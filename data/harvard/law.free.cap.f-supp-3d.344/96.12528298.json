Years later, Congress amended the immigration laws to provide for expedited removal of those seeking admission to the United States. Under the expedited removal process, an alien could be summarily removed after a preliminary inspection by an immigration officer, so long as the alien did not have a credible fear of persecution by his or her country of origin. In creating this framework, Congress struck a balance between an efficient immigration system and ensuring that \"there should be no danger that an alien with a genuine asylum claim will be returned to persecution.\" H.R.

Upon consideration of the parties' memoranda, the parties' arguments at the motions hearings, the arguments of\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the administrative record, the applicable law, and for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that several of the new credible fear policies, as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   and the Policy Memorandum, violate both the APA and INA. As explained in this Memorandum Opinion, many of these policies are inconsistent with the intent of Congress as articulated in the INA. And because it is the will of Congress-not the whims of the Executive-that determines the standard for expedited removal, the Court finds that those policies are unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Part I of this Opinion sets forth background information necessary to resolve plaintiffs' claims. In Part II, the Court considers plaintiffs' motion to consider evidence outside the administrative record and denies the motion in part. In Part III, the Court considers the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. In Part III.A, the Court considers the government's arguments that this case is not justiciable and holds that this Court has jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs' challenges to the credible fear policies. In Part III.B, the Court addresses the legal standards that govern plaintiffs' claims. In Part III.C, the Court turns to the merits of plaintiffs' claims and holds that, with the exception of two policies, the new credible fear policies are arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the immigration laws. In Part III.D, the Court considers the appropriate form of relief and vacates the unlawful credible fear policies. The Court further permanently enjoins the government from continuing to apply those policies and from removing plaintiffs who are currently in the United States without first providing credible fear determinations consistent with the immigration laws. Finally, the Court orders the government to return to the United States the plaintiffs who were unlawfully deported and to provide them with new credible fear determinations consistent with the immigration laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Policy Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The government also argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Policy Memorandum under section 1252(e) for three reasons. First, according to the government, the Policy Memorandum \"primarily\n   addresses the asylum standard\" and therefore does not implement section 1225(b) as required by the statute. Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 85 at 30. Second, since the Policy Memorandum \"merely explains\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   , the government argues, it is not reviewable for the same reasons\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   is not reviewable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11336332\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/214/#p225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the government argues that sections 1225 and 1252(e)(3)\"indicate\" that Congress only provided judicial review of agency guidelines, directives, or procedures which create substantive rights as opposed to interpretive documents, like the Policy Memorandum, which merely explain the law to government officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court need not spend much time on the government's first two arguments. First, the Policy Memorandum, entitled \"Guidance for Processing Reasonable Fear, Credible Fear, Asylum, and Refugee Claims in Accordance with\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   \" expressly applies to credible fear interviews and provides guidance to credible fear adjudicators. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 4 n.1 (\"[T]he Attorney General's decision and this [Policy Memorandum] apply also to ... credible fear determinations.\"). Furthermore, it expressly invokes section 1225 as the authority for its issuance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The government's second argument that the Policy Memorandum is not reviewable for the same reasons\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   is not, is easily dismissed because the Court has already found that\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   falls within section 1252(e)(3)'s jurisdictional grant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 114-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The government's third argument is that section 1252(e)(3) only applies when an agency promulgates legislative rules and not interpretive rules. Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 85 at 30-33. Although not entirely clear, the argument is as follows: (1) the INA provides DHS with significant authority to create legislative rules; (2) Congress barred judicial review of such substantive rules in section 1252(a) ; (3) therefore Congress must have created a mechanism to review these types of legislative rules, and only legislative rules, in section 1252(e)(3) ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. Folded into this reasoning is also a free-standing argument that because the Policy Memorandum is not a final agency action, it is not reviewable under the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Contrary to the government's assertions, section 1252(e)(3) does not limit its grant of jurisdiction over a \"written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure\" to only legislative rules or final agency action. Nowhere in the statute did Congress exclude interpretive rules.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A) (stating subsection of statute does not apply to \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\").

First, upon review of the cited cases it is apparent that, although the word \"condone\" was used, in actuality, the courts were applying the \"unwilling or unable\" standard.

However, relying on the BIA findings, the Court found that notwithstanding the fact \"police might take some action against telephone threats\" the applicant would still face persecution if she was sent back to her country of origin because she could have been killed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11514765\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/955/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Court ultimately concluded that an applicant can still meet the persecution threshold when the police are unable to provide effective help, but fall short of condoning the persecution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11514765\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/955/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11514765\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/955/\">\n    at 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the language it used to describe the standard, the court did not apply the heightened \"condoned or complete helplessness\" persecution standard pronounced in the credible fear policies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Second, and more importantly, under the government's formulation of the persecution standard, no asylum applicant who received assistance from the government, regardless of how ineffective that assistance was, could meet the persecution requirement when the persecutor is a non-government actor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 17 (stating that in the context of credible fear interviews, \"[a]gain, the home government must either condone the behavior or demonstrate a complete helplessness to protect victims of such alleged persecution\").

Here, plaintiffs do not challenge\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    '\n   </em>\n   s statements with regard to the rule against circularity, but rather challenge the Policy Memorandum's articulation of the rule.

Specifically, they challenge the Policy Memorandum's mandate that domestic violence-based social groups that include \"inability to leave\" are not cognizable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Policy Memorandum states that \"married women ... who are unable to leave their relationship\" are a group that would not be sufficiently particular. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 6. The Policy Memorandum explained that \"even if 'unable to leave' were particular, the applicant must show something more than the danger of harm from an abuser if the applicant tried to leave because that would amount to circularly defining the particular social group by the harm on which the asylum claim is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Policy Memorandum's interpretation of the rule against circularity ensures that women unable to leave their relationship will always be circular.

First, as\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   made clear, there cannot be a general rule when it comes to determining whether a group is distinct because \"it is possible that under certain circumstances, the society would make such a distinction and consider the shared past experience to be a basis for distinction within that society.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20227\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

The government, however, argues that no such directives exist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Court agrees with the government. There is nothing in the credible fear policies that support plaintiffs' arguments that asylum officers are to exercise discretion at the credible fear stage. The Policy Memorandum discusses discretion only in the context of when an alien has established that he or she is eligible for asylum. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 5 (\"[I]f eligibility is established, the USCIS officer must then consider whether or not to exercise discretion to grant the application.\").\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   also discusses the discretionary factors in the context of granting asylum. 27 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 345 n.12 (stating exercising discretion should not be glossed over \"solely because an applicant\n   <em>\n    otherwise meets the burden of proof\n   </em>\n   for asylum eligibility under the INA\")(emphasis added). Eligibility for asylum is not established, nor is an asylum application granted, at the credible fear stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(ii) (stating if an alien receives a positive credibility determination, he or she shall be detained for \"further consideration of the application of asylum\"). Since the credible fear policies only direct officers to use discretion once an officer has determined that an applicant is eligible for asylum, they do not direct officers to consider discretionary factors at the credible fear stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Court also agrees that, with respect to\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   , the decision does not impose a delineation requirement during a credible fear determination. The decision only requires an applicant seeking asylum to clearly indicate \"an exact delineation of any proposed particular social group\" when the alien is \"on the record and before the immigration judge.\" 27 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 344. Any delineation requirement therefore would not apply to the credible fear determination which is not on the record before an immigration judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The Policy Memorandum, however, goes further than the decision itself and incorporates the delineation requirement into credible fear determinations. Unlike the mandate to use discretion, the Policy Memorandum does not contain a limitation that officers are to apply the delineation requirement to asylum interviews only, as opposed to credible fear interviews. In fact, it does the opposite and explicitly\n   requires asylum officers to apply that requirement to credible fear determinations. Policy Memorandum, ECF No. 100 at 12. The Policy Memorandum makes clear that \"if an applicant claims asylum based on membership in a particular social group, then officers must factor the [standards explained in\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    into their determination of whether an applicant has a credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. In directing asylum officers to apply\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   to credible fear determinations, the Policy Memorandum refers back to all the requirements explained by\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   including the delineation requirement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (referring back to section explaining delineation requirement). In light of this clear directive to \"factor\" in the standards set forth in\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   , into the \"determination of whether an applicant has a credible fear\" and its reference to the delineation requirement, it is clear that the Policy Memorandum incorporates that requirement into credible fear determinations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The government argues, that to the extent the Policy Memorandum is ambiguous, the Court should defer to its interpretation as long as it is reasonable. The government cites no authority to support its claim that deference is owed to an agency's interpretations of its policy documents like the Policy Memorandum. However, the Court acknowledges the government's interpretation is \"entitled to respect ... only to the extent that those interpretations have the 'power to persuade.' \"\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

For the reasons stated above, however, such a narrow reading of the Policy Memorandum is not persuasive.

First, a directive to ignore circuit precedent when doing so would violate the principles of\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   itself is clearly unlawful. For example, when a court determines a provision is unambiguous, as courts have done upon evaluating the \"unwilling and unable\" definition, a court's interpretation controls when faced with a contrary agency interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/\">\n    545 U.S. at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Policy\n   Memorandum directs officers as a rule not to apply circuit law if it is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   , without regard to whether a specific provision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   is entitled to deference in the first place. Such a rule runs contrary to\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Second, the government's argument only squares with the\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   framework if every aspect of\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-B-\n   </em>\n   is both entitled to deference and is a reasonable interpretation of a relevant provision of the INA. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   does not disturb any prior judicial opinion that a statute is unambiguous because Congress has spoken to the interpretive question at issue.\n   <em>\n    Brand X\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/\">\n    545 U.S. at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8210237\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/967/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency's interpretation, and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill, displaces a conflicting agency construction.\").

Defs.' Reply, ECF No. 85 at 75 (emphasis in original). The more natural reading of the provision, however, is that these forms of relief are prohibited except when a plaintiff brings \"any action ... specifically authorized in a subsequent paragraph.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(e)(1)(a).

Mot., ECF No. 57-1 at 28 (stating an \"asylum officer reviewed each of [plaintiffs] credible fear claims and found them wanting in light of Matter of A-B-\").

No relief short of enjoining the unlawful credible fear policies in this case could provide an adequate remedy. Plaintiffs do not seek monetary compensation. The harm they suffer will continue unless and until they receive a credible fear determination pursuant to the existing immigration laws. Moreover, without an injunction, the plaintiffs previously removed will continue to live in fear every day, and the remaining plaintiffs are at risk of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The last two factors are also straightforward.
