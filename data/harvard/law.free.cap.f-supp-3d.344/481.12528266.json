WOODS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 9, 2015, Officer James Frascatore was sent to the Grant Hyatt Hotel in New York City, tasked to take the potentially dangerous ringleader of a criminal conspiracy into custody. He was provided the criminal's photograph. The picture \"portrayed a man bearing a striking resemblance to the way Defendant Blake appeared that day.\" They were both African-American. When he saw a man matching the description and picture of the ringleader, Frascatore tackled and detained the man. But Frascatore and fellow officers quickly determined that the man he had taken down was not a criminal, but, rather, a prominent former professional tennis player in town for the U.S. Open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the days and weeks that followed, the media lambasted Frascatore. He found his face plastered on the front page of the New York\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   , depicted as a \"psycho cop\" with a \"shocking\" disciplinary record. In their stories, the media relied on information contained in files that Frascatore alleges the CCRB and its Executive Director, Tracy Catapano-Fox, had released in 2014, prior to the incident. Rather than standing behind him, the NYPD criticized and scapegoated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Years later, in 2017, Blake published a book called\n   <em>\n    Ways of Grace\n   </em>\n   in which Blake tells the story of his encounter with Frascatore (the \"Incident\"). In the book, and in media appearances in connection with the book's release, Frascatore asserts that Blake defamed him by mischaracterizing the incident and by implying that he was a racist. Frascatore asserts that the CCRB and the NYPD damaged his reputation and made his dreams of returning to being a teacher after his retirement from the NYPD impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, Frascatore asserts procedural due process \"stigma-plus\" claims against the NYPD, the City of New York, the CCRB, and Catapano-Fox. Frascatore also asserts that Catapano-Fox, the CCRB, and the NYPD intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his race, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Frascatore brings a claim against Blake for defamation. Frascatore's stigma-plus claims both fail because he did not allege that any statements made by the NYPD, the City of New York, the CCRB, and Catapano-Fox were false, or that any statements were made close enough in time to any adverse employment actions. The stigma-plus claim against the CCRB and Catapano-Fox fails for the additional reason that Frascatore did not allege the utterance of any statements at all by those defendants. Frascatore's stigma-plus claims against the City of New York and the NYPD fail for the additional reason that the statement he attributes to them is not sufficiently derogatory to state a claim. Frascatore's race discrimination claims fails because he did not plead sufficient facts to establish an inference of discriminatory intent. Frascatore's defamation claims fail because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , he does not allege that many of the statements are false, and several of the challenged statements are non-actionable statements of opinion. Accordingly, the motions to dismiss\n   of Blake and the City Defendants are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Shortly before Statement Seven, Blake describes the incident, and also describes Frascatore's history of excessive force complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marino Decl. at 12, 17-18. To the extent that Statement Seven is read to imply that Frascatore has a \"discriminatory pattern of behavior,\" Blake discloses the basis for that opinion-that Frascatore has at least three excessive force complaints, as reported in the article that Blake cites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. As a result, Frascatore's defamation claim as to this statement is dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medcalf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3908778\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/938/478/#p486\">\n    938 F.Supp.2d at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As referenced above, Frascatore failed to plead sufficient facts demonstrating falsity regarding Statement Eight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tannerite Sports, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275688\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/236/#p247\">\n    864 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the challenged statement, Blake describes how \"[the officers'] version of the events was very different from mine.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 43. Frascatore contends that Blake's \"statements are belied by the paperwork filed by the officers, including the voided arrest form and email sent to supervisors on the day of the incident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275688\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/236/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Blake's contention in Statement Eight is that his version of events was different than the officers' version of events. As a result, rather than demonstrating the falsity of Blake's statement, Frascatore's allegations confirm Blake's statement-that Blake's version of events and the officers' version of events are inconsistent. As such, Frascatore has failed to plead facts demonstrating how this statement was false, and his defamation claim as to this statement must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, as referenced above, Frascatore failed to plead that Blake made Statement Nine in a grossly irresponsible manner. The allegation that Blake recounted events differently than Frascatore\n   recalls them does not, without more, constitute grossly irresponsible conduct. Although Frascatore asserts that Statement Nine is in \"direct contradiction of the video evidence,\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 42, he later recounts that the video only shows Frascatore \"extend[ing] his hand to Blake\" and \"pat[ting] Blake on the shoulder,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Though these gestures may appear conciliatory, they do not necessarily constitute an \"apology.\" Finally, Blake did not source this information \"without due consideration for the standards of information gathering,\"\n   <em>\n    Enigma Software Grp. USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175659\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/263/#p287\">\n    194 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   287 ; instead, he was recounting his own subjective recollection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court's conclusion that Frascatore has failed to plead that Blake made Statement Nine with the requisite degree of fault is not inconsistent with the Court's obligation to take as true the facts pleaded in the complaint. Frascatore alleged that he apologized to Blake after the Incident,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175659\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/194/263/#p287\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 and Blake wrote that Frascatore did not apologize,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. These versions of events are directly at odds, and the Court is required to credit Frascatore's version at the motion to dismiss stage. However, the relevant inquiry is whether Frascatore pleaded that Blake made the statement in question in a grossly irresponsible manner, which Frascatore failed to do. As a result, the defamation claim as to Statement Nine must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
