According to this memorandum, CMS changed \u00a7 1102.3L's language \"[a]s a result of [a] Ninth Circuit decision,\" which had \"found [\u00a7] 1102.3L to be inconsistent with the Secretary's must[-]bill policy.\" AR 1607-08 (citing\n    <em>\n     Cmty.

At issue in this case are the plaintiffs' claims for Medicare reimbursement of unpaid deductible and coinsurance amounts associated with dual eligible patients, incurred between the fiscal years ending in October 1995 and December 2004.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 2-3.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    During these fiscal years, the plaintiffs \"billed [Medi-Cal] for some of the dual eligible patients but due to various factors related to the billing process they decided[ ] ... to stop billing, alleging that it was not cost effective\" for them to bill Medi-Cal. AR 12 n.13. Among the problems they encountered were that \"Medi-Cal [ ] failed to issue remittance advices in some instances and also[,] ... as a result of [Medi-Cal's] payment ceiling, the Medi-Cal payments were often zero or only a dollar or two.\" AR 12. According to the plaintiffs, beginning \"in 1992 and [ ] continu[ing] ... in 1995,\" they \"gathered alternative documentation and submitted bad debt lists for billed and unbilled cross[ ]over claims ... for audit verification.\" Pls.' Objs. at 19. Additionally, \"the [plaintiffs] contracted in 2007[ ] ... with\" EDS Corporation (\"EDS\"), which they claim is \"the same contractor used by ...

AR 12-13;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    AR 34 (explaining that the plaintiffs retained EDS \"in order to ... generate certain reports 'for the purposes of identifying outpatient and inpatient bad debt payable by the Medicare program' \").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The plaintiffs' intermediary ultimately \"disallowed the ... amounts\" claimed by the plaintiffs because \"there were no State Medicaid remittance advices,\" AR 12,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , a \"receipt\" for payment or non-payment, Motions Hrg.

Accordingly, the[ir] failure to produce Medicaid remittance advices represent[ed] a failure on the part of the [p]roviders to meet the necessary criteria for Medicare payment of bad debts related to these claims and the [intermediary] was correct to deny the crossover bad debt claims for the cost years at issue.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    AR 13. Additionally, regarding the \"require[ment] to bill for and produce [ ] remittance advices,\" AR 13, referred to collectively by the Administrator as the Secretary's \"must-bill policy,\" the Administrator found:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    [T]he [B]ad [D]ebt [M]oratorium d[id] not prohibit the disallowances in this case ...

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    As already explained, the Administrator denied the plaintiffs' claims for Medicare reimbursement of unpaid deductibles and coinsurance pursuant to the Secretary's \"must-bill policy,\" AR 15, which requires providers seeking Medicare reimbursement for bad debts associated with dual eligibles to (1) bill the state Medicaid program (the \"billing requirement\") and (2) obtain and submit to the intermediary a remittance advice from the state Medicaid program (the \"remittance advice requirement\"),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    AR 13 (explaining that the must-bill policy \"require[s] [providers] to bill for and produce remittance advices as a condition of including crossover bad debt claims on [their] cost report[s]\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Administrator denied the plaintiffs' claims for failing to satisfy the remittance advice requirement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 13 (\"[T]he [plaintiffs'] failure to produce the Medicaid remittance advices represent[ed] a failure ... to meet the necessary criteria for Medicare payment of bad debts[,] ... [and] the [intermediary] was correct to deny the [plaintiffs'] crossover bad debt claims[.]\"). In opposition to this conclusion, the plaintiffs argue that (1) \"[t]he Secretary's purported must-bill policy ... was not in place prior to August 1, 1987, and therefore violates the Moratorium,\" Pls.' Objs. at 3, or, alternatively, even if the must-bill policy is lawful: (2) \"the Secretary should be ordered to accept the alternative documentation the [p]laintiffs submitted\" under \"PRM [\u00a7] 1102.3L, which clearly provided that providers could submit proper alternative documentation in lieu of billing the State[ ] ... and which was applicable to the [p]laintiffs' cost years at issue,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 17; and (3) the plaintiffs' \"EDS [reports] were the equivalent of remittance advices from the State, and[, therefore,] rejecting them was improper,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 24. For the reasons explained below, because the Court concludes that the Administrator erred by finding that a remittance advice requirement existed prior to August 1, 1987, and thus, did not violate the Moratorium, the Court must remand this case to the Secretary for further proceedings without addressing the plaintiffs' remaining arguments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Alleged Violation of the Bad Debt Moratorium\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Administrator concluded that the Secretary's must-bill policy did not violate the Bad Debt Moratorium based on his finding that the \"policy [ ] ha[d] been in effect since before August 1, 1987, as is evidenced in numerous Administrator and Board decisions, ... the longstanding PRM sections 310 and 312 and 322, ... [and] the longstanding regulations and statute.\" AR 16. The Magistrate Judge agreed with the Administrator's conclusion, specifically \"find[ing] that the must-bill policy was established through the three cited portions of the PRM, was further identified in the [1985 Intermediary Manual], and was consistently applied in several administrative decisions.\" R &amp; R at 18. The plaintiffs object to the Magistrate Judge's finding that a must-bill policy existed prior to the Moratorium on numerous grounds. Specifically, they argue that the Magistrate Judge (1) \"applied the wrong\n    standard and misconstrued [the p]laintiffs' [action] as one challenging whether the must[-]bill policy is reasonable,\" Pls.' Objs. at 3; (2) \"erred by finding [that] the PRM provisions established the must[-]bill policy because those provisions do not by their plain terms establish the must[-]bill policy, nor is there substantial evidence to support the position that the Secretary interpreted them as establishing such a policy before the Moratorium,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 12; (3) \"misapplied administrative decisions, correctly noting that they are incapable of setting policy but incorrectly construing them as evidence of the existence of the must[-]bill policy,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 15; (4) \"improperly considered a 1985 ... Intermediary Manual [ ] provision ... that [ ] is not part of the [a]dministrative [r]ecord in this case,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13; and (5) erred by \"not giv[ing] any weight to the unchallenged testimony at the [Board hearing] that senior officials at CMS were emphatic that no must[-]bill policy existed prior to the Moratorium,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    As an initial matter, the Court notes that so far as it is aware, the issue of whether the Secretary's must-bill policy violates the Moratorium has not been decided by any other court. Although a number of courts, including this Circuit, have addressed whether the Secretary's must-bill policy is owed judicial deference,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Grossmont Hosp.

Thus, despite the Secretary's insistence that the Administrator's decision \"must be affirmed because it is settled law, in this [C]ircuit and others, that the must-bill policy is valid,\" Def.'s Summ. J.

Next, because the Administrator relied only on the remittance advice requirement of the must-bill policy as the basis for rejecting the plaintiffs' claims,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    AR 12, the Court's Moratorium analysis addresses the remittance advice requirement first.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     1.

However, once again, this provision on its face does not require that a provider must receive a remittance advice from the state in order to receive Medicare reimbursement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(r)(1) (providing that \"a State must[ ] ... have in operation mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems\" that,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"provide for electronic transmission of claims data[,] ... including[ ] ... data elements from the automated data system\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Finally, the Administrator cited JSM-370 as support for his position that the must-bill policy, including the remittance advice requirement, existed prior to August 1, 1987,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    AR 8 (\"[ ]JSM-370[ ] restated Medicare's longstanding bad debt policy[.]\"), as well as \"letters from three [fiscal i]ntermediaries setting forth the must-bill policy,\" AR 14 n.16.

Moreover, the two pre-1987 Board decisions cited do not demonstrate that the Secretary interpreted those authorities to require a remittance advice. Finally, the administrative decisions issued after the Moratorium and alleged statements by CMS officials or intermediaries made after the Moratorium do not constitute the Secretary's pre-1987 policy and \"do not illustrate how [the policy] was actually applied prior to 1987.\"\n    <em>\n     Mountain States Health All.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759043\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/128/195/#p199\">\n     128 F.Supp.3d at 218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that the Administrator's finding that a remittance advice requirement existed prior to the Moratorium is not supported by substantial evidence.

In\n    <em>\n     Grossmont Hospital\n    </em>\n    , after concluding that the state determination requirement of the Secretary's must-bill policy was \"sensible\" and upholding the Secretary's denial of a provider's claims based on a failure to meet that requirement, the Circuit went on to \"conclude that an independent basis for affirming the Secretary's disallowance of [the provider]'s claims [wa]s the failure of [the provider] to timely bill Medi-Cal for those claims.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073213,3553685\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1239/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Specifically, the Circuit found that \"[a]lthough the Secretary relied only on the state determination requirement for her disposition, she stated that the record [ ] supports a conclusion that these claims were not in the States's system, that is, they were not billed.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073213,3553685\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1239/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Here, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Grossmont Hospital\n    </em>\n    , the Court concludes that \"there is ... uncertainty as to the outcome of [this] proceeding on remand.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073213,3553685\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1239/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Manin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073213,3553685\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/1239/\">\n     627 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1243 ). Although the Administrator in this case concluded that \"the [plaintiffs] were required to bill ... as a condition of including crossover bad debt claims on [their] cost report[s],\" AR 13, he did not make any factual finding \"that the record [ ] supports a conclusion that the[ ] claims [at issue] ... were not billed,\"\n    <em>\n     Grossmont Hosp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772016,4330857\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1079/\">\n     797 F.3d at 1086\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Although it may be certain that the Administrator would again deny any claims that he found had not been billed on the ground that the plaintiffs would not qualify for an exception to the billing requirement under the terms set forth in \u00a7 1102.3L,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    AR 15-16,\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    the Court cannot be certain as to the outcome of any of the claims that the Administrator may find\n    <em>\n     were\n    </em>\n    billed. As to these claims, whether the plaintiffs qualify for relief under \u00a7 1102.3L or whether their documentation ultimately satisfies the requirements of that provision would not be dispositive because \u00a7 1102.3L merely creates an exception to billing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 1248 (addressing the documentation a provider must provide \"in lieu of billing\"). Moreover, the only other basis the Administrator provided for rejecting the plaintiffs' claims was that the alternative documentation the plaintiffs provided was not the equivalent of a remittance advice or any other official state documentation,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    AR 18 (refusing to accept the plaintiffs' EDS reports because they \"are not contemporaneously generated State documents\" and \"were not validated, certified or adopted as State documents and do not qualify as State remittance advices\"), and because this basis for rejection of the plaintiffs' documentation necessarily relied on the remittance advice requirement that the Court has already rejected, absent further development of the record, the Administrator may not again apply this requirement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that the fate of any claims the Administrator finds were billed would be certain on remand.

Accordingly, the Administrator erred when he concluded that the remittance advice requirement did not violate the Moratorium. Therefore, the Court cannot affirm the Secretary's denial of the plaintiffs' claims on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to provide remittance advices to support their claims. Moreover, because the Administrator did not find that the plaintiffs failed to bill the state for all of the claims at issue, the Court cannot affirm the Administrator's decision denying all of the plaintiffs' claims on the alternative ground that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy any billing requirement. Accordingly, the Court declines to adopt, except as otherwise indicated, the Magistrate\n    Judge's recommendation, grants in part and denies in part the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, denies the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment, and remands this case to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n    this 29th day of September, 2018.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-138\">\n     In 1989, Congress amended the Medicare Act a third time.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.
