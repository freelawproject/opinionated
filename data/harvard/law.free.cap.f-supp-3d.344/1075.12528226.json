Bade, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants Ugly Pools Arizona, Inc., and Brian Morris (\"Defendants\") have filed a third motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 86.) The motion seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for false copyright marking under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), asserted in Count Three of the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). The motion is fully briefed. (Docs. 86, 87, 92, 93, 94.) For the reasons below the Court grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In Count Three of the FAC, Plaintiff SellPoolSuppliesOnline.com (\"Plaintiff\" or \"SPSO\") alleged that Defendants violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"DMCA\"). (Doc. 39 at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 48-50.) Plaintiff alleged falsification and removal claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1202(a) and (b). The parties previously filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims in the FAC, including its claims under the DMCA. (Docs. 43, 45.) On June 9, 2017, the Court denied both motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff's falsification claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and granted Defendants' motion\n   for summary judgment on Plaintiff's removal claim under \u00a7 1202(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 64 at 35-41.) The Court denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff's \u00a7 1202(a) falsification claim because it found that there were disputed issues of fact on an element of that claim, specifically Defendants' intent in placing their copyright notice on their website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As set forth below in Section I.B, and in the Court's June 2017 Order, Plaintiff has asserted various descriptions of its copyrighted material over the course of the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) In its June 2017 Order, the Court concluded that for purposes of Plaintiff's infringement claim, Plaintiff's claims related to copyrighted material referred to copyrighted photographs on its website www.poolandspapartsnow.com. (Doc. 64 at 12.) Based on this limited description of Plaintiff's claimed copyrighted material, Defendants requested leave to file a third motion for summary judgment directed at Plaintiff's \u00a7 1202(a) falsification claim. (Doc. 75.) Defendants argued that the limitation on Plaintiff's claim of copyrighted material from Plaintiff's \"website as a whole\" to \"photographs\" on Plaintiff's website was significant. Defendants argued that they \"did not change Plaintiff's copyright notice on any of its photos\" and, therefore, could not be liable under \u00a7 1202(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) The Court granted Defendants' motion for leave to file a third summary judgment motion on Plaintiff's \u00a7 1202(a) falsification claim. (Doc. 83.) This order addresses only that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the FAC and other filings in this matter, Plaintiff described its business as licensing pre-made websites that it refers to as \"the Platform.\" (Doc. 78-1 \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiff has admitted that \"much of the website code\" is licensed from BigCommerce, a non-party entity that provides \"backend electronic storefront\" services. (Doc. 53, Ex. Q.) After Plaintiff commenced this matter, it sought to register a copyright in various aspects of the Platform. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 64 at 5-7 (discussing the copyright registration process).) Plaintiff initially claimed a copyright in portions of computer code, code to provide for the 360-degree rotation of images, all images containing the letters CVP in the image, product descriptions, and the arrangement of text and images. (Docs. 87 at 1 \u00b6 1; Doc. 96 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff later limited its copyright claim. (Doc. 87 \u00b6 2; Doc. 93 \u00b6 2.) On November 29, 2016, the copyright office issued Plaintiff a certificate of registration. (Doc. 50, Ex. 1; Doc. 80 \u00b6 44.) The certificate of registration was for \"text, photographs.\" (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 4; Doc. 93 at \u00b6 4.) After the copyright office issued the certificate of registration, Plaintiff's filings before this Court referred to Plaintiff's copyrighted material as \"the collection of photos at issue in this case.\" (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 5; Doc. 93 at \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in July 2014, SPSO employed Mark Kesler as a salesperson to sell licenses to use the Platform. (Doc. 78-1 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.) During 2014, Kesler introduced Defendant Brian Morris, owner of Defendant\n   Ugly Pools Arizona, Inc., to Plaintiff as a potential licensee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Defendants represented themselves to Plaintiff as prospective customers who were considering purchasing a license of SPSO's Platform to create a website for their business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff provided Defendants access to Kesler's copy of the Platform to assist them in making a purchasing decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) Plaintiff alleges that \"Defendants were aware that they would have to purchase a license to be authorized to have further access to the Platform-that is, to use it commercially-and that the SPSO license governed the nature of their use of the Platform.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Defendants and Kesler were working together and had formed a partnership for Morris to manage and redesign Kesler's site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, Ex. 2 at 37.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants downloaded \"a complete copy of SPSO's Platform.\" (Doc. 78-1 \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff alleges that nearly a year later, Defendants published a website located at allpoolsupplies.com (\"APS\"), which was nearly identical to the Platform. (Doc. 78-1 \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff asserts that Defendants admitted to copying the Platform and creating APS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' site \"wholly incorporated the original photos which are registered with the U.S. Copyright Office under Registration Number TX 8-268-803 ('Registered Photos') and other content from the Platform into APS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants provided false copyright management information on the website with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement. (Doc. 39 at \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its statement of facts in opposition to Defendants' third motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendants' copyright notice is located only at the bottom of Defendants' website and is not placed next to any of Plaintiff's photographs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 7 (citing Doc. 39-6 at 7 (Ex. F to the FAC) ); Doc. 93 at \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff agrees that Defendants did not add their copyright notice to Plaintiff's photographs. (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 93 at \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff has admitted that Defendants did not remove or change Plaintiff's copyright marking from any of Plaintiff's photographs. (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 9 (citing Doc. 87, Ex. 1 at 54 line 5 to p. 55 line 8); Doc. 93 at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants assert that their contributions to the APS website include (1) Defendants' brand design logo on the top of the webpage, and (2) Defendants' blog entries on the bottom of the webpage. (Doc. 87 at \u00b6 10 (citing Doc. 39-6 at 7, Ex. F to the FAC).) Plaintiff disputes this assertion because Exhibit F to the FAC does not depict blog entries. (Doc. 93 at \u00b6 10.) Although Exhibit F does not include specific blog entries, it depicts a navigational link to a blog. (Doc. 39-6 at 2, 7.) Defendants' copyright notice appears in a shaded block at the bottom of the webpage that includes a link to the blog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Additionally, Plaintiff has provided evidence of a blog entry. (Doc. 93-1 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's Falsification Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a falsification claim under \u00a7 1202(a), which requires Plaintiff to establish that Defendants \"knowingly and with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement-(1) provide[d] copyright management information that is false, or (2) distribute[d] or import[ed] for distribution copyright management information that is false.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Plaintiff asserts that Defendants' website \"wholly incorporated the original photos and content from the Platform into APS and then attached a [We Fix Ugly Pools] WFUP copyright notice.\" (Doc. 44 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff's claim is based on the inclusion of \"Copyright 2015 We Fix Ugly Pools. All Rights Reserved\" on the APS website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 39-6 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that they placed the copyright notice \"Copyright 2015 We Fix Ugly Pools. All Rights Reserved\" on their website, but argue that doing so did not violate \u00a7 1202(a). (Doc. 86 at 5-8.) Defendants argue that they cannot be liable under \u00a7 1202(a), and the Court should enter summary judgment in their favor on this claim, because (1) the \"generic footer\" placed at the bottom of the APS website was not CMI because it was not \"conveyed in connection with\" Plaintiff's copyrighted photographs (Doc. 86 at 5), and (2) if their copyright notice was CMI, it was not false because Defendants properly placed the copyright notice on the APS website to identify Defendants' contributions to the webpage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Therefore, to resolve Defendants' third motion for summary judgment, the Court must determine whether Defendants added information to the APS website that fits within the definition of CMI.

(Doc. 86 at 4-5.) Defendants contend that the placement of a \"generic footer\" at the bottom of the website was not \"information conveyed in connection with\" Plaintiff's photographs because it was \"not near or next to any of Plaintiff's photographs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

However, Plaintiff does not directly address whether the WFUP copyright notice, as placed on the APS website, constituted false CMI, as defined in \u00a7 1202(c), and in violation of \u00a7 1202(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, Plaintiff's response focuses on whether Defendants can claim derivative ownership of the work and, thus, whether any CMI was false. (Doc. 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Personal Keepsakes\n   </em>\n   and other cases support Defendants' arguments. Several courts have interpreted the definition of CMI in \u00a7 1202(c).

Therefore, Plaintiff's falsification claim is not necessarily limited to its copyright registration for \"text, photos.\" Plaintiff suggests that the work at issue is the \"Platform.\" (Doc. 78-1 \u00b6 1; Doc. 92 at 15.) Plaintiff refers to its Platform and to the \"code enabling rotating the Photos 360-degrees\" (Doc. 92 at 10, 15), but has not offered any evidence to support any claim that it has a copyright in any particular website code. Additionally, Plaintiff has admitted that \"much of the website code\" is licensed from BigCommerce, a non-party entity that provides \"backend electronic storefront\" services. (Doc. 53, Ex. Q.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   During the copyright registration process Plaintiff limited its copyright claim to \"text and photographs\" and advised the copyright office that it was no longer interested in registering the computer code.

Further, in briefing on its earlier-filed cross-motion for summary judgment and in response to Defendants' third motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff stated that its work is comprised of \"over six hundred\" and up to \"thousands of Photos capable of supporting a 360-degree view.\" (Doc. 43 at 5, 10; Doc. 92 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's response to Defendants' third motion for summary judgment also indicates that it does not claim a copyright in the code that enables the 360-degree rotation of the photographs, but rather claims a copyright in each photograph that was taken to create a 360-degree view. (Doc. 92 at 10 (stating that \"[t]he fact that the code enabling rotating the Photos 360-degrees was not registered does not imply that the Photos were not painstakingly taken with the intention of displaying 360 degrees.... These Photos are all part of the Work.\").) The Court, thus, concludes that the work at issue for purposes of Plaintiff's \u00a7 1202(a) claim is Plaintiff's photographs that appear on its website www.poolandspapartsnow.com.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 64 at 11-12; Doc. 83 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants have established that the WFUP copyright notice to which Plaintiff objects did not constitute actionable CMI as defined in \u00a7 1202(c). Therefore, Plaintiff's claim that Defendants violated \u00a7 1202(a) necessarily fails and the Court need not consider whether Defendants knew its copyright notice was false CMI or whether Defendants intended to provide false CMI to enable or conceal copyright infringement. Accordingly, the Court does not reach Defendants' alternative argument that, if the copyright notice was CMI, it was not false, or Plaintiff's arguments in opposition. (Doc. 86 at 6-8; Doc. 92.) The Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   the Defendants' third motion for summary judgment (Doc. 86) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and that the Clerk of Court shall enter judgment for Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Court also denied without prejudice both parties' motions for summary judgment on Plaintiff's copyright infringement claim in Count One, granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's unfair competition claim in Count Two, and denied Defendants' motion for an order directing Plaintiff to cancel or amend its copyright registration. (Doc. 64.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    To provide context for this Order, the Court cites several filings in this case. Because the parties have filed multiple motions for summary judgment, to avoid confusion, the Court refers to filings by the Court's CM/ECF docket and page numbers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In its response to the motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts that \"Defendants placed their copyright notice next to hundreds if not thousands, of Plaintiff's [p]hotos....\" (Doc. 92 at 13.) However, Plaintiff does not cite any evidence in the record to support this statement, which is contrary to its statement of facts. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 87 at \u00b6 7 (citing Doc. 39-6 at 7); Doc. 93 at \u00b6 7.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    This definition of CMI applies to claims under \u00a7\u00a7 1202(a) and (b).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).

(Doc. 86 at 5.) The Court does not consider this issue because it already granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff's removal claim under \u00a7 1202(b).
