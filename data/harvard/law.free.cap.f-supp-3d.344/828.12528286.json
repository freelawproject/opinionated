MESSITTE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a previous Opinion, the Court held that the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland have standing to challenge, in his official capacity, President Donald J. Trump based on his alleged violations of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court found that Plaintiffs had standing based on proprietary, quasi-sovereign, and\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interests vis-a-vis the President's undisputed ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel in Washington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a second Opinion, the Court considered the meaning of the term \"emolument\" as used in the Clauses. The Foreign Clause bans any person holding an office of profit or trust under the United States, (including, the Court found, the President) from accepting without Congressional approval \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 8. The Domestic Clause provides that \"[t]he President shall... receive for his services, a compensation...and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 7. Based on those constitutional texts, as well as the virtually universal definition given the term \"emolument\" in dictionaries and literature contemporaneous to the enactment of the Clauses, the purpose of the Clauses, and ample historical evidence and executive branch precedent and practice, the Court determined that the word \"emolument\" refers to any \"profit,\" \"gain\" or \"advantage\" of a more than\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the President's ownership interest in the Trump International Hotel and his apparent receipt of benefits from at least some foreign and state governments, as well as from the Federal Government itself, suggest that he has received \"emoluments\" in violation of the Constitution, giving rise to plausible causes of action against him brought by parties with standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The President has filed a Motion for Leave to Appeal (Interlocutory) and for a Stay Pending Appeal the Court's rulings, ECF No. 127, which Plaintiffs oppose. As part of the relief he requests, the President asks the Court to stay any and all discovery pending his appeal, again over Plaintiffs' objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court has reviewed the President's Motion and, for the reasons that follow, will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   it. His Motion for a Stay pending any appeal will also be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Most centrally, even were the Court of Appeals to accept the President's cramped interpretation of the meaning of \"emoluments,\" i.e. that they are only prohibited if given for actions taken by the President as President-there is clear evidence that some foreign governments have explicitly stated that they are patronizing the Trump International Hotel precisely because the President, in effect, owns it. Accordingly, say Plaintiffs, discovery would proceed in the case even if the term \"emoluments\" is more narrowly defined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Court's interpretation of the term \"Emolument\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First and foremost, the President believes that the correct interpretation of the term \"emolument\" in the Emoluments Clauses and the scope of those Clauses is a controlling question of law because, if decided in his favor, this suit would be terminated or, at the very least, substantially narrowed in scope. Plaintiffs not only believe the Court's interpretation of the meaning of the term \"emolument\" is, by any analysis, correct; they argue that the issue is not even a controlling question of law. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The President insists here, just as he did in his original brief, that his interpretation of what an \"emolument\" is- based on his reading of text, his review of contemporaneous definitions of the term, his understanding of the purpose of the Clauses, his take on historical evidence, and executive branch precedent and practice-is one as to which substantial grounds of disagreement exist, presumably in the sense that fair minded jurists might reasonably reach contradictory conclusions. The Court finds this a dubious proposition. Even now it remains unclear, as it did in connection with the President's original motion to dismiss, exactly how he came to his view of the meaning of \"emolument.\" What he said in his Motion to Dismiss and repeats now is that the President would have to receive payments for his services\n   <em>\n    as President\n   </em>\n   for the payments to qualify as prohibited \"emoluments;\" in other words, over and above the salary he receives for his services as President, the Federal government,\n   and foreign and state governments would have to make specific payments to him (or possibly provide non-monetary benefits) for Presidential acts before they would be constitutionally impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def's Mot. for Appeal at 14. By every reasonable metric, this appears to describe what is tantamount to a bribe, so above all else the President's definition of the term \"emolument\" is exceedingly strained. To be sure, it may be a difference of opinion, (\"emoluments... of any nature whatsoever\"), but, in candor, as much as anything it appears to be little more than a lawyerly construct to establish a \"difference of opinion,\" but not necessarily one as to which fair minded jurists might reach contradictory conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Emoluments Opinion at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs, moreover, stress that \"the President offers no authority demonstrating the disagreement\n   <em>\n    among courts\n   </em>\n   that is generally necessary to show substantial doubt as to the correctness of this Court's opinion.\" Pls.'

They emphasize that the mere fact that the Court's ruling deals with an issue of first impression does not guarantee certification for purposes of interlocutory appeal.

The Court's own 52-page opinion on the subject, rather than \"highlight[ing] the complexity of the interpretive task,\" as the President suggests, Def's Mot. for Appeal at 11, provides an extensive explanation of how and why the vast weight of textual, definitional, and historical evidence and executive branch precedent and practice justify the broader reading of the term \"emolument\" given by the Court than what the President puts forth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is clear that the President, unhappy with the Court's reasoning and conclusion, merely reargues that his interpretation of the Emoluments Clauses should apply instead of the one the Court gave. He challenges the Court's interpretation of the text of the Clauses; the original definitions and public meaning of the term \"emolument\"; the purpose of the Emoluments Clauses; their historical context; and the consistent interpretation that the executive branch offices have given the term or related terms over the years. The Court sees no point in stating again why it concluded as it did as to each of these issues. Clearly the President believes that the Court made incorrect holdings; it is another matter altogether, however, for him to establish the requisite \"substantial difference of opinion\" over the Court's rulings apart from that. He has not done so. Although the President cites to the decision of Judge Daniels in the\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   case as a court disagreeing over the purpose of the protection\n   the Clauses offer, the fact is that Judge Daniels engaged in no analysis at all as to the meaning of the Emoluments Clauses. Rightly or wrongly, he dismissed the case on standing grounds.

Furthermore, insofar as a question may arise for the first time, it has been held that while district courts may consider novelty as a determinative factor in certifying an order, they should do so only\n   <em>\n    where the other statutory requirements for certification are already met\n   </em>\n   and where the \"matter of first impression also ha[s] other grounds for difference of opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Lynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3939429\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/953/612/#p623\">\n    953 F.Supp.2d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%209009364\">\n    2010 WL 9009364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   All this said, as the Court had occasion to point out in its earlier opinion, even accepting the President's proposed definition of \"emolument,\" Plaintiffs have still plausibly stated a claim in this case. Emoluments Opinion at 19. For instance, insofar as foreign governments have expressly stated in the media that they are patronizing the President's hotel precisely because he is the President, and insofar as foreign governments such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have demonstrably done so, their payments could still constitute an \"emolument\" foursquare within the President's definition of the word, especially if, what appears likely, the payments to his hotel are being made with an expectation of favorable treatment by the President in matters of foreign policy. As a result, even if the appellate court were to disagree with this Court's definition of \"emolument\" and embrace the President's, Plaintiffs' claims in this case would still remain viable under the definition of \"emolument\" the President himself appears to embrace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, there is genuine concern on the part of Plaintiffs, indeed the Court shares it, that if the President is permitted to appeal the Court's decisions in piecemeal fashion, ultimate resolution of the case could be delayed significantly, perhaps for years, since it is quite likely the President would seek to appeal an adverse decision from the Fourth Circuit to the U.S. Supreme Court. That, as a matter of justice, cannot be countenanced. There is no substantial disagreement over the meaning of the term \"emolument\" in the sense that reasonable jurists, much less courts, would disagree, nor would resolution of that question in favor of the President on appeal be likely to materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceedings or otherwise streamline the proceedings in any material respect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra pp.\n   </em>\n   835.

He disagrees with the Court that the Emoluments Clauses \"were intended to protect against competitive injuries to particular members of the public\" or that the Court \"may recognize an equitable cause of action by a private person to\n   enforce\" them. Def's Mot. for Appeal at 22. He begins, as of course he must, by arguing the question of Plaintiffs' standing is a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial disagreement, which is to say, one that fair minded jurists disagree over or as to which diverse courts have opined. The Court has just rejected this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But, further, Plaintiffs argue that their standing is not a controlling question of law because the Court found that they \"have standing based on harms to their proprietary,\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   , and quasi-sovereign interests.\" Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Opinion at 20, 25, 29. On the other hand, the President, in his motion seeking certification for leave to appeal, only discusses the Court's ruling on the question of competitor standing. Again, therefore, Plaintiffs conclude, an appellate decision favorable to the President-i.e., were the Court to find that the Emoluments Clauses were not meant to protect competitors' economic interests-would still leave Plaintiffs free to proceed in their capacities as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   and quasi-sovereigns. Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 6. The President has sought to salvage his argument in his Reply, suggesting that \"by 'economic interests,' he was clearly referring to interests against 'competitive injuries,'... which would encompass both Plaintiffs' proprietary and asserted\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   interests.\" Def's Reply at 10. The President's reply gains him no ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the Court explained in its Standing Opinion, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland have standing as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   in part because of the apparent competitive economic injuries sustained by their residents as a result of competitive advantages enjoyed by the Trump International Hotel. The Court also held that as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   and by reason of the District and Maryland's quasi-sovereign positions, they are acting appropriately to protect their state economies and governance interests. Standing Opinion at 15. That is, on behalf of their citizens, Plaintiffs assert \"public or governmental interests that concern the State as a whole.\" Standing Opinion at 25 n.14, 26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v.

Although the President goes on at length, arguing that contrary to the Court's ruling, competitor standing does not apply in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def's Mot. for Appeal 22-23; Def's Reply at 12-13, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that even an appellate ruling in favor of the President on this point would not preclude Plaintiffs from pursuing their claims as\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   and quasi-sovereigns. In other words, resolving the President's question differently on appeal would not substantially narrow or terminate this litigation, and is not therefore a controlling question for the purposes of certification under \u00a7 1292(b). While this alone suffices to deny certification of this particular question, for the sake of completeness, the Court considers the President's further arguments on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The President points to Judge Daniels' decision in the\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   case as an instance of another court disagreeing over whether business competitors are within the Emoluments Clauses' zones of interest. Def's Mot. for Appeal at 22. To be sure, Judge Daniels did say that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [n]othing in the text or the history of the Emoluments Clauses suggests that the Framers intended these provisions to protect anyone from competition. The prohibitions contained in these Clauses arose from the Framers' concern with protecting the new government from corruption and undue influence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418425\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/276/174/\">\n    276 F.Supp.3d at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The quoted language from Judge Daniel's decision, however, is pure dicta. After finding that plaintiffs there-a non-profit\n   organization (CREW) and two private citizens-had failed to show injury-in-fact for standing purposes, Judge Daniels went on to opine that business competitor plaintiffs are not within the zone of interests of the Emoluments Clauses and thus could not invoke their protection. Even as dicta, it is not clear why entities or persons affected by undue influence or corruption on the part of their business competitor somehow lie outside the zone of interests of the Clauses. In a broad sense, all Americans fall within the zones of interest of the Clauses. Nothing in the Constitution precludes business competitors-a sub-class of Americans-from challenging the improper receipt of emoluments by a President who is purportedly engaging in a business directly in competition with those businesses; especially given the particular allegations in the present case- that the President's business is specifically drawing business away from hotels, event spaces, and restaurants owned by the business competitors. Judge Daniel's decision in the\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   case, in short, does not represent a substantial different of opinion among courts as to standing, limited as it is to the question of standing of particular non-governmental plaintiffs. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the \"President's reliance on the\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   decision reflects-at best-an instance of judges applying the law differently[. It] does not demonstrate, as is required for interlocutory appeal, that 'courts themselves disagree as to what the law is.\" Pls.'

Yet it is noteworthy that since the briefing on the certification of the standing question was completed, another federal court has held that some 200 members of Congress have standing to sue the President for failure to notify Congress of his receipt of foreign \"emoluments\" pursuant to the Foreign Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blumenthal v.

The Court has just considered this question in connection with the previous question as to which the President seeks certification. The President challenges the Court's determination that the competitor standing doctrine yields the conclusion that Plaintiffs have suffered or will imminently suffer an injury-in-fact. But again Plaintiffs note that competitor standing is integral primarily to their proprietary claims, not those made in their\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   or quasi-sovereign capacities. For the same reasons that the Court rejects the President's claim that prudential standing considerations justify certification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   p. 838, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that whether they have suffered injury-in-fact based on the competitor standing theory is not a controlling question. It is also worth considering the President's argument that there is \"substantial ground for disagreement\" on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The President again points to\n   <em>\n    CREW v. Trump\n   </em>\n   as evidence that courts disagree over whether Plaintiffs have standing. Def's Mot. for Appeal at 23-24; Def's Reply at 13. He recites some of Judge Daniels' reasoning for finding that the plaintiffs in that case did not have standing. He then argues that \"reasonable minds could differ\" over whether the doctrine of competitive standing establishes Plaintiffs' injury-in-fact; the President submits that \"the Fourth Circuit has never expressly endorsed the competitor standing doctrine\" and that no court \"has applied it in the context of a diffused market in which competition depends on a large number of variables, as is the case here.\" Def's Mot. for Appeal at 23-24. The President also notes that \"[t]his Court is the first ever to permit a party to pursue relief under the Emoluments Clauses for alleged competitive injury-or for any injury for that matter ....\" Def's Reply at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Again, Plaintiffs respond that even if this Court's ruling that competitive standing establishes an injury-in-fact for the Article III standing analysis were overturned, Plaintiffs would still be able to proceed based on their\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   and quasi-sovereign capacities. Under the latter theories, Plaintiffs share interests of \"trying to protect a large segment of their commercial residents and hospitality industry employees from economic harm\" and in \"protect[ing] their position among ... sister states.\" Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 5 (citing Standing Opinion at 15, 19, 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But Plaintiffs also point out that \"even if the Fourth Circuit had not addressed the question [of competitor standing], it would be of no moment because ... 'the\n   <em>\n    Supreme Court\n   </em>\n   has recognized that plaintiffs with an economic interest have standing to sue to prevent a direct competitor from receiving an illegal market benefit leading to an unlawful increase in competition.' \" Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 6-7 (quoting Standing Opinion at 21). Plaintiffs conclude by pointing out that Judge Daniels' decision in\n   <em>\n    CREW v. Trump\n   </em>\n   was nothing more than a Judge applying essentially the same law to different facts, finding that \"the private-party plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged competitor standing against the President,\" but not showing disagreement about \"what the law is.\" Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 7 (internal quotation omitted). In other words, Judge Daniels was not disagreeing with this Court over what is required to establish standing. He employed the same three-part test this Court did. He simply found, with respect to the plaintiffs before him, all non-governmental persons or entities, that no injury-in-fact had been shown. Here, with more broadly based governmental entity plaintiffs before it,\n   this Court found that, in contrast, they had indeed established injury-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Beyond that, the President's statement that the Fourth Circuit has not addressed the question of competitor standing is somewhat misleading. While it may not have specifically decided a case involving the theory, the Fourth Circuit has in fact noted that \"numerous cases have found that a firm has constitutional standing to challenge a competitor's entry into the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Zeneca, Inc. v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11510487\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/161/\">\n    213 F.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170 n.10 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mova Pharm.

Cir. 1998) ). There is thus a strong indication that the Fourth Circuit would embrace the competitor standing theory if and when squarely called upon to decide. But this is not that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Since the first two statutory factors for certification have not been met on the question of Article III standing via the competitor standing doctrine, the Court declines to certify this issue for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   h.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Court has jurisdiction to declare Declaratory and Injunctive relief against the President\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The fourth and final question the President identifies as certifiable is whether the Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief against him. He submits that if the Court's failure to grant his motions to dismiss on this point was erroneous, it would necessarily be reversible and dispositive on final appeal. Therefore, he says, this is a controlling issue of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767627\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/445/#p452\">\n    307 F.R.D. at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considers first whether there is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion on this issue among courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The President argues that it is open to debate among courts whether equitable relief can be granted against a sitting president. Def's Mot. for Appeal at 24. He believes \"Supreme Court precedent holds that equitable relief against a sitting President is 'extraordinary,' and that federal courts have 'no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5767627\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/307/445/#p452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mississippi v.

Thus the President says that the Court's conclusion that there is no \"barrier to its authority to grant either injunctive or declaratory relief,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Standing Opinion at 36, is in \"significant tension\" with\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and other cited precedent. Def's Mot. for Appeal at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Court was correct in finding that \"[p]recedent makes clear that a plaintiff may bring claims to enjoin unconstitutional actions by federal officials and that they may do so to prevent violation of a structural provision of the Constitution.\" Standing Opinion at 42. They point out that in the two cases the President cites where the courts did not issue injunctive relief against the President, both courts noted that it was more appropriate in each case to enjoin a subordinate executive official to block the protested action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n at 18. Here, where there is obviously no subordinate official against whom equitable relief would make sense-the suit has been filed against the President for actions benefitting him personally-the situation is significantly different. Moreover, instead of involving parties seeking to enjoin the President from enforcing an act of Congress, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   present suit \"involves [the President's] personal compliance with discrete constitutional prohibitions that foreclose any claim of Presidential authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In its Standing Opinion rejecting the President's argument, the Court discussed this issue at length, and the issue needs no further elucidation here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Opinion at 42. The Court found there was ample authority suggesting that even the President - in his official capacity - can be the subject of equitable relief, especially given a situation such as the one at hand. While Plaintiffs may not have sought a preliminary injunction, that obviously would not diminish the force of their claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Extraordinary Circumstances Justifying Certification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The President relies heavily on the proposition that the Court's orders should be certified because they present extraordinary circumstances dealing with issues of first impression-that a sitting President, representing an equal branch of the government, is accused of violating the Constitution and faces the prospect of civil discovery, a burdensome and distracting enterprise.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Def's Mot. for Appeal at 3, 6, 9, 25; Def's Reply at 1, 4, 6-7.
