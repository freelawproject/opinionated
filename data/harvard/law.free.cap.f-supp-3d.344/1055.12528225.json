(Docket 26 at p. 1). DSS filed an answer denying it violated Title VII. (Docket 27). DSS timely filed a motion for summary judgment, together with its statement of undisputed material facts, two affidavits with supporting exhibits and a legal memorandum. (Dockets 41-44 &amp; 49). The United States filed a response to defendant's statement of material facts, an affidavit with supporting exhibits and a brief in resistance to defendant's motion. (Dockets 53-55). DSS filed a reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment. (Docket 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the same day, the United States timely filed a motion for partial summary judgment, together with a statement of undisputed material facts, an affidavit and a legal memorandum. (Dockets 45-48). DSS filed a response to plaintiff's statement of material facts, an affidavit with supporting exhibits and a legal memorandum. (Dockets 50-52). Plaintiff filed a reply brief in support of its motion for partial summary judgment. (Docket 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the analysis in this order, defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied and plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, the United States filed the complaint against DSS under Title VII. (Docket 1). In the fall of 2016, the United States filed an amended complaint. (Docket 26). Count I of the amended complaint alleges DSS violated Title VII by individual race discrimination against Cedric Goodman, a Native American, and other similarly situated Native Americans by denying them, because of their race, employment as a Specialist\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the DSS Office at Pine\n   Ridge, South Dakota, during 2007 through 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4-7. Count II of the amended complaint alleges DSS violated Title VII by engaging in a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination against Native Americans by denying them, because of their race, employment as a Specialist at the DSS Pine Ridge Office during 2007 through 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 4-7 &amp; 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DSS denied it discriminated either against individual Native American applicants for a Specialist position or through a pattern or practice of racial discrimination. (Docket 27). Among other defenses, DSS asserted with respect to Mr. Goodman, and all other allegedly similar applicants, its \"policies, practices and decisions ... were at all times based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8. DSS further alleged its \"actions ... were at all times reasonable and undertaken in good faith and consistent with applicable statutes and enforceable regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court bifurcated discovery into two stages. (Docket 16 at p. 1). The first stage focused \"on (a) the liability, if any, of the [DSS] for the plaintiff's pattern-or-practice claim; (b) any defenses asserted by DSS that apply to the issues to be tried in Stage I; and (c) the relief, if any, including prospective injunctive relief ordered by the court on that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A subsequent order modified the discovery timetable and established a deadline for submission of Stage I motions. (Docket 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DSS's motion for summary judgment asserts the United States \"cannot meet its burden to show a prima facie case that DSS intentionally engaged in a pattern-or-practice of discrimination.\" (Docket 41 at p. 1). The United States moves for \"partial summary judgment on its\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that [DSS] engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional discrimination against Native Americans when hiring Specialists at its Pine Ridge office from 2007 through 2013.\" (Docker 45 at p. 1).
