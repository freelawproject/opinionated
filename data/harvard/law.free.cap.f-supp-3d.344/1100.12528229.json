As the TTAB stated in\n    <em>\n     Amazon Technologies\n    </em>\n    , an \"assignment\" is a transfer of property to another.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203597254\">\n     2010 WL 3597254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *8 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 62 (5th ed. abridged 1983) ). In this case, the Assignment Document only\n    <em>\n     removed\n    </em>\n    Guillome as an owner of the intent-to-use registration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 31 at 16. Touquette owned the mark before and after the Assignment Document's execution; there was thus no transfer to another. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the transfer executed via the Assignment Document was not an assignment subject to \u00a7 1060(a)(1), and that Palm Wine's Second Counterclaim must be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Moreover, even if the transfer executed via the Assignment Document was an assignment rather than a relinquishment of rights, Palm Wine has not sufficiently alleged that the assignment violated the Lanham Act. The Assignment Document states that Guillome and Touquette transferred to Touquette \"any and all goodwill of the business connected with the use of, and symbolized by, the same, and the business in connection with which the trademark is intended to be used.\" ECF No. 31 at 16. Thus, the Assignment Document contradicts Palm Wine's allegation that Guillome and Touquette failed to transfer to Touquette the \"entire business of Mr. Guillome related to the TEETER-TOTTER brand.\" ECF No. 31 \u00b6 25. Absent such an allegation, Palm Wine's Second Counterclaim fails as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Perhaps as a result, Palm Wine recharacterizes the Second Counterclaim in its briefing. Palm Wine contends in its opposition that because \"there was no ongoing and existing business for TEETER-TOTTER wine,\" the Assignment Document constituted an invalid assignment. Opp. at 11. Palm Wine argues that this case is analogous to\n    <em>\n     Muzooka\n    </em>\n    , which concerned a transfer between an individual and an LLC of which the individual was the sole owner.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20949004\">\n     2016 WL 949004\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *1. The dispute in\n    <em>\n     Muzooka\n    </em>\n    was whether the LLC \"succeeded to an 'ongoing and existing' business\" under the terms of \u00a7 1060(a)(1).\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *9. This Court concluded that an ongoing and existing business \"requires at least some use of the mark in commerce,\" and that because the plaintiff had not alleged such use, his claims should be dismissed.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *11-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Palm Wine asserts that, as in\n    <em>\n     Muzooka\n    </em>\n    , because Teeter-Totter had \"no ongoing and existing business\" and \"no goodwill associated with the mark\" as of the date of execution of the Assignment Document, the Assignment Document was invalid. Opp. at 11. The essence of Palm Wine's argument is that \"any goodwill that could have possibly existed in the TEETER-TOTTER mark as of March 20, 2014 belonged to distinct corporate legal entities\" rather than to Guillome and Touquette.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12. However, as Teeter-Totter points out on reply, Palm Wine's Second Counterclaim includes no such allegation about Guillome and Touquette's ongoing and existing business.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 4. The factual allegations that Palm Wine includes in its briefing to support its argument that Teeter-Totter had no ongoing and existing business,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 12-13, are not in the Counterclaim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Instead, the basis for Palm Wine's second Counterclaim is that \"the Assignment document does not convey rights to Mr. Touquette of the entire business of Mr. Guillome related to the TEETER-TOTTER brand.\" ECF No. 31 \u00b6 25. The Assignment Document itself contradicts that allegation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Accordingly, even if the transfer executed in the Assignment Document was an \"assignment\" under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201060\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1060\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), Palm Wine has not sufficiently alleged that Teeter-Totter violated the Lanham Act's prohibition on assignment of intent-to-use applications.

Instead, Palm Wine contends that its Lanham Act fraud claim rests on the allegation that Touquette made false statements about \"the date of first use in commerce; ownership of the mark; and prior use in commerce at all as of April 24, 2014.\" Opp. at 16. However, Palm Wine's Third Counterclaim includes no factual allegations about the latter two sets of false statements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 31 \u00b6 31 (asserting the untruth only of Teeter-Totter's statements about the date of first use).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    It is clear from the authorities cited above that Palm Wine cannot state a Lanham Act fraud claim based on Touquette's false statements about Teeter-Totter's date of first use in commerce. Further, the two out-of-circuit district court cases that Palm Wine cites are not relevant. For example, in\n    <em>\n     City of New York v. Tavern on the Green, L.P.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803653\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/233/\">\n     427 B.R. 233\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D.N.Y. 2010), the district court concluded that the applicant had committed fraud because the applicant made false representations about\n    <em>\n     another owner's\n    </em>\n    first use of the mark the applicant sought to register.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803653\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/233/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803653\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/233/\">\n     at 243\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those misrepresentations about ownership and others' prior use \"bore directly on [applicant's] right to register the mark,\" and were thus material.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803653\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/427/233/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of New York\n    </em>\n    did not hold that an applicant's false statements about its own first use of a trademark were material. The same is true of\n    <em>\n     Select Export Corp. v.

May 5, 2011). In\n    <em>\n     Select Export\n    </em>\n    , the district court held that misstatements about the ownership of a mark-not about an applicant's own date of first use-constituted fraud on the USPTO.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *7-8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Accordingly, Palm Wine's allegations that Touquette made false statements about Teeter-Totter's's date of first use in commerce are not sufficient to state a claim for fraud under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201064\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3). Moreover, \"trademark claims under California law 'are substantially congruent' with federal claims and thus lend themselves to the same analysis.\"\n    <em>\n     Grupo Gigante\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9144054\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/1088/#p1095\">\n     391 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1100 (citing\n    <em>\n     Playboy Enters., Inc. v.

Thus, Palm Wine's allegations cannot state a claim for fraud to cancel Teeter-Totter's California design mark registration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court therefore GRANTS Teeter-Totter's motion to dismiss (1) Palm Wine's Second Counterclaim for violation of the Lanham's Act intent-to-use assignment prohibition; and (2) Palm Wine's Third Counterclaim for fraud. The Court also dismisses Palm Wine's First Counterclaim for declaratory relief to the extent that it is premised on Teeter-Totter's alleged violations of the Lanham Act. The Court affords Palm Wine leave to amend because Palm Wine may be able to allege sufficient facts to support its Lanham Act claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lopez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11489998\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/1122/#p1127\">\n     203 F.3d at 1127\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that \"a district court should grant leave to amend ... unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Attorney's Fees and Costs\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Teeter-Totter also moves for attorney's fees and costs because, it contends, Palm Wine's Second and Third Counterclaims \"were brought frivolously and/or with an improper motive to needlessly expand the scope and increase the expense of this litigation.\" Mot. at 10. On reply, Teeter-Totter clarifies that it asks the court to exercise its inherent authority to award attorney's fees or its authority under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which provides that \"[a]ny attorney ... who so multiplies\n    the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorney's fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\" The Court concludes that although Palm Wine failed to state claims as a matter of law, the Second and Third Counterclaims were not so frivolous as to warrant an award of attorney's fees and costs. Thus, the Court DENIES Teeter-Totter's request for attorney's fees and costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court DISMISSES Palm Bay's Second and Third Counterclaims with leave to amend.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-61\">\n     For that reason, the Court denies as moot Palm Wine's request that the Court take judicial notice \"that Fait Main Wines, LLC is a California limited liability company ... formed by Robert M. Fanucci on July 16, 2012.\" Opp. at 4 n.2. There are no allegations about Fait Main Wines, LLC in the Counterclaim; Fait Main's ownership is thus irrelevant to the instant motion.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
