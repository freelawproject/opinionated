BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case has an intricate history revolving around West Virginia's Intellectual/Developmental Disability Home and Community Based Services waiver program (\"I/DD Waiver Program\") and benefit reductions suffered by program recipients beginning in 2015. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources' (\"DHHR\") Bureau for Medical Services (\"BMS\") administers the State's Medicaid plan, which includes the \"intermediate care level services for individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities\" program from the federally recognized optional services. (ECF No. 14 at 36 \u00b6 225.) This program provides for individuals with intellectual disabilities institutions that offer residential, health, and rehabilitative services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37 \u00b6 226; ECF No. 54 at 9), known as Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (\"ICF/IIDs\"). (ECF No. 179-2 (Nisbet Third Dec.) at 2.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(d). West Virginia implements an alternative option for individuals otherwise eligible for an ICF/IID to receive home- and community-based services instead because, in part, the State has capped the number of ICF/IID beds. The cap is currently set at 533, \"and there are no large or state-run ICF/IIDs in West Virginia.\" (ECF No. 180 at 7; ECF No. 179-2 (Nisbet Third Dec.) at 3 (noting that \"[a]n ICF/IID is the least common service setting for individuals with intellectual disabilities\").) This alternative program-the I/DD Waiver Program-is the subject of the current litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As detailed in this Court's previous memorandum opinion and orders, the I/DD Waiver Program provides \"an array of ... services that an individual needs to avoid institutionalization.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20441.300\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 441.300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 122 at 1-10; ECF No. 170 at 1-5.) Many individuals enrolled in the program live with family members in their homes while others live in an \"[i]ntensively [s]upported [s]etting,\" where one to four program members live together in a residential or group home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 11; ECF No. 115 at 76.) West Virginia's I/DD Waiver Program currently provides services to 4,684 individuals while over 1,300 individuals remain on the program's waiting list. (ECF No. 179-2 (Nisbet Third Dec.) at 1 (noting that \"DHHR added 50 additional slots to the program in July 2018\").) BMS contracts with Kepro f/k/a APS Healthcare Inc. (\"APS\") to assist in the I/DD Waiver Program's administration, such as \"monitoring the member's health and safety,\" (ECF No. 54 at 10-11), \"[e]nsuring each [I/DD Waiver Program] participant's medical eligibility is initially established and reestablished on an annual basis,\" and conducting an \"annual assessment of each program participant's abilities and needs,\" (ECF No. 28-3 at 7). Local service provider agencies ultimately receive contracts to provide individual recipients with their waiver services. (ECF No. 14 at 41 \u00b6 252.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, an I/DD Waiver Program recipient's annual service authorization began with a calculation of their individual \"budget\" by APS. (ECF No. 54 at 14.) This involved the completion of an \"annual assessment,\" which included, in part, an interview with program members, their legal representatives, their case managers, and other interested parties, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38-3 at 73), and a compilation of data regarding each participant's \"abilities, strengths, and support needs,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 14-15). Importantly, APS applied a proprietary algorithm to the assessment's results, producing an individual budget from a multi-variable statistical analysis. (ECF No. 54 at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 at 43 \u00b6 265.) The algorithm was secret in that \"the exact factors it consider[ed], the weight it accord[ed] to each factor, and its overall methodology in determining each member's budget [were] not publicly available information.\" (ECF No. 122 at 5 (citing ECF No. 115 at 145-50).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After APS notified individuals-without explanation-of their budget amount, the member's \"interdisciplinary team\" (\"IDT\"), consisting of the member, a representative from the provider agency, and possibly \"the member's guardian(s) and health care professionals,\" met to create an \"Individualized Program Plan\" (\"IPP\"). (ECF No. 51-1 at 8 \u00b6 19; ECF No. 54 at 15.) The IPP detailed \"each type of service needed to meet that recipient's individually-assessed safety, health, and care needs.\" (ECF No. 14 at 42 \u00b6 257;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 15.) If the costs of the requested services fell within the APS-calculated budget and complied with BMS policies, then \"APS [would] approve service authorization requests consistent with the [IPP].\" (ECF No. 54 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, if a recipient's IPP resulted in the need for services costing more than the APS-determined budget, then \"the service coordinator submit[ted] requests for authorization of services to APS....\" (ECF No. 51-1 at 9 \u00b6 21.) Prior to September 2014, \"APS made independent determinations to grant or deny these requests for funds in excess of the budget and 'routinely approved' such 'service authorization requests.' \" (ECF No. 122 at 6 (citing ECF No. 51-1 at 9-10 \u00b6 22; ECF No. 14 at 44 \u00b6 272).) After BMS discovered that the I/DD Waiver Program was exceeding its budget and that APS was \"approving\" IPPs \"with services costs in excess of the budgets,\" (ECF No. 115 at 94-96;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ECF No. 51-1 at 9 \u00b6 22), BMS instructed APS in September 2014 to \"cease unilaterally approving\" IPPs that included service costs in excess of the APS-calculated budget. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 51-1 at 9 \u00b6 22.) Thereafter, requests for funding in excess of the APS-calculated budget required BMS approval through a \"second[-]level negotiation,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21), which involved BMS review of the recipient's file, attached materials, and an APS recommendation, as well as, if requested, a meeting with the recipient and interested parties prior to deciding whether to grant the funding request. (ECF No. 115 at 88-89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After denying a second-level negotiation request for funding in excess of the APS-calculated budget, BMS sent the member a notice containing appeal rights. (ECF No. 54 at 16.) To exercise the right to appeal the second-level denial, the member could request a fair hearing before the State's Board of Review. (ECF No. 115 at 91-92;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 16.) The BMS and I/DD Waiver Program member could present arguments as well as any supporting documentation at the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 115 at 92-94.) The Board of Review then issued its decision affirming or reversing the second-level determination by BMS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94.) If dissatisfied with the decision, the member retained the option of filing a final direct appeal to a state circuit court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The operative pleading in this action is Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (\"Complaint\"), filed on September 28, 2015, which addresses the alleged infirmities within DHHR's old authorization system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 14.) The Complaint includes the following four causes of action against the old system: (I) violation of procedural due process; (II) violation of the federal Medicaid Act; (III) violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"); and (IV) violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 (\"Rehab Act\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-59 \u00b6\u00b6 315-336.) Plaintiffs request injunctive and declaratory relief against Defendant regarding the allegedly discriminatory former system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 13, 2016, this Court granted Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered Defendant \"to reinstate the named Plaintiffs' individualized I/DD Waiver Program budgets to the amounts Plaintiffs received in 2014, but only for those Plaintiffs that received a reduction in their individualized budgets after 2014.\" (ECF No. 122 at 32.) The decision was based in part on the Court's finding that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their \"claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that Defendant violated Plaintiffs' procedural due process rights by employing the APS Algorithm when determining Plaintiffs' benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 170 at 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subsequent to the preliminary injunction's entry, DHHR developed a new service authorization system to ameliorate the Court's concerns regarding the previous system's constitutionality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the\n   new authorization system replaced the proprietary algorithm with a budget matrix employing a number of clearly identified variables based on a combination of a member's living situation and answers to specific questions during the member's annual assessment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 156 at 7.) Further, DHHR updated its budget letter, created an exceptions process \"designed to evaluate and accommodate requests from individuals who believe they require services beyond what can be purchased within the budget,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9), and refined policies \"to make clear that services in excess of the budget can be authorized when necessary to avoid a heightened risk of institutionalization,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing ECF No. 155-1 at 10-11) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court found on March 26, 2018 that \"the due process injustices inherent in the old system addressed by the injunction are not repeated in DHHR's proposed authorization system.\" (ECF No. 170 at 24.) The Court summarized the rationale for its conclusion in the following passage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Initial budget determinations are individualized and based on transparent and discernible standards in stark contrast to the old system. Plaintiffs may alert DHHR directly if they notice an error in the budget calculation such as the misapplication of a particular input. After receiving a detailed budget letter, Plaintiffs may take advantage of the exceptions process if they believe that their required services are not adequately covered by their budget. Plaintiffs' ability to navigate the exceptions process is open and obvious on many fronts, and there is no evidence that service requests in excess of a base budget will be denied in a blanket manner as in the old system. Moreover, if Plaintiffs receive an unfavorable outcome from the panel that reviewed their case during the exceptions process, Plaintiffs may choose to appeal that decision and request a Medicaid Fair Hearing in front of the Board of Review as detailed in the updated denial notices. The Board of Review has the authority to overturn factual determinations previously made and to grant services requiring funding beyond an individual's initial budget. All these procedures are outlined in the letters and notices that DHHR transmits to members as well as DHHR's updated policy manual. As such, the proposed system does not appear susceptible to the \"high risk of arbitrary and erroneous benefits determinations\" that due process forbids.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) The Court modified its previous memorandum opinion and order to allow the injunction to expire individually as to each named Plaintiff on that individual's first anchor date following the order's entry unless the anchor date fell within ninety days of entry in which case the injunction would expire on the individual's second anchor date after the order's entry.

DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Complaint challenges an allegedly \"unpublished, unfiled, and unlawful policy eliminating any method of obtaining reasonable accommodation, as implemented beginning in late 2014 by defendant Secretary Bowling in her capacity as the executive head of the [DHHR].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 14 at 3 \u00b6 10.) That policy, detailed above and in this Court's previous memorandum opinion and orders, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 122 at 4-8; ECF No. 170 at 1-5), was the subject of the earlier preliminary injunction that has since been effectively dissolved by the Court, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 170 at 5-7, 18-28 (modifying the Court's previous ruling enjoining Defendant) ). The Plaintiffs' individual harms, as alleged in the Complaint,\n   were directly caused by the application of the policy that went into effect in September 2014 and resulted in \"massive reductions and terminations of the waiver benefits and services needed by plaintiffs and the class....\" (ECF No. 14 at 5 \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant first argues in his motion that the old authorization system affected by the previous injunction no longer exists as of the new system's implementation and that \"[t]here is no reasonable likelihood that DHHR will return to the prior system that the Plaintiffs challenge in the Amended Complaint.\" (ECF No. 180 at 12.) Defendant states that there is no plausible rationale for returning to the old system given that DHHR undertook the following steps to transition away from the old system: \"significant policy work by DHHR staff; hiring an outside consultant (Lewin Group) to conduct an actuarial analysis of prior I/DD waiver funding levels; changing the I/DD Waiver Manual (subject to notice and public comment); drafting new notice documents; and extensive training for stakeholders.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 179-1 at 12 \u00b6 47).) Thus, Defendant avers that his agency \"could not undo [the new policy] as a practical matter without deploying significant resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This position is supported by the third declaration of Patricia Nisbet (\"Ms. Nisbet\"), Director of BMS, whose testimony provides that \"BMS has no intention to return to its previous service authorization system and to do so would be an incredible financial and administrative burden.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 179-1 at 12 \u00b6 47 (citing ECF No. 179-2 at 7 \u00b6 17) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alternatively, but related to mootness, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' challenges to the new authorization system in the briefing are not properly before the Court as the operative Complaint \"does not contain a single factual allegation relating to the new service authorization system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) According to Defendant, DHHR has begun implementing a \"substantially different\" system, which requires any challenge to it to take place \"in a subsequent lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Valdivia v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822960\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/956/1125/#p1137\">\n    956 F.Supp.2d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1137 (E.D. Cal. 2013) ).) Ultimately, Defendant notes that while Plaintiffs had the opportunity to amend the Complaint to give Defendant fair notice of claims related to the new authorization system, they did not do so and cannot rely on the Complaint any longer as the system it addresses is no longer in effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs' response to this argument suggests that they are still suffering under the new authorization system and that the Court is capable of granting their originally requested relief \"to require [D]efendant to return to the more ADA-compliant, less discriminatory, more individual-need focused Medicaid waiver benefit granting processes and levels the state provided\" in 2014. (ECF No. 188 at 5.) Because Plaintiffs claim a continued interest in returning the I/DD Waiver Program to its pre-September 2014 version, they argue that this case is not moot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Further, Plaintiffs argue that the new system \"incorporated many of the same unconstitutional practices DHHR employed at the time this action was filed\" and that the matter, therefore, is still live.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) They\n   further note that this Court's most recent memorandum opinion and order only evaluated the new authorization system through a procedural due process lens as that was the basis for the preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, they argue that the class' other claims in Counts II, III, and IV of the Complaint related to Medicaid fair hearing regulations, the ADA, and the Rehab Act are not moot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response to Ms. Nisbet's testimony that DHHR does not plan on reverting back to the old authorization system, Plaintiffs argue that her declaration \"is immaterial and also entitled to no weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) They aver that it \"is irrelevant since the prior system continues to harm the plaintiff class, and the new system does not afford plaintiffs the relief they sought, including relief under Counts II, III, and IV of the Amended Complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) As stated by Plaintiffs, Ms. Nisbet's assertion is an attempt at avoiding judicial review and should not be considered as DHHR could easily resume the prior practice at any point in the future. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (\"Ms. Nisbet's position grants her neither personal knowledge of the State's future intentions nor authority to bind the future acts of BMS, DHHR, or the State of West Virginia, on any matter or in any fashion.\").) As for Defendant's related but alternative argument that Plaintiffs' current claims challenging the new authorization system are not properly before the Court, Plaintiffs dispute this view on the basis that \"the class members continue to suffer present, future, and collateral harm\" as about ninety-two percent of the I/DD Waiver Program members continued to receive benefits under the old system at the time their response to Defendant's motion was filed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's reply provides that \"[t]here is no dispute that Defendant is transitioning away from the service authorization system challenged in Plaintiffs' Complaint.\" (ECF No. 192 at 10 (citing ECF No. 189 at 27-29 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48).) He highlights testimony on the record from Cynthia Beane, BMS Commissioner, and Ms. Nisbet providing that \"BMS is terminating the old system and implementing a new one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing ECF No. 155-2 at 4 \u00b6 8; ECF No. 179-2 at 7 \u00b6 17).) Therefore, Defendant avers that this testimony \"is sufficient to overcome the 'voluntary cessation' exception to mootness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Grutzmacher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277309\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/332/#p349\">\n    851 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   349 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court agrees with Defendant that\n   <em>\n    Lamar Advertising of Penn, LLC v.

Virtually every aspect of the system has been amended,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the method used to calculate an I/DD Waiver Program member's initial budget, the budget letter notifying members of their budget with an explanation of it, and a new exceptions process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 155-1.) As all parties are aware, DHHR has begun implementing the new system, and some waiver recipients already seem to be benefiting from it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since Plaintiffs received noticed of the I/DD Waiver Program's complete overhaul, however, they have not moved to amend the Complaint further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Complaint cannot be construed as bringing claims against the new system as the policies involved did not exist at the time the original complaint was previously amended. As Defendant notes, the Complaint never mentions the new system or its components in the factual allegations. Similarly, Plaintiffs cannot allege violations of substantive due process or West Virginia law as they argue in\n   response to Defendant's motion, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 188 at 34-38), as those claims are not in the Complaint either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wahi v. Charleston Area Med. Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5897726\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/599/#p617\">\n    562 F.3d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617 (4th Cir. 2009) (\"[A] plaintiff may not raise new claims after discovery has begun without amending his complaint.\"); Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (providing that a pleading must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief\"). To sidestep this procedural problem, Plaintiffs instead attempt to simply advance the claims in the Complaint against a different set of facts than those alleged. In this endeavor, Plaintiffs now argue that the new authorization system violates Counts II, III, and IV of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' arguments in the dispositive motions' briefing, the notion that Plaintiffs or other I/DD Waiver Program members will be worse off under the new system is purely speculative at this point. The only evidence Plaintiffs attach to their motion or their response to Defendant's motion of the effect the new authorization system has had on certain class members is declarations from five guardians related to their dependent class members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 182-3, 182-4, 182-5, 182-6, 182-11, 189-2, 193-1.) Those declarations purport to show that under the new authorization system, the members are worse off than they were when the policy was changed back in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, as Ms. Nisbet notes in her fourth declaration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   four of those five individuals (Alexa G., Cole J., Bo M., and Christopher B.) have not been assigned budgets under the new system authorization system, and the one individual who has been assessed under the new system (James N.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   has not made\n   an exceptions request for services in excess of his budget. Thus, even if Plaintiffs' claims were not moot and they were allowed to go forward on the merits as applied to the new system, those claims would not necessarily be ripe for review. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that any class member has been assigned a budget under the new system and exhausted the available remedies for seeking services outside the assigned budget.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This case boils down to the fact that the system Plaintiffs originally sought to challenge no longer exists. The Court acknowledges that the parties here have expended immense resources on this case, and nothing in this opinion should be construed to hold that the legality of DHHR's new authorization system is immune from challenge. However, the challenged system has been replaced, and the Court finds that Defendant has met his burden of showing that there is no probability that DHHR will return to the old system and that he has overcome the voluntary cessation exception to mootness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grutzmacher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277309\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/332/#p349\">\n    851 F.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because the system against which the Complaint was lodged has been substantially revised, Plaintiffs' claims against it are moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532636\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/854/673/#p677\">\n    854 F.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (4th Cir. 1988) (\"A request for prospective relief alone, founded on a challenge to a regulation which no longer applies to plaintiffs, does not present an actual case or controversy.\"). As such, any challenges to the new system are better addressed in a subsequent lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valdivia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822960\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/956/1125/#p1137\">\n    956 F.Supp.2d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even if the case were not constitutionally moot, the Court would elect to use its \"discretionary power to withhold injunctive and declaratory relief for prudential reasons....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S-1 v. Spangler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10544455\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/832/294/#p297\">\n    832 F.2d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297-99 (4th Cir. 1987) (citations omitted). It has become clear that the specific relief sought by Plaintiffs may no longer be necessary once the named Plaintiffs and class members receive services under the new authorization system. No Plaintiff or class member has been assigned a budget under the new system and utilized the avenues to obtain services in excess of that budget such as the new exceptions process and a Medicaid fair hearing. Once the named Plaintiffs receive their services over the next year, they may be in an equal or better position than they were in 2014, so there could be a question as to their standing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief and their ability to represent the defined class. Further, the claims in Counts II, III, and IV were lodged against the old system, which is being phased out relatively quickly, and the Court believes that based on the evidence provided by Defendant, the allegedly violative procedures and substantive policies in it may have been cured. Nonetheless, the legality of the new system must be demonstrated in practice. Should unlawful components exist within the new system once it is fully implemented, there are many potential plaintiffs, including those named in the current suit, to challenge it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the reasons above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (ECF No. 182), and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion\n   for Summary Judgment insofar as it requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiffs' claims as moot and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   the motion insofar as it requests summary judgment, (ECF No. 179). The Court further\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   this case and\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTS\n   </strong>\n   the Clerk to remove this matter from the Court's docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Despite the subsequent modifications to the system challenged within the Complaint, Plaintiffs have never moved to amend the Complaint in the three years since it was filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    A detailed description of the new authorization system was attached to Defendant's previously filed Motion to Vacate or Modify the Preliminary Injunction Order. (ECF No. 155-1.) The Court heavily relied on that description when granting Defendant's motion and modifying the preliminary injunction in this case. (\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 170.) In conjunction with Defendant's pending Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant filed a Statement of Undisputed Facts that relies in part on the previously filed Description of New Service Authorization Process. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 179-1 at 13-23 \u00b6\u00b6 49-84, 24-25 \u00b6\u00b6 88-90.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Plaintiffs now move pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(2) to strike the description of the new service authorization process included in Defendant's statement of facts as it allegedly constitutes inadmissible evidence. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 184.) They argue that the description is inadmissible hearsay as it relies on information obtained from DHHR's consultant, Lewin Group, and the record contains \"no affidavit or testimony from an individual with personal knowledge affirming the information provided by Defendant's consultant, nor has Defendant presented any expert witness testimony regarding this information.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2 (citing Fed.

The Court agrees with Defendant that this information \"could be introduced at trial through the direct testimony of an individual from the Lewin Group.\" (ECF No. 191 at 3.)\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Humphreys &amp; Partners Architects, L.P. v.

For this reason, the Court\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n    the motion to strike, (ECF No. 184), and will consider, to the extent necessary, the information contained in Defendant's description of the new service authorization system.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    A more extensive discussion of DHHR's new authorization system is included in the Court's previous memorandum opinion and order entered on March 26, 2018.

The Court's memorandum opinion and order enjoining Defendant from calculating the named Plaintiffs' budgets using the APS algorithm if it resulted in a smaller budget than Plaintiffs enjoyed in 2014 focused on DHHR's policy as it existed in 2016. Thus, Plaintiffs argue that the old policy, as it is challenged in the Complaint, has been used, in part, to create the new authorization system that Defendant argues cannot properly be challenged in this action. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 8-9 (\"Consequently, the new system 'bakes in' injuries inflicted by the contested processes, and assures the class will continue to suffer adversely from the consequences of those illegal practices for several years yet to come. The continuing 'brooding presence' of the arbitrary KEPRO algorithm, the absence of any meaningful process by which class members could seek and obtain reasonable accommodation of DHHR budget policy to their individual needs, and the absence of adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to contest denial of benefits, means a new system that continues and extends that injury does not moot the harm to the plaintiff class.\").)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that because DHHR used a figure derived from the old challenged system to initially base the budget matrix within the new system, the new system is inextricably linked with the challenged system.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    , note 7. While this may bind the two systems to a small degree for the moment, DHHR \"intends to rebase the budgets every few years, which will further untether the new budget matrix from services authorized under the prior system.\" (ECF No. 192 at 11.) Therefore, any concern associated with this link is mitigated by the DHHR's method for rebasing the budget matrix in the future.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    For example, according to Ms. Nisbet, as of June 29, 2018, after members began assessment under the new system, BMS \"received a few requests for services in excess of the budget, and ha[d] already granted three requests for additional services\" and \"approved in part a fourth request for services in excess of the budget.\" (ECF No. 179-2 (Nisbet Third Dec.) at 6;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 192-1 (Nisbet Fourth Dec.) at 2 (reaffirming the previous declaration regarding the granting of these four exception requests).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Court further notes that on July 31, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Strike Paragraph[s] Fifteen[ ]and Sixteen of the Third Declaration of Patricia S. Nisbet, (ECF No. 185), which contains the information quoted in the preceding paragraph. In accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(2), Plaintiffs argue that the information is inadmissible evidence based on Ms. Nisbet's \"fail[ure] to establish that she has personal knowledge about the matters to which she avers\" because she \"does not identify any personal involvement with the individual cases that she references.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2-3 (citing Fed.
