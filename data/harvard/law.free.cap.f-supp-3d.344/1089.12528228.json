Therefore, this Court is bound by the\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    decision to find that a conviction for assault on a federal officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon under Section 111(b) is a crime of violence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Mobley's argument that\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    's holding under the elements clause of Section 16(a) is invalid because assault on a federal officer does not require the use of violent force does not persuade. He first argues that the\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    Court made no finding regarding the level of force as required by\n    <em>\n     Johnson I\n    </em>\n    . Although the\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    court did not specify that violent force was required for a conviction under Section 111(b), it noted in its crime of violence analysis that the \"ordinary meaning of ['crime of violence'], combined with \u00a7 16's emphasis on the use of physical force against another person ... suggests a category of violent, active crimes.\"\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3648532\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/943/\">\n     566 F.3d at 947\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Leocal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p9\">\n     543 U.S. at 11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3442217\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/1/#p9\">\n     125 S.Ct. 377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). In addition, by the time the Ninth Circuit had decided\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n    , it had already established a \"violent force\" requirement under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    and similar generic offense provisions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Thus, the Court is not persuaded that\n    <em>\n     JF\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    failed to take into account the violent force requirements under the elements clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Mobley further cites\n    <em>\n     Dominguez-Maroyoqui\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that a Section 111 conviction may result from any use of force, not just violent force, and thus argues that Section 111(b) does not qualify as a crime of violence. However,\n    <em>\n     Dominguez-Maroyoqui\n    </em>\n    only determined that a \"[Section]111(a) felony does not require proof, as a necessary element, that the defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use physical force as defined in\n    <em>\n     Johnson [I]\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5887845\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/918/#p920\">\n     748 F.3d at 921\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It did not make the same finding for Section 111(b), the offense at issue here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Next, Mobley relies on the out-of-circuit decision in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

(Suppl. Memo at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted).) In\n    <em>\n     Torres-Miguel\n    </em>\n    , the Fourth Circuit held that a criminal threats conviction under California Penal Code section 422(a), which occurs when an individual \"willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,\" is not categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because such an offense may result in death or great bodily injury without involving the use of physical force.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20422\">\n     Cal.
