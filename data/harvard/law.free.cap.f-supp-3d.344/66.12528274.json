Plaintiff requested documents related to the 1995 termination of an Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\"). In response to Plaintiff's FOIA request, Defendant identified three letters. Defendant eventually provided Plaintiff with one of the responsive letters but withheld the two remaining responsive letters, claiming that they fell under FOIA's Exemption 6 which protects \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b)(6).

BACKGROUND\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     In his FOIA request, Plaintiff seeks to acquire letters regarding the potential misconduct and termination of former AUSA for the Eastern District of New York (\"EDNY\") Raymond Granger. Plaintiff's FOIA request stems from a 1995 joint state-federal investigation into Plaintiff's possible involvement in criminal acts, which eventually lead to Plaintiff pleading guilty in the EDNY. Pl.'s Statement of Facts, ECF No. [13-2], 3. Mr. Granger was the lead prosecutor for the investigation.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      at 2\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . But, Mr. Granger was removed from Plaintiff's case in 1995 and was soon thereafter terminated from his position with EDNY.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      at 3\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Plaintiff has requested the termination materials related to Mr. Granger based on the belief that the materials may show that Mr. Granger engaged in misconduct regarding certain proffers that Plaintiff made to the federal and Los Angeles County prosecutors when Mr. Granger was leading the investigation. Compl., ECF No. [1], \u00b6\u00b6 10-13. If the termination materials show misconduct on the part of Mr. Granger, Plaintiff intends to use such information to help his effort to get a new trial before the California state court, where he was convicted of murder in 2014. Pl.'s Statement of Facts, ECF No. [13-2], 3-4.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     As part of his strategy in the California case, in 2007, Plaintiff initiated his first FOIA request seeking documents relating\n     to Mr. Granger's termination. Pl.'s Mot, ECF No. [13-3], 12. The Department of Justice, which was in possession of a draft termination letter and related documents, withheld the documents as exempt under FOIA. In 2012, Plaintiff initiated suit seeking disclosure of the documents. The court ordered the release of approximately 3,600 pages of exhibits to the requested letter but concluded that the draft letter itself was exempt under FOIA.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      at 12-13\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ;\n     <em>\n      see generally\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Bloomgarden v.

Pl.'s Statement of Facts, ECF No. [13-2], 4. Defendant indicated that three responsive letters had been found and that all three letters would be released to Plaintiff. Pl.'s Ex. DD, ECF No. [13-7], 78-79. But Defendant later explained that, upon further review, the letters were exempt from FOIA under Exemption 6.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 80. The archivist who had initially agreed to release the letters had been newly hired, and after her supervisor reviewed the request, the supervisor determined that disclosure of the letters would cause an unwarranted invasion of Mr. Granger's personal privacy under Exemption 6. Dec. of Martha Wagner Murphy, ECF No. [12-2], Ex. G. Accordingly, Defendant refused to release the three letters. But, on administrative appeal, Defendant agreed to release one of the letters, finding that only two of the letters met the requirements of Exemption 6.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     Plaintiff continues seeking disclosure of the two letters pertaining to Mr. Granger's termination from the U.S. Attorney's Office. In 2017, Plaintiff brought action in this Court, asking the Court to conclude that Exemption 6 is inapplicable because the release of the letters would not result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of Mr. Granger's privacy. Both parties have moved for summary judgment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     <strong>\n      II.

DISCUSSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     Plaintiff does not challenge the adequacy of Defendant's search for responsive records to Plaintiff's FOIA request. As such, the sole issue before the Court is whether the two, undisclosed letters regarding the termination of Mr. Granger from the U.S. Attorney's Office fall under FOIA Exemption 6. The Court has reviewed the two letters in camera. Considering the arguments of the parties, as well as the Court's own review of the letters, the Court concludes that the letters fall under FOIA Exemption 6 and were rightfully withheld.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     Exemption 6 to FOIA allows government agencies to withhold \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"\n     <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b)(6). Fundamentally, \"Exemption 6 is designed to protect personal information in public records.\"\n     <em>\n      Multi Ag Media\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644291,5864700\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/1224/\">\n      515 F.3d at 1228\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (citations omitted). Exemption 6 is not limited to \"a narrow class of files containing only a discrete kind of personal information[,]\" but was \"intended to cover detailed Government records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.\"\n     <em>\n      U.S. Dep't of State v.

So, when reviewing the withholding of records under Exemption 6, the Court first must determine whether the records in question are the sort of personnel, medical, or other records which are protected by the exemption.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     Assuming the records at issue are of the type that fall within the ambit of Exemption 6, \"the court must then determine whether their disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, which requires balancing the privacy interest that would be compromised by disclosure against any public interest in the requested information.\"\n     <em>\n      Wisdom v.

But, the similarities between Plaintiff's prior case and this one make that court's analysis informative.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-26\">\n     Looking first to Mr. Granger's privacy interest in the letters, it is an \"indisputable proposition that disclosure of information identifying a particular attorney as the subject of a ... disciplinary proceeding ... would violate substantial privacy interests of the attorney.\"\n     <em>\n      Carter v.

Mr. Granger still has a privacy interest keeping the details of his termination private.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     Plaintiff argues that, because Mr. Granger's termination occurred more than two decades ago, the passage of time has lessened Mr. Granger's privacy interest in the letters. But, the Court concludes that \"[t]he passage of time, without more, does not materially diminish\" Mr. Granger's privacy interest.\n     <em>\n      Schrecker v.

Mr. Granger's continuing privacy interest is especially apparent given that Mr. Granger is a currently-licensed, practicing attorney who would be interested in avoiding embarrassment and harm to his reputation and livelihood.

When the information requested through FOIA relates to the misconduct of federal employees, the Court considers the rank of the employee and the seriousness of the allegations.\n     <em>\n      Kimberlin\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11846785,3712837\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/139/944/\">\n      139 F.3d at 949\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Here, the alleged misconduct involves a former staff-level AUSA. Misconduct by a federal government attorney is always of some concern to the public. Federal government attorneys have their salaries paid by the taxpayer and have discretion in exercising the penal powers of the federal government. But, the public's interest in the negligent job performance and unremarkable misconduct of a staff-level attorney is relatively low.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Stern v.

But, due to the two decades which have passed since Mr. Granger was terminated, the information contained in the requested letters will illuminate little about the current internal operations of the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Cochran v.

But, the letters requested by Plaintiff have little to no historic import. Having read the letters, the Court concludes that they do not illuminate systemic failings or widespread misconduct on the part of the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n     <em>\n      Contrast with\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Bartko v.

Cir. 2018) (finding a strong public interest where the requested documents evidenced a pattern of discovery abuses by the U.S. Attorney's Office). Instead, the letters pertain only to a single AUSA who was terminated over two decades ago for relatively unremarkable reasons. And, insofar as Plaintiff argues that the two letters should be disclosed based on the effect that disclosure may have on his own criminal case, Plaintiff's personal reasons for requesting disclosure are not a consideration under the FOIA analysis.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      U.S. Dep't of Def. v.

Exemption 6 protects personal information in an employee's file only if the disclosure of the information would create a \"clearly unwarranted\" invasion of privacy.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n      5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b)(6). Here, the invasion of privacy resulting from the disclosure of the two letters would be clearly unwarranted. Mr. Granger maintains a strong privacy interest in the information contained in his termination letters. His interest is especially strong given his continued work in the legal field. In contrast, the public's interest in the disclosure of the letters is relatively low. The letters relate only to the two-decades old termination of a lower-level government attorney. The letters do not show systemic failures or a larger pattern of misconduct on the part of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Accordingly, disclosure would not \"contribut[e] significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government\" which is \"the only relevant public interest in disclosure to be weighed.\"\n     <em>\n      Fed. Labor Relations Auth.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230545\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/487/#p495\">\n      510 U.S. at 495\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230545\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/487/#p495\">\n      114 S.Ct. 1006\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (internal citations and alterations omitted).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-33\">\n     The Court finds that the above analysis applies equally to both of the requested letters. However, in his motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff attempts to distinguish the two letters. Plaintiff argues that, at a minimum, the April 4, 1997 letter should be disclosed as this letter relates to the \"requesting of documents and the return of property,\" which does not implicate Mr. Granger's privacy interest. Pl.'s Mot, ECF No. [13-3], 17. But, the Court's review of this letter shows that the letter also contains sensitive material relating to the circumstances surrounding Mr. Granger's termination and to other private information in Mr. Granger's personnel file. Moreover, insofar as Plaintiff argues that the letter primarily concerns the return of property, the corresponding public interest in this information would be extremely low. Accordingly, both letters meet the requirements of FOIA Exemption 6.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     The Court must make a separate finding as to whether any portion of the two letters withheld in their entirety could have been segregated and released.\n     <em>\n      Trans-Pac.

Cir. 2007). Having reviewed the two letters as well as the declaration by NARA employee Martha Wagner Murphy, the Court is satisfied that no reasonably segregable information has been withheld. Any non-exempt information contained in the two letters is \"inextricably intertwined with exempt portions.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.
