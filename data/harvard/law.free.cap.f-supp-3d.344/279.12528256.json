INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The approval and regulation of gambling (or \"gaming\") on Native American (\"tribal\") land requires a careful balancing of tribal, state, and federal law, and this action implicates that balance. Plaintiffs the state of Connecticut (the \"state\") and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe (\"Pequot\") seek to amend the federally-imposed procedures authorizing gambling on Pequot land within Connecticut under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (the \"IGRA\"). This amendment is necessary for Pequot to operate a commercial casino on Connecticut land. The procedures require that Plaintiffs obtain the Secretary of the Interior's (the \"Secretary\") approval to amend them; approval the Secretary has withheld. Plaintiffs assert that the IGRA requires that the Secretary and the United States Department of the Interior (the \"Department\") (together, \"Federal Defendants\") deem the amendments approved, and they ask this Court to require the Secretary to publish a notice of approval in the Federal Register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MGM Resorts Global Development, LLC (\"MGM\"), a multinational commercial casino operator, claims to have an interest in this action because the Secretary's approval of Plaintiffs' proposed amendments would give Pequot a competitive advantage over MGM in the market for commercial gambling in Connecticut and the surrounding states. First, MGM asserts that both it and Pequot have proposed the development of a casino in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and the state's approval of one proposal over the other largely hinges on the Secretary's decision at issue in this action. Second, MGM asserts that the Secretary's approval of Plaintiffs' proposed amendments would clear the final hurdle preventing the development of a casino in East Windsor, Connecticut that would directly compete with MGM's casino in Springfield, Massachusetts. Accordingly, MGM seeks to intervene as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now before the Court are Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss the action,\n   MGM's motion to intervene as a defendant, and several related motions. For the reasons stated below, the Court will allow MGM to intervene as a defendant and it will dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Federal Defendants argue, however, that under the IGRA and its implementing regulations, the Secretary's approval of secretarial procedures and procedure amendments is not governed by the same timing requirements governing the Secretary's approval of tribal-state compacts and compact amendments. Under this interpretation of the IGRA, the \"mandatory timeframes\" that Plaintiffs claim dictated the Secretary's actions with respect to amendments to the Mohegan Compact do not apply to amendments to the Pequot Procedures. Fed. Defs. Mot. Partial Dismissal (\"Fed. Defs. Mem.\") at 6, ECF No. 18. According to Federal Defendants, \"Plaintiffs have therefore failed to establish this Court's subject matter jurisdiction over the case and failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted with regard to [Pequot's] proposed procedures amendment,\" because Plaintiffs have not identified a nondiscretionary action that the Secretary unlawfully failed to take.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9370900,5872109\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/728/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs, unsurprisingly, read the IGRA very differently.

The Court concludes that Federal Defendants' interpretation of the IGRA is supported by the relevant provisions' plain meaning, and therefore that the Secretary was not required to act in the manner asserted by Plaintiffs.

Federal Defendants and MGM claim that by its plain terms, the IGRA imposes strict deadlines on the Secretary's consideration of tribal-state compacts but not on the Secretary's imposition of procedures and approval of amendments to those procedures.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Plaintiffs' Sur-Reply at 5-7 (\"While Plaintiffs would disagree that the Defendants can take as much time as they would like in prescribing amendments to procedures than [sic] in reviewing and approving compact amendments, that is not the issue before the Court.\").
