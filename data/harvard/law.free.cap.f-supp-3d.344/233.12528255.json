Gallaudet argues that the plaintiffs cannot establish any mental suffering resulting from the alleged false arrest because \"[t]he record is notably absent of any indication that [Manganelli] ever mentioned the arrest to anyone from the time he was release[d] until his suicide,\" Gallaudet's Summ. J. Mem. at 28-29, and that \"[a]lthough ... Johns[on] testified that she recalled seeing [Manganelli] express a single tear while he was detained in the hallway, ...

However, these arguments ask the Court to weigh and draw inferences from the record evidence, which is not the Court's function on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge[ ] ...

Thus, although the Court concludes that the plaintiffs may not recover damages for physical and mental suffering due to Manganelli's suicide under the Survival Act, the plaintiffs have identified sufficient evidence to demonstrate that they may be entitled to recover other damages due to the alleged false arrest. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Gallaudet's motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' claims for damages under the Survival Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The District does not dispute that the first element has been satisfied here, and its position that the plaintiffs cannot establish the second element lacks merit.

J. Mem. at 31. However, the District fails to explain why the comparatively short duration of Manganelli's custody would require a reasonable juror to conclude that the District was not deliberately indifferent to its obligation to assess Manganelli's accommodations needs. Although the duration of his custody might be an appropriate consideration in determining the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of damages, it does not compel the conclusion that the plaintiffs are entitled to no damages whatsoever. And, to the extent that the District suggests that the relatively short duration of time that Manganelli was in its custody made conducting an assessment unreasonable, it is not apparent to the Court why twelve hours would not be sufficient time to make the requisite assessment of Manganelli's mental health. Moreover, the Court has already rejected the District's argument that a Title II claim always requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that he or she was denied a public entity's benefits or services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.E.2.ii;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.160\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"A public entity [must] take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with ... members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Additionally, the District argues that \"there is no evidence that Manganelli requested\n   any accommodation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   District's Summ. J.

The Court must also reject the District's argument that \"the District had in place a policy ... to [e]nsure that deaf detainees receive accommodations,\" and \"MPD had a longstanding policy governing the processing of persons who are suspected of having mental illness,\" and that \"[t]he very existence of these policies shows that the District was not deliberately indifferent to Manganelli's rights under the ADA.\" District's Summ. J. Mem. at 31. However, the existence of such policies may prove to be irrelevant, given that the District has not asserted that they were followed in this case or that they comport with the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have identified evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the District failed to reasonably accommodate Manganelli's deafness in violation of the ADA, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to potentially recover compensatory damages for that failure. However, the Court concludes that it must grant summary judgment to the District on the plaintiffs' claim that the District violated the ADA by failing to inform Pretrial Services of Manganelli's deafness, and must hold in abeyance the District's summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs' claim that the District failed to reasonably accommodate Manganelli's mental illness. Accordingly, the Court must grant in part, deny in part, and hold in abeyance in part the District's summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs' reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that it must exclude Dr. Welner's proposed expert report and testimony as unreliable, but that striking the District's alleged undisclosed summary judgment exhibits is not warranted. Additionally, the Court concludes that summary judgment for the defendants is not warranted on the plaintiffs' false arrest claims against both defendants, as well certain aspects of the plaintiffs' ADA claim against the District for its alleged failure to reasonably accommodate Manganelli's deafness. However, the Court concludes that summary judgment for the defendants is appropriate on the plaintiffs' ADA claims against the District for wrongful arrest and for failure to inform Pretrial Services of Manganelli's deafness, as well as the plaintiffs' claims for damages arising from Manganelli's suicide under the Wrongful Death Act and the Survival Act. Finally, the Court concludes that it must hold in abeyance the District's summary judgment motion as to the plaintiffs' ADA claim for failure to reasonably accommodate Manganelli's mental illness pending further briefing by the parties. Accordingly, the Court will grant Gallaudet's motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Welner, deny the plaintiffs' motion to strike the District's alleged undisclosed exhibits, and grant in part, deny in part, and hold in abeyance in part the defendants' motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 29th day of October, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) Gallaudet University's Memorandum in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Gallaudet's Summ.

However, this concern cannot provide a basis for imposing a duty Title II itself does not impose. In any event, the Court notes that even if it could conclude that the plaintiffs' claim is cognizable under Title II and should survive summary judgment, the plaintiffs would likely have an impossible task demonstrating at trial that the denial of a pre-presentment screening caused Manganelli harm. The plaintiffs suggest that a pre-presentment screening was critical because it \"traditionally includes screening aimed at early identification of mental health issues to be reported to the [j]udge handling the first appearance,\" Compl. \u00b6 142; however, the plaintiffs do not argue that the judge presiding over Manganelli's presentment would have taken different actions had the judge received such a report, and in any event, the evidence in the record demonstrates that the judge was aware that such mental health issues may have existed,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Gallaudet's Summ. J. Mot., Ex. YY (Release Order Addendum) at Gianni0583 (reflecting that the judge ordered Manganelli, as a condition of his release, to \"[r]eport to [Pretrial Services] for [an] evaluation\" by the agency's SSU). Moreover, evidence in the record suggests that even if Manganelli had been identified by Pretrial Services as someone requiring mental health services, such services would not have been available to him on March 29, 2014, the day he was in federal custody,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Summ. J. Opp'n, Ex. W (Deposition of Sheena Baynes-Bagley (Apr. 28, 2017) ) 12:20-13:9 (testifying that Pretrial Services' liaison from the Department of Behavioral Health is not available on Saturdays);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Reply to District's Facts \u00b6 40 (admitting that \"March 29, 2014[,] was a Saturday\"). Thus, it appears that merely identifying Manganelli as in need of mental health intervention would not have permitted him access to mental health services prior to his appearance in court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The Court shall contemporaneously issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
