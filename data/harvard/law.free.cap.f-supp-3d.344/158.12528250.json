Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (\"Direct Loan Program\"), which allows students who attend participating schools to obtain federal loans. The regulations were intended to \"protect student loan borrowers from misleading, deceitful, and predatory practices.\" William D.

Shortly before the 2016 Rule was scheduled to take effect, Plaintiff California Association of Private Postsecondary Schools (\"CAPPS\") brought this action seeking to set the rule aside in its entirety. Dkt. 1 at 75-76. About a week later, CAPPS moved preliminarily to enjoin the implementation or enforcement of a single provision, which prohibits participants in the Direct Loan Program from employing predispute arbitration clauses and class action waivers in certain disputes with student-borrowers (\"Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Provision\"). Dkt. 6. That motion was never fully briefed or decided, however, because the Department of Education, on its own accord, stayed the effective date of most of the 2016 Rule pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20705\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   pending resolution of this case.

Within weeks of issuance of the stay, two student-borrowers and a coalition of nineteen states and the District of Columbia filed separate lawsuits seeking to invalidate the stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

The Department subsequently issued an interim final rule on October 24, 2017, staying the effective date of the 2016 Rule to July 1, 2018, and then issued a final rule staying the effective date for another year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   William D.

The Court consolidated the\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   cases and, on September 12, 2018, issued an opinion resolving the consolidated action.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

In that decision, the Court held that the Section 705 Stay was arbitrary and capricious and thus unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"); that the Interim Final Rule was, for the most part, moot; and that the Final Delay Rule was issued in violation of the Higher Education Act's negotiated rulemaking requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526776\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/325/74/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Five days later, the Court entered a remedial order vacating the Final Rule and Section 705 Stay but staying vacatur of the Section 705 Stay until October 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v.

Two days after issuing that decision, the Court held a status conference in this action and set a schedule for CAPPS to renew its motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the 2016 Rule, which would go into effect upon expiration of the Court's stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order (Sept. 17, 2018). The Court also granted the\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs leave to intervene (\"\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   Intervenors\") and granted the interested states and the District of Columbia leave to participate as amici (\"State Amici\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (Sept 14, 2018); Minute Order (Sept. 18, 2018). On September 22, 2018, CAPPS filed the pending motion for a preliminary injunction. Dkt. 65. This time, however, CAPPS has sought preliminarily to enjoin four provisions of the 2016 Rule: (1) the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver that it targeted in its original motion; (2) the \"Financial Responsibility Provision;\" (3) the \"Repayment Rate Provision;\" and (4) the \"Borrower Defense Provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The United States and\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   intervenors filed briefs in opposition, and the states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67 (State Amici); Dkt. 68 (\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   Intervenors); Dkt. 69 (United States). CAPPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   filed a reply brief on October 8, 2018, Dkt. 72, and the Court held oral argument the following day, Minute Order (Oct. 9, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each of the four provisions that CAPPS seeks to enjoin raises a distinct set of issues; overall, CAPPS raises\n   <em>\n    twenty-four\n   </em>\n   challenges to the four provisions. As to most of the challenged provisions, CAPPS has failed to demonstrate that it has standing or that the dispute is ripe for decision. Moreover, with respect to each of the four provisions, CAPPS has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that any one of its members is likely to suffer an irreparable injury in the absence of an injunction. Because irreparable injury is the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   for obtaining a preliminary injunction, that flaw is dispositive. In light of these threshold obstacles, the Court need not reach the merits of the plethora of substantive arguments that CAPPS raises-and, indeed, concludes that it would not be prudent to do so on such an abbreviated schedule. Those issues, in short, are for the next chapter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, deny the motion for a preliminary injunction and will set a schedule for cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dkt. 65-2 at 2 (Johnson Decl. \u00b6 9). Johnson adds that the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Provision will require these schools \"to send notices to their students\" regarding the rule change, \"to amend their agreements[,] retrain their admissions staffs[,] and actually litigate new cases, including class actions, in federal and state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Johnson Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12).

CAPPS has identified specific member schools that will likely suffer a concrete injury if the challenged provision takes effect, and it is likely that the relief sought from the Court-including a preliminary injunction-would redress that injury. To take the most obvious example, the declarations establish that, if the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Provision takes effect, each of the identified schools would be required promptly to send a notice to students with existing enrollment agreements informing them that the school will \"not ... use any predispute arbitration agreement to stop [the student] from bringing a lawsuit concerning\" the covered conduct, 2016 Rule, 81 Fed.

But, even putting aside the question whether requiring parties to litigate in court, as opposed to before an arbitrable tribunal, constitutes irreparable harm, none of the declarations says anything about when, if at all, such injury is likely to occur. Specifically, they say nothing\n   about how often they are confronted by covered legal claims brought by their students, about the nature of those claims, or about actual expense of litigating those cases, if any.

Notably, however, these declarations stop short of saying that the arbitrations would be affected by the rule; they merely assert that they are\n   <em>\n    uncertain\n   </em>\n   about how they could proceed.

One source of uncertainty, of course, is that nothing in the 2016 Rule prevents the parties to an existing dispute from agreeing to arbitrate, and, to the extent any pending case is on the eve of arbitration, it is not difficult to imagine that all parties might have an interest moving forward as planned. The Court, of course, can only speculate about what might happen because these three declarations devote only single, qualified sentence to matters \"currently ... in arbitration.\" Dkt. 65-4 at 2 (Casanover Decl. \u00b6 11); Dkt. 65-7 at 2 (Second Casanover Decl. Dkt. 65-8 at 1 (Weerasuriya Decl. \u00b6 10). Because those declarations say nothing about the number of arbitrations, the nature of the disputes, whether the disputes clearly fall within the scope of the 2016 Rule (or whether the declarants are merely \"[un]certain\" about that question,\n   <em>\n    Wis.

Dkt. 75 at 21. Today, member schools employ arbitration clauses and class action waivers; if the 2016 Rule takes effect, they will need to notify their students that they will not use these agreements; and, if the 2016 Rule is set aside, they will want to shift back to using arbitration clauses and class action waivers. To be sure, \"[i]njury to reputation can, at least at times, rise to the level necessary to support the issuance of an injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Atlas Air, Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277646\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/59/#p103\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103 (D.D.C. 2017). This, however, is not such a time. To start, the declarations from the individual schools that CAPPS submitted in support of its motion make\n   no mention of reputational harm. Moreover, the schools have a ready answer to any criticism they may face based on changes to their contracts; the changes are not a matter of whim, but rather, they are compelled by federal law. A preliminary injunction requires far more than the indefinite prospect that some students might mistakenly blame one or more CAPPS schools for the \"zigzag\" required by implementation of the 2016 Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, CAPPS argues that the arbitration and class action waiver provision \"violates the Due Process Clause through its retroactive application to current contracts\" and that a constitutional violation is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   irreparable. Dkt. 65 at 36. CAPPS is, of course, correct that \"suits for declaratory and injunctive relief against the threatened invasion of a constitutional right do not ordinarily require proof of any injury other than the threatened constitutional deprivation itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11679553,2338934\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/1342/\">\n    158 F.3d 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998). But, even assuming that this principle extends to constitutional claims of the type at issue here, the mere assertion of a constitutional violation is not sufficient to establish irreparable injury. Because the alleged irreparable injury is the constitutional violation itself, the Court must consider whether the movant has established that it \"is likely to suffer [that] harm\"-that is, the constitutional injury-\"in the absence of preliminary relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CAPPS does not come close to clearing that hurdle. It devotes just two sentences to its due process argument, Dkt. 65 at 33, and for good reason: To prevail on a due process challenge to retroactive application of an economic law, the movant must show that the government action bears no rational and legitimate relationship to the interest the government seeks to support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

Indeed, in the words of the only majority opinion CAPPS cites, \"[i]t is by now well settled that legislative Acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come to the Court with a presumption of constitutionality, and that burden is on one complaining of a due process violation to establish that the [government] has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\"\n   <em>\n    Pension Benefit Guar.

That omission, moreover, is not simply a technical error. Without any evidence about how an identified member school is likely to be affected by the provision, the Court cannot determine whether the risk is minimal or substantial, whether the prospective loss is minor or great, or whether the school may have an alternative remedy, such as an APA action. CAPPS may well be able to cure this deficiency but, on the present record, the Court is left to conclude that CAPPS has failed \"to show a substantial likelihood of standing\" and, thus, \"is not entitled to a preliminary injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court need not, however, premise its decision on this ground alone because CAPPS has also failed to carry its burden\n   of showing that a specific member-or, indeed, any member-is likely to sustain an irreparable injury if the financial responsibility provision is not preliminarily enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Irreparable Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court's conclusions with respect to injury-in-fact extend with even greater force to the question of irreparable injury. As explained above, not one of the declarations offered by a CAPPS member school so much as mentions the Financial Responsibility Provision. The Johnson and Gunderson declarations do address the provision, but they fail to show that any member will suffer any harm that is \"certain and great,\" \"actual and not theoretical,\" and \"beyond remediation.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and quotation marks omitted). Johnson and Gunderson each attest that, if the rule takes effect, \"CAPPS members w[ill] be subject to [the] triggers;\" that some CAPPS members are currently defending lawsuits, and others \"have been required to submit teach-out plans;\" that CAPPS schools \"have gainful employment programs that could become ineligible for Title IV;\" that the triggers \"would cause CAPPS members to post letters of credit;\" and that \"[o]btaining letters of credit or other financial protection\" would require schools to incur \"substantial fees and expenses,\" Dkt. 65-2 at 5 (Johnson Decl.

Dkt. 65-2 at 5 (Johnson Decl. \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to much of this, Johnson and Gunderson do not say when it is likely to occur. Each merely says, in conclusory terms and without explanation, that CAPPS members will be required to post letters of credit, but they do not indicate whether that is likely to happen in the next weeks or months or at some time years from now. Moreover, neither declaration provides any basis to conclude that any CAPPS school is likely to face a trigger that would\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   require a member school to obtain a letter of credit; they do not say, for example, that a CAPPS member has a cohort default rate in excess of thirty percent or is likely to be delisted from the exchange on which it trades. Even with respect to those triggers that simply require that the Department recalculate the school's \"composite score,\" moreover, the Johnson and Gunderson declarations fail to establish any imminent threat of irreparable harm. Johnson says, for example, that \"[m]any CAPPS schools are listed as defendants in lawsuits,\" Dkt. 65-2 at 5 (Gunderson Decl. \u00b6 21), but he does not indicate whether those lawsuits have pending motions for summary judgment or whether the size of the claim for monetary relief in any of those cases is likely to push an otherwise acceptable \"composite score\" into the range requiring the posting of a letter of credit. 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,073.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-3 at 3 (Gunderson Decl. \u00b6 12) (making similarly general assertions). Similarly, although Johnson asserts that CAPPS schools \"have been required to submit teach-out plans\" in the past, Dkt. 65-2 at 5 (Johnson Decl. \u00b6 22), he does not say that any such demand is \"likely\" in the near future or that, even if it was, that the re-calculation of that school's \"composite score\" would require the posting of a letter of credit.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-3 at 3 (Gunderson Decl. \u00b6 13) (same). And, finally, he asserts that CAPPS \"schools have gainful employment programs that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   become ineligible for Title IV,\" Dkt. 65-2 at 5 (Johnson Decl. \u00b6 23) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65-3 at 3 (Gunderson Decl. \u00b6 14) (same), but that assertion is-on its face-too speculative to support preliminary relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wis.

At oral argument, CAPPS did not dispute that the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), would provide a cause of action, but argued that \"the mere recalculation of the composite score requires notifying state agencies with possibly profound consequences\" and added that \"there [is] no guarantee the state agencies will [be willing to] wait until the outcome of\" the APA action before taking adverse action against a school with an unacceptable composite score. Dkt. 75 at 36. That concern-without evidence that any CAPPS member will likely receive an unacceptable \"composite score\" due to the operation of the 2016 Rule\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that a state agency will likely take adverse action before the school can obtain relief under the APA-is far too speculative to support a finding that any CAPPS member is \"likely\" to sustain an irreparable loss if the financial responsibility provision is not preliminarily enjoined.\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 297-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"speculative\" injury insufficient to support preliminary injunction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, CAPPS argues that the automatic triggers violate the rights of its members to procedural due process, Dkt. 65 at 41, and that any related injury is, accordingly, \"per se irreparable,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. On the present record, however, it is far from clear that an aggrieved school would lack any opportunity to contest or to refute the Department's conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,074 (discussing challenges relating to the cohort default rate);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,006 (\"an institution may show (1) that a reportable event no longer exists, has been resolved, or that it has insurance that will cover debts and liabilities that arise at any time from that triggering event; or (2) that the amount claimed in a lawsuit ... exceeds the potential recovery the claimant may receive\"). Indeed, CAPPS merely asserts that \"the ability to contest a trigger exists on very narrow grounds\" and \"only for some, not all, of the triggers.\" Dkt. 72 at 25. That may be true, but the Court cannot discern whether any CAPPS member faces an imminent threat that it will be forced to post a letter of credit based on some set of facts that might escape review under the Financial Responsibility Provision. And, even if CAPPS had shown that at least one of its members might be required to obtain a letter of credit without an opportunity to contest the Secretary's decision, it has not shown that its members have the type of interest in participating in the Title IV program that even implicates the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Accredited Cosmetology Schs. v.

Cir. 1992) (noting that a \"Program Participation Agreement confers upon member schools no legally protectible interest in ... continued eligibility\" for a Title IV program). Absent any such evidence, or argument, the Court cannot conclude that CAPPS has demonstrated that it, or any of its members, is likely to suffer an imminent constitutional injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that CAPPS has failed to carry its burden of showing that it, or one of its members, is entitled preliminarily to enjoin the Financial Responsibility Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Repayment Rate Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, CAPPS seeks preliminarily to enjoin the Repayment Rate Provision. Under that provision, \"the Secretary calculates a proprietary [school's] loan repayment rate[ ] for the cohort of borrowers who entered repayment on their [Title IV loans] at any time during the two-year cohort period.\" 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg at 76,070. If that calculation shows \"that the median borrower has not either fully repaid ... or made loan\n   payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's [Title IV loans] received for enrollment [at] the [school], the [school] must, in all of its promotional materials that are made available to prospective or enrolled students, ... include a loan repayment warning in a form, place, and manner prescribed by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,071. Unless otherwise specified in the forthcoming regulation, the warning language must provide: \"U.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To date, the Department has yet to promulgate a rule specifying the form, place and manner for the required notice. Dkt. 69 at 15 (noting that \"the Department has not yet published any notice that specifies the form, place, and manner that would be required for such warnings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CAPPS raises a host of challenges to this provision, both statutory and constitutional. It argues that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to adopt the rule; that it was adopted in violation of the APA; and that it will violate the First Amendment rights of those schools required to provide the mandated warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 65 at 31-35. Once again, however, the Court declines to reach the merits because CAPPS has failed to establish that it has standing or that it or any member faces an imminent threat of irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As with the Financial Responsibility Provision, in order to establish associational standing to challenge the Repayment Rate Provision, CAPPS must show that \"at least one specifically-identified member has suffered [or will suffer] an injury-in-fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Chemistry Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8454840,3559991\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/810/\">\n    468 F.3d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the preliminary injunction stage, this means that CAPPS bears the burden of establishing \"a 'substantial likelihood' \" that it will be able to prove that an identified member will suffer an injury as a result of the Repayment Rate Provision.\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CAPPS submitted seven declarations in support of its motion, yet only one-the Johnson declaration-even mentions the Repayment Rate Provision, and that declaration fails to meet CAPPS's burden. It merely asserts (1) that the 2016 Rule requires for-profit, participating schools, \"in certain circumstances[,] to include in all promotional materials a loan repayment rate warning,\" and (2) that \"[a]ny visitor of a school's website or reader of its promotional materials will unjustifiably view the institution[ ] as being financially unstable and ill-equipped to prepare [its] students to succeed financially upon graduation.\" Dkt. 65-2 at 6 (Johnson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30). The declaration does not identify a single member school with a repayment rate that is sufficiently low that the school faces a concrete threat that it will be required to provide the mandated notice. And, indeed, the declaration does not even posit that some unidentified member school faces such a threat. Because CAPPS has failed to offer any evidence that any specific member school is likely to be subject to the challenged provision, it has failed to carry its burden of establishing a substantial likelihood that it has standing to challenge the Repayment Rate Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Irreparable Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   CAPPS's claim to irreparable injury is on even weaker ground. To start, absent evidence that any specific CAPPS member is likely to find itself subject to the new rule, CAPPS cannot establish irreparable injury. At oral argument, moreover,\n   the Department removed any doubt regarding the risk that a CAPPS member school is likely to be harmed if the Court does not preliminarily enjoin the Repayment Rate Provision. As noted above, the 2016 Rule expressly contemplates that the Department will publish a notice in the Federal Register regarding the form, place, and manner of the required notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,071 (noting that the warning will be \"in a form, place, and manner prescribed by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register). At oral argument, the Court asked whether the Department would enforce the Repayment Rate Provision before that notice is issued, and the Department represented-in unqualified terms-that it will not take any enforcement action before the notice issues. Dkt. 75 at 122-23. That is unlikely to occur anytime soon, moreover, because the Department further represented the notice will \"go through notice and comment rulemaking,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52, and will not take effect for at least thirty days following the promulgation of a final notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff asserts three potential injuries relevant to this provision: \"reputational injury, financial harm, and deprivation of their constitutional rights.\" Dkt. 65 at 35. All of these harms, however, turn on the premise that at least one member school will be subject to the Repayment Rate Provision, and on the (incorrect) premise that the Department will enforce the provision in the near future. At oral argument, CAPPS suggested that First Amendment harms are\n   <em>\n    sui generis\n   </em>\n   and that the mere\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of future enforcement may be enough to pose an irreparable injury. Dkt. 75 at 28. But the cases that recognize that type of harm are premised on the chilling effect that a speech-regulating rule might have.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (in order to make out claim of irreparable harm, \"moving parties must also establish they are or will be engaging in constitutionally protected behavior to demonstrate that the allegedly impermissible government action would chill allowable individual conduct\"). A risk of criminal prosecution for marching in parade, for example, might dissuade plaintiffs from attending, and that chill could provide a basis for seeking preliminary relief. This case, however, is different in kind: CAPPS has failed to even identify any speech that could be chilled by the Repayment Rate Provision. In short, no substantial First Amendment issue will be presented until a member school faces some risk that it will be required to issue the warnings, and that risk is non-existent at least until the Department promulgates the required notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that CAPPS has not made the requisite showing to entitle it to a preliminary injunction with respect to the Repayment Rate Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Borrower Defense Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The final portion of the 2016 Rule that CAPPS seeks to enjoin is the Borrower Defense Provision. As State Amici note, the parties at times conflate two distinct processes. Dkt. 67 at 49. The first process is addressed in the 2016 Rule, and it amends the way in which student borrowers may assert \"defenses\" to repayment of loans made to them by the Department under Title IV,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1087e(h). Under the 2016 Rule, student-borrowers may now raise \"defenses\" to repayment affirmatively; that is, they need not default on a loan and wait to assert a defense to repayment in a collection action. 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,083. In addition, the 2016 Rule changes the standard for what constitutes a defense to repayment. In the past, student-borrowers could only invoke defenses to repayment premised on violations of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.206\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). But, under the 2016 Rule, they may now rely on a new, federal standard applicable to loans dispersed on or after July 1, 2017. 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,083. That new standard is available if (1) \"the borrower ... has obtained against the school a nondefault, favorable contested judgment based on State or Federal law in a court or administrative tribunal;\" (2) \"the school the borrower received a Direct Loan to attend failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student;\" or (3) \"the school or any of its representatives ... made a substantial misrepresentation ... that the borrower reasonably relied on to the borrower's detriment when the borrower decided to attend, or to continue attending, the school or decided to take out a Direct Loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the new Borrower Defense Provision authorizes \"the Secretary [to] initiate a process to determine whether a group of borrowers, identified by the Secretary, has a borrower defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,084.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The second process begins where the first ends and contemplates that the Department, having relieved a student-borrower, in whole or in part, of his or her obligation to repay a Direct Loan, may seek to recover the amount due from the student's school.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20685.206\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 685.206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Among other potential theories of recoupment, the 2016 Rule provides that \"the borrower is deemed to have assigned to, and relinquished in favor of, the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or the contract for educational services for which the loan was received, against the school.\" NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,353. As the Department explained in the final 2016 Rule, it intends to \"undertake any action to recover against a school under specific procedures that are being developed and will ensure an opportunity for the school to present its defense and [to] be heard.\" 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 75,960. Those procedures \"will be comparable to that provided\" under existing regulations \"for actions to find, or to limit, suspend or terminate participation of, a school;\" \"[t]he hearing will be conducted by a Department official who is independent of the component of the Department bringing the action;\" and \"[a]ny decision reached in these proceedings would be reviewable under section 706 of the APA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the 2016 Rule permits \"the school of the borrower\" to offer certain \"evidence or argument\" in the proceeding between the student-borrower and the Secretary,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 76,084, the Department has represented to the Court that it will not invoke collateral estoppel to bind the school with respect to findings made in that proceeding, Dkt. 75 at 83-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   CAPPS challenges both processes. It challenges the Department's authority to adopt the new Borrower Defense Provision and argues that, in any event, the provision is arbitrary and capricious and not the product of reasoned decision making under the APA. Dkt. 65 at 38-43. And it argues that both steps in the process violate the Due Process Clause, Article III, and the Seventh Amendment \"because Department officials are responsible for both prosecuting and hearing cases,\" and because \"agency officials\" are authorized \"to adjudicate what in essence is a private right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Once again, however, the Court declines to reach the merits of CAPPS's arguments because it has yet to demonstrate that CAPPS has standing to challenge any final rule and has not carried its burden of establishing irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standing and Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To the extent CAPPS challenges the standards and procedures applicable to the proceeding between the student-borrower and the Secretary, it has yet to show that it has standing. As clarified at\n   oral argument, that proceeding is not binding on the relevant school; it binds only the student-borrower. Dkt. 75 at 6-8. The question, then, is-if the new rules governing the process between the student-borrower and the Department are not set aside-what \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual and imminent\" injury,\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , will any CAPPS member likely suffer? Or, more precisely because we are at the preliminary injunction phase, what has CAPPS offered to show that there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that it will be able to carry its burden of proving that at least one identified CAPPS member will suffer a concrete and imminent injury?\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At least at this stage of the proceeding, CAPPS has failed to carry this burden. Notably, not one of the seven declarations that CAPPS has submitted so much as mentions the Borrower Defense Provision. Not a single school has indicated that the rule will affect its conduct in any way or that a proceeding between a student-borrower and the Secretary is likely to have any effect on the school. It is possible that CAPPS might eventually show that the proceeding between a student-borrower and the Secretary-which is not binding on the school-will cause a member school some cognizable injury-in-fact. Thus far, however, it has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To the extent that CAPPS, instead, challenges the Department's authority to bring a recoupment action against a CAPPS member school, that challenge faces both standing and ripeness difficulties.

As the Department explained in the final 2016 Rule, it is still \"develop[ing]\" procedures to govern actions \"to recover against a school\" based on loan obligations the Department decides to relieve under the new Borrower Defense Provision. 2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg at 75,960. Before such an action could commence, a student-borrower from a CAPPS member school would need to institute a borrower-defense action; the Department would need to decide that action in favor of the student; the Department would need to develop procedures governing a recoupment action; and the Department would need to bring such an action. The Court cannot discern on the present record whether-and, if so, when-a CAPPS member would be subject to a proceeding to recoup amounts foregone in a borrower-defense proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even putting this threshold difficulty aside, CAPPS has yet to demonstrate that its challenge to the recoupment process is\n   ripe for decision. To take one example, with the evidence now before it, the Court cannot determine whether the Department might seek to recover from a participating school based on a violation of the new, federal standard, or whether it would simply seek to recover based on the theory that it is subrogated to, or has been assigned, whatever rights the student borrower may have had against the school under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 76,086. To take another example, CAPPS argues that the recoupment procedure is unconstitutional because the same \"Department officials are responsible for both prosecuting and hearing cases,\" Dkt. 65 at 65, but the Court cannot evaluate that premise before the Department has finalized the rules that will govern those proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg at 75,960. Because these questions and others that bear on CAPPS's challenge remain unanswered, the Court concludes that CAPPS has not shown a \"substantial likelihood\" that it will be able to establish that the challenge is fit for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, given the undisputed availability of APA review of any final recoupment decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2016 Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 95,960, it has not shown that the association or its members will face a significant \"hardship\" if review is postponed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Irreparable Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even if CAPPS has standing to bring a ripe challenge to some portion of the Borrower Defense Provision, CAPPS makes no plausible claim to irreparable injury. As noted above, none of CAPPS's declarations even mentions the Borrower Defense Provision and, as far as the Court can discern on the current record, there is no prospect that the Department will initiate a recoupment action against a CAPPS member school in the near future. Moreover, even if the Department were to do so, CAPPS does not dispute that the Department's decision would be subject to APA review, and a harm that can be remedied under the APA is not irreparable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   At oral argument, CAPPS suggested that, even if the result of a proceeding between a student-borrower and the Secretary is not binding on the student's school, a finding by the Secretary that the student should be relieved of its obligation to repay a student loan due to a breach of contract or a misrepresentation by the school \"would obviously have a reputational damage\" to the school. Dkt. 75 at 9. That assertion, however, is once again unsupported by any evidence and is far from self-evident. Indeed, when asked at oral argument, the Department represented that its decisions in proceedings between student-borrowers and the Department will not be published in the Federal Register. Dkt. 75 at 84;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. And, although it is possible that such a decision might be subject to a FOIA request,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 84, it is speculative-at best-to suggest that a student from an unidentified CAPPS member school might someday bring a successful borrower defense claim that reflects poorly on that school; that someone would obtain that decision under FOIA or some other disclosure statute; and that the disclosure of the decision would cause the school some material, reputational damage above and beyond whatever accusations of wrongdoing are already public. At least on the present record, this theory does not demonstrate that type of \"actual and not theoretical\" harm necessary to support a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    Wis.

With respect to many of CAPPS's challenges, the Court is not convinced that the association has shown a \"substantial likelihood\" that it has standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to some challenges, that conclusion is clear, while it is less certain as to others. But, as to each of the challenges that CAPPS raises in the pending motion, it falls well short of the \"high standard for irreparable injury\" that the Court of Appeals \"has set.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 68 at 28; Dkt. 69 at 11-12. CAPPS, in turn, argues that this only serves to \"severely exacerbate[ ] the prospect of irreparable injury.\" Dkt. 65 at 22. CAPPS has not suggested, however, that any one of its member schools is likely to make this choice with respect to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Provision or any other provision they have sought to preliminarily enjoin. The Court, accordingly, does not consider whether the loss of Title IV funding would constitute irreparable harm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The declarations of all five member schools also make the qualified claim that, if they \"cannot include arbitration provisions in [their] enrollment agreements, the agreements will be difficult if not impossible to amend at a future date\" to reincorporate predispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers. Dkt. 65-4 at 2 (Casanover Decl. \u00b6 12); Dkt. 65-5 at 2 (Gourji Decl. \u00b6 12); Dkt. 65-6 at 2 (Wood Decl. \u00b6 12); Dkt. 65-7 at 2 (Second Casanover Decl. Dkt. 65-8 at 1 (Weerasuriya Decl. \u00b6 11). Again, the qualification bears consideration. The declarations notably stop short of asserting that it would, in fact, be impossible to amend the agreements at a future date, presumably because they want to keep that option open. \"Difficult\" is very different from \"impossible,\" yet the declarations offer no insight into what might be required. They do not indicate, for example, whether it would be permissible for the schools to include fallback language in their enrollment agreements that would become operative when, and if, the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Provision is set aside.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The 2016 Rule also recognizes certain \"discretionary\" triggers, which require a school to provide letters of credit when the \"Secretary demonstrates that there is an event or condition that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, or results of operations of the institution.\" Id. at 76,074 (providing a non-exhaustive list of examples, such as failure of a financial stress test and high annual dropout rates).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    To be sure, portions of CAPPS's challenge might be; to the extent CAPPS argues that the Department is entirely without authority to seek recoupment, for example, a challenge to the provision assigning the borrower's right to a loan refund to the Secretary might be fit for adjudication. But, even as to that more limited challenge, CAPPS has not carried its burden of showing that an\n    <em>\n     identified\n    </em>\n    member school faces an actual threat of injury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    CAPPS does assert in its brief that the provision will require CAPPS member schools to \"expend substantial transition costs to comply with these new regulations;\" which will cause a \"diversion of resources from schools' mission of educating students;\" and will cause a \"regulatory whiplash,\" if the Department later rescinds the rule. Dkt. 65 at 43-44. None of that, however, is supported by any evidence, nor is it self-evident that any CAPPS members will sustain any loss related to the Borrower Defense Provision in the near future.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
