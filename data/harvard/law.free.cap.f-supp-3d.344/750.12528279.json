He alleged that his disability began on July 1, 2013, the date he was injured in a car accident, when he was 33 years old. R. 10, 17, 286.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Martes's applications and Martes sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 75, 83, 85. An initial hearing was held on January 12, 2016, before an ALJ. R. 47-60. A supplemental hearing was held on June 15, 2016, before the same ALJ. R. 31-46. In a written decision dated August 22, 2016, the ALJ found Martes not disabled within the meaning of the Act. R. 7-19. On May 31, 2017, the Appeals Council denied Martes's request for review of the ALJ's decision, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-6. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Martes was represented by attorney David Levine at his hearings before the ALJ. R. 31, 47. Because the ALJ had not received any records for medical appointments occurring after May 2014 prior to the initial hearing held in January 2016, the initial hearing was limited to oral testimony from Martes as to his treatment during the period of May 2014 through January 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 50-52. Martes testified to seeing two physicians in that time: Dr. Emmanuel Lambrakis for pain management and Dr. Eli Witt for psychiatric counseling. R. 55, 56-57. He also referred to a primary care physician at Montefiore Medical Center whom he saw for referrals. R. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the June 15, 2016, hearing, Martes testified that prior to the car accident he worked in customer service at a retail store, as well as \"some delivery and moving type work,\" and maintenance. R. 36. After the accident, however, he began to experience knee, neck, and back pain. R. 37, 38-39. He felt radiating pain from his neck into his spine and his hands and arms sometimes shook due to his neck pain. R. 43. He also experienced sharp pains in his lower back, radiating \"sometimes\" to his legs. R. 43. Because of his pain, he estimated that he could stand no more than 15 minutes at a time, R. 44, and that in an eight-hour period he would spend \"most of the time ... laying down somewhere,\" R. 45. If he instead spent the time sitting, he would experience back pain. R. 45. To cope with this pain, Martes takes several medications - namely, Oxycodone, Xanax, and Motrin - that cause him to experience incoherence, difficulty walking, dizziness, and memory problems. R. 37-38. As a result of the pain and the side effects of his pain medication, he said he could no longer perform his prior work. R. 37. Martes underwent surgery on his knee, but he did not have any improvement as a result. R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   38. He turned down a recommendation that he undergo a second surgery because he did not want it. R. 38. Martes also reported seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety and trouble sleeping. R. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Martes was 36 years old at the time of the hearing. R. 35. He testified to having two children and recently living with them, though he had since moved in with his mother. R. 36, 40. He stated that he spent most of his days sleeping and reported that he is unable to take care of his children as a result of the drowsiness associated with his medications, though he used to take care of them. R. 40-41. He did not drive or perform activities of daily living, like cleaning or cooking, relying on his mother for these activities. R. 41. He also did not \"associate with public transportation\" because of the side effects from his medication. R. 42. He used to have hobbies, but no longer had any. R. 42. Instead he spends his time \"try[ing] to sleep,\" so that the effects of his medication \"wear off.\" R. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both Martes and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 1-5; Comm'r Mem. at 4-10. The summaries are substantially consistent with each other. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Jan. 10, 2018 (Docket # 16), \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court adopts Martes's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ALJ denied Martes's application for DIB and SSI on August 22, 2016. R. 7. Following the five-step test set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found at step one that Martes had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity since July 1, 2013, the alleged [disability] onset date.\" R. 12. At step two, the ALJ found that Martes had the following severe impairments: \"status post arthroscopic repair of the left knee, L4-5 disc bulge and straightening of the lumbar lordosis, disc bulges of the cervical spine at C4-C5 and C5-C6, as well as straightening of the cervical lordosis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ also noted that Martes had the \"non-severe impairments\" of high blood pressure, childhood asthma, right shoulder surgery, and \"adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed\n   mood.\" R. 13. At step three, the ALJ concluded that none of Martes's severe impairments singly or in combination met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (the \"Listings\"). R. 14-15. The ALJ considered Listings 1.02 and 1.04, determining that Martes did not exhibit the necessary medical criteria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Before moving to step four, the ALJ assessed Martes's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 14. The ALJ determined that Martes retained the RFC \"to perform sedentary work ... except [Martes] is limited to occasionally climbing, balancing, kneeling, stooping, crouching and crawling.\" R. 15-17. In making this determination, the ALJ accorded varying weights to the opinions of Dr. Seema Rai, Dr. Ksenia Pavlova, and Dr. Eli Witt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Having determined Martes's RFC, the ALJ evaluated at step four whether Martes could continue his past work \"as a maintenance worker, stocker, and youth monitor,\" concluding that he no longer could. R. 17. At step five, because the ALJ found that Martes retained the RFC to perform the \"full range of sedentary work\" with \"additional limitations [that] have little or no effect on the occupational base of unskilled sedentary work,\" the ALJ determined that the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, Rule 201.28 directed a finding of \"not disabled\" under the Act.

Following arthroscopic surgery on Martes's left knee, Dr. Sveilich diagnosed Martes with a \"[l]eft knee ACL sprain grade 1.\" R. 289.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seven weeks after the surgery, Dr. Sveilich noted that \"[p]ain was elicited at the extreme limits of the range of motion,\" and he observed tenderness on palpation of Martes's knee, but otherwise observed that Martes exhibited normal flexibility and extension of the knee, full strength with no muscle atrophy, and normal gait and stance. R. 327-28. Nine months after surgery, in May 2014, Dr. Sveilich observed that Martes experienced knee pain \"throughout the range of motion\" and that \"ambulation required crutches,\" but also found that Martes exhibited a full range of motion and had no muscle atrophy, balance issues, or gait and stance issues. R. 331. He also remarked that Martes was \"[d]oing well.\" R. 330. These relatively mild findings are consistent with the ALJ's determination that Martes suffered from no \"significant\" range of motion limitations, though he might suffer occasional pain upon motion. Dr. Sveilich's May 2014 notation supporting the use of crutches reflects ambulatory limitations, but the ALJ could have looked to Dr. Rai's February 2014 opinion that Martes's use of a cane was \"not medically necessary.\" R. 315. Dr. Rai also observed that Martes could \"walk on heels and toes without difficulty,\" was \"[a]ble to rise from [a] chair without difficulty,\" and exhibited a full range of motion in his back, knees, and neck. R. 315-16. Thus, Dr. Rai's notes and opinions support the ALJ's finding. As for Martes's testimony at the hearing, Martes testified to driving and taking care of his young child except when on Oxycodone, and did not assert any ambulatory or range of motion limitations due to knee and back pain when asked to identify his disabling symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 39-41. This testimony is consistent with the ALJ's finding that Martes experienced no range of motion limitations or ambulatory problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Martes contends his doctors observed \"limited range of motion\" and that he walked with \"an antalgic gait,\" Pl. Mem. at 8, but these remarks either were inconsistent with Dr. Sveilich's and Dr. Rai's notes, or predated significant treatment for Martes's pain. For instance, only one physician, Dr. Emmanuel Lambrakis (Martes's pain management specialist) observed that Martes walked with an antalgic gait \"due to muscle spasm on the low back,\" R. 375, but the notes of Dr. Sveilich and Dr. Rai contradict this finding. It is within an ALJ's discretion to resolve \"genuine conflicts in the medical evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Veino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n    312 F.3d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the ALJ could properly resolve those conflicts in\n   favor of the notes of Dr. Sveilich and Dr. Rai. Similarly, while Dr. Joseph Gorum noted that Martes's \"cervical range of motion is restricted and painful,\" R. 287, that observation preceded significant amounts of physical therapy as well as trigger point injections in the neck and upper back,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 281 (trigger point injections), 313 (physical therapy \"which helped\"). Given that Martes showed no restricted range of motion in his back on later exams,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 315-16, the ALJ's reasoning was supported. Martes also directs us to a disability field office examiner report that noted Martes had sitting, standing, and walking \"difficult[ies],\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 204, but it is unclear how those remarks translate into functional limitations, and in any event, the ALJ could choose to draw his conclusions from the physicians who examined Martes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The record also supports the ALJ's assertion that his treatment has been \"routine in nature\" and that \"he has shown good improvement with treatment, including good recovery after a knee surgery.\" R. 17. Following his arthroscopic knee surgery in September 2013, the operating physician, Dr. Sveilich, recommended that Martes \"cease offending physical activity,\" attend physical therapy, perform \"[h]ome exercises for strengthening\" and continue using crutches. R. 325, 328, 332, 341, 410. The recommended physical therapy consisted of biking and elliptical and strength training, R. 410, and Martes later told Dr. Seema Rai he does these exercises, as directed by his doctor, and \"uses the bike, as well as weights for his legs,\" R. 313. Dr. Sveilich noted a week after surgery and then nine months after surgery that Martes was \"[d]oing well,\" R. 324, 330, though Martes continued to report pain in his left knee, R. 330. Dr. Sveilich did recommend a second surgery because of \"patient's complaints, [the] results of [a] clinical examination with positive orthopedic findings[,] and [a] significant lack of patient's improvement to conservative nonsurgical treatment,\" R. 333; however, Martes turned down this surgery, R. 38, which in any event was to be only for the purpose of \"properly diagnos[ing] [Martes's] condition ... to provide more specific and maximal effective treatment for the patient,\" R. 333. Martes later told Dr. Rai that \"[h]e has had some improvement with previous physical therapy.\" R. 313. In the two years after Dr. Sveilich's second recommendation for surgery, the record notes on Martes condition reflect an unchanged course of \"conservative treatment,\" R. 367, consisting of the use of Oxycodone and other pain medications which he said reduced his pain,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 366-88. For his back pain, Martes's treatment was limited to pain medication and physical therapy, and one-time trigger point injections. R. 274-75, 313, 366-88. Martes argues that these records \"show [his] condition did not improve with treatment and that his severe pain and symptoms remained unchanged.\" Pl. Mem. at 9. In doing so, Martes relies heavily on the treating notes of his pain management physician, Dr. Lambrakis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Lambrakis, as Martes notes, \"frequently noted that [ ] Martes was in severe pain,\" and observed no improvement with treatment or any changes in his condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 366-87 (noting from December 2013 through March 2016 that Martes \"continues [with] severe pain on all affected areas\" and recording consistent pain levels of 8/ or 9/10).

Dr. Rai, whose opinion received \"great weight\" from the ALJ, R. 16, opined that Martes had \"no limitations,\" R. 316. Dr. Pavlova opined in July 2013 that Martes was \"partially disabled,\" R. 274, but by August 2013 Dr. Pavlova concluded that Martes was \"not disabled,\" R. 280. Last, Dr. Eli Witt, Martes's treating psychiatrist, only opined on Martes's mental functioning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 336-38.

The ALJ did not\n   refer to treating sources Dr. Sveilich, Dr. Gorum, or Dr. Lambrakis by name, but in summarizing the record the ALJ noted their reports that Martes had reported ongoing pain to them and noted their treatments or recommendations. R. 16. Martes contends the ALJ should have given controlling weight to Martes's treating physicians \"rather than to an outdated opinion from a one-time [consulting examiner].\" Pl. Mem. at 11. In so arguing, Martes makes reference only to Dr. Pavlova, Dr. Sveilich, Dr. Gorum, and Dr. Lambrakis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

The ALJ reasoned that Dr. Pavlova's July 2013 opinion merited little weight because \"it was drafted a few days after the claimant's accident that caused his alleged disability\" and thus provided only a snapshot of Martes's condition before any treatment. R. 16-17. It was also contradicted a month later by Dr. Pavlova's August 2013 opinion that Martes was \"not disabled from his previous work.\" R. 16, 280. Because the July 2013 opinion was quickly contradicted by the August 2013 opinion, and both opinions pre-dated Martes's September 2013 surgery,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 289, the ALJ reasonably concluded that the July 2013 opinion was due no more than \"limited weight,\" R. 16. Of course, an ALJ need not defer to a treating source's opinion on the ultimate issue of disability and can discount a vague opinion rendered in simplistic categories of \"total, partial, and no\" disability, as Dr. Pavlova's opinion was in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snell v.

Mem. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The record also supports the ALJ's reasons for giving \"great weight\" to Dr. Rai's February 2014 opinion that Martes \"had no limitations\" and did not need to use a cane. R. 16. As the ALJ wrote, Dr. Rai was \"an examining source who provided a full length examination and is familiar with the Agency guidelines on assessing a claimant's functioning.\" R. 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 313-17. The ALJ further noted that Dr. Rai's observations of minimal abnormalities on examination and in laboratory results were \"consistent with the claimant's complaints that support medium levels of pain but do not purport significant functional limits.\" R. 16. A review of Dr. Rai's examination confirms these observations. On examination, Dr. Rai observed that Martes could \"walk on heels and toes without difficulty,\" that he \"[n]eeded no help changing for [the] exam or getting on or off [the] exam table,\" and that he was \"able to rise from [a] chair without difficulty.\" R. 315. A musculoskeletal and neurological examination revealed nothing abnormal, though an x-ray of the back revealed straightening of the lumbosacral spine. R. 315-16, 318. These objective medical observations support Dr. Rai's finding that Martes endured no functional limitations. Moreover, as the ALJ noted, Martes had reported to Dr. Rai that he experiences constant knee pain that he would place as a six or seven on a ten-point scale, which worsens \"with bending his knee or walking for extended periods,\" but also that \"[h]e has had some improvement\n   with previous physical therapy\" and that he \"currently does exercises in the gym, as directed by his physician.\" R. 313. Martes also reported to Dr. Rai that his back pain was a three to five on a ten-point scale. R. 313. Thus, as the ALJ noted, Dr. Rai's opinion was consistent with Martes's reports of medium levels of pain that do not translate to \"significant functional limit[ations].\" R. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Rai's findings were also supported by Dr. Sveilich's observation that Martes was \"doing well,\" R. 324, 330, and the record of only mild objectively verifiable injuries,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 289-90 (Dr. Sveilich diagnosing Martes with a grade 1 ACL sprain post-operation).

Accordingly, the ALJ had no such basis for reducing the weight given to Dr. Rai's opinion. Martes's final claims are that Dr. Rai's opinion merited less weight because it was from two years before the ALJ issued his decision and thus did not include two years worth of information, Dr. Rai \"had no treating relationship with him,\" and Dr. Rai \"examined [ ] Martes only once.\" Pl.

When discussing why the ALJ believes Martes \"warrant[s] additional limitations beyond those noted in Dr. Rai's opinion,\" the ALJ cites to Martes's \"ongoing complaints,\" \"ongoing treatments,\" and \"recent treatment.\" R. 16. The ALJ also describes Dr. Rai as a consultative examiner who saw Martes only once, on February 6, 2014. R. 16. We thus believe the ALJ already accounted for these factors in her decision to give great, but not controlling weight to Dr. Rai's opinion.

In other words, the ALJ omitted additional limitations in Martes's RFC relating to the non-severe impairments because she found that the non-severe impairments did not cause greater limitations than those already included the RFC. In fact, the ALJ extensively discussed Martes's diagnosis of adjustment reaction disorder at step three of his analysis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 13-14, and discussed Martes's treating psychologist Dr. Witt's opinion concerning Martes's functional limitations when weighing the medical evidence relevant to the RFC determination, R. 17. The ALJ, however, concluded that Martes \"is mentally capable of performing substantially all unskilled jobs,\" including by \"understanding, carrying out and remembering simple instructions; us[ing] judgment; responding appropriately to supervision, coworkers and usual work situations; and dealing with changes in a routine work setting.\" R. 13. The ALJ similarly concluded that despite Martes's diagnosis for high blood pressure, \"the record supports only routine\n   treatment with no symptoms, complications or significant limitations caused by this condition.\" R. 13. Any elevated readings, the ALJ reasoned, were due to Martes's conceded noncompliance with his medication protocols.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10606037\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1033/#p1037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ further noted that Martes has no ongoing symptoms as a result of his childhood asthma and right shoulder repair.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10606037\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1033/#p1037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, given these conclusions, no limitations greater than those in the RFC were appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We also note that these conclusions are supported by the record.
