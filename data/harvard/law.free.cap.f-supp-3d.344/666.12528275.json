(\"EnyxFPGA\") and Enyx SA (\"Enyx\") alleging that Defendants used confidential information they misappropriated from Plaintiff to develop a\n   technology that is the subject of patent applications filed in the United States (the \"U.S. Patent Applications\") and Europe (the \"European Patent Applications\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgments that Plaintiff's Chief Technology Officer, Marc Battyani, is a joint inventor of the inventions described in the U.S. Patent Applications and that Plaintiff is the owner of the inventions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 39.) Plaintiff also asserts claims for the misappropriation of its trade secrets under both state and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-66.) Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's patent ownership and trade secret misappropriation claims and to stay Plaintiff's patent inventorship claim pending the outcome of a related action filed by Plaintiff against Enyx in France (the \"France Action\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants' motion is GRANTED as to the dismissal of Plaintiff's patent ownership and trade secret misappropriation claims, but DENIED as to the stay of Plaintiff's patent inventorship claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a French corporation involved in the design and marketing of financial data processing systems. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11.) Plaintiff has designed and developed a \"feed-handling\" system that processes financial data streams, such as stock exchange orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The system includes software and an electronic board that uses Field-Programmable Gate Array (\"FPGA\") integrated circuits, which are designed to treat financial data with the \"lowest latency possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The system also processes real-time market data functions in hardware, and provides processing that is faster than what is available with traditional software-based solutions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Plaintiff has been marketing its system to stock exchanges, banks, and other financial institutions since 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Edward Kodde began working as an intern for Plaintiff, which was then known as HPC Platform SA (\"HPC Platform\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) During his time as an intern and, later, as an employee, Kodde worked on the source code for Plaintiff's HPC Platform at Battyani's direction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In connection with his work as an intern, Kodde signed an HPC Platform Non-Disclosure and IP Assignment Agreement (the \"Intern Agreement\"), which assigns to Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   all intellectual property rights and know-how in and to any creation or invention developed by [Kodde] in relation to [his] internship and in particular to the Project in any form whatsoever (including in particular, technical inventions, software, computer programs, integrated circuits, designs, plans or any other technical, commercial or other documents).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Intern Agmt. \u00a7 3.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 58.) The Intern Agreement further states that\n   such rights \"shall become [NovaSparks'] property as soon as each creation or invention is developed.\" (Intern Agmt. \u00a7 3.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Intern Agreement also contains a confidentiality clause, which obligated Kodde to, among other things, \"keep HPC Platform's Confidential Information secret and confidential and not disclose it in any way to any third party\" and to \"not use the Confidential Information in any way which is detrimental to the Project or HPC Platform.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.1.1, 2.1.3.) The Intern Agreement provided that Kodde's confidentiality obligations \"remain[ed] effective until the end of the internship and for three (3) years thereafter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.3.) Additionally, the Intern Agreement contains a choice-of-law and forum selection clause, which provides, \"[t]his Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the French courts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 27, 2009, Kodde signed an HPC Platform Non-Disclosure Agreement in connection with his employment contract with Plaintiff (the \"Employee NDA\"). The Employee NDA contained a confidentiality clause imposing obligations identical to those in the Intern Agreement, and stated that such obligations \"expire[d] 24 months after the termination of the contract of employment.\" (Decl. of Michael E. Anderson dated May 23, 2018 (\"Anderson Decl.\"), Ex. 2 (\"Employee NDA\") \u00a7\u00a7 2.1.1, 2.1.3, 3.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 58.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The Employee NDA also contained choice of law and forum selection provisions identical to the ones in the Intern Agreement. (Employee NDA \u00a7 3.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2011, Kodde left NovaSparks and, together with several other former employees, formed Enyx. (Compl. \u00b6 20.) Enyx's bylaws indicate that its purpose is the \"design, manufacture, marketing, and maintenance or evolution of technical and software solutions, low-latency data processing and hardware ... applied to financial data flows and the provision of ... related services or products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that, \"in violation of his confidentiality obligations to NovaSparks, and knowing that they were the property of NovaSparks, Mr. Kodde disclosed NovaSparks' trade secrets to Enyx.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Plaintiff further alleges that Enyx knew or should have known that the information Kodde disclosed was obtained in violation of Kodde's confidentiality obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 13, 2011, after Plaintiff became aware of the existence of Enyx, Plaintiff wrote a letter to Enyx reminding Plaintiff's former employees of their confidentiality obligations and asking Enyx to respect Plaintiff's intellectual property rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Although Enyx denied infringing on Plaintiff's rights, Plaintiff subsequently discovered that Defendants were marketing a feed-handling solution and that the parties were in competing discussions with North American customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 13, 2012, with the permission of the President of the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance, Plaintiff carried out an \"infringement seizure\" on Enyx SA's premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff alleges that, during the seizure, it discovered that Enyx \"used various materials wrongfully expropriated from NovaSparks in the development of Enyx's feed handling product,\" but does not identify or describe those materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 9, 2013, Plaintiff and Enyx entered into a Settlement Agreement regarding Plaintiff's claims that Enyx had misappropriated Plaintiff's materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The Settlement Agreement states, among other things, that \"[a]s consideration for the commitments made by Enyx in article 1.1,\" which required Enyx to make settlement payments, \"NovaSparks waives the right to any legal action against Enyx ... that may be based on the facts or material found or the documents seized during the infringement seizure.\" (Settlement Agmt. art. 1 \u00a7 1.2.) The Settlement Agreement also states that \"[i]n the future, Enyx undertakes not to file patent applications for a technology that was owned by NovaSparks (that it developed itself or was acquired from a third party) before March 2011 or that obviously follows from it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 2.) Additionally, the Settlement Agreement contains a choice-of-law and forum selection clause, which states that \"[t]his [S]ettlement [A]greement is subject to French law\" and that \"the parties agree to submit any disputes related to the fulfillment and/or interpretation of this [S]ettlement [A]greement to the competent jurisdiction of the Paris Appeals Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 1, 2013, Enyx filed the European Patent Applications, which named Kodde as the sole inventor. (Compl. \u00b6 25.) Enyx subsequently filed the United States Patent Applications, which claimed priority to the European Patent Applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) A patent was issued on one of the U.S. Patent Applications on January 1, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The other U.S. Patent Applications and the European Patent Applications remain pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the \"subject matter disclosed or claimed in\" all of the patent applications was \"developed by NovaSparks employees, including Mr. Kodde, prior to March 2011.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff explains that \"each invention claimed in the U.S. Patent Applications was conceived ... by Mr. Battyani, who instructed Mr.\n   Kodde to create software code embodying his ideas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) As of February 28, 2011, the \"Apache Subversion (SVN) version control system\" that stores Plaintiff's source code contained \"source code embodying each of the inventions disclosed or contained in the U.S. Patent Applications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that, by filing the European and U.S. Patent Applications, Enyx violated the Settlement Agreement and disclosed Plaintiff's trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25-26, 51.) Plaintiff also alleges that Enyx has used and continues to use Plaintiff's trade secrets in products provided to clients in New York and New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's patent ownership and trade secrets claims based on the forum selection clause in the Settlement Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mem. at 2.) Plaintiff argues that the forum selection clause in the Settlement Agreement is permissive and that the claims involved in this action are not subject to it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Response to Defs. Mot. to Dismiss and/or Stay (\"Resp.\"), at 7-12.) Both of Plaintiff's arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Boutari\n   </em>\n   , the court found a provision stating \"[a]ny dispute arising between the parties ... shall come within the jurisdiction of the ...

By contrast, in\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , the court found a clause stating that \"legal proceedings that may arise out of [the parties' agreement] are to be brought in England,\" was mandatory because \"[t]he parties' use of the phrase 'are to be brought' establishe[d] England as an obligatory venue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047242\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/378/\">\n    494 F.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the Settlement Agreement provides, \"the Parties agree to submit any disputes related to the fulfillment and/or interpretation of this settlement agreement to the competent jurisdiction of the Paris Appeals Court.\" (Settlement Agmt. art. 8.) NovaSparks argues that this clause is similar to the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Boutari\n   </em>\n   . (Resp. at 8.) However, in\n   <em>\n    Boutari\n   </em>\n   , the parties recognized that their disputes would \"come within\" the Greek courts' jurisdiction or, in other words, that \"the [Greek courts]\n   <em>\n    have\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction\" over their claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10502558\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/51/#p53\">\n    22 F.3d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

However, the facts as alleged in Plaintiff's complaint make clear that ownership of the U.S. Patent is \"related to\" the fulfillment of Enyx's obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiff alleges that the terms of Battyani's and Kodde's employment agreements with Plaintiff obligated them to assign ownership of all inventions made during their employment to Plaintiff. Plaintiff further alleges that it is the rightful owner of the inventions described in the U.S. Patent Applications because those inventions were developed by Battyani and Kodde while they were employed at NovaSparks. Thus, Plaintiff's patent ownership claim alleges, in essence, that Enyx violated its obligations under the Settlement Agreement by filing the U.S. Patent Applications claiming ownership of \"a technology that was owned by NovaSparks (that it developed itself or was acquired from a third party) before March 2011 or that obviously follows from it.\" (Settlement Agmt. art. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although Plaintiff claims that its trade secret claims \"encompass[ ] actions independent of the obligations in the Settlement Agreement,\" the forum selection clause is not limited to claims for breaches of the Settlement Agreement. (Resp. at 11.) Rather, it covers all claims \"related to the fulfillment and/or interpretation of\" that agreement. (Settlement Agmt. art. 8.) The Settlement Agreement provided that \"[i]n the future, Enyx undertakes not to file patent applications for a technology that was owned by NovaSparks ... before 2011 or that obviously follow from it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   art. 2.) Plaintiff's complaint expressly alleges that \"[i]n violation of the [S]ettlement [A]greement, Enyx filed three European Patent Applications\" and \"[i]n violation of the [S]ettlement [A]greement, Enyx filed three U.S. Patent Applications.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Each of Plaintiff's trade secret claims further alleges that \"[b]y filing the European Patent Applications and the U.S. Patent Applications, Enyx compromised the value of NovaSparks' trade secrets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 63.) Thus, Plaintiff's trade secret claims are plainly \"related to\" Enyx's fulfillment of its obligations under the Settlement Agreement. (Settlement Agmt. art. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, in addition to the filing of the patent applications, its trade secret claims also concern Enyx's sale of products to customers in the United States, and that these alleged \"improper actions took place after the Settlement Agreement and thus could not be the subject of a release contained in the Settlement Agreement.\" (Resp. at 11.) But the\n   release clause in the Settlement Agreement is not limited to then-existing claims. The release provides that \"NovaSparks waives the right to\n   <em>\n    any legal action\n   </em>\n   against Enyx ... that may be based on the facts or material found or the documents seized during the infringement seizure.\" (Settlement Agmt. art. 1, \u00a7 1.2 (emphasis added).) Plaintiff's complaint alleges that \"[d]uring th[e] seizure\" that NovaSparks carried out on Enyx's premises, \"it was discovered that Enyx had used various materials wrongfully expropriated from NovaSparks in the development of Enyx's feed handling product.\" (Compl. \u00b6 23.) Because Enyx's trade secret claims concern the sale of that product, they are \"based on facts or material found or the documents seized during the infringement seizure, and are therefore covered by the release. (Settlement Agmt. art. 1 \u00a7 1.2.) Moreover, because claims covered by the release are plainly \"related to\" Plaintiff's obligations under the Settlement Agreement, they are also within the scope of the forum selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. LEGAL STANDARDS FOR A STAY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to moving to dismiss Plaintiff's patent ownership and trade secret claims, Defendants also move to stay Plaintiff's patent inventorship claim pending the outcome of the France Action.

Plaintiff and Enyx SA are parties to both actions. (Mem. at 19.) Although Enyx FPGA is not a party in the France Action, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enyx SA that supports sales of Enyx SA's products in the United States.

And, as Plaintiff concedes, \"there is no question that there are ... common issues of fact\" in both actions. (Resp. at 11.) Both actions concern Enyx's filing of patent applications based on information that Enyx allegedly misappropriated from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) However, Plaintiff asserts that, regardless of what discovery is conducted in the France Action, additional discovery will need to be conducted in this action, because \"France does not allow for depositions and U.S. style discovery.\" (Resp. at 12.) \"Although it can be expensive and time consuming for parties to have to litigate similar conduct in different forums, th[is] Court does not find this factor gives rise to exceptional circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Schenker A.G. v.
