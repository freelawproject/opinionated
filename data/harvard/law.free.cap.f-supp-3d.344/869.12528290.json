I find that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree that during the early morning of November 22, 2014, the plaintiff's wife called 911 and requested that the dispatcher send an ambulance to transport the plaintiff, Philip J. Tomashek, II, to the hospital. The events that followed are almost entirely in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff contends that his wife explained to the dispatcher that he needed an ambulance because he was behaving erratically. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Mot. for\n   Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Resp.\") Ex. B, at 70 [ECF No. 122-2]. The plaintiff alleges that shortly thereafter, his wife again called 911, cancelling the request for medical assistance and advising the dispatcher that she was taking the plaintiff to the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff contends that despite his wife's second call, the dispatcher sent two Raleigh County Sheriff's Office officers, A.S. Meadows and J.D. Johnson, to the plaintiff's home with lights and sirens. Pl.'s Resp. Ex. E, at 24 [ECF No. 122-5]. The officers ultimately intercepted the plaintiff before he could leave for the hospital. Through deposition testimony, the parties provide different accounts of what happened next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims that he was walking toward a guardrail to sit when an altercation with the officers began. Pl.'s Resp. Ex. A, at 70 [ECF No. 122-1]. The plaintiff recalls the officers asking him to sit in the back of the police car, though the plaintiff claims he had done nothing wrong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-78. According to the plaintiff, as he was walking to the guardrail, \"all of a sudden, [his] arm was being twisted behind [him], and [his] fingers were being bent and crunched\" by one of the officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77. The plaintiff asserts that he saw the officer reach for him and reflexively raised his hand to block the officer's reach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   All the plaintiff remembers happening next is being \"beaten\" and taken to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officers then used a taser and pepper spray.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The officers tell a different story. The officers contend that they believed they were responding to a possible domestic violence situation and that the plaintiff posed an immediate threat to the officers' safety. Defs.' Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mot.\") Ex. F, at 15 [ECF No. 117-6]. Moreover, according to Deputy Johnson, the plaintiff began aggressively \"yelling and pointing\" at his wife soon after their arrival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Deputy Johnson contends that the plaintiff ignored and refused the officers' commands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Deputy Johnson then purportedly asked the plaintiff to place his hands on the police car in order to detain the plaintiff with handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff allegedly resisted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-32. When asked what happened next, Deputy Johnson stated that he did not \"exactly remember\" how the plaintiff ended up on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Nonetheless, Deputy Johnson claims that while the plaintiff was on the ground, the plaintiff grabbed the other officer, Deputy Meadows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. It was at this point that Deputy Johnson instructed Deputy Meadows to retrieve a taser and deploy a stun to the plaintiff's thigh.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. The plaintiff was then arrested on two counts of battery on a police officer and obstructing an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties agree that, at the officers' direction, an emergency medical technician examined the plaintiff at the Raleigh County Sheriff's Office. The plaintiff was then taken into custody at Southern Regional Jail (\"SRJ\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next evening, he was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted for ten days and allegedly diagnosed with encephalopathy, acute liver injury, and acute rhabdomyolysis. Compl. \u00b6 38 [ECF No. 1]. On December 8, 2014, after his release from the hospital, the plaintiff was arraigned on two counts of battery on a police officer and obstructing an officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff later entered into a pretrial diversion agreement. Defs.' Mot. Ex. I [ECF No. 117-9]. The plaintiff successfully completed the 90-day diversion program, and all the charges against him were dismissed. Defs.' Mot. Ex. E [ECF No. 117-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this civil action, filing a twenty-count complaint against several parties. Robert Steven\n   Tanner, A.S. Meadows, J.D. Johnson, and the Raleigh County Commission (\"RCC\") are the only remaining defendants. Counts Two (Negligence), Three (Negligence), Four (Negligence), Seven (Outrage), Twelve (Battery), Fourteen (Excessive Force), Sixteen (Procedural Due Process), and Eighteen (Deliberate Indifference) remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   confronted the issue of \u00a7 1983 claims brought \"to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But if the district court determines that the plaintiff's action, even if successful, will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

This appears to be an attempt to dismiss the claim but does not comport with the requirements of Rule 41(a). Even if the court construes it as a perversely stated request for voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b), the court cannot grant dismissal. \"At this stage in the litigation, an announcement of an intention not to pursue a claim can only be construed as a concession that there is no factual basis for the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The plaintiff has failed to show, however, that his injury occurred as a result of the officers' alleged lack of knowledge of an unspecified policy, particularly in light of the extensive training both officers have received regarding the use of force, arresting persons, and providing medical care. The plaintiff argues further that the defendants violated a department policy requiring officers to report each use of force and to review each use of force. This argument likewise fails. The plaintiff has not produced any evidence-and\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   produce any evidence-that his injuries occurred as a result of the lack of a report or review, considering that the alleged failure to report or review the incident occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the altercation. Lastly, the plaintiff asserts Tanner and RCC were negligent because Johnson instructed Meadows to use a taser in violation of written policy.
