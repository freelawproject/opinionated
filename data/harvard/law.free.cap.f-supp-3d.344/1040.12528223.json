Based on a review of the file, record, and proceedings herein, the court grants M.N.B.'s motion and denies the District's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) case arises out of the District's refusal to provide transportation services to M.N.B. beyond its border.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.N.B. is an eleven year old who lives in Big Lake, Minnesota and who suffers from emotional and behavioral disorders. Admin. R. at 39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For her third and fourth grade years, the Big Lake School District placed M.N.B. at an out-of-district school - Karner Blue Education Center - so that she could receive special education services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2015, Karner Blue Education Center developed an individualized education program (IEP) for M.N.B.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40. Among other accommodations and services, the IEP included transportation \"individually to and from school\" because M.N.B. \"struggles with other students who are in close proximity to her that display vocalizations, which can be really frustrating to her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 259. Consistent with the IEP, M.N.B.'s parents drove her to and from school. The Big Lake School District reimbursed them for mileage incurred between their home and school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 263.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the fall of 2016, M.N.B.'s parents applied for open enrollment in the District, and the District accepted the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   M.N.B.'s parents and the District agreed that M.N.B. would attend North Education Center, located in yet another school district, so that she could receive necessary special education services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237. M.N.B.'s parents noted, consistent with the existing IEP, that she required individualized transportation to and from school. The District agreed to reimburse M.N.B.'s parents for mileage between the District's boundary and North Education Center, but rejected their request for mileage reimbursement between their home in Big Lake and North Education Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 311. The District did not dispute, however, M.N.B.'s need for individualized transportation. Thereafter, the parties unsuccessfully tried to reach agreement on the issue of transportation reimbursement, among other issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   id. at 329-34. Because of the ongoing disagreement, the parties were unable to fully develop an updated IEP during the 2016 school year, and the 2015 IEP effectively remained in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties then each filed due process complaints with the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 404-10, 1021-23. The District requested a determination that it is only legally obligated to transport M.N.B. between the District boundary and North Education Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1023. M.N.B. conversely argued that the District failed to provide her with a free appropriate public education (FAPE) by refusing to fully implement her IEP, which requires individualized transportation between her home and school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 408-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties both moved for summary judgment before the administrative law judge (ALJ). On March 17, 2017, the ALJ issued a comprehensive order in M.N.B.'s favor specifically determining that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [M.N.B.'s] current IEP is a stay-put\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   IEP developed in October 2015 by her then IEP team at Karner Blue Education Center. That IEP includes the necessary related service of transportation between home and school. While [M.N.B.] remains open enrolled in the District, the District is responsible for [M.N.B.'s] FAPE and therefore for implementation of the stay-put IEP. The stay-put IEP requires [M.N.B.] to be transported by the Parents and that they receive reimbursement for mileage from the District.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. The ALJ ordered the District to reimburse M.N.B. for all transportation expenses incurred to date and going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 15, 2017, the District commenced this action against M.N.B., by and through her parent, J.B., under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2), appealing the ALJ's determination and seeking a determination that it is not required under the IDEA to provide transportation services to M.N.B. between her home and school.

The District maintains that it has no obligation\n   to provide door-to-door transportation services to M.N.B. because she chose to open enroll in the District based purely on parental preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court agrees with M.N.B. and the ALJ that under the circumstances presented, the District is required to provide door-to-door transportation services to M.N.B. in order to meet its obligation to provide a FAPE to M.N.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   M.N.B.'s IEP expressly states that she requires individualized transportation between her home and school because she \"struggles with other students who are in close proximity to her that display vocalizations, which can be really frustrating to her.\" Admin. R. at 259. As a result, M.N.B.'s individualized transportation is a \"related service\" necessary to ensure that she receives a FAPE. Because the District is responsible for providing M.N.B. with a FAPE, it is necessarily responsible for providing her with specialized transportation as stated in her IEP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that J.B. made the decision to open enroll M.N.B. in the District does not undermine this conclusion or alter what M.N.B. requires in order to receive a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The District relies heavily on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals' decisions in\n   <em>\n    Timothy H. v. Cedar Rapids Community School District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577787\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/968/\">\n    178 F.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), and\n   <em>\n    Flick v.

This reliance is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, as noted, M.N.B.'s \"transportation request\" is not based on parental preference, but rather on a specific provision in her IEP that is necessary for her to receive a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Timothy H.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Flick\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Timothy H.\n   </em>\n   , the Eighth Circuit upheld a school district policy allowing students to transfer schools intra-district, but requiring that parents provide the transferring student's transportation between school and home.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577787\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/968/\">\n    178 F.3d at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record established that the request was made for personal rather than educational reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107987\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107987\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/968/\">\n    at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on\n   <em>\n    Timothy H.\n   </em>\n   , the court held that a school district does not violate the law when, in applying a facially neutral transportation policy, it rejects a request for specialized transportation based on parental convenience or preference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107987\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, however, M.N.B is not challenging an intra-district policy based on parental preference. Rather, M.N.B. is challenging the District's decision to disregard an important\n   aspect of her IEP that is necessary for her to receive a FAPE at the school the District designated her to attend. Further, this case involves the open enrollment process rather than concurrent school choices - both of which could provide a FAPE - within the same district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   M.N.B. submitted an open enrollment application in the District, as permitted under Minnesota law. Once the District accepted her application, M.N.B. became a student of the District rather than a student in her home district of Big Lake. The District thereafter became solely responsible for providing M.N.B. with a FAPE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the choice to open enroll is not the same as choosing one FAPE-providing school over another within a single school district. Indeed, expanding\n   <em>\n    Timothy H.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Flick\n   </em>\n   to the open enrollment context would allow school districts to avoid their obligation to provide a FAPE by simply establishing that the decision to open enroll was based on parental preference, which is no doubt often the case, rather than educational need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court further notes that the District's conduct in this case appears to disregard an order by the MDE requiring it to assess the need for specialized transportation on an individualized basis. At the time M.N.B. open enrolled in the District, the District had a blanket policy against providing out-of-district transportation services to open enrolled students with IEPs containing specialized transportation provisions. Admin. R. at 281. Parents of those students challenged the policy under the IDEA. On October 12, 2016, the MDE concluded that the policy violated the IDEA because it failed to determine \"on a case-by-case basis the individual transportation needs of each [s]tudent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 299. Although the District acknowledges the MDE order, its conduct as to M.N.B. appears to be consistent with the now-defunct policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the District has rejected M.N.B.'s IEP provision requiring specialized transportation based solely on the fact that she open enrolled in the District rather than based on any determination that M.N.B. does not need individualized transportation between her home and school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the above, the court finds that the ALJ correctly concluded that the District is required to provide M.N.B. with transportation services as set forth in the IEP and that its failure to do so violates its obligation to provide a FAPE to M.N.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, based on the above,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1.
