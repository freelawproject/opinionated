Plaintiffs have filed a Response (Dkt. No. 27), and Defendant has filed a Reply (Dkt. No. 28). The motion is now at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Christina and Jeffrey Terry are residents of Greer County, Oklahoma. At all times during the relevant events, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma (\"BCBSOK\") insured Plaintiffs. On January 13, 2014, Plaintiff Christina Terry gave birth to a child, G. Terry, at Great Plains Regional Medical Center in Elk City, Oklahoma. G. Terry was born premature and his lungs were not fully formed. On January 15, 2014, G. Terry's medical condition deteriorated to the point that his doctor determined that the baby needed care only available at Children's Hospital at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center (\"Children's Hospital\"). The doctor determined that G. Terry would not survive the length of an ambulance ground transfer and recommended air transfer to Children's Hospital. Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC (\"RMH\"), evacuated G. Terry by ambulance\n   air transfer to Children's Hospital. RMH does not have a contract for services with Defendant BCBSOK and is considered out-of-network and not covered by Plaintiffs' insurance plan. RMH billed Plaintiffs $49,999.00 for the air ambulance transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are insured through an individual preferred provider organization (\"PPO insurance contract\"). (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-1, pp. 1-2.) In addition to Plaintiffs' PPO insurance contract, Plaintiffs' additional policy explanations and benefits are set forth in the Schedule of Benefits for Comprehensive Health Care (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-2) and the Outline of Coverage (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 29, 2014, Defendant BCBSOK sent Plaintiffs their first EOB. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-4, p. 1.) The EOB stated: \"Your claim has been denied. We have requested additional information from your provider which is required in order to process this claim. Your claim will be processed when this additional information is received. No payment can be made at this time.\" (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-4, p. 1.) On September 4, 2014, Plaintiffs received another EOB. Defendant BCBSOK informed Plaintiffs they adjusted the total benefits approved to $2,909.92 and Plaintiffs owed the remaining $47,089.08. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-5, p. 1.) After receiving the EOB, Plaintiffs verbally appealed the determination of benefits to Defendant BCBSOK and was told \"BCBSOK would review the claim.\" (Compl., Dkt. No. 1, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 7, 2014, Plaintiffs received an EOB adjusting the total benefits approved to $4,849.86 and stating Plaintiffs owed the remaining $45,149.14. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-6, p. 1.) Plaintiffs subsequently filed a complaint with the Oklahoma Insurance Department (\"OID\") for further assistance in the matter. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs state they appealed to OID in late 2014:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I don't believe I should have to pay fifty thousand dollars to the helicopter company when I have insurance that I am paying for that should cover the cost of life saving procedures such as this. The insurance company ... should cover the helicopter ride cost. The point of having insurance is covering individuals in case of a catastrophic event happening such as this. If they aren't going to cover emergencies, then what is the point of having insurance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Compl., Dkt. No. 1, p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   RMH continued to seek payment of the outstanding bill for the air ambulance transfer and on November 13, 2014, RMH referred the matter to a collection agency, United Resource Systems, Inc., which sued Plaintiffs to recover the amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that on or about \"December 31, 2014 BCBSOK responded to the OID's inquiry regarding Plaintiffs' Request for Assistance reiterating that $4,849.86 was the total amount BCBSOK would cover and that Plaintiffs were responsible for the remaining $45,149.14.\" (Compl., Dkt. No. 1, p. 5.) Then, on December 30, 2017, Plaintiffs received a letter from Defendant BCBSOK stating that the organization had reconsidered Plaintiffs' appeal and the letter stated the claim had been processed correctly. (Compl., Dkt. No. 1-7, p. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs filed the instant action on March 27, 2018, and allege Defendant BCBSOK breached its contractual obligations, acted in bad faith and\n   allege fraud, constructive fraud, and misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II.

(Compl., Dkt. No. 1, pp. 18-21.) Defendant argues that the \"statute of limitations for both causes of action began to run ... when Plaintiffs became aware of BCBSOK's determination regarding the Air Ambulance Claim.\" (Def.'s Mot., Dkt. No. 22, p. 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, as detailed above, the dates listed in the Complaint do not make it clear the right has been extinguished and Plaintiffs allege behavior that still could fall within the prescribed statute of limitations. This Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief on their face. As a result, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss regarding Plaintiffs' bad faith claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also raises the argument that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for bad faith. \"[T]he essence of the intentional tort of bad faith with regard to the insurance industry is the insurer's unreasonable, bad-faith conduct, including the unjustified withholding of payment due under a policy....\"\n   <em>\n    McCorkle v.

Here, Plaintiffs allege Defendant has unjustifiably withheld payment for G.

Resp., Dkt. No. 27, p. 26.) Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' bad faith \"allegations consist of nothing more than conclusions that ignore the plain language of the Policy.\" (Def. Mot., Dkt. No. 22, p. 28). In this instance, construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have pled a claim for bad faith. As a result, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss regarding Plaintiffs' bad faith claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    C.
