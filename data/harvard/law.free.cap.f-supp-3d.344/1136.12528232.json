(\"EHL\")'s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 23, the \"Motion to Dismiss\"); (3) EHL's Motion to Vacate Arbitral Award (ECF No. 26, the \"Cross-Motion to Vacate\"); and (4) Pharmaniaga's Motion for Right to Attach Order and Writ of Attachment (ECF No. 43, the \"Attachment Motion\"). For the following reasons, the Motion to Confirm is GRANTED, and the remaining Motions are DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   All of the Motions arise from the London-seated arbitration titled\n   <em>\n    E*HealthLine.com Inc. v. Modern Industrial Investment Holding Group Co. Ltd. &amp; Pharmaniaga Berhad\n   </em>\n   , ICC Case No. 20125/RD (the \"Arbitration\"), in which EHL was the claimant and Pharmaniaga and Modern Industrial Investment Holding Group Co. Ltd. (\"Modern\") were the respondents. A three-member arbitral tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") presided over the Arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The procedural history of the Arbitration involved:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Significant document productions by all parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Extensive pre-hearing pleadings (with evidentiary exhibits and written fact and expert testimony) by all parties throughout 2014-2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 A five-day hearing (with opening and closing statements, live witness testimony, and cross-examination) in April 2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Post-hearing submissions by all parties on the merits in May 2016; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Post-hearing submissions by all parties on the allocation of the Arbitration's costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Arbitration concluded on November 2, 2016, when the Tribunal issued its unanimous, 174-page \"Final Award,\" which is included as an exhibit to Pharmaniaga's Motion to Confirm. ECF No. 1-2. In the Final Award, the Tribunal rejected all of EHL's claims, finding that Pharmaniaga and Modern succeeded on all \"material issues addressed by the Tribunal\" and EHL \"ha[d] not succeeded upon any of the Tribunal's Principal Issues[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the Arbitration, \"[a]ll three Parties [were] agreed\" that the Tribunal's decision on the allocation of costs \"should reflect the Parties' relative success and failure in the [A]rbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169. Applying this standard after rejecting EHL's claims, the Tribunal ordered EHL to pay for the costs of the Arbitration (including the parties' legal fees) for a total of \u00a32,000,000.00 (at a post-award interest rate of 4% per annum) and $872,953.00 (at a post-award interest rate of 3% per annum).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172. Although the Final Award awarded part of that total to Pharmaniaga and part to Modern, Modern assigned Pharmaniaga its interest in the Final Award pursuant to an Assignment of Rights Agreement dated November 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-5 (\"Assignment Agreement\") at \u00b6 5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Throughout 2016 and 2017, Pharmaniaga asked (through counsel) for EHL to pay the amounts ordered by the Final Award, but EHL refused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 (\"First Harrison Affidavit\") at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. On December 21, 2017, Pharmaniaga initiated this action to enforce the Final Award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. On February 2, 2018 and February 8, 2018, respectively, EHL filed its Motion to Dismiss and Cross-Motion to Vacate. On March 19, 2018, Pharmaniaga filed its Attachment Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Final Award Is Confirmed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pharmaniaga's Motion to Confirm, and EHL's Motion to Dismiss and Cross-Motion to Vacate, all address the question of whether the Final Award should be confirmed. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that the Final Award should be confirmed, and hereby GRANTS Pharmaniaga's Motion to Confirm and DENIES EHL's Motion to Dismiss and Cross-Motion to Vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The New York Convention Governs Confirmation of the Final Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The confirmation of the Final Award is governed by the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958 (the \"New\n   York Convention\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v.

Pharmaniaga Has Met Its Burden To Confirm The Final Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A petitioner seeking the confirmation of a foreign arbitral award satisfies its burden by submitting copies of (1) the award and (2) the agreement to arbitrate. 21 U.S.T. 2517, Art. IV. Pharmaniaga has met this burden by submitting the Final Award and the agreement to arbitrate found in the Memorandum of Collaboration (\"MOC\"), which is the same agreement to arbitrate that EHL invoked in submitting its claims to arbitration in the first place. ECF No. 1-2 at p. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. There Is No Basis To Refuse Confirmation Under the New York Convention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal law implementing the New York Convention provides that a court \"shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the [New York] Convention.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

V(1)(e). The Final Award was made in London under English law (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2 at pp. 21, 174), and EHL has not argued (or submitted any evidence) that the Final Award has been \"set aside or suspended\" by any court or other competent authority of the United Kingdom.

V(1)(b). EHL does not dispute that it participated in the Arbitration (including the document production, pre- and post-hearing submissions of pleadings and evidence, and the five-day hearing in London).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2 at pp. 12-16. In addition, EHL's counsel confirmed on the record at the Arbitration, in response to the Tribunal's question, that it had \"no grievances\" regarding the Tribunal's handling of the Arbitration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36-5 (Excerpt from the Arbitration Hearing Transcript) at pp. 163:24-165:16. \"This concession, when given the opportunity to present objections to the alleged fundamental unfairness on the record, effectively operates as a waiver of [the] argument that the arbitrators deprived [that party] of a fundamentally fair proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Urquhart v.

EHL's argument that it was \"unable to present its case\" within the meaning of Article V(1)(b) therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

EHL's principal arguments against confirmation of the Final Award are disputes with the Tribunal's credibility determinations and weighing of the evidence, which are outside the scope of judicial review in an arbitral award enforcement proceeding. Accordingly, the Court finds it appropriate to award Pharmaniaga the reasonable costs it expended to confirm the Final Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Not later than thirty (30) days following the date this Memorandum and Order is electronically filed, Pharmaniaga shall file a motion pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to address the amount of the attorney's fees and other costs it seeks.

The following excerpts further highlight the Tribunal's reasoning and justification for weighing the evidence before it against EHL. The Tribunal concluded that (1) EHL based its claims to have provided Pharmaniaga and Modern with valuable intellectual property on \"hopelessly vague, unspecific and unparticularised\" assertions, and on \"knowledge which was [not] unique to EHL\" or obvious proposals for which there was \"manifestly no special insight or analysis,\" (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 5.143, 5.149, 5.151, 5.153); (2) \"There is no case that [Pharmaniaga and Modern] misused [EHL]'s confidential information or work-product for their bilateral joint venture,\" (ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6 5.198); (3) \"Dr. Mekhamer gave evidence to the Tribunal that he must have known to be untrue, as indeed it was,\" (ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6 5.13); (4) EHL alleged that many of its supposed \"secrets\" were transmitted over the phone by Dr. Mekhamer, yet \"[d]espite [Dr. Mekhamer's] insistence that he made notes of such calls, none were provided to the Tribunal by [EHL],\" (ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6 5.162); (5) EHL \"falsified EHL Exhibits 61, 63 and 64,\" which were \"deliberately presented by [EHL] to the Tribunal as genuine in a misplaced attempt to found its claim[,]\" (ECF No. 1-2 at \u00b6 5.108);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 35 (Pharmaniaga Berhad's Opposition to EHL's Cross-Motion to Vacate) at pp. 15-16 (discussing issue of forged evidence) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    EHL appears to challenge this Court's subject matter jurisdiction.
