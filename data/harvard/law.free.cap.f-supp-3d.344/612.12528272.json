Annucci (\"Annucci\"), Deputy Commissioner Joseph Bellnier (\"Bellnier\"), Director of Special Housing and Inmate Discipline Donald Venettozzi (\"Venettozzi\"), Superintendent William F. Keyser (\"Keyser\"), Deputy Superintendent Edward Burnett (\"Burnett\"), Deputy Superintendent for Administrative Services Henry Moore (\"Moore\"), Commissioner's Hearing Officer Anthony Polizzi (\"Polizzi\"), Correctional Lieutenant Wayne Jordan (\"Jordan\"), and Correction Officer of the Office of Special Investigation Kurtis Holzapfel (\"Holzapfel\"). (Compl. (Dkt. No. 2).) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his rights under the First, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments by depriving him of\n   due process during various disciplinary proceedings, retaliating against him for filing grievances, and sexually assaulting him.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Mot. (Dkt. No. 36).) For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Complaint and the exhibits attached to it, (Compl.), and papers submitted in response to Defendants' request for a pre-motion conference, (Letter from Pl. to Court (Dec. 11, 2017) (\"Pl.'s Obj. Letter\") (Dkt. No. 22) ), and are taken as true for the purpose of resolving the instant Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the events relevant to this Action, Plaintiff was a prisoner incarcerated at Sullivan Correctional Facility (\"Sullivan\"), housed in \"the D-North Housing Block for Sensorial Disable[d] Inmates.\" (Compl. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the morning of April 16, 2015, while Plaintiff was on callout at the inmate law library, Sergeant Raykoff ordered Correction Officer (\"C.O.\") Burns to search Plaintiff's cell, \"allegedly on the basis of [c]onfidential [i]nformation from [c]onfidential [s]ources.\" (Compl. 9 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff was unable to observe the search, but Burns allegedly discovered contraband, and Plaintiff was charged with disciplinary inmate rule violations, including \"Possessing Information relating to another Inmate's Crime, Improper Legal Assistance[,] and Possession of another Inmate's Affidavit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) On April 28, 2015, Plaintiff had a Tier II Disciplinary Hearing before Defendant Jordan, a Hearing Officer, regarding these charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jordan found Plaintiff guilty as charged and imposed 30 days of keeplock confinement and corresponding loss of privileges as punishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff administratively appealed, and on May 6, 2015, the Tier II Hearing Disposition was affirmed by Captain Gary Sipple, Acting Deputy Superintendent for Security Services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 11, 2015, Plaintiff filed an Article 78 Petition in New York Supreme\n   Court seeking review, reversal, and expungement of these disciplinary charges from his disciplinary record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Plaintiff argued in his Petition that Jordan failed to give a written explanation for denying Plaintiff's request for certain witnesses to testify at the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9- 10 \u00b6 5.) The Assistant Attorney General defending against Plaintiff's Article 78 Petition, J. Gardner Ryan, read Plaintiff's Tier II Hearing record and concluded that the disposition should be administratively reversed and expunged from Plaintiff's disciplinary record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10 \u00b6 6.) He therefore contacted DOCCS, which agreed to reverse and expunge the disposition, and did not submit a response to Plaintiff's Article 78 Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Compl. Ex. C.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Article 78 case was thus closed. (Compl. Ex. B (letter from clerk of New York Supreme Court stating case is closed).) Plaintiff also filed an inmate grievance complaint and ultimately exhausted his administrative remedies regarding the Tier II Hearing deprivations. (Compl. 10 \u00b6 8; Compl. Ex. A (Central Office Review Committee Affirmance).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the afternoon of May 4, 2005, Sergeant LeConey ordered C.O. Genovese to search Plaintiff's cell. (Compl. 17 \u00b6 9.) Genovese allegedly discovered a weapon beneath the foot of Plaintiff's bed and a second weapon hidden in Plaintiff's radiator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the weapons were photographed and secured, Genovese wrote a Misbehavior Report charging Plaintiff with violating Disciplinary Rule 113.10 for possessing a weapon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was transported to a Disciplinary Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\") the same day, where he was held in a pre-hearing solitary confinement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, May 5, 2015, Plaintiff received a copy of the Misbehavior Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff also met with his assigned Employee Assistant, J. Dewitt (\"Dewitt\"), in preparation for a Tier III Disciplinary Hearing on the charges contained in the Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asked Dewitt to obtain documents and interview several potential inmate witnesses who resided in the D-North housing block and to report back on his findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff \"hoped to learn if any of the [w]itnesses had seen unauthorized persons enter his cell in his absence\" and thus \"could offer [t]estimony relevant to his [d]efense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff identified inmates Lopez, Rivera, Shobey, Ramos, Romero, Morales, and Braun as potentially relevant witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, \"[d]espite Plaintiff's clear instructions to ... Dewitt that he find out what they knew and had observed, [Dewitt] did not report back any substantive findings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18 \u00b6 11.) Instead, Dewitt \"advised Plaintiff [that] only some of the [i]nmates had agreed to [t]estify on his behalf,\" and otherwise \"provided no information concerning the [w]itnesses['] knowledge of recent unauthorized entries of Plaintiff's cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The same day, the Tier III Hearing commenced before Defendant Moore, the Hearing Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff pleaded not guilty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He then notified Moore that he was not satisfied with the assistance he received from Dewitt because, \"among other failings, Dewitt did not question potential witnesses and report back on his findings as requested,\" so Plaintiff \"could not anticipate the contents of their testimony and could not adequately prepare a defense.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff then \"outlined the contour of his defense to ... Moore.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Specifically, \"[h]e denied knowingly possessing the weapon[s] recovered from his cell and asserted that someone unknown to him had planted them there without his knowledge or consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He therefore \"wanted to establish through inmate witnesses[ ] that another party had means and opportunity to enter his cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff further explained that he \"knew better than to have [c]ontraband in his cell\" after 40 years in prison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moore agreed \"that both lines of questioning would be relevant and material to the proceedings\" but did not arrange for anyone to interview Plaintiff's requested witnesses and report back to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moore elicited testimony from three of the eight individuals Plaintiff had identified to Dewitt: Ramos, Shobey, and Romero. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 \u00b6 14.) Ramos testified that \"Plaintiff's cell was routinely left unsecured in his absence for periods ranging from 5 to 15 minutes,\" and that \"he had regularly seen other prisoners enter Plaintiff's cell while he was not present.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Shobey also confirmed that Plaintiff's cell was left open for 5 minutes, and sometimes longer, and said \"he had seen someone recently enter Plaintiff's cell while he was not there,\" but could not verify if that person was carrying a weapon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Romero similarly testified that the cell was often left unsecured for 5 to 10 minutes and that he had seen other prisoners[ ] enter Plaintiff's cell during those periods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, none of these witnesses was \"able to identify any of the unauthorized parties they had seen enter Plaintiff's cell,\" nor did any have \"firsthand knowledge if those parties had been carrying or planting weapons in the cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moore then took testimony from C.O. Jackson, who stated that \"Plaintiff's cell was generally left open for 3 to 5 minutes during movement periods,\" and C.O. Bradley, who testified that cells on the D-North Unit are generally opened \"just long enough for everyone to start migrating down to the Sally Port for [e]xit\" during movement periods, which he estimated to be about 30 seconds to a minute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20 \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As the Hearing drew to a close, Moore asked Plaintiff if he wished to call any more witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 \u00b6 16.) \"Plaintiff stated [that] he still wanted inmates Lopez, Braun, Rivera, and Morales, but was under the impression they were refusing to testify, because that is what ... Dewitt[ ] had told him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Moore admitted he knew nothing about any witness refusals, but was denying each witness just the same.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to Lopez, Moore said, \"There is nothing on here that says he agrees or [does] not agree[ ], but I am not going to call him anyway.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to Braun, Rivera, and Morales, Moore \"similarly said he didn't know of their refusals to testify, but denied those witnesses, too.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moore also denied another witness, inmate Rosario, who \"apparently had agreed to testify.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, \"Moore preemptively denied any other witnesses Plaintiff might have wanted to call,\" stating \"I'm not going to call anymore, so any other inmate witnesses I will deny unless for other reasons, unless there's another reason.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff objected, arguing that his requested witnesses were material to his defense and because he \"had not been provided with any reasons for\" Moore's decision to deny their testimony and no reasonable effort had been made to interview his witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moore then closed all testimony and adjourned the Hearing to render his disposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21 \u00b6 17.) \"Plaintiff learned that his witnesses had been denied as redundant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21 \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 27, 2015, Plaintiff was found guilty of the weapon charge and received a penalty of 365 days of punitive segregation in SHU and corresponding loss of privileges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Moore issued a written disposition stating that \"[h]e relied, in part, upon testimony from officers Bradley and Jackson that Plaintiff's cell 'is closed as soon as he is leaving the unit.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Moore wrote that \"he did not\n   believe the weapons could have been placed in Plaintiff's cell in 'a very short amount of time['] as he claimed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff timely appealed the Hearing Disposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) On July 10, 2015, Defendant Venettozzi modified the Disposition to 306 days of Disciplinary SHU and 60 days suspended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's counsel submitted a supplemental administrative appeal and Venettozzi further reduced the penalty imposed to 245 days of Disciplinary SHU and 60 days suspended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 25, 2015, Plaintiff filed an Article 78 Petition in New York Supreme Court to reverse and expunge the Disposition of his Tier III hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 \u00b6 20.) The Petition alleged that Plaintiff had been deprived of his right to Employee Assistance and to call witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 \u00b6 20.) The Petition was dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, prior to the New York court's judgment, Plaintiff filed an Inmate Grievance Complaint regarding his dissatisfaction with his Tier III Assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Central Office Review Committee responded that Plaintiff's concerns had been appropriately addressed and that it found insufficient evidence of malfeasance by staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. D.) Plaintiff also filed a similar Grievance regarding his dispute of the weapons charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 \u00b6 20) Plaintiff alleges that he exhausted all administrative remedies on October 5, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 3, 2016 at approximately 10:10 am, Plaintiff was served with an Inmate Misbehavior Report (\"MBR\") charging him with the following Inmate Rule Violations: 102.10 Threats, 104.13 Creating a Disturbance, and 107.11 Harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 \u00b6 21.) The author of the report was Defendant C.O. Holzapfel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) He wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   On the above [d]ate and approximate [t]ime, I[,] C.O Holzapfel[,] escorted ORC Alexander to deliver a SDP Talking Book to [Plaintiff] ... who was [k]eep-locked pending a [h]earing, after delivering the item to [Plaintiff], the inmate proceeded to tell ORC Alexander that he will be calling her as a witness for his [h]earing. When prompted as to why [Plaintiff] became irate and started screaming, causing my porters to stop work and take notice, [Plaintiff] was screaming [\"]because this motherfucker here wants to fuck with me. He don't know who he's fucking with,[\"] pointing towards me and yelling, [\"]Believe me you don't want this problem, it's coming.[\"] [Plaintiff] re[p]lied \"You know what's coming,\" referring to earlier threats he ... has made against my life. My area supervisor Sergeant Beach was notified of the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) On April 8, 2016, at approximately 4:00 pm, Plaintiff met with his assigned Employee Assistant, Leslie Fishman, at SHU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 16, 2016, before Plaintiff's release from SHU, Captain Sipple authorized an Administrative Segregation Recommendation against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42 \u00b6 48.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Recommendation alleged that Holzapfel feared his life would be in danger if Plaintiff returned to General Population upon his release from SHU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Recommendation further alleged that confidential informants had reported that Plaintiff made threats against Holzapfel and had been actively attempting to acquire a weapon to assault him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Sipple concluded that Plaintiff's release from SHU to General Population would place Holzapfel's life in jeopardy, and thus\n   recommended that Plaintiff be confined under Administrative Segregation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 23, 2016, an Administrative Segregation Hearing commenced before Defendant Burnett, who was acting as Hearing Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) After the Recommendation was read into the record, \"Plaintiff sought to clarify the burden of proof at the proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, he asked Burnett \"if he would be required to prove that there was no need for his confinement[,] which [Burnett] confirmed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff then objected that Burnett \"had impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from [DOCCS] to [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Throughout the Hearing, both Plaintiff and numerous witnesses confirmed that a personal conflict had existed between Plaintiff and Holzapfel over the [preceding] months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43 \u00b6 51.) Specifically, Plaintiff testified that Holzapfel had \"relentlessly harassed and threatened him leading him to write numerous Grievances and Complaints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 \u00b6 51.) He also testified that Holzapfel \"authored false and retaliatory Misbehavior Reports against him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) \"Plaintiff expressly and repeatedly denied issuing any threats to [Holzapfel] or attempting to procure a weapon,\" testifying that \"his only intended recourse in the conflict was through [j]udicial means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"No evidence was adduced at the Hearing to even suggest that Plaintiff presented a generalized threat to the [s]afety or [s]ecurity of the [f]acility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 45 \u00b6 61 (same).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Hearing concluded on June 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 \u00b6 53.) Burnett issued a written disposition invoking Administrative Segregation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He concluded that \"the relationship between Plaintiff and ... Holzapfel ha[d] deteriorated to such a degree that a physical altercation ... would be more probable[ ] if Plaintiff returned to General Population, and that [Holzapfel's] well-being would be in danger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff contends that Burnett \"plainly applied the wrong burden of proof in this proceeding\" by stating that \"Plaintiff would be required to prove that his confinement to Administrative Segregation was not necessary\" and, upon Plaintiff's objection, that Plaintiff must \"show that he would not pose a threat to ... Holzapfel if released to General Population.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44 \u00b6 56.) In other words, Plaintiff contends that Burnett was not an impartial hearing officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, because \"the sole basis\" for his Segregation was \"the individualized threat [Plaintiff] allegedly poses to a single [o]fficer,\" Plaintiff contends that \"[a]ny risk that [his] presence in General Population might present ... could be immediately and permanently solved by his transfer to another facility.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45 \u00b6 62.) Plaintiff alleges that \"[a] robust body of [s]cientific study has confirmed that extended periods of extreme isolation present [a] myriad [of] dangers to an individual's physical and psychological well-being.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 46 \u00b6 65 (same).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Beginning on June 1, 2016, Plaintiff was confined to Administrative Segregation and compelled to take medications for depression and panic attacks in order to deal with his conditions of solitary confinement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 \u00b6 66.) Plaintiff alleges that DOCCS has \"failed to provide a meaningful periodic [r]eview process that fairly considers Plaintiff's continued placement in Administrative Segregation,\" as required by DOCCS Directive 4933. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) Specifically, the reviews have been \"merely perfunctory\" and a \"sham.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) DOCCS officials \"have shown a factual lack of good faith and pretexutality,\n   regarding the nature and adequacy of the [r]eviews,\" although Plaintiff recognizes that DOCCS \"can rely on purely subjective evaluations and predictions of future behavior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47 \u00b6 69.) However, Plaintiff also alleges that he received a form indicating such a review occurred on December 7, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 \u00b6 68.) This form, attached to the Complaint, states that a determination was made to keep Plaintiff in Administrative Segregation because \"Holzapfel remains working at Sullivan\" and \"[a]ny release of [Plaintiff] would jeopardize the officer's well being\" in light of \"the threats toward\" him. (Compl. Ex. P;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. Q (upholding Administrative Segregation in a review form dated February 1, 2017); Compl. 51 (stating, on September 8, 2018, that \"[y]our Administrative Segregation status continues to be reviewed periodically to determine the need for such assignment,\" and \"[a]t this time, your present placement appears appropriate.\").) However, the alleged reason listed for why Segregation was initially deemed appropriate included credible information that Plaintiff was actively conspiring to have another inmate harm Holzapfel, which was not supported by the testimony of DOCCS officers at the hearing.

Additionally, on March 1, 2016, Holzapfel \"sexually abused Plaintiff to satisfy his homosexual proclivities by fondling Plaintiff's private parts under the pretext\" that he \"was conducting a body pat frisk for suspicion of contraband.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 \u00b6 75.)

Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Complaint and a request to proceed in forma pauperis (\"IFP\") on June 12, 2017. (Compl.; Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiff was granted IFP status on June 19, 2017, (Order Granting IFP Application (Dkt. No. 4) ), and the Court issued an Order of Service directing service on Defendants on August 11, 2017, (Order of Service (Dkt. No. 6) ). On November 13, 2017, Defendants filed a pre-motion letter indicating the grounds on which they would move to dismiss the Complaint. (Letter from Daphna Frankel, Esq. to Court (Nov. 13, 2017) (Dkt. No. 17).) The Court memo endorsed the letter with a briefing schedule on November 28, 2017. (Dkt. No. 19.) However, Plaintiff filed a letter responding to Defendants' pre-motion letter on December 14, 2017, (Pl.'s Obj. Letter), which the Court memo endorsed reminding Plaintiff of the briefing schedule already set and noting that \"Plaintiff should include all arguments in response to the motion\" in his opposition rather than file another pre-motion letter, (Dkt. No. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff also filed an application for appointment of pro bono counsel on November 15, 2017, citing difficulty with obtaining inmate legal assistance at Sullivan Correctional Facility despite his sensorial disabilities. (Application for Appointment of Counsel (Dkt. No. 18).) At the Court's direction, (Dkt. Nos. 21, 25), Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff's request, (Letter from Daphna Frankel, Esq. to Court (Dec. 18, 2017) (Dkt. No. 24); Decl. of Jessica Sircable in Opp'n to App. For Counsel (Dkt. No. 28).) Plaintiff responded to Defendant's letter and requested an extension of time to prepare a rebuttal, (Letter from Plaintiff to Court (Jan.3, 2018) (Dkt. No. 29); Letter from Plaintiff to Court (Jan. 5, 2018) (Dkt. No. 30) ), which he filed on January 17, 2018, (Resp. to Defs.' Opp'n (Dkt. No. 32) ). However, on January 24, 2018, Plaintiff filed a change of address form which listed an address not in a prison. (Dkt. No. 35.) The Court therefore directed the Parties to inform the Court \"whether Plaintiff is still incarcerated,\" and \"[i]f Plaintiff is no longer incarcerated at Sullivan, Plaintiff should explain ... why the Court should not [deny] his Motion to Appoint Counsel as moot.\" (Dkt. No. 40.) On February 9, 2018, Plaintiff wrote to the Court confirming he had been released on parole, but renewing his request for counsel, now arguing that he no longer had access to the legal assistance provided in prison; alternatively, he requested a 60 day extension of time to obtain representation. (Letter from Pl. to Court (Feb. 9, 2018) (Dkt. No. 41);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 43 (same).) On February 28, 2018, the Court denied Plaintiff's request for counsel without prejudice \"should the circumstances change.\" (Dkt. No. 45)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Meanwhile, Defendants filed the instant Motion To Dismiss and accompanying papers on January 30, 2018. (Not. of Mot.; Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. To Dismiss (\"Defs.' Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 37); Decl. of Daphna Frankel, Esq. in Supp. of Mot. To Dismiss (\"Frankel Decl.\") (Dkt. No. 38); Not. of Local Rule 12.1 (Dkt. No. 39).) On February 25, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff a sixty-day extension of time to respond to the Motion To Dismiss, but stated \"there will be no more extensions.\" (Dkt. No. 44.) Plaintiff requested an additional\n   30 day extension on March 28, 2018, (Letter from Pl. to Court (March 28, 2018) (Dkt. No. 46) ), which the Court denied, (Dkt. No. 47). On May 8, 2018, Defendants requested that the Court deem the Motion fully briefed, (Letter from Daphna Frankel, Esq. to Court (May 8, 2018) (Dkt. No. 49) ), which the Court granted, (Dkt. No. 50). However, on May 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a proposed amicus curiae brief. (Dkt. No. 53.) Defendants opposed the motion. (Letter from Daphna Frankel, Esq. to Court (June 20, 2018) (Dkt. No. 55).) The Court then denied Plaintiff's motion because the proposed amicus brief was \"irrelevant to the pending Motion [T]o Dismiss (and this Action generally),\" which \"does not concern the accommodations Plaintiff was allegedly denied at Sullivan Correctional Facility\" and \"[i]n any event, Plaintiff is no longer incarcerated there, so those claims are moot.\" (Dkt.

Holzapfel's allegations regarding Plaintiff's behavior, the reports from informants, and the testimony adduced at the hearing regarding the tumultuous relationship between Plaintiff and Holzapfel clearly constitute \"some evidence\" upon which Barrett could have reasonably concluded that Plaintiff posed a threat to prison security or safety.

However, in light of Plaintiff's pro se status, and because Burnett's name appears on the Review sheets attached as exhibits to the Complaint, the Court assumes that Plaintiff meant to bring this claim against Burnett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint, taken alone, are conclusory.

However, in combination with the attached Sixty-Day Review forms, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a procedural due process claim. The first review form, dated December 6, 2016, begins with a \"Summary report of the facility three-member committee,\" which includes Burnett. (Compl. Ex. P.) That section states that Plaintiff was initially placed in Administrative Segregation \"after credible information was obtained that [Plaintiff] was actively conspiring to either harm [Holzapfel], himself, or have the officer harmed by another inmate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, as of the review date, Plaintiff \"ha[d] acted appropriately while confined in Ad Seg.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The form also notes as \"other factors\" favoring continued confinement that \"Holzapfel remains working at Sullivan ... Any release of [Plaintiff] would jeopardize the officer[']s well being.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This decision was then affirmed by the Superintendent/Deputy Commissioner for Correctional Facilities, although the signature is illegible, \"[b]ecause of the threats toward the officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The second Sixty-Day Review form, dated February 1, 2017, is\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   to the first form, except that the Superintendent neglected to provide any reason for affirming the Committee's decision\n   to maintain Plaintiff's Administrative Segregation. (Compl. Ex. Q.) Therefore, as alleged and provided for on these forms, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Burnett and the Committee did not provide a meaningful review of whether Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    continued\n   </em>\n   confinement was justified; rather, their initial justification was \"frozen in time\" and they continued to \"rehash[ ] information addressed at [Plaintiff's] initial Ad Seg determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Proctor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128996\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/597/\">\n    846 F.3d at 610-611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
