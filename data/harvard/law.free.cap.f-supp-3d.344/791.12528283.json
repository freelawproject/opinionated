BAYLSON, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, The Center for Investigative Reporting (\"CIR\"), has moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendant, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (\"SEPTA\"), from enforcing two specific advertising standards. CIR sought to purchase advertising space in and on SEPTA buses to display its journalistic comic strip about disparate lending practices. The advertisement was rejected on the basis of SEPTA's standards at issue-specifically, because it constituted a \"political\" advertisement and expressed a position on a \"matter[ ] of public debate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the motion is denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary of CIR's position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Facts alleged in the Complaint and/or Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CIR is a nonprofit investigative news organization that, through its division called \"Reveal,\" investigated and published a report about racial disparities in the conventional home mortgage market. (Pl.'s Memo in Support of Mot., ECF 20-1 at 5, 14) (hereinafter \"Mot.\"). CIR created a ten-panel comic strip based on that report and, in January 2018, applied to have an advertisement derived from the comic placed on the interior advertising spaces of SEPTA buses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). CIR states that it \"believed that advertising on SEPTA's vehicles, which move through many neighborhoods, offered a rare opportunity to reach interested readers all across the city, including but not limited to those affected by the lending disparities its investigation had uncovered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). After reviewing the comic strip, SEPTA's licensee, Intersection (formerly Titan Outdoor, LLC), which manages SEPTA's advertising program, informed CIR that SEPTA would not accept the advertisement because \"disparate lending is a matter of public debate and litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9, 15;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 30, at 1). On February 21, 2018, SEPTA rejected CIR's advertisement under its \"2015 Advertising Standards,\" which read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Prohibited Advertising Content.\n   </em>\n   Advertising is prohibited on transit facilities, products and vehicles if it or its content falls into one or more of the following categories -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a) Advertisements promoting or opposing a political party, or promoting or opposing the election of any candidate or group of candidates for federal, state, judicial or local government offices are prohibited. In addition, advertisements that are political in nature or contain political messages, including advertisements involving political or judicial figures and/or advertisements involving an issue that is political in nature in that it directly or indirectly implicates the action, inaction, prospective action or policies of a government entity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (b) Advertisements expressing or advocating an opinion, position or viewpoint on matters of public debate about economic, political, religious, historical or social issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CIR filed its Complaint for a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech on May 2, 2018. (Compl., ECF 1). The Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed on August 17, 2018. (Pl. Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF 20). The Court allowed limited discovery prior to the hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. During the deposition of Gino Benedetti, Esq., SEPTA's General Counsel and 30(b)(6) witness, Benedetti stated that he had \"particular concern\" about two of the panels-one that displayed \"a white hand handing keys and a stick of dynamite to a black hand,\" and one that displayed \"African-Americans holding signs protesting ... and a white guy not part of the protest.\" (Benedetti Dep. 156:9-158:3). CIR claims that in response to these statements, it \"drafted an additional proposed advertisement without these design elements,\" but that SEPTA would not consider this proposal because of pending litigation. (Mot. at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Gino Benedetti, Esq. Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of its motion, CIR attached the July 18, 2018 deposition of Gino Benedetti, Esq. Benedetti stated that SEPTA has a license with an advertising company, \"Intersection,\" \"to go out and get the advertising for us, to submit advertising to our advertising department, to-if approved, to install the advertising wherever it needs to be and interact with the customers that it's serving.\" (Benedetti Dep. at 20:13-23). Intersection is the \"predominant\" way SEPTA obtains advertisements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:14-61:5). The purposes for leasing advertising space are \"to raise revenue independent of the farebox and taxpayer subsidies and to do so in a manner that provides for the safety, efficiency and comfort of our passengers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:5-10). Benedetti stated that SEPTA \"generally\" does not own bus shelters, but that at transportation hubs such as 69th Street Station and Frankford Transportation Center, SEPTA does lease space for newsstands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:4-42:16). The newsstands, according to Benedetti, are not able to sell \"some risqu\u00e9-type periodicals\" but otherwise, the content of materials sold or programs shown on televisions within those stands is unrestricted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Benedetti described the digital displays or \"infotainment systems\" on the new fleet of city buses as including advertisements, news headlines,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and information about the time and location of the stops on each bus route. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:20-30:12). According to Benedetti, Intersection subscribes to a service provided by Screenfeed, a company which curates news information from Reuters and the Associated Press. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:13-22). This information is then \"pushed\" onto SEPTA's panels and digital displays in two different formats-90 or 180 second loops. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Benedetti explained that neither Screenfeed nor Intersection determines what news to put onto the system, but rather \"Reuters and Associated Press puts out whatever they put out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:23-32:17). Although he could not say whether Intersection reviews the content before it is posted, Benedetti did state that SEPTA had not given any direction or guidance to Intersection regarding the content of the news feed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:18-22). Benedetti explained that the purpose of the newsfeed on the infotainment system is \"[t]o keep eyes on the screens, because that enhances the value of the advertising, and it draws people's attention to the system information as well.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:21-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Benedetti spoke at length about SEPTA's reasoning for amending its Advertising Standards in 2015. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   After the American Freedom Defense Initiative [\"AFDI\"] sued us sometime in 2014, I don't remember when the complaint was filed, we made an initial amendment to the advertising standards that was designed to address the concerns that were raised by that lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And really what we're trying to do was state very clearly our intention to be a nonpublic forum, and that's what that amendment did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We went through the lawsuit. We lost the lawsuit. Judge Goldberg wrote a decision about why he gave the relief to AFDI that he gave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   And we then studied that decision and made further changes to the policy .... That was a process that included legal counsel. I certainly was at the center of that process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:14-48:10). Benedetti proceeded to explain the process by which SEPTA's board adopted the 2015 Advertising Standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:11-52:16). In formulating these standards, Benedetti said that he reviewed transit authority policies in other cities, including Seattle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:20-53:13). Benedetti also explained that he considered riders' experiences when adopting the 2015 Advertising Standards, and that he was concerned about \"public outcry,\" discontent from employees, and potential vandalism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:21-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Benedetti described the process by which SEPTA determines that an advertisement violates its 2015 Advertising Standards as follows. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:6-68:5). Intersection's sales representatives, with direction from Intersection employee Jon Roche, identify advertisements that they believe might violate the 2015 Advertising Standards. Roche then sends that advertisement via email to Benedetti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jim Dellispriscolli, a SEPTA employee, also reviews potential advertisements for compliance with the 2015 Advertising Standards. Benedetti provides an additional review as he rides SEPTA every day on his way in to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Aside from these three rounds of review, Benedetti stated that there is no written guidance aside from the 2015 Advertising Standards themselves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Benedetti did not know if SEPTA posted its 2015 Advertising Standards to its website, and although he provided his own interpretation of the language used in the standards,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is unclear whether the public has access to any guidelines regarding their application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:11-13.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When asked about the contents of the proposed SEPTA advertisement specifically, Benedetti stated that he and his team had \"particular concern\" about two images-one of \"a white hand handing keys and a stick of dynamite to a black hand\" and another of \"African-Americans holding signs protesting against-the white-and a white guy not being part of the protest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156:9-258:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Benedetti also discussed many other advertisements, some of which were run by SEPTA and some of which were hypotheticals proposed by CIR's attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Victoria Baranetsky, Esq. Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties' briefing also cites to the deposition transcript of Victoria Baranetsky, Esq., General Counsel of CIR, who was deposed as CIR's 30(b)(6) designee on July 12, 2018. Baranetsky testified that the comic strip advertisement at issue was based on an investigation and report by two journalists employed by CIR, supported by an entire \"data team\" with extensive training in statistical analysis. (Baranetsky Dep. at 11:8-12:11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Baranetsky explained that there was no final artwork\n   created for the bus advertisement because SEPTA would need to \"spend significant time editing and finalizing the advertisement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:4-34:18). Although CIR never submitted a hard copy of the comic to SEPTA, it did send a hyperlink through which SEPTA could view it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:8-23). Baranetsky testified that CIR was drawn to advertising on SEPTA buses because each comic strip panel could be placed on a separate advertising panel, filling the ten total advertising panels on each bus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:4-23). Despite testifying about CIR's desire to advertise on SEPTA buses, Baranetsky did not know which bus routes CIR aimed to target, how many buses CIR wished to advertise on, or what the budget was for CIR's advertising campaign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:13-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   CIR had planned outreach events in Camden and Philadelphia to \"kick off\" its advertising campaign about the disparate lending report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:23-62:3). Baranetsky explained that the event in Camden already took place, but the event in Philadelphia had to be moved to the fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:5-63:9). Baranetsky did not testify about the details of the outreach events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:10-69:17).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the proposed advertisement was rejected by SEPTA, Baranetsky testified that the City of Philadelphia agreed to post the comic strip on bus shelters and newsstands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:23-78:22). At the time of her deposition, Baranetsky stated that the advertisements had yet to be posted by the City, and she did not know how many advertisements would be posted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is unclear whether the City imposes restrictions on those advertising spaces, and neither party has addressed why the advertisement has yet to run in those spaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Oral Argument and Supplemental Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We held oral argument on September 14, 2018, and counsel was asked a series of questions regarding outstanding factual and legal issues. CIR stated that there were no outstanding factual issues with respect to the motion for preliminary injunction. (9/14/18 Hearing Tr. at 6:11-14). CIR explained that it accepts Benedetti's testimony regarding his decision-making process, but that it challenges whether his interpretation and application of SEPTA's 2015 Advertising Standards are constitutional and consistent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:24-10:4). CIR asserted that it had met all the requirements for a preliminary injunction in its written submissions and that no further testimony was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SEPTA disagreed that there were no factual disputes at issue. According to SEPTA, questions remain about whether CIR's advertisement is an advocacy piece or \"just straight news\"; whether CIR is an advocacy or reporting agency; what reasons SEPTA had to amend its standards; and how SEPTA controls information on its infotainment systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:21-13:22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition to-and more concerning than-the outstanding factual issues identified by SEPTA, SEPTA's purposes for and administration of its amended standards\n   deserve, or require, additional explanation. CIR contends that SEPTA's reasoning for implementing its policies prohibiting speech on \"matters of public debate\" is \"just a euphemism for a ban on speech that SEPTA deems 'controversial.' \" (Pl.'s Suppl. Br. at 4). SEPTA countered at oral argument that it has \"a list of reasons\" for adopting the 2015 Advertising Standards, but we are unable to glean anything further from the evidence presented by SEPTA, including Benedetti's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There was a question discussed at oral argument as to whether CIR submitted a final advertisement to SEPTA for approval, and whether the second proposal submitted by CIR had been reviewed and responded to by SEPTA. Counsel for CIR asserted at the hearing that its Motion would cover both advertisements, and that \"if SEPTA would prefer the second rather than the first, as we believe it would, the Center would be happy to just go along with the second one.\" (9/14/18 Hearing Tr. at 19:19-25). The Court directed SEPTA to include in its supplemental briefing a response to this second advertisement, and SEPTA did so, concluding that \"the second ad submission is also barred by the same advertising standards as the first.\" (Def.'s Suppl. Br., Ex. A at 2). This exchange, coupled with Benedetti's deposition testimony, has illuminated for the Court a discrepancy in the manner in which SEPTA reviews proposed advertisements. Although Benedetti has testified that he and his colleagues at Intersection and SEPTA considered particular factors, the reasoning SEPTA employed to reject CIR's advertisement and the process it employs generally to accept or reject advertisements remain unclear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Relatedly, SEPTA states in its supplemental memorandum that it does not consider whether advertisements are \"controversial.\" (Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 7). But Benedetti testified specifically that he \"research[ed] the controversy\" surrounding Narcan when reviewing that ad for its compliance with the advertising standards. (Benedetti Dep. at 252:15-253:5). As noted above, Benedetti explained that he considers something as being \"debated in the public arena\" if \"it's something that's sort of got society's attention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, it is worth noting that although the 2015 Advertising Standards prohibit advertising that \"express[es] or advocate[es] an opinion, position, or viewpoint on matters of public debate,\" when Benedetti was asked whether an advertisement \"merely involving the matter of public debate without expressing or advocating an opinion\" would violate Substandard (b), Benedetti responded \"I don't know without seeing it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120:13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Given these various discrepancies, it remains unclear whether SEPTA's policy is in fact targeted toward controversial speech and, if not, how SEPTA could explain the difference between controversial speech and matters of public debate. Similarly, we question whether SEPTA prohibits advertisements that have as their subject issues of public debate, or rather prohibits only those advertisements that express opinions. We expect these issues to be clarified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Previous litigation involving limitations on SEPTA's advertising space\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This is not the first time SEPTA's advertising policies have been the subject of a lawsuit before this Court. Although SEPTA contends that the previous decisions involved outdated policies, no longer in effect since the adoption of the 2015 Advertising Standards, a brief review of the prior cases is relevant to the Court's analysis here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Christ's Bride Ministries v. SEPTA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    148 F.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245 (3d Cir. 1998), the Third Circuit held that SEPTA's removal of an advertisement violated the First Amendment because SEPTA had created a public forum in its advertising space and the removal of the advertisement in question did not survive strict scrutiny, nor was it reasonable even if the forum were nonpublic. Although SEPTA originally agreed to display the advertisement at issue, which stated that \"Women Who Choose Abortion Suffer More &amp; Deadlier Breast Cancer,\" SEPTA removed the poster from various stations and transit stops after receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calling its accuracy into question.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 245-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In holding that the forum was a designated public forum, the Third Circuit focused on SEPTA's intent by examining its policies and practices and the nature of the property. Because SEPTA's policies were aimed at generating revenue and promoting awareness of social issues, the forum was intended to be partly commercial and partly expressive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that SEPTA had discretion to reject advertisements for any reason did not render the forum \"not public\"-if anything, the government's reserved right to control speech without any particular standards or goals called for closer scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the record revealed no policy or practice demonstrating that SEPTA intended the forum be closed to speech on the issue of abortion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, \"[i]n its efforts to generate advertising revenues, SEPTA permitted abortion-related and other controversial advertisements concerning sexuality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the forum was closed, the Third Circuit held that SEPTA's actions were unreasonable because SEPTA did not ask the advertiser to clarify the basis for its contention after receiving the letter calling the poster into question, could not explain how its decision was related to preserving the advertising space for its intended use, and failed to implement an official policy governing the display of advertisements making contested claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287787\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/242/#p245\">\n    at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   More recently, in\n   <em>\n    American Freedom Defense Initiative [\"AFDI\"] v.

Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   CIR argues that ongoing loss of First Amendment freedoms constitutes\n   \"irreparable injury\" warranting a preliminary injunction.

CIR also asserts that it is harmed by not being able to display the advertisement in anticipation of an October 1, 2018 panel discussion where a Data Reporter from CIR will serve as a panelist and discuss its reporting. (Pl.'s Suppl. Br. at 3). In light of both of these considerations, CIR has shown irreparable harm, as monetary damages would not suffice to correct its potential injury of a violation of its First Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276310\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/173/#p180\">\n    858 F.3d at 180, n.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Balance of Equities and the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The public interest does not clearly cut exclusively in favor of CIR in this case. There is an obvious and great public interest in the free exchange of views on political, social, and economic issues that CIR desires. On the other hand, there is a strong public interest in having a viable public transportation system in a large metropolitan area, such as the greater Philadelphia area, which SEPTA serves. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Lehman\n   </em>\n   , advertising space within \"public transportation is a part of the commercial venture,\" and attracting and maintaining riders is a reasonable interest for a transit agency such as SEPTA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/\">\n    418 U.S. at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Regarding the balance of equities, both sides have presented valid arguments for this Court to consider. Of considerable importance for this decision on the preliminary injunction is the fact that, as illuminated on the September 14, 2018 hearing and explained herein, there remain a number of factual disputes and issues in this case that should be explained, and subjected to cross examination, at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Lastly, this complaint was filed on May 2, 2018, and CIR did not seek a temporary restraining order. The Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed on August 17, 2018. This is not intended as any criticism, but rather meant to highlight the fact that in moving for a preliminary injunction, some delay was necessitated in having discovery and briefing on the important issues at stake here. We are in a position where the final trial will begin in less than one week, and will be completed promptly. The Court intends to prioritize the final disposition of this case so the parties can, if they so desire, submit the issues to the Third Circuit on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
