Tardif brings a variety of state and federal claims against the City of New York (\"City\"), the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), Sergeant Thomas McManus, Police Officer Marsha Rumble, and Police Officer Felix Schmidt. At this stage in the litigation, no claims remain against Inspector John O'Connell, Deputy Inspector Edward Winski, Police Officer James McNamara, Police Officer Alena Aminova, Police Officer Kendal Creer, Deputy Inspector Daniel Mulligan, or John Doe NYPD Officers # 1-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are several pre-trial motions, namely: (1) the parties' request for clarification as to which of Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims against the City survived summary judgment (ECF Nos. 211, 215, 216); (2) Defendants' motion to preclude the testimony of Tardif's expert, Dr. Robert Goldman (ECF No. 227); (3) Tardif's motion to preclude the expert testimony of Defendants' expert, Dr. Steven Fayer (ECF No. 244); (4) Tardif's motions in limine seeking to exclude certain evidence and requesting other relief from the Court (ECF No. 246); (5) Defendants' motions in limine seeking to exclude certain evidence and requesting other relief from the Court (ECF No. 230); and (6) Tardif's motion to seal certain of her in limine papers (ECF No. 219).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the case, only the relevant filings and orders are summarized here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The parties then filed cross-motions for reconsideration. (ECF No. 190, 192.) The following claims were dismissed as to all Defendants as a result of the summary judgment motion, and the Court declined to reconsider their dismissal: (1) the \u00a7 1983 false arrest claim;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the ADA claim; (3) the \u00a7 1983 First Amendment retaliation claim; and (4) the \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 23, 2017 Op. &amp; Order (\"Reconsideration Op.\") at 8-9 (ECF No. 202); Mar. 22, 2017 Op. &amp; Order (\"Summ. J. Op.\") 3, 7, 9, 10 (ECF No. 187). In addition, all claims against the John Doe defendants were dismissed because Tardif failed to identify those defendants before the close of discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reconsideration Op. 13, 14; Summ. J. Op. 3-4, 8-9. Those claims included \u00a7 1983 claims based on excessive force and deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition, as well as state law assault and battery claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With respect to the remaining \u00a7 1983 claims based on excessive force, the Court denied summary judgment as to Sergeant McManus. Reconsideration Op. 12. Tardif withdrew her excessive force claims against Inspector O'Connell, Officer Rumble, and Deputy Inspector Mulligan. Summ. J. Op. 3 (citing Pl.'s Mem. Law Opp'n Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. 5 (ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   174) ). Accordingly, Tardif's only remaining claim for excessive force under \u00a7 1983 is against Sergeant McManus. The Court also denied summary judgment with respect to the remaining \u00a7 1983 claims for deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition and for unconstitutional confinement. Reconsideration Op. 12. Tardif brings those claims against Officers Rumble and Schmidt, based on their conduct on April 16, 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to Tardif's remaining state law assault and battery claims, the Court dismissed those claims as against Officer Creer and Deputy Inspector Mulligan, but denied summary judgment as to Sergeant McManus. Summ. J. Op. 8-9. Accordingly, Tardif's only surviving claim for assault and battery with respect to an individual defendant is against Sergeant McManus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This leaves Tardif's state law\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims against the City of New York, which are the subject of some dispute between the parties. The Court initially granted summary judgment in favor of the City on all of Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims, but on reconsideration stated that the\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim survived summary judgment \"only with respect to her underlying state law assault and battery allegation.\" Reconsideration Op. 6. The parties disagree about which \"underlying\" assault and battery allegation(s) may form the basis of Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims, and the Court ordered briefing on that issue on November 15, 2017. (ECF No. 209.) That dispute is resolved later in this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To summarize, the following claims survive for trial: (1) a \u00a7 1983 claim for excessive force against Sergeant McManus; (2) a \u00a7 1983 claim for deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition against Officers Rumble and Schmidt, based on their conduct during Tardif's April 16, 2012, term of custody; (3) a \u00a7 1983 claim for unconstitutional conditions of confinement against Officers Rumble and Schmidt, based on their conduct during Tardif's April 16, 2012, term of custody; (4) a state law assault and battery claim against Sergeant McManus; and (5) state law claims against the City of New York based on a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , with the specifics to be discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Pre-Trial Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The parties have filed several pre-trial motions. On January 9, 2018, Tardif moved to file some of her in limine motion papers under seal. (ECF No. 219.) On January 16, 2018, Defendants moved to preclude the testimony and report of Tardif's expert, Dr. Robert Goldman. (ECF No. 227.) Also on January 16, 2018, Defendants filed a motion in limine to preclude other evidence and requesting various other forms of pre-trial relief. (ECF No. 230.) On January 23, 2018, Tardif filed an amended motion to preclude the testimony of Defendants' expert witness Dr. Steven Fayer. (ECF No. 244.) Also on January 23, 2018, Tardif filed a motion in limine to preclude other evidence and requesting various other forms of pre-trial relief. (ECF No. 246.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Respondeat Superior\n    </em>\n    Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties dispute whether Tardif maintains a New York state law\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against the City for assault and battery predicated on the alleged March 21, 2012, conduct of John Doe # 8 and John Doe # 9, and the alleged April 16, 2012, conduct of Lieutenant Destefano and Officer Aminova.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The core of the disagreement\n   is a sentence in the Court's Reconsideration Opinion, which stated that Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim was preserved for trial \"only with respect to her underlying state law assault and battery allegation.\" Reconsideration Op. 6. Tardif argues that the phrase \"underlying state law assault and battery allegation\" includes all allegations in the TAC related to assault or battery. That is, Tardif argues that (1) regardless of whether the Court earlier dismissed an assault and battery claim with respect to an individual defendant, she maintains a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against the City predicated on the conduct on which that (dismissed) claim was founded, and (2) regardless of whether she alleged an assault and battery claim against a given individual, she maintains a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against the City predicated on that individual's conduct. Defendants contend that Tardif's only remaining\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim is predicated on the alleged March 21, 2012, conduct of Sergeant McManus. They argue that any other potential\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim was dismissed by the Court's Reconsideration Opinion. In the alternative, they argue that because the Court dismissed all federal claims premised on the March 21, 2012, conduct of John Does # 8 and # 9 and the April 16, 2012, conduct of Lieutenant Destefano and Officer Aminova, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any putative state law\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim based on those incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The details of Tardif's assault and battery allegations and their procedural history are helpful to understanding the parties' dispute. In the TAC, Tardif alleged that on March 21, 2012, John Doe # 8 forcefully pushed Tardif in the chest with his baton, causing Tardif to fall backward. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 77, 204. John Doe # 9 then allegedly grabbed Tardif at the neck and waist, picked her up, and tossed her to the ground.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    \u00b6 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on these allegations, Tardif asserted claims for assault and battery under New York state law against John Does # 8 and # 9.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 204-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to Tardif, \"it is undisputed\" that John Doe # 9 is Mattera. Pl.'s Reply Mem. Regard Respondeat Superior (\"Pl.'s Respondeat Superior Mem.\") 3 (ECF No. 216). However, Tardif never named Sergeant Mattera as an individual defendant in this suit. Tardif's assault and battery claims against John Does # 8 and # 9 were dismissed for failure to timely identify those individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summ. J. Op. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Tardif also alleged that during her arrest on April 16, 2012, Lieutenant Destefano and Officer Aminova grabbed her by her hair and slammed her head against the pavement and against a brick wall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 107, 110.

Initially, the Court dismissed all of Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims against the City because it viewed the TAC as predicating the City's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability on Tardif's \u00a7 1983 claims. Summ. J. Op. 11.

However, in deciding the parties' subsequent cross-motions for reconsideration, the Court explained that despite Tardif's \"deficient pleading,\" her\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims should not have been dismissed because (1) Defendants did not address Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims in their summary judgment briefing, and (2) the record reflected Tardif's intention to seek\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability with respect to her New York state law claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reconsideration Op. 5-6.

When the Court revived Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim, the only state law assault and battery claim remaining against an individual defendant was Tardif's claim against Officer McManus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court's rationale for allowing Tardif to maintain her\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim based on state law assault and battery applies equally to the allegations of misconduct by John Does # 8 and # 9, Lieutenant Destefano, and Officer Aminova. First, Defendants did not address any of Tardif's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims in their summary judgment motion. Therefore, Defendants never moved for summary judgment on\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims based on the relevant March 21, 2012, conduct, or the April 16, 2012, conduct. Second, throughout the litigation, Tardif has demonstrated her intent to bring\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims predicated on the actions of John Does # 8 and # 9, Lieutenant Destefano, and Officer Aminova. In its Reconsideration Opinion, the Court held that Tardif's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Summary Judgment evinced Tardif's intent to bring\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims\n   predicated on state law assault and battery. That memorandum describes Tardif's intent to seek\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability for the assaults and batteries by NYPD officers, and explicitly references the March 21, 2012, and April 16, 2012, incidents in the context of the\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 174, at 16. Accordingly, contrary to Defendants' contention, the Reconsideration Order does not bar Tardif from asserting these state law\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims. This conclusion is bolstered by the Second Circuit's view that district courts should construe complaints liberally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marbury Mgmt., Inc. v.

In Dr. Goldman's expert report, he first describes Tardif's life up until the 2012 protests, and then recounts Tardif's account of her participation in the Occupy protests, including the \"psychological injuries\" she allegedly sustained as a result of\n   Defendants' conduct. Decl. Stefan H. Krieger, Ex. 1 (\"Goldman Report\") 2-4 (ECF No. 257).

Although Dr. Goldman acknowledges that Tardif \"initially suffered with PTSD\" as a result of other traumas, he concludes that her March 17, 2012 and April 16, 2012, arrests and the April 16, 2012, alleged denial of medical attention \"are what currently render [her] traumatized [and] faced with great difficulty in her daily functioning.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to his diagnosis of Tardif, and his conclusion that her PTSD was exacerbated by Defendants' conduct, he also proposes to testify that \"the symptoms of PTSD can increase the likelihood that individuals may unwittingly place [themselves] in harm's way of another traumatic event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants argue Dr. Goldman should be precluded from testifying because (1) he is not an expert in PTSD; (2) he did not review Tardif's psychiatric records from prior to January 2012 and in his report he does not explain how he was able to differentiate the PTSD linked to Tardif's arrests and alleged maltreatment, in contrast to the PTSD linked to earlier events in Tardif's life; and (3) his proffered testimony simply reiterates Tardif's experiences at the Occupy protests and therefore will not be helpful to a jury. Defendants also raise for the first time on reply that Dr. Goldman relied on inapt psychological literature in forming his opinion that individuals with PTSD are at an elevated risk of reexposure to trauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

According to his curriculum vitae (\"CV\"), Dr. Goldman is a licensed psychologist. Goldman Report 14. He received a doctor of psychology degree in school-community psychology from Hofstra University in New York in 2004.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also received a J.D. from Touro College in in New York in 1992.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goldman's advanced degree in psychology and his psychologist license suggest that he has broad background knowledge in mental health and mental conditions; however, Tardif fails to direct the Court to any record evidence describing the content of Dr. Goldman's psychology training or explaining the state licensure requirements, both of which would have been helpful to the Court in making findings on Dr. Goldman's potential qualification as a psychological expert. According to Dr. Goldman's CV, he has presented at eleven conferences, but the titles of the lectures given suggest several of the presentations were on legal topics, not psychology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. In addition, his CV lists three publications, but it is not clear whether they have anything to do with psychology.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Finally, the CV does not indicate that he has any specific education or training related to PTSD, and Dr. Goldman has never been qualified to testify as an expert in a case involving PTSD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Brachah Goykadosh Ex. B (\"Goldman Dep.\"), at 9:6-7 (ECF No. 231).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In addition to his academic credential in psychology, Dr. Goldman also has some\n   experience treating individuals with PTSD. At the time Dr. Goldman examined Tardif, he had been a supervising psychologist at the Suffolk County Mental Health Unit for just over one year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Goldman Report 13. Dr. Goldman estimates that ten to twenty percent of the jail inmates he sees in his role as the supervising psychologist for the Suffolk County Mental Health Unit have some form of \"PTSD traits or actual PTSD.\" Goldman Dep. at 17:8-17:10. Dr. Goldman appears to have indicated at his deposition that he sees ten to fifteen patients per day at the jail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl. Stefan H. Krieger Ex. 2, at 17:1 (ECF No. 257). Based on this statement, Tardif speculates that Dr. Goldman has seen at least 208 patients with PTSD in his career.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Opp'n Defs.' Mots. Lim. (\"Pl.'s Daubert Opp'n\") 4 (ECF No. 260). Tardif also points to Dr. Goldman's professional experience \"providing] therapy, therapeutic visitations, individual counseling, and forensic evaluations\" but fails to explain how these experiences are relevant to Dr. Goldman's expertise diagnosing mental conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. She leaves the Court to infer what these experiences actually entail. Prior to his role as a supervising psychologist at the Suffolk County Mental Health Unit, Dr. Goldman was a supervising psychologist at the Suffolk County Department of Probation for just under eight years. Goldman Report 13. This may be relevant to Dr. Goldman's qualifications, but again, Tardif fails to provide record evidence of what Dr. Goldman's role entailed, or to explain how these experiences demonstrate Dr. Goldman's qualifications to diagnose mental conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nonetheless, although Tardif's development of the record leaves something to be desired, Dr. Goldman is qualified to testify on the issue of PTSD. His advanced education in psychology and his work experience qualify as \"specialized knowledge\" gained through \"experience, training, or education\" within the meaning of Rule 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702. Moreover, the \"liberal thrust\" of the Federal Rules of Evidence and their \"general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to opinion testimony counsels in favor of admissibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    509 U.S. at 588-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p589\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted).

The Court agrees in part. Specifically, for the reasons explained below, Dr. Goldman's opinion as to his diagnosis of Tardif's current mental disorders is based on reliably applied, well-accepted methodology in his field and is therefore admissible. But his conclusion that these disorders were caused (or \"exacerbated,\" to use Tardif's term) by Defendants' conduct\n   during the Occupy, rather than by earlier traumas in Tardif's life, involves \"too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered,\" and is therefore unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Gen.

Dr. Goldman's expert report, and his deposition testimony, fail to explain the basis for his conclusion that Defendants' conduct, and not other traumatic experiences in Tardif's life, caused her current injuries. As Defendants point out, Dr. Goldman did not review any of Tardif's pre-2012 mental health records, despite his awareness that plaintiff [redacted] and other traumas before 2012. Accordingly, Dr. Goldman's causation opinion is based on Tardif's 2014 account of her conditions, which she provided during the pendency of this litigation, and her 2012 medical records. In response to the question of whether Tardif's prior psychiatric records were necessary to a proper psychological evaluation, Dr. Goldman stated that \"it would have been helpful but I still felt comfortable what I with given with what I had.\" Goldman Dep. 98:12-13. The expert \"feel[ing] comfortable,\" without more, is not a sound methodology under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   Although differences in symptomology could perhaps provide a basis for a sound causation opinion, in this respect Dr. Goldman states vaguely that \"the symptomatology that [Tardif] reports to have is different than what she had\" as a result of [redacted] Goldman Dep. 121:1-4 (emphasis added). But Dr. Goldman does not indicate how he determined the substance of Tardif's earlier symptoms, other than through Tardif's own accounting of her disorders. This renders his opinion on causation unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The court is aware that the absence of a differential diagnosis is not always fatal to an expert's causation opinion. In\n   <em>\n    Matthews v. Hewlett-Packard\n   </em>\n   , Judge\n   Batts surveyed the caselaw in this district and found that in some instances, courts have admitted causation testimony in the absence of a differential diagnosis. Specifically, a differential diagnosis may not be required (1) when the expert is plaintiff's treating physician; (2) when the link between the injury and its cause is obvious to even a lay person, such as with a car accident and a broken leg ; and (3) when there are \"other sufficient indicia of reliability,\" such as literature reviews, reviewing medical records, and interviews with the plaintiff.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206804075\">\n    2017 WL 6804075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4-5. Neither of the first two categories applies here, and \"other sufficient indicia of reliability\" are lacking, given Dr. Goldman's failure to opine on Tardif's pre-2012 psychiatric records or explain his reliance on Tardif's accounting of her conditions. Moreover, when faced with the weaknesses in Dr. Goldman's expert opinion, Tardif provided no further useful evidence on the question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tchatat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347527\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/315/441/#p445\">\n    315 F.R.D. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 446 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (noting that while it may be \"understandable\" for an expert to fail to explain his methodology in his initial report, \"there is no justification for the fact that the defendants, when confronted in plaintiffs moving papers with this claimed defect in methodology, declined to offer any admissible evidence on the question\"). Instead, Tardif rests on the argument that she seeks only to have Dr. Goldman show that Defendants' conduct \"exacerbated\" her PTSD, not that their conduct caused it. Pl.'s Daubert Opp'n 9. Therefore, in her view, Dr. Goldman need not consider any information about Tardif's pre-2012 mental health.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. This parsing is unhelpful.

He specifically opines that her willing participation in the protests and continued return to the site of the protests \"is not consistent with her having [PTSD].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 30. He also opines that based on his observations of Tardif, she did not demonstrate symptoms of PTSD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Dr. Fayer's report, Tardif's only symptom of PTSD is her complaint that she suffers from nightmares (which he, of course, could not verify independently).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiff's argument, Dr. Fayer's failure to undertake a differential diagnosis does not render his opinion inadmissible. A differential diagnosis is relevant when an expert opines on causation. Here, because Dr. Fayer concludes that Tardif does not exhibit symptoms consistent with PTSD at all, the concept of causation is irrelevant to his opinion. Tardif's argument that Dr. Fayer's conclusion conflicts with those of Dr. Goldman or Tardif's other doctors does not render his opinion unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mirena IUD Prod.

Tardif argues that the probative value of this evidence is low because she is willing to stipulate that she experienced PTSD and received mental health treatment prior to January 2012. She further contends that the records will cause undue confusion and delay because she will need to present evidence explaining why Defendants' conduct-not other events-resulted in an exacerbation of her PTSD.

Tardif's MIL # 3: Past Recreational Drug Use\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Tardif moves to preclude all testimony regarding her past use of recreational drugs, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Court agrees that testimony about Tardif's past recreational drug use has little, if any, probative value. Neither party alleges that Tardif was under the influence of drugs at the time of the relevant incidents. Moreover, Defendants offer no explanation for how the drug use is relevant to Tardif's damages. Defendants argue that testimony on Tardif's past drug use \"relate[s]\" to her PTSD claim, and specifically that their expert, Dr. Fayer, \"considered\" Tardif's drug use in crafting his expert report. Mem. Law Opp'n Pl.'s Mots. Lim. 3 (ECF No. 256). But Dr. Fayer's expert report mentions the drug use only in passing when it summarizes Tardif's medical records, and Defendants do not provide any other reason for offering testimony on Tardif's past drug use. Accordingly, for these reasons, Tardif's motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Tardif's Motion # 4: Paving Stone Dimensions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Tardif asks the Court to take judicial notice under Fed. R. Evid. 202 that (1) New York City regulations require the hexagonal paving stones used in city parks to be 8 inches between parallel sides, and (2) that the stones in the photograph in Tardif's Trial Exhibit 31 are that size. Exhibit 31 is a photograph taken at Union Square Park on March 21, 2012, depicting Sergeant McManus and Tardif, along with other police officers and unidentified protestors. Pl.'s Notice Mots. Lim. Ex. 5 (ECF No. 246). In support of this motion, Tardif directs the Court to two sets of City regulations. First, the 2016 City of New York Parks and Recreation Tree Planting Standards (\"Tree Standards\") state that \"[a]ll pavement or pavers must conform to Department of Transportation (DOT) standards (Refer to DOT for materials and specifications).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p421\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6, at 7-8. Second, \u00a7 3.1.7 of the New York City Department of Transportation Street Design Manual (Updated 2015) (\"Street Design Manual\") states that the size of hexagonal asphalt paver stones is \"8 inches between parallel sides.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343001\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/396/#p421\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Tardif has not offered any proof that these standards and regulations were in effect at the time when the park was paved. Nor has Tardif offered any evidence\n   showing that the stones in Union Square Park conform to the City's standards. Therefore there is no basis for taking judicial notice of the size of the Union Square Park stones. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the request to judicially notice the size of the paving stones. With respect to Tardif's request that the Court judicially notice the Tree Planting Standards and the Street Design Manual, the Court DENIES this request without prejudice to renewal if Tardif can demonstrate their relevance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion # 5: NYPD Communications Division Staff Member\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Tardif moves to preclude testimony from \"an NYPD Communications Division staff member,\" whom Defendants list on their proposed witness list, because Defendants did not identify the individual in their initial disclosures as required by Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1). The staff member is expected to testify to the contents of the \"SPRINT Report,\" which is an NYPD document that was properly disclosed to Tardif.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n 7. Defendants concede that they have no explanation for why this witness was not disclosed in a timely manner, but argue that there is no prejudice to Tardif in allowing the testimony. Because Tardif fails to demonstrate prejudice from Defendants' failure to disclose this witness in compliance with Rule 26, this motion is DENIED without prejudice to renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Tardif's MIL # 6: Stipulation of Uncontested Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Tardif asks the Court to compel defendants to stipulate to the facts set forth in Exhibit 10 to their Notice of Motions in Limine, relying on Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Among other things, Plaintiff proposes the parties stipulate that the officers described in the TAC are NYPD employees and were acting in the scope of their employment during the events complained of, that certain individuals were present at the Occupy protest on April 16, 2012, and to facts related to Tardif's health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Notice Mots. Lim, Ex. 10. Tardif cites no authority from this Circuit suggesting that the Court has the power to order this relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mots. Lim. Mem. 11. At least one Circuit court that considered the issue held that Rule 16\"does not authorize a court to force parties to stipulate facts to which they will not voluntarily agree.\"\n   <em>\n    J. F. Edwards Const. Co. v. Anderson Safeway Guard Rail Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1029232\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/542/1318/#p1322\">\n    542 F.2d 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1322 (7th Cir. 1976). Although the Court encourages the parties to stipulate to undisputed facts so as to avoid unnecessary proof, it will not order Defendants to make stipulations at this time. This request is therefore DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Tardif's MIL # 7 and 8: Witnesses' Names\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Tardif moves to require both parties to refer to Tardif's witness, formerly known as James Amico, as Mari Tade Storm Summers, and to use the pronouns \"she,\" \"her,\" and \"hers\" when identifying or addressing Ms. Summers at trial. Tardif makes the same request with respect to her witness, formerly known as Tony Zilka, and now known as Mandy Quinn. Defendants do not contest this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Law Opp'n Pl.'s Mots. Lim. 13. (\"[D]efendants have no objection to referring to these witnesses-and any person-by whatever name and pronoun they prefer.\"). Therefore, the motion is DENIED as MOOT. Defendants do, however, raise the concern that the use of masculine pronouns or names may be necessary for clarity when referring to the 2012 events that are the subject of this suit, for example if Ms. Summers and Ms. Quinn are asked to identify themselves in video footage of the events. As a general matter, the parties\n   are required to use witness's preferred pronouns and names. The parties should use great caution and limit any use of witnesses' 2012 names to those that are necessary to avoid confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Tardif's MIL # 9: Trial Director Software\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, Tardif moves to use \"Trial Director Software\" to project exhibits at trial. A motion in limine is not the appropriate vehicle for this request. To the extent Tardif wishes to use software that differs from the usual audiovisual technology employed by litigants, Tardif is directed to contact the audiovisual staff at the courthouse. Accordingly, this motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Defendants' Other Motions in Limine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendants have filed several motions in limine seeking to preclude certain evidence and requesting other relief from the Court. (ECF No. 230.) The Court addresses each below, adopting the numbering used in the parties' Proposed Joint Pre-Trial Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 224 at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' MIL # 1: Evidence on Failed Theories of Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants' first motion in limine includes four separate requests. The Defendants' first two requests are to preclude Tardif from introducing evidence concerning failed claims and from testifying about alleged damages arising from failed claims. Tardif has stipulated that she will not argue any failed theories of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. Supp. Defs.' Mots. Lim. (\"Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem.\") 2 n.2 (ECF No. 232); Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n Defs.' Mots. Lim. (\"PL's Opp'n Defs.' Mots. Lim.\") 12 (ECF No. 266). Accordingly, these motions are DENIED as MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendants' request to preclude testimony related to any police officer other than McManus, Rumble, or Schmidt (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem. 5) is also DENIED. In this Opinion and Order, the Court holds that at trial, Tardif may assert\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims against the City based on the conduct of John Does # 8 and # 9 on March 21, 2012, and the conduct of Officer Aminova and Lieutenant Destefano on April 16, 2012. Accordingly, Tardif may present evidence on those claims, which may include testimony related to those individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Defendants' motion to instruct the jury that Tardif's April 16, 2012, arrest was lawful, is DENIED without prejudice to renewal. This motion is more appropriately addressed as part of Defendants' proposed jury charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' MIL # 2: Referring to Tardif's Counsel as Students or Interns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from referring to her legal counsel as students or interns and to preclude Tardif from referring to the Hofstra Law Clinic, arguing that this could cause the jury to forgive weaknesses in Tardif's case due to sympathy for the law students' novice status. Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem. 6-8. The Court agrees this is a valid concern. Moreover, the involvement of law students and of the Hofstra Law Clinic is not relevant to the issues of liability or damages. Tardif barely contests this motion, stating only that she \"has no intent to introduce evidence\" on the matter and that she \"believes the Court is in the best position to determine whether the jury should be informed\" of the status of Tardif's attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mots. Lim. 5-6. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to preclude Tardif from referring to her legal counsel as students or interns and to preclude\n   Tardif from referring to the Hofstra Law Clinic is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' MIL # 3: Using the Terms \"City of New York\" and \"City Attorneys\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from referring to defense counsel as City attorneys, from including the City of New York in the caption to this action on the verdict sheet, and from referring to any alleged New York City Police Department policy or practice, arguing that there is no claim for municipal liability in this action. Because the City is a defendant in this action, this motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendants' MIL # 4: The NYPD Patrol Guide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from offering the NYPD Patrol Guide into evidence, arguing that any violation of the Patrol Guide is irrelevant to whether Tardif's constitutional rights were violated. Although Defendants rely on Fed.R. Evid. 402 and 403 for this motion, all of their arguments relate to relevance. Tardif's excessive force claim will require a jury to consider whether the conduct of the Defendants was unreasonable. The NYPD Patrol Guide is relevant to the question of whether the Defendants behaved reasonably.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collado v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 11 CIV. 9041 (DAB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204533772\">\n    2017 WL 4533772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2017) (Batts, J.) (collecting cases, and acknowledging that \"a violation of the Patrol Guide is not necessarily a violation of constitutional rights\" but is nonetheless relevant to an excessive force claim). Therefore, because the Patrol Guide is relevant and its probative value is not outweighed by prejudice or delay, Defendants' motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Defendants' MIL # 5: Specific Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sergeant Mattera and Officer Destefano\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Sergeant Mattera and Officer Destefano from testifying on the ground that they lack personal knowledge related to the claims in this case. This motion is DENIED because the Court holds in this Opinion and Order that Tardif may assert\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims against the City based on the conduct of John Does # 8 and # 9 (the latter identified as Mattera) on March 21, 2012, and the conduct of Officer Aminova and Lieutenant Destefano on April 16, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Mandy Quinn, Daniel Shockley, Stephanie Shockley, and Maxine Dade\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendants initially argued that the testimony of Mandy Quinn,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Daniel Shockley, Stephanie Shockley, and Maxime Dade should be precluded because Tardif failed to provide contact information for these witnesses, in violation of Rule 26(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In their Reply papers, Defendants conceded that Tardif did, in fact, provide this information. Reply Mem. Law Supp. Defs.' Mots. Lim. (\"Defs.' Mots. Lim. Reply\") 7 (ECF No. 269). Defendants nonetheless contend for the first time on reply that the testimony should be precluded because Tardif allegedly violated other aspects of Rule 26. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(i) provides, in relevant part, that a party is obligated to disclose to the opposing party \"the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information-along with the subjects of that information-that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses.\" Where a party fails to comply with Rule 26(a), the \"party is not\n   allowed to use that... witness ... at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants first contend that Tardif violated Rule 26 by failing to disclose the subject of the discoverable material possessed by these witnesses. Defs.' Mots. Lim. Reply 7. But Defendants do not point to any prejudice that resulted from this alleged omission. Accordingly, even assuming Tardif failed to disclose the subject of the discoverable material, that omission was harmless and does not warrant preclusion under Rule 37(c)(1). Defendants alternately argue that the testimony should be precluded because Defendants were \"unable to get in touch with [the witnesses].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Defendants' inability to reach Tardif's proposed witnesses, without more, does not provide a basis for a Rule 26 violation. Absent such a violation, preclusion of testimony is not warranted under Rule 37(c)(1). Defendants also raise the argument that \"it is not clear\" whether any of these individuals have personal knowledge of the events giving rise to Tardif's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Defendants argument is speculative at this stage. At trial, if the witnesses testify to matters outside of their personal knowledge, Defendants may object on that ground. Defendants' motion to preclude the testimony of Mandy Quinn, Daniel Shockley, Stephanie Shockley, and Maxime Dade is therefore DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In a footnote, Defendants request permission to depose Quinn, the Shockleys, and Dade, if the Court denies Defendants' motion to preclude those individuals' testimony.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   19 n.4. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) provides that a discovery schedule \"may be modified only for good cause and with the judge's consent.\" During the discovery phase of this case, Defendants had the names and contact information for these individuals, and had ample time to seek Court assistance, if needed, in contacting them. Trial is now imminent. Defendants offer no explanation for their failure to pursue discovery from these individuals prior to the close of discovery. Therefore, Defendants' request to depose Mandy Quinn, Daniel Shockley, Stephanie Shockley, and Maxime Dade is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Defendants' MIL # 6: Tardif's Use of Depositions in her Case in Chief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from offering deposition testimony of ten NYPD employees, arguing (1) Tardif should be required to have those individuals testify in court because the Second Circuit has a \"preference\" for live testimony; and (2) in some instances, the testimony is not relevant because it pertains only to dismissed claims. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32 provides that depositions may be offered in lieu of live testimony in certain circumstances. Defendants do not dispute that those circumstances are met here. But, as Defendants indicate, there is a \"well-established\" and \"sensible\" preference for live testimony in this Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re:Gen. Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-MC-2543 (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204493863\">\n    2016 WL 4493863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2016) (Furman, J.) (noting the potential for juror boredom when depositions are played in court). Although that preference is shared by this Court, because Rule 32 does not bar the use of deposition testimony under these circumstances, the Court will not compel Tardif to call the witnesses live. Further, given the Court's ruling that the\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claims predicated on the alleged March 21, 2012, assault by John Does # 8 and # 9 and the alleged April 16, 2012, assault by Lieutenant Destefano and Officer Aminova survive for trial, Defendants' relevance argument fails, at least in the aggregate version they presented in\n   their briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem. 19-20. Therefore, the motion is DENIED without prejudice to raising particular objections at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Defendants' MIL # 7: Causation of Tardif's Seizures or Medical Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from offering evidence relating to the cause of her seizures or to \"medical damages,\" the latter of which the Court takes to refer to medical expenses related to her seizures and/or her epilepsy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Tardif has stipulated that she will not mention her epilepsy or seizures when testifying about March 21, 2012, and will not introduce testimony about the purported exacerbation of her epilepsy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.2. She also states that does not seek damages based on the causation of her seizures. Pl.'s Opp'n Defs.' Mots. Lim. 20.

Defendants' MIL # 8: Tardif's Status as a Medic\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from testifying about or introducing any evidence related to Tardif's training or activities as a \"medic,\" arguing that such information is irrelevant or will mislead the jury into thinking Tardif possesses some expert knowledge, skill, or training. Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem. 23. Tardif argues that testimony on this topic will help the jury understand why, even after her alleged PTSD was exacerbated by Defendants' conduct, she nonetheless returned to the site of the protests-that is, she wanted to provide medical support to the protesters. To the extent that Defendants argue that her return to the protests shows that her alleged PTSD was not exacerbated by the Defendants' conduct, this testimony could refute that argument. This motion is therefore DENIED without prejudice to Defendants raising particular objections at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' MILs # 9: Defendants' Interactions with Other Arrestees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Defendants move to preclude testimony or argument about Defendants' interactions with other arrestees, relying on Fed. R. Evid. 402 and 403. Because Defendants' argument is vague and unspecific, this motion is DENIED without prejudice to Defendants raising particular objections at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Defendants' MILs # 10 and 11: Other Instances of Alleged Police Actions Related to Occupy Wall Street and Unrelated Police Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from eliciting testimony or arguing about other instances of alleged police actions related to the Occupy Wall Street movement, or about other police actions generally. Because Tardif has stipulated that she will not elicit testimony or argue about other instances of alleged police misconduct against persons other than herself, this motion is DENIED as MOOT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mots. Lim. Mem. 2 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    K. Defendants' MIL # 12: What Defendants Could or Should Have Done\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from offering testimony on what she believes Defendants could or should have done. Defendants' argument on this point is speculative; they point to no specific testimony that Tardif plans to offer on this topic. Moreover, what the Defendants could or should have done may be relevant to the question of whether the individual defendants acted reasonably. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED without prejudice\n   to Defendants raising particular objections at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    L. Defendants' MIL # 13: Questioning Defendants about the Appropriate Conduct for \"Human Beings\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defendants move to preclude Tardif from questioning Defendants on the appropriate way to treat \"human beings,\" arguing that the topic is not relevant. Defendants note that when Tardif deposed Officer Rumble, Tardif asked Officer Rumble whether he was concerned about Tardif, since she is another human being.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. Brachah Goykadosh Ex. G at 160:22-25 (ECF No. 231 Ex. 7). However, Tardif has not designated that deposition testimony for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Proposed Deposition Excerpts (ECF No. 236). Accordingly, this objection is premature because Tardif has not sought to introduce testimony on this topic.
