Therefore, it remanded the matter to the Secretary for further consideration and clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On remand, the Secretary again denied plaintiff's flight gate waiver request. Presently before the Court is plaintiff's second motion for summary judgment, in which plaintiff argues that the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in his denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant has filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that the Secretary's decision is entitled to deference, and that it was in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After reviewing the parties' motions, including the attachments thereto, the administrative record, and the relevant authorities, the Court will grant defendant's motion for summary judgment, and plaintiff's motion will be denied. While plaintiff is understandably chagrined by the decision, given all of the circumstances, the Court cannot conclude that there is any basis to overturn this decision that fell within the Secretary's discretion to make.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Governing Law and Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"A member of a uniformed service\" is entitled to \"aviation career incentive pay ... for the frequent and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty required by others.\" 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 301a(a). Aviation Career Incentive Pay (\"ACIP\") is \"restricted to regular and reserve officers who hold, or are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating or designation and who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 301a(a)(2). Under this statute, \"an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties ... for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer\" to be eligible for continuous monthly incentive pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 301a(a)(4). The \"screening point at the end of specific periods of aviation service (normally at the 12 and 18-year marks) used to determine eligibility for continuous ACIP\" is called a \"flight gate.\" Secretary of the Navy Instruction 7220.87 (\"SECNAVINST\") Enclosure (1), \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Secretary of the Navy \"may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements\" for at least six years of aviation service. 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 301a(a)(5) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SECNAVINST 7220.87 \u00b6 4 (\"The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 authorized the Secretary of the Navy ... to waive ACIP flight gate requirements for aviators who are unable to meet their flying gates due to reasons beyond their control.\"). This action is typically called a \"flight gate waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SECNAVINST 7220.87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once a request for a waiver has been submitted, the waiver package is routed through the chain of command to the Secretary of the Navy. SECNAVINST 7220.87 \u00b6\u00b6 5(b), (d). Once the waiver package is received by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs), \"the flight gate waiver request package will be reviewed for content, validity, and rationale and forwarded to [the Secretary of the Navy] with a recommendation to approve, disapprove, or to be returned to Navy or Marine Corps for further action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 14. Plaintiff successfully moved to sever the charges, and he was subsequently acquitted of aggravated assault, but convicted of aggravated sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Plaintiff was sentenced to total forfeiture of pay and allowances, two years confinement, and a dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. He appealed the conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the court found that his second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-30. On April 23, 2012, the court set aside the conviction and sentence and dismissed the charge with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 9, 2014, plaintiff requested a waiver of the flying requirement necessary to achieve the \"Gate 1 flight gate\" and retain his ACIP. Admin. Record [Dkt. # 34] (\"AR\") at 1556-57. The request summarized his flight data, showing that he had achieved a total of 72 months of flying (\"MOF\") out of the necessary 96. AR 1556. On his waiver application, he attributed his inability to meet the flying requirement to the unconstitutional conviction, and stated that but for those circumstances, he \"would have been able to accumulate the 23 months of flying duty required\" to reach Gate 1. AR 1557. The Marine Corps endorsed plaintiff's request, AR 1554-55, and on February 21, 2014, the Deputy Commandant, Manpower and Reserve Affairs (\"M &amp; RA\"), sent an action memo to the Secretary of the Navy \"strongly recommend[ing] approval.\" AR 1551. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (M &amp; RA), though, sent an action memo to the Secretary recommending disapproval of the application, in which he noted that plaintiff was set to be discharged because he twice failed to achieve promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 1514-15; AR 1547. On April 15, 2014, the Secretary denied plaintiff's request for flight gate waiver. AR 1513; AR 1550.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 4, 2014, plaintiff submitted a second request for a waiver of the MOF requirement. AR 1450-52. Again, the Marine Corps endorsed the request, and the Deputy Commandant recommended approval. AR 1446-49. This time, the Assistant Secretary's action memo to the Secretary stated that plaintiff's \"waiver request [was] within norms and appropriate,\" and that plaintiff was no longer facing a discharge. AR 1442-43. But on February 12, 2015, the Secretary of the Navy disapproved plaintiff's second request for a flight gate waiver. AR 1439. The Secretary did not set forth any reasons for his decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 18, 2016, plaintiff filed his second amended complaint in this lawsuit, challenging three decisions made by the Secretary of the Navy, only one of which is relevant here: the claim that the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the second request for the flight gate waiver. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57\n   (Count 1). Both parties moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 35]; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 37]. After reviewing the record, the Court found that because the Secretary did not provide a \"rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,\" the decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , 251 F.Supp.3d at 156-57. The Court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment as to this count, and on May 1, 2017, remanded the decision to deny plaintiff's ACIP flight gate waiver request to the Secretary of the Navy for further consideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 19, 2017, the Secretary of Navy denied plaintiff's request for ACIP flight gate waiver for a third time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Secretary of the Navy Memo [Dkt. # 56-1] (\"Sec'y Memo\"). The Secretary found that \"approving this request does not meet the needs of the service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. He stated that \"Captain Stewart's entitlement to ACIP ended when, upon reaching 12 years of service, he had not completed 9 years of prescribed operational flying duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To be eligible for a waiver, one must have not less than six years of qualifying service, and the Secretary observed that plaintiff had barely met the requirement because he had completed only six years and fifteen days of aviation service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, according to the Secretary, plaintiff's qualifying duties are almost three years short of the statutory entitlement to ACIP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Secretary observed that plaintiff's failure to accumulate the necessary experience was not entirely attributable to the pendency of the criminal proceedings, and he pointed to the fact that plaintiff \"was not in flight status\" between June 5, 2008 and September 18, 2009, and between April 12, 2012 and November 4, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Finally, the Secretary observed that he was not inclined to exercise his discretion to grant a waiver because plaintiff's personnel records revealed that plaintiff has consistently ranked in the bottom two-thirds of his peer group and has been evaluated as performing better than only about 18% of his peers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 24, 2018, plaintiff moved for summary judgment claiming that the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law in rendering his decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 55] (\"Pl.'s Mem.\"). On June 15, 2018, defendant opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 56] (\"Def.'s Mem.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings and evidence show that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that] the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

While the Secretary's previous decision lacked any explanation, AR 1439, here the Secretary has explained in detail why he\n   decided to deny plaintiff's request for a flight gate waiver, and his decision is entitled to great deference. Plaintiff argues, though, that the Secretary's decision should be vacated and remanded for three reasons: 1) the Secretary acted contrary to law, applicable regulations, and this Court's order when he asked the Deputy Commandant for a new recommendation without returning the case to the chain of command; 2) the Secretary erred as a matter of law when he failed to address plaintiff's assignment history; and 3) the Secretary's analysis of plaintiff's personnel records was based on unreliable factors. These arguments fail for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Secretary was not required to obtain new chain of command endorsements on remand.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the fact that the Secretary sought a fresh recommendation from the Deputy Commandant (M &amp; RA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   after the remand, and he argues that this somehow contravened the Court's order to reconsider plaintiff's request. Pl.'s Mem. at 12-13. But plaintiff does not cite to any rule or support for his contention that the Secretary cannot exercise his discretion to obtain another recommendation from a subordinate to aid in his decision-making process. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has recognized that a decision-maker may gather additional information on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PPG Indus., Inc. v.

Navy regulation states that \"packages forwarded to SECNAV for approval must be endorsed by the chain of command.\" SECNAVINST 7220.87 \u00b6 5(d). A plain reading of the regulation indicates that the chain of command requirement is not a requirement that the\n   <em>\n    Secretary\n   </em>\n   must fulfill in making his decision. Rather, it is a requirement that the\n   <em>\n    member\n   </em>\n   must fulfill before his application can be reviewed by the Secretary. AR 1465. Here, plaintiff fulfilled that requirement, and the package was endorsed by the chain of command. AR 1446-49. Thus, when the Secretary solicited a new recommendation from the Deputy Commandant, he was not obligated to return the case to the chain of command. Further, there is no indication that, in soliciting a new recommendation from the Deputy Commandant, the Secretary did not consider the full record that included the previous endorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Deputy Commandant's new recommendation\n   should have been reviewed by the Assistant Secretary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 14, citing SECNAVINST 7220.87 \u00b6 5(e) (\"Once received at [the Assistant Secretary of the Navy], the flight gate waiver request package will be reviewed for content, validity, and rationale and forwarded to SECNAV....\"). This rule appears to address the handling of requests moving up the chain from a member, and it is not clear that it has any applicability to a request that has already proceeded through those channels and has been specifically remanded to the Secretary by a court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But, even if one were to conclude that the regulations called for a return to the chain of command or to the Assistant Secretary, that error was not prejudicial.

The record returned to the Secretary on remand contained the original endorsement of plaintiff's chain of command, as well as the approval of the Assistant Secretary. Plaintiff does not specify how returning the application through the chain of command would have changed the result, nor does he identify any reason why the Assistant Secretary needed to weigh in again. And, the Secretary's ultimate decision did not refer at all to the Deputy Commandant's recommendation, to which plaintiff objects.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Sec'y Memo. The Secretary's decision relied entirely on independent bases for denial, such as the plaintiff's assignments before and after the conviction and reversal (which did not include qualifying flight time), the amount of qualifying time he has served in flight status, and his personnel records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.

Therefore, the Court finds that even if the agency committed procedural error, this error was not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Secretary's alleged failure to address plaintiff's assignment history does not render his decision arbitrary or capricious.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"the Secretary ignored the facts of plaintiff's assignment history and whether the assignments were beyond plaintiff's control.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the record reflects that the Secretary did not ignore the circumstances that kept plaintiff from flying or fail to consider whether the assignments were beyond plaintiff's control. The decision explicitly refers to plaintiff's \"conviction and later acquittal of criminal misconduct,\" and the Secretary did not predicate his decision on any failure to fly during that time period. Sec'y Memo \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. He explained that he was not persuaded that plaintiff would have been able to meet the required flight time even without this intervening event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (declining to \"speculate about how the Marine Corps would have assigned Captain Stewart\" and considering plaintiff's assignments before his sentencing and after the reversal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, it is in the Secretary's discretion to determine whether a flight gate waiver would meet the needs of the service. As prescribed by paragraph 4 of SECNAV Instruction 7220.87, \"the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), for the needs of the service\" is authorized \"to waive ACIP flight gate requirements for aviators who are unable to meet their flying gates due to reasons beyond their control.\" And section 301a(a)(5) states that the Secretary \"may permit\" such waivers \"on a case by case basis.\" 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 301a(a)(5). Plaintiff suggests that because the reasons he could not meet the flight gate were beyond his control, he should have been granted a waiver. But, the statute and regulation do not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the Secretary to issue a waiver in such a situation; he may deny an application if it does not meet the needs of the service, so long as he articulates the reasons for the denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leavitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559685,3674342\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/1/\">\n    460 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Secretary has done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, the Secretary's explanation here does not \"run[ ] counter to the evidence before the agency.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 17. The Secretary reviewed plaintiff's conviction and the reversal by the appeals court, balanced that information with plaintiff's personnel records and the amount of qualifying flight time he has fulfilled, and found that the circumstances did not warrant a flight gate waiver:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Given the totality of the facts pertaining to Captain Stewart's ACIP waiver request, I have determined a waiver does not meet the needs of the service, and his request is denied. Captain Stewart barely meets the requirements of [ 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 301a ] to submit a waiver request, is nearly three years short of qualifying service for statutory ACIP entitlement, and neither the content of Captain Stewart's waiver request nor the results of my qualitative review of his personnel records provided me with adequate reason to grant a waiver in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Sec'y Memo \u00b6 6. The fact that the Secretary did not accord the reversal of plaintiff's conviction the weight that plaintiff believes it is entitled to receive does not render the decision arbitrary or capricious since it was accompanied by a \"reasoned evaluation of the relevant information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.
