First, Plaintiff's argument that he was unaware of the constitutional inadequacy of the presiding ALJ while the case was at the administrative level is unavailing. Although the administrative process in\n   <em>\n    Jones Brothers\n   </em>\n   predates the current case, the\n   <em>\n    Jones Brothers\n   </em>\n   plaintiff noted a \"circuit split\" on the issue of the appointment of ALJs while its case was still at the administrative level. In contrast, current Plaintiff\n   failed to raise, much less develop the Appointments Clause issue at the administrative level although the split in authority occurred long before the application for benefits was considered by the Appeals Council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, while Plaintiff claims that she did not receive an opportunity to make a constitutional challenge at the administrative level, she did not challenge the validity of the ALJ's appointment in either her prehearing brief, at the hearing. or before the Appeals Council. In defense of her failure to raise the level at the administrative level, Plaintiff cites an August 6, 2018 Social Security memorandum stating that ALJ's are \"not to respond\" to constitutional challenges to their appointments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the same memorandum states that such challenges may be brought before the Appeals Council:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   If a claimant or representative files a timely Appointments Clause challenge and timely requests Appeals Council review, the AC will consider the challenge in the context of the facts of the case (including, but not limited to, the date of the ALJ decision and the date the challenge was raised) in determining whether there is a basis to grant review. The AC will determine whether granting review is appropriate under 20 CFR 404.970 or 416.1470, or both, when considering both the decision on the merits and any potentially unresolved Appointments Clause issues. \u00b6 In those matters where a timely Appointments Clause challenge to an ALJ decision issued prior to July 16, 2018 is raised to the Appeals Council in a proper request for review, the AC will grant review and issue a decision or order remand, as appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moreover, a regulation in effect long prior to the events in question states that claimants may receive an expedited appeals process to challenge a \"provision in the law that you believe is unconstitutional.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.924\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The administrative transcript shows that Plaintiff submitted additional medical evidence for Appeals Council review as late as August 14, 2017 (Tr. 19). However, she did not challenge the validity of the ALJ's appointment although the circuit split occurred well over six months earlier. Because Plaintiff failed to make an argument or even note a split of authority pertaining to the appointment of the ALJ at any point in the administrative procedure, the\n   <em>\n    Jones Brothers\n   </em>\n   holding cannot be extended to the facts of the present case. \"Courts 'generally expect parties...to raise their as-applied or constitutional-avoidance challenges' at the administrative level and 'hold them responsible for failing to do so.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   at *1 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones Brothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517991\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/669/\">\n    898 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   676 ). As of this date, the courts that have considered the issue have unanimously rejected attacks on the validity of the ALJ's appointment under\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   brought under 42 U.S.C. 405(g) where the claimant failed to make a constitutional challenge at the administrative level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stearns v.
