(\"Formulatrix\") has brought this action against Rigaku Automation, Inc. (\"Rigaku\") and Rigaku Americas Holding, Inc. (\"Rigaku Americas\") (together \"Rigaku\") for breach of contract and other causes of action related to a January 2015 Customer Support Agreement (\"CSA\") between the parties. At the heart of Plaintiff's complaint is its allegation that Rigaku failed to comply with certain provisions of the CSA governing\n   the transmission of business documents within a 90 day period. Defendants dispute this allegation and assert counterclaims against Plaintiff, alleging that Formulatrix breached the CSA by improperly withholding installment payments due to Rigaku and that Formulatrix violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A by engaging in a pattern of extra-contractual demands coupled with the threat of contractual nonperformance or litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 22, 2015, Formulatrix initiated the instant action against Defendants alleging the following causes of action: breach of contract; tortious interference with contractual and/or advantageous business relationship; breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; request for attorneys' fees under the CSA; unfair and deceptive conduct in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A \u00a7 11 ; and enforcement of a guaranty given by Rigaku America in the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1). On April 5, 2016, Defendants filed a Counterclaim asserting claims of breach of contract; breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; declaratory judgment; violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A \u00a7 11 ; and attorneys' fees under the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 17). On August 25, 2016, following a ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss, which struck Formulatrix's tortious interference and ch. 93A claims (Docket No. 15), Formulatrix filed an Amended Complaint reasserting the claims that survived Defendants' motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 42). On September 1, 2016, Defendants filed a Counterclaim reasserting the same causes of action asserted in its original Counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the court on Formulatrix's \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 66), by which Formulatrix is seeking summary judgment with respect to Rigaku's claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. This matter is also before the court on Rigaku's \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 70), by which Rigaku is seeking summary judgment with respect to all of Formulatrix's remaining claims, and affirmatively on its own breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. Both parties are also seeking summary judgment on the issue of entitlement to attorneys' fees. For the reasons detailed herein, Formulatrix's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED and Rigaku's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is ALLOWED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. Specifically, Rigaku's motion is ALLOWED with respect to Count I of Rigaku's Counterclaim (breach of contract), Count II of Formulatrix's Amended Complaint (breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing), but DENIED with respect to Count IV of Formulatrix's Amended Complaint (guaranty) and Count V of Rigaku's Counterclaim (attorneys' fees). With respect to Count I of Formulatrix's Amended Complaint (breach of contract), Rigaku's motion is ALLOWED as to the reports required by Art. 2.02 and accurate representations and warranties under Schedule 5.06, but otherwise DENIED. As detailed herein, this court concludes that the issue of entitlement to attorneys' fees is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The CSA\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Formulatrix is in the business of developing, manufacturing, and selling protein crystallization automation products (\"Automation Products\") to customers in the protein crystallization industry. (PF \u00b6 1). As of the beginning of 2015, Rigaku was a direct competitor to Formulatrix in the Automation Products industry. (PF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). On January 15, 2015, Formulatrix presented Rigaku with an offer to purchase its assets, and thereafter, the two companies engaged in negotiations related to the offer. (DOppF \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Effective January 20, 2015, Formulatrix and Rigaku entered into a Customer Support Agreement (\"CSA\" or \"Agreement\"). (PF \u00b6 2). Generally speaking, under the CSA, Rigaku agreed to exit the business of developing, manufacturing, and selling protein-crystallization-automation equipment; to transfer certain assets and license certain intellectual property to Formulatrix; to transfer certain business documents to Formulatrix within 90 days; and to provide transition support services to Formulatrix for up to 90 days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 1 Arts. 1.01, 1.02, 2.01, 2.04, 3.01). In turn, Formulatrix agreed to provide support services to Rigaku's protein-crystallization customers and to pay Rigaku $2 million upon the execution of the CSA and then an additional sum of $1.825 million in equal installments over the course of 12 months commencing on January 20, 2016, one year after the execution of the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 1 Arts. 1.02, 4.01).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree that Formulatrix did not conduct due diligence with respect to Rigaku's financial representations and warranties before signing the CSA. (PF \u00b6 6; DR \u00b6 6). However, the parties dispute whether this was by mutual agreement, as Rigaku contends, or because Rigaku refused to allow Formulatrix to conduct such due diligence, as Formulatrix contends. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DR \u00b6 6; PROppF \u00b6 2). Among the representations and warranties provided by Rigaku in the CSA is a schedule containing Rigaku's financial information. (PEx. 1 Art. 5.06, Schedule 5.06). Rigaku's financial information, provided in Schedule 5.06, includes Rigaku's revenue for FYE2014 and projected revenue for FYE2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Formulatrix asserts, but Rigaku disputes, that Formulatrix agreed to pay Rigaku the amount of monetary consideration in the CSA in reliance upon Rigaku's representations and warranties as to such revenue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6 5; DR \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the heart of Formulatrix's case is the CSA's records transfer provision, which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Art. 2.04\n   <em>\n    Records\n   </em>\n   . On or promptly following the Effective Date, and in no event later than ninety (90) days following the Effective Date, Rigaku shall deliver to Formulatrix a copy of all of the following records of Rigaku (whether\n   such materials are evidenced in writing, electronically or otherwise) with respect to the Products\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   : (i) purchasing and production records; (ii) all customer lists (including contact information for each customer); (iii) all vendor, supplier and service provider lists (including a copy or description of the underlying commercial agreements or arrangements with such vendors, suppliers or service providers); (iv) blueprints, technology, technical designs, drawings, specifications; (v) pricing and cost information, including a copy of any purchase order to be filled by Formulatrix, (vi) service support records and (vii) other books, records and files used or held for use by or on behalf of Rigaku, in each case which are solely related to the Products or used solely in conjunction with the Business\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Records\n   </em>\n   \"). Rigaku shall provide all Records in excel format or shall provide Formulatrix with a copy of the software necessary to access the Records in their existing format, in each case to the extent reasonably practicable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (PEx. 1 Art. 2.04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At issue in the instant case is whether Rigaku breached the CSA's record transfer provision by failing to transmit within 90 days certain documents that Formulatrix asserts were required to be transferred pursuant to the CSA. Specifically, the parties dispute whether the transfer of documents related to historical instrument sales and service revenue (invoices, quotes, and purchase orders) was required under the CSA, and whether, if required, the transfer of these documents and/or their transfer within 90 days was a material term of the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7; DR \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7; Docket No. 67 at 6, 12; Docket No. 80 at 14-15). Formulatrix contends that such documents were necessary for it to confirm Rigaku's representations in the CSA regarding Rigaku's financial information so that Formulatrix could determine if the purchase price Formulatrix had agreed to was justified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 67 at 11-12). Rigaku contends that these documents were irrelevant since the purchase price was not dependent on any historic sales and revenue figures and that Formulatrix is using the documents as a belated justification for failing to make payments when due. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 80 at 1, 14-15, 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The CSA also provides for the award of attorneys' fees, stating that \"In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof or thereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other available remedy.\" (PEx. 1 Art. 9.12). The parties dispute which party should be considered the \"successful party\" entitled to attorneys' fees in the present litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Performance During The 90 Day Record Transfer Period\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Immediately following the execution of the CSA, the parties began performance. There is no dispute that Formulatrix transferred $2 million to Rigaku and that Rigaku stopped developing, manufacturing, and selling protein-crystallization products, announced this stoppage to both its staff and its customers, and also encouraged third parties to contact Formulatrix to purchase additional protein-crystallization products. (DF \u00b6 3; DOppF \u00b6 4; PROppF \u00b6 4). Rigaku also began providing Formulatrix with transition support by tasking Rigaku personnel to facilitate the\n   transition of support services; giving Formulatrix access to its intellectual property; and transferring Rigaku source code and software in accordance with the CSA. (DOppF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7; PROppF \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7). As of January 21, 2015, Rigaku began transferring records and other data related to its Automation business to Formulatrix by making data available to Formulatrix through a dedicated VPN (virtual private network) and by way of email transfers. (DOppF \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Between January and April 20, 2015, Formulatrix communicated to Rigaku frustration with the pace, organization, accuracy, and completeness of the records it was receiving from Rigaku. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppEx. 18; PEx. 11; PEx. 14). On January 30, 2015, Jeremy Stevenson, the President and CEO of Formulatrix, emailed Rigaku's CFO expressing concern that the data Rigaku was sending to Formulatrix wasn't \"being validated,\" and asked whether there was a way to reconcile Rigaku's service revenue figures listed in the CSA with the records being transferred to Formulatrix. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppEx. 18 at 1). On March 11, 2015, Stevenson again emailed Rigaku expressing concern about the pace of the record transfer and frustration that Formulatrix had not yet been able to get a complete customer list from Rigaku as of that date. (PEx. 11 at RIGAKU-001691). Stevenson indicated that Formulatrix needed the data from the record transfer both to \"take over operations of support, and to validate the rep[resentations] and warrant[ies] in the Customer Service Agreement,\" and that he wouldn't consider the data transfer properly completed until Formulatrix could \"validate [that] it all ties out - revenue, [purchase orders], customers, service contracts, installed systems and service call data.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rigaku's CFO responded, stating that while the CSA did not call for the data to be delivered in a particular manor, he \"appreciate[d] the desire to get data in a format that is easy to review,\" and his team was working to get Formulatrix \"clean\" data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at RIGAKU-0001690). After this exchange Rigaku and Formulatrix continued to work together on the data transfer. It is undisputed that Formulatrix began to take over Rigaku's customer support obligations in mid-April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 3, 2015, Formulatrix emailed Rigaku again expressing concerns, this time about received data sets that were missing customer quotes and invoices. (PEx. 14). Formulatrix relayed that it needed that information to \"move forward with maintenance\" and \"verify the representations and warranties\" in the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). During the record transfer process, Formulatrix asked Rigaku to quality check its data and service contract records prior to sending them to Formulatrix. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROppF \u00b6 11; DOppEx. 10 at 38). Rigaku never refused to provide the data and records Formulatrix requested, in the formats requested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 15; PROppF \u00b6 15). A Rigaku employee who worked on the record transfer averred that members of Rigaku's transfer team \"incurred significant time and expense quality-checking data, providing reformatted data, and creating records that did not previously exist,\" which \"greatly slowed down the transfer process.\" (DEx. 16 at 1-2). Formulatrix does not dispute that its request that Rigaku quality check its data slowed down the data transfer process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROppF \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 20 and 21, 2015, Formulatrix emailed Rigaku spreadsheets identifying purchase orders, quotes, and invoices that Formulatrix believed it had not yet received. (PF \u00b6 11). On April 27, Rigaku responded, advising that the invoices related to its current service contracts had been uploaded to the shared VPN folder. (PF \u00b6 11; PEx. 17 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Communications Leading Up To Litigation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Though the parties continued to work together under the CSA after the April 20, 2015 record transfer deadline, their relationship continued to break down. Formulatrix asserts, but Rigaku disputes, that Rigaku interfered with Formulatrix's attempts to hire former Rigaku employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF \u00b6 4; PR \u00b6 4; PEx. 5 at 7-8). Additionally, after the record transfer deadline, Formulatrix personnel informed Rigaku that Formulatrix would withhold support service to Rigaku customers until Formulatrix received all of the data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppEx. 9 at 159; DOppEx. 25 at 1). Rigaku's CFO brought this information to the attention of Formulatrix's President, asserting that Rigaku had provided Formulatrix with \"enough information to carry out the support services.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PReplyEx. 8 at 3). Formulatrix's President responded by stating that despite Formulatrix's belief that Rigaku had breached the agreement, Formulatrix had \"not stopped [its] effort to take over support.\" (PReplyEx. 4 at 3). However, he subsequently clarified that Formulatrix was not yet in a position to take over European support of Rigaku products because Formulatrix \"lack[ed] documents and ... [did not] have a team in place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As of around May 1, 2015, Formulatrix engaged Rigaku in discussions regarding a potential contract addendum related to Rigaku's continued transfer of data and records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 18). Formulatrix sent Rigaku an early stage draft of its proposed addendum to the CSA, which required that records be provided in a specific format and be fully quality-checked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). The draft addendum also provided that if Rigaku failed to meet a revised record transfer deadline, Formulatrix would be entitled to a refund of the $2 million in consideration it had paid and would have no further obligations under the contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). Rigaku reviewed the proposed addendum, but ultimately did not agree to an amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 19 at 1; DOppEx. 28; DOppEx. 29). On June 18, 2015, Formulatrix emailed Rigaku stating that there were \"two directions we can go\": either negotiate an amendment to the CSA by the following week wherein, Rigaku would agree to \"[p]ayment of $100K per month for each month the data is not transferred, retroactive to the due date\"; \"[p]ayment of $50K per month for each month where either [t]he service revenue reports or payments aren't received, retroactive to the due date of the first report\"; coverage of \"legal fees post contract closing and through acceptance of the agreement\"; and an agreement to deliver data that \"will be meaningful and substantially correct as was verbally promised to us when negotiating the contract,\" or Formulatrix would file suit against Rigaku with \"a Complaint prepared\" and \"ready to submit.\" (DOppEx. 29). Formulatrix further stated that if Rigaku did not respond by the next day, it would assume that Rigaku was not agreeing to negotiate the amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is Rigaku's position that through these discussions about amending the contract and this threat of litigation, Formulatrix violated ch. 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 22, 2015, Formulatrix filed the Complaint in this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1). Formulatrix took the position that, to the extent that Rigaku had not provided Formulatrix with invoices, quotes, or purchase orders to validate Rigaku's service revenue as listed in the CSA, such unvalidated revenue constituted damages Formulatrix had suffered from Rigaku's alleged breach of contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DEx. 8 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Continued Records Transfer\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties agree that by June 2, 2015, after the record transfer deadline but before the filing of the instant action, Rigaku\n   had transferred and quality checked all engineering data to Formulatrix. (DOppF \u00b6 25). By July 29, 2015, Rigaku had transferred and quality checked all of the CRM (customer relationship management) data. (DOppF \u00b6 26; PROppF \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 28, July 31, September 19, and November 4, 2015, Formulatrix emailed Rigaku supplemental lists of purchase orders, quotes, and invoices that Formulatrix had not received. (PF \u00b6 13). Rigaku responded with additional information and records throughout this period and into January 2016. (PF \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rigaku asserts that by January 13, 2016, it had transferred all data and records that Formulatrix had identified as missing in any outstanding list. (DR \u00b6 13). On January 19, 2016, the day before the first installment payment was due, Rigaku emailed Formulatrix stating that Rigaku believed it had transferred the last of the data to Formulatrix. (DOppEx. 38). Formulatrix's CFO responded the next day, stating \"I will not have time available to focus on this for about two weeks. I'll certainly review and respond as usual.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rigaku asserts that Formulatrix never provided Rigaku any further notice that it believed there were additional records missing. (DOppF \u00b6 36). Formulatrix disagrees, asserting that it provided notice via responses to discovery requests in the instant action, discussed below. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROppF \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38-40; PF \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Formulatrix asserts that Rigaku did not complete its data transfer obligation under the CSA until September 2016, when Rigaku transferred the last of the service contract-related invoices, quotes and purchase orders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PROppF \u00b6 32; PF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). As discussed further below, Rigaku contends that Formulatrix did not provide Rigaku with sufficient information to identify these documents as missing until August 11, 2016. (DR \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Installment Payment Obligation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is undisputed that pursuant to the CSA, Formulatrix was required to begin paying the $1.825 million in monthly installment payments to Rigaku on January 20, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PR \u00b6 2; PEx. 1 Art. 4.01). In February 2016, Formulatrix transferred into a separate account to which Rigaku did not have access, the first two installment payments due to Rigaku under the CSA. (PF \u00b6 15; DR \u00b6 15). As subsequent monthly installments came due throughout 2016, Formulatrix continued to segregate payments into that account and furnish statements to Rigaku. (PF \u00b6 16). Formulatrix asserts that it was entitled to set aside the payments due to what it considered to be Rigaku's prior material breach of the CSA and pending Rigaku's compliance with the CSA's record transfer provision. Rigaku asserts that Formulatrix was not justified in failing to pay Rigaku the installment payments on time and thus Formulatrix breached the CSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On July 1, 2016, Formulatrix, in response to a request for production made by Rigaku in the context of this litigation, produced two Microsoft Excel files bates-labeled FORMULATRIX 2045 and 2046. (DOppF \u00b6 39; PROppF \u00b6 39). On August 11, 2016, Formulatrix served its supplemental response to Rigaku's first set of interrogatories, in which Formulatrix explained that FORMULATRIX 2045 and 2046 listed invoices, quotes, and customer purchase orders that it believed Rigaku had failed to provide in violation of the record transfer provision of the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 41; PEx. 6 at 2-3). The parties dispute whether Formulatrix had previously identified those files to Rigaku as outstanding. (DOppF \u00b6 41; PROppF \u00b6\u00b6 41, 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On September 21, 2016, Rigaku produced to Formulatrix, as a supplemental initial disclosure pursuant to\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, the purchase orders, quotes, and invoices relating to its support-services revenue for FYE2014 and FYE2015 that Formulatrix had identified as unproduced on FORMULATRIX 2045 and 2046. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF \u00b6 7; DOppF \u00b6 44). Based on these productions, Formulatrix contended that it was finally able to verify $810,748 of FYE2014 revenue and $344,243 of FYE2015 revenue that it had not previously been able to confirm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 6 at 2-3; PReplyEx. 2 at 2; PROppF \u00b6 14). Accordingly, Formulatrix no longer asserts that it has suffered damages in the form of service revenue that has not been validated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 77 at 5-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties entered into settlement negotiations, and on December 14, 2016, Formulatrix wired to Rigaku all of the installment payments that had been held in the separate account in the amount of $1.825 million. (PF \u00b6 20; DF \u00b6 3; PReplyEx. 1 at 3). The parties dispute whether Formulatrix attempted to condition the release of the installment payments on certain amendments to the CSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 48; PROppF \u00b6 48). However, it is undisputed that no further amendments to the CSA were agreed upon and that Formulatrix released all installment payments in full to Rigaku. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 51; PF \u00b6 21). Rigaku asserts that Formulatrix owes it damages in the form of interest on the previously withheld installment payments.

Rigaku has moved for summary judgment on Formulatrix's breach of contract claim with respect to each of these allegations. Formulatrix has not moved for summary judgment on its own breach of contract claim. The court shall address each allegation in turn. As detailed herein, there are disputed facts as to whether Rigaku breached the CSA by failing to produce all the documents within 90 days or whether such a production was excused. Similarly, there are disputed facts as to whether Rigaku interfered with Formulatrix's ability to hire former Rigaku employees.

This provision of the contract is unambiguous, and imposes no\n   specific requirements on Rigaku regarding the organization of the transferred documents, other than that they be transferred in excel or native format. Furthermore, it is clear that pursuant to this provision of the CSA, Rigaku did not make any specific promises regarding the ease of transferability of its records, the number of repositories in which its records were housed, or the completeness of individual records. Thus, any claim by Formulatrix that Rigaku breached Art. 2.04 of the CSA due to allegations of disorganization, difficulty of transferability, number of repositories, or completeness of individual records, does not constitute a contractual breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To the extent that Formulatrix contends that Rigaku breached the contract by failing to provide all historical records within 90 days to \"validate Rigaku's financial representations and warranties under the Agreement\" (Docket No. 67 at 6), Formulatrix has not cited to any contractual provisions supporting its contention that Rigaku's records were intended to be used for such a purpose. Rather, a reading of the CSA as a whole indicates that the primary purpose of the record transfer provision was to provide Formulatrix with sufficient records to continue Rigaku's business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, there is evidence in the record that the parties engaged in a course of conduct pursuant to which Formulatrix would request specific information which Rigaku would then provide,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which may be found to constitute an agreed upon method of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vita v.

Mass. 2010) (\"It is well-settled that even a fully-integrated written contract can be modified by subsequent oral agreement and that such modification may be inferred from the parties' conduct and the surrounding circumstances.\"). Along those lines, the parties dispute whether Formulatrix requested documents in a timely manner and/or whether Rigaku was required to produce the same information multiple times. Finally, but without limitation, there is evidence in the record that Formulatrix's insistence that Rigaku quality check its documents, a requirement not included in the contract, slowed down the production of documents which may have resulted in a waiver of the 90 day deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DEx. 16 at 1-2). On the other hand, it is undisputed that Rigaku did not produce all of the historical instrument sales and service revenue records within 90 days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppF \u00b6 27; PROppF \u00b6 27). In sum, there are disputed facts as to whether Rigaku's late production constituted a breach of contract, or whether such a breach was material. Therefore,\n   Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on Formulatrix's breach of contract claim related to Rigaku's record transfer obligations must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nevertheless, for completeness this court will address Rigaku's argument that even if there was a breach caused by the late production, Formulatrix has failed to establish any damages. While this court agrees with Rigaku, that does not moot Formulatrix's breach of contract claim. Not only may a breach of contract entitle a party to nominal damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scholz v.

As detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , that determination is relevant to the question of which party, if any, is entitled to attorneys' fees under the CSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Formulatrix argues that it suffered damages in the forms of (1) attorneys' fees, in that it filed the instant lawsuit against Rigaku to compel compliance with the record transfer provision of the CSA; (2) approximately $86,000 in excess personnel costs equaling the value of the time its personnel had to spend on the data transfer as a result of Rigaku's failure to comply with its data-transfer obligations; and (3) approximately $500,000 in unpaid service contract revenue that Rigaku has withheld in violation of CSA Art. 1.02(a). These breach of contract damages are not supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, Formulatrix's assertion that Rigaku has improperly withheld $500,000 in unpaid service contract revenue in violation of CSA Art. 1.02(a) is a theory of liability and damages not made in the pleadings. As such it will not be considered by this court as a basis for damages related to Formulatrix's breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estrada v. Progressive Direct Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060826\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/53/484/#p497\">\n    53 F.Supp.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (D. Mass. 2014) (holding that plaintiffs could not introduce an entirely new theory of liability in their summary judgment papers and that by doing so they were \"impermissibly seek[ing] to amend [their] complaint without ever filing a motion for leave to amend pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, this court concludes that Formulatrix has not supported any claim of damages for excess personnel costs. Formulatrix asserts that its personnel \"were forced to work unnecessarily on the data transfer\" for over a year after the signing of the CSA, specifically, that employees had to spend time reconciling data as a result of Rigaku's \"repeated dumps of incomplete, repetitive and disorganized data.\" (Docket No. 77 at 6). However, the CSA only required Rigaku to complete a data dump of certain records in Excel or native format within the 90 day time frame. Evidence of time spent by Formulatrix employees to reconcile repetitive, incomplete, or disorganized data resulting from such a data dump, does not constitute evidence of costs incurred as a result of a breach, because Rigaku was not under a duty to so organize its documents under the CSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To prove excess personnel costs, Formulatrix has also produced evidence in the form of a computation of time that certain employees spent working on the Rigaku document transfer (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PEx. 5 at 20), deposition transcripts (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   POppExs. 1 &amp; 2), and the time records of a Formulatrix employee. (POppEx. 4). However, it is not possible to determine whether the time was spent for any purpose other than fulfilling Formulatrix's burden of organizing and reconciling Rigaku's records. Thus, the evidence is insufficient to support Formulatrix's excess employee hours theory of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Formulatrix contends that its attorneys' fees are recoverable under Art. 9.12 of the CSA. Rigaku contends that it, not Formulatrix, is the party entitled to recover attorneys' fees under the CSA as the prevailing party. The court will address the issue of attorneys' fees\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , but for present purposes it is sufficient to recognize that either party's entitlement to attorneys' fees under the contract is \"a collateral matter to be determined following adjudication of the relevant claims\" and is not an element of breach of contract damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doucot v. IDS Scheer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4212197\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/734/172/#p191\">\n    734 F.Supp.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (D. Mass. 2010) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Breach of Reporting Obligations Under Art. 2.02\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Formulatrix's Amended Complaint also asserts that Rigaku \"failed to provide the reports it was obligated to provide under [Art. 2.02] of the Agreement with respect to the amortized value of the revenue recognized by Rigaku.\" (Docket No. 42 \u00b6 30). Rigaku has moved for summary judgment on this claim, contending that it has given Formulatrix all of the reports it was required to provide pursuant to Art. 2.02. Although the parties disagree about the timeliness of the filing of these reports, Formulatrix does not appear to dispute that Rigaku has provided all such reports. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PR \u00b6 14). Accordingly, because all such reports have been provided, and the Amended Complaint does not assert a breach of contract claim on the basis of the delay in filing these reports, Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on Formulatrix's breach of contract claim, as it pertains to the reports required by Art. 2.02, is ALLOWED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Breach of Obligation to Provide Accurate Representations and Warranties\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Rigaku also seeks summary judgment on Formulatrix's claim that Rigaku failed to provide accurate representations and warranties under Schedule 5.06, in breach of the CSA. No evidence has been provided to indicate that Rigaku did not provide accurate representations and warranties in Schedule 5.06. Indeed, Formulatrix has indicated that once Rigaku produced all of its invoices, quotes, and purchase orders, Formulatrix was able to verify the revenue figures Rigaku represented and warranted in the CSA. (PReplyEx. 2 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The parties do dispute whether the pro forma revenue figure in Schedule 5.06 corresponds to FYE2015 or FYE2016. (DF \u00b6 8; PR \u00b6 8). Formulatrix's CFO testified that Formulatrix believed the figure was a projection of future revenue for FYE2016, and that because Formulatrix's actual earnings from Rigaku's business were significantly less than this projection in FYE2016, the pro forma figure was materially inaccurate. (DEx. 4 at 174; POppEx. 1 at 83). However, Art. 5.06 of the CSA itself states that \"Schedule 5.06 contains ... profit &amp; loss statements related to the Support Services for fiscal year ended January 31, 2014 (historical), January 31, 2015 (projected) and January 31, 2015 (pro forma with Key Employees on a full-time equivalent basis) ....\" (PEx. 1 Art. 5.06). Given that the plain language of Art. 5.06 indicates that the pro forma figure is for FYE2015, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the pro forma figure corresponds to FYE2015 or FYE2016. It indisputably corresponds to the former. Accordingly, Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on Formulatrix's breach of contract claim, as it pertains to accurate representations and warranties under Schedule 5.06, is ALLOWED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Breach of Obligations Under Art. 2.06 as to Rigaku Employees\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Formulatrix's Amended Complaint alleges that \"a Rigaku employee interfered with Formulatrix's attempt\n   to hire key Rigaku employees, which resulted in Formulatrix being unable to enter into employment agreements with these key employees,\" in violation of Art. 2.06. (Docket No. 42 \u00b6 31). Rigaku seeks summary judgment on this claim, arguing that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Rigaku interfered with Formulatrix's ability to hire its employees. This court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Formulatrix alleges that Tom Vorndran, the director of engineering at Rigaku Automation, Inc., interfered with Formulatrix's attempts to hire two other Rigaku employees, Rollan Mosko and Andrew Provost, who both ultimately declined to accept Formulatrix's offer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 77 at 8). Formulatrix's allegation of interference is based on the testimony of a former Rigaku employee, who Formulatrix did hire, Adolfo Martinez. Martinez testified that in the time period when Formulatrix was making employment offers to Rigaku employees, Mosko, Provost, and Vorndran met with one another. (POppEx. 3 at 45). Martinez does not know what was discussed at this meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). Martinez testified that Mosko later called a meeting of the Rigaku employees who had been offered jobs with Formulatrix, which included Martinez and Provost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46). Martinez testified that Mosko stated at the meeting that he wanted Formulatrix to make an employment offer to Vorndran and another employee, and suggested that \"if we walk in with these demands, that we should be able to get these demands because without any of us, this deal wouldn't go through.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46-47). Martinez also testified that he heard Vorndran, Provost, and Mosko each relay the same message to Formulatrix - that the company did not have a plan to succeed - \"word for word,\" and that he found this behavior \"odd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44). Provost's subsequent email declining the employment offer used similar wording. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DReplyEx. 8 at 1). In addition to Martinez's testimony, a Formulatrix employee memorialized a conversation he had with Provost in an email, stating \"[Provost] doesn't feel like we have the right team in place to make this work. He seemed to think we really needed [Vorndran] in order to form a successful team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The email also indicated that \"[Provost] seemed to imply that [the Rigaku employees] should all be talking on their side and deciding on whether to join as a group, not as individuals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Mosko, Provost, and Vorndran deny any such interference, and neither Mosko nor Provost referenced Vorndran in their emails declining employment. (DReplyEx. 2 at 2; DReplyEx. 3 at 3; DReplyEx. 4 at 3; DReplyEx. 8 at 1; DReplyEx. 9 at 1). However, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Formulatrix, Martinez's testimony at the very least indicates that Mosko tried to intercede in connection with Formulatrix's ability to hire Rigaku employees by encouraging them to band together and make demands, and the email indicates that Provost had a similar attitude. Based on the evidence of the meeting between Mosko, Provost, and Vorndran, their identical statements to Rigaku, and Mosko and Provost's insistence that Formulatrix hire Vorndran, there may be sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Vorndran asked Mosko and Provost to leverage their offers on his behalf, and that this action constituted wrongful interference, a conclusion about which this court expresses no opinion. Nevertheless, there is a genuine dispute of material fact and Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on Formulatrix's breach of contract claim, as it pertains to interfering with hiring Rigaku employees, is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Formulatrix's Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Claim Against Rigaku\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Rigaku has also moved for summary judgment with respect to Count\n   II of Formulatrix's Amended Complaint, in which Formulatrix asserts a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \"Under Massachusetts law, every contract implies good faith and fair dealing between the parties to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Formulatrix was understandably frustrated that the record transfer process was proceeding slowly and that Rigaku was not providing \"clean\" data. However, there is no evidence that Rigaku was deliberately trying to slow down the process or provide Formulatrix with a poorer version of the data that Rigaku had internally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOppEx. 9 at 85-86 (\"I do not believe they were intentionally giving us dirty data\") ). When Formulatrix later proposed amending the CSA to include new, specific provisions to address the data transfer, including penalties for failing to transfer the data in the manner Formulatrix desired, Rigaku's CFO responded to the proposal, indicating that he would solicit feedback from Rigaku employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 18 at 1). While the emails between the parties demonstrate that they disagreed about the scope of Rigaku's obligations under Art. 2.04, Rigaku still continued to work with Formulatrix to provide the data in the manner Formulatrix requested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 20 at 1). Thus, there is no genuine issue of material fact and Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on Formulatrix's claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is ALLOWED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Rigaku's Claims Against Formulatrix for Delayed Installment Payments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In its Counterclaim, Rigaku asserts both a breach of contract claim and a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim against Formulatrix for failing to timely pay installment payments\n   to Rigaku.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Formulatrix and Rigaku have moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.

When Rigaku's CFO brought this to the attention of Stevenson, Formulatrix's President, however, Stevenson emphatically stated that Formulatrix employees \"were NOT told to stop support of [Rigaku] products.\" (PReply Ex. 4 at 1).

Formulatrix subsequently proposed an amendment to the CSA that had provisions which would allow Formulatrix to receive a refund of the $2 million in consideration it had already paid and potentially release Formulatrix from its obligation to pay the installment payments if Rigaku did not meet certain conditions (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PEx. 18 at 4). After Rigaku rejected adding any such large scale penalty to the CSA, Formulatrix's President subsequently emailed Rigaku stating that \"If I do not receive an unequivocal statement that Rigaku will amend the contract to include the specific terms set forth in detail in my May 5th email ... we will exercise all our legal rights and remedies.\" (PEx. 19 at 1; DReplyEx. 11 at 2). Formulatrix subsequently filed suit and continued with the contract, but still chose to withhold installment payments from Rigaku for nearly a year. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that this behavior constituted an unfair and deceptive act or practice. Formulatrix's motion for summary judgment as to Rigaku's ch. 93A claim is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Formulatrix's Guaranty Provision Claim Against Rigaku\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Rigaku also moves for summary judgment on Formulatrix's guaranty provision claim, under Art. 2.07 of the CSA. By this provision, Rigaku Americas Holding, Inc. has guaranteed Rigaku Automation, Inc.'s obligations under the CSA. Rigaku argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on this claim because Formulatrix cannot demonstrate any actual damages. At this stage in the litigation, however, it remains undetermined whether Rigaku breached the CSA or whether it is liable for nominal damages and/or attorneys' fees. Accordingly, Rigaku's motion for summary judgment on this claim is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     Attorneys' Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, the parties move for summary judgment on their claims for attorneys' fees. The provision of attorneys' fees is set forth in Art. 9.12 of the CSA, which provides: \"In any action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or where any provision hereof or thereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to any other available remedy.\" (PEx. 1 Art. 9.12). Formulatrix asserts that it should be deemed the successful party in the litigation, having achieved its purpose in initiating the litigation by successfully compelling Rigaku to comply with its record transfer obligations. Rigaku counters that this court should conduct a claim-by-claim analysis to determine which party is the \"successful party\" entitled to attorneys' fees for each claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The provision at issue \"is plain spoken and '[successful] party' is to be understood in the ordinary or popular sense, and given commonsense meaning[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Bardon Trimount, Inc. v.
