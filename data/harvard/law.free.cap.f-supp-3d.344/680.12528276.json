BRODERICK, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 23, 2015, Plaintiffs Brad Schwartzman and Trusgan, Inc. (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed this action against two groups of defendants: (1) Defendants Label LLC, Label, N.Y. LLC, David Miller, and Jeremy Miller (collectively, \"Label Defendants\"), and (2) Defendants Automatic Data Processing, Inc., ADP LLC, and Colin Barnett (collectively, \"ADP Defendants\"). On October 30, 2015, the Label Defendants filed their answer which contained defenses, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims. Before me are two motions to dismiss: (1) the ADP Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety on the grounds that their contractual relationship is governed by ADP's terms of services agreement, and because it fails to state claims for defamation or negligent misrepresentation, and (2) Plaintiffs' partial motion to dismiss Label Defendants' counterclaims on the basis that the counterclaims fail to state claims under the Lanham Act and for tortious interference, and because exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law counterclaims is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against the ADP Defendants for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, the ADP Defendants' motion with respect to those claims is GRANTED. With respect to Plaintiffs' defamation claim, the ADP Defendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED. Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the Complaint to allege additional facts in support of its claim for defamation is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' partial motion to dismiss the Label Defendants' counterclaim for violation of the Lanham Act is GRANTED, but the Label Defendants may amend the counterclaim with respect to false advertising under the Lanham Act within thirty (30) days of this Opinion &amp; Order. Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss the Label Defendants' state law counterclaims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for tortious interference is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Facts Alleged Against ADP in Plaintiffs' Complaint\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Label sells bespoke and custom men's clothing throughout the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   David Miller and Jeremy Miler (together, the \"Millers\") are founding members of Label, and David Miller is a manager of the company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24.) In August 2013, Schwartzman started working for Label as Vice President of Sales and entered into an agreement entitled Binding Term Sheet - Cooperation Agreement (\"Term Sheet\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.) The Term Sheet, among other things, outlined how Schwartzman was to be compensated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) In the spring of 2014, while employed at Label, he established his own bespoke tailoring and made-to-measure men's clothing company, named Trusgan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Thereafter, Schwartzman provided his services to Label as an employee of, and through, Trusgan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2013, Schwartzman and the Millers were introduced to Colin Barnett, an employee of ADP, who was interested in buying clothes from Label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) Barnett did not purchase clothes, and instead offered ADP's account services to Label and Schwartzman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) Label hired ADP to automate its employee payroll system, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62), and began paying Trusgan for Schwartzman's services through ADP, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 22, 2014, Schwartzman also established an ADP account for Trusgan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) Plaintiffs allege that they paid ADP a $1200 fee to set up an account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176.) The ADP account was intended to transfer payments from Trusgan's bank account to Schwartzman's bank account. In connection with creating Trusgan's ADP account, Schwartzman sent Barnett a voided Trusgan check on April 25, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-88.) Unbeknownst to Schwartzman, however, a voided Label check had already been sent to Barnett from Label's JP Morgan Chase account on April 24, 2014, one day earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.) ADP \"ignored\" the correct voided Trusgan check of April 25, 2014, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95), and created a payroll that drew money from Label's Chase Bank account instead of from Trusgan's, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98). As a result of this error, Schwartzman began receiving $1,500 bi-monthly payments from Label instead of Trusgan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) The bank statements incorrectly indicated that payments were coming from \"Trusgan, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 26, 2014, Schwartzman told the Millers that he would no longer be affiliated with Label as of October 6, 2014, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103), and requested that the \"stipulations in the Term Sheet be honored,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104). Around the same time, the Millers discovered that ADP was improperly doubling Schwartzman's salary through the two payroll accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113.) Specifically, Schwartzman and Label's shared accountant, Richard Gilmartin, discovered the payroll error in September 2014, and contacted Barnett and ADP about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 113-14.) Barnett refused to speak to Gilmartin, and, instead, on or about October 2014, \"an ADP employee named Bob Oliverie (\"Oliverie\"), a Director of Accountant-Sales support, responded to Gilmartin and sent the account opening documents that Barnett had altered along with the voided Label check that Barnett had obtained from Chase.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) Oliverie\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   incorrectly but falsely told Gilmartin that Schwartzman had emailed a Label check to ADP and had also submitted documents with Label's bank account numbers to ADP that was used to set up\n   the Trusgan payroll that resulted in the erroneous payments. As support, Oliverie and ADP provided Gilmartin the altered documents as evidence that Schwartzman was responsible for the unauthorized debits by ADP on Label's Chase Bank account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) ADP \"presented the same falsehoods to Label, and told them that Schwartzman had submitted the Label check and bank account numbers to ADP,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118), despite having the \"correct voided Trusgan check\" in its possession, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 17, 2014, the Label Defendants began their \"campaign of calumny\" against Plaintiffs by sending a \"newsletter\" by email to Label customers claiming that: (1) Schwartzman committed fraud during his employment at Label; (2) Defendants were pursuing criminal charges against Schwartzman for embezzling funds; and (3) Schwartzman's claim that he can offer Label's products at a cheaper price is false because Defendants received commitments from their suppliers that the suppliers will not do business with Schwartzman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-31.) When Schwartzman learned about the newsletter, he asked Gilmartin about it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139.) Gilmartin, who at the time was \"under the impression that Schwartzman had erroneously provided a voided Label check instead of a voided Trusgan check,\" told him about the ADP error, and forwarded him ADP documents that \"Barnett had secretly altered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 140-43.) After Schwartzman received the ADP documents, he \"immediately advised Gilmartin that the documents he submitted to ADP must have been altered by Barnett and ADP, and he provided the documents that he submitted to ADP and his correspondence with ADP to Gilmartin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.) Schwartzman learned about the payroll error for the first time from Gilmartin and, pursuant to Gilmartin's advice, returned the $19,011.95 to Label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Facts Alleged in Label Defendants' Counterclaims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Millers hired Schwartzman to serve as Vice President of Sales in August 2013. (Counterclaims \u00b6 23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that capacity, Schwartzman was to be responsible for managing and training Label's clothiers and overseeing all aspects of the supply chain, from initial client fitting and sales, to interacting with wholesalers and manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Schwartzman was privy to all of Label's confidential business plans and client information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) He was paid a substantial base salary, plus travel and entertainment expenses, and a percentage of his commissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Schwartzman proved to be an ineffective salesman and failed to conduct himself in a professional manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The Millers began receiving customer complaints about Schwartzman's quality of service, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28), and Schwartzman also acted in a manner inconsistent with Label's interests, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). For example, he charged personal expenses to Label credit cards, disappeared for days at a time without notice, and actively tried to steal customers for his own side business during Label work hours and using Label resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In January 2014, the Millers held a meeting with Schwartzman to discuss these problems, including the fact that Schwartzman's behavior was \"scaring away referrals by making potential clients uncomfortable and being unfriendly and awkward, and that he was not following LABEL's pricing policies appropriately-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Schwartzman cut side deals\n   on LABEL products with favored clients at below-market rates and used LABEL products for payment in kind to cover his personal expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) The intervention was unsuccessful and did not affect Schwartzman's performance or stop him from engaging in this behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While still employed by Label, Schwartzman surreptitiously contacted Label clients, misrepresented that he was placing orders for them through Label, and instead placed the orders through his own company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) For example, Schwartzman communicated with a Label supplier about a large order in August 2014. The supplier asked whether the \"orders were still under Label,\" to which Schwartzman replied, \"all these orders are under me not Label,\" and \"I was only sending them to you because I can't risk them accidentally being sent through Label.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) A client subsequently complained to Label about the fit of the order, delivery times, and customer service, believing that Label had been responsible. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Label believes that \"Schwartzman placed multiple such secret side orders for his own benefit and misrepresented to customers that they were buying [Label] products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Schwartzman also told Label customers that he was opening up his own business and that \"he could continue to service these customers at this new business where he would provide better customer service and pricing than Label, while offering the same exact product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"In or about March 2014, Schwartzman requested that [Label] pay his base salary through Trusgan,\" and Label agreed because it believed-based upon Schwartzman's representations-that Trusgan was merely a holding company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Label set up an ADP account through which Trusgan was to be paid by Label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unbeknownst to Label, Schwartzman set up an additional ADP payroll account, purportedly to pay Schwartzman from Trusgan's account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Instead of sending ADP a voided Trusgan check, however, Schwartzman arranged for ADP to receive a voided Label check, resulting in Schwartzman being paid out of Label's account instead of Trusgan's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Over the next approximately five or six months, \"Schwartzman's payroll scheme caused ADP to draw payments from LABEL's accounts to pay Schwartzman nearly $20,000\" and \"Schwartzman hid this fact from LABEL, who continued to pay Schwartzman his salary unaware that Schwartzman was simultaneously having Trusgan siphon additional, unauthorized money from LABEL's account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Label discovered \"Schwartzman's embezzlement scheme\" in October 2014, and after the discovery, Schwartzman repaid the $20,000 to Label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Label relies on high quality customer service, product quality, and competitive pricing, and maintains accurate, individualized measurements for each client. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Label has spent considerable time and resources compiling specific information about its clients, such as height, weight, age, build, posture, fit preferences, whether they wear a watch and on which hand, and up to 30 discrete body measurements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.) Label has also spent considerable time and resources creating resources to ensure the gathering of detailed customer and garment information, which serve as checklists for salespersons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Its pricing method was also developed through research and identification of private fabric wholesalers and suppliers, many of whom are overseas and not readily identifiable to the general public, and through negotiated pricing and supply agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.) Label's pricing and price lists are not publicly available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Schwartzman had access to all of this information while working at Label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) At the time of his resignation, Schwartzman had access to Label computers and refused to confirm that he would return and/or destroy all of Label's confidential information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) During an October 8, 2014 meeting, Schwartzman told the Millers that he would \"go after\" all of Label's top customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After Schwartzman left Label, David Miller was told by Label clients that Schwartzman had approached them and \"represented ... that he could easily handle former Label clients through Trusgan, because Schwartzman had these Label clients' measurements and other information regarding their previous orders from Label.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Former Label employee Brett Seeman, who at the time had taken over servicing the clients that Schwartzman had previously covered while he was employed by Label, told the Millers that Schwartzman had been telling Label clients that he had their measurements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Schwartzman told Label customers that \"he can beat LABEL's pricing ... by 20% to 30% while offering the exact same product, from the same manufacturers and using the same fabrics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Schwartzman also poached various Label employees, inducing them to breach their duties and bring confidential Label information with them to Trusgan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 23, 2015, Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing the Complaint. (Doc. 1.) On October 30, 2015, the Label Defendants answered the Complaint, asserting defenses, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims. (Doc. 37.) On March 22, 2016, the ADP Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the Complaint, (Doc. 62), and a memorandum of law and declaration in support of their motion, (Docs. 63-64). On April 26, 2016, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the ADP Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Doc. 73.) On May 13, 2016, the ADP Defendants filed their reply in further support of their motion. (Doc. 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 22, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their partial motion to dismiss the Label Defendants' counterclaims, (Doc. 66), and a memorandum of law and declaration in support of their motion, (Docs. 67-68). On April 26, 2016, the Label Defendants filed their opposition. (Doc. 72.) On May 13, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their reply in further support of their motion. (Doc. 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 27, 2017, Plaintiffs advised that Schwartzman had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Tennessee. (Doc. 81.) On March 28, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a status update, explaining that Schwartzman was discharged from bankruptcy on June 19, 2017 and noting that Plaintiffs' counsel had been authorized to be employed as special counsel for the Trustee in this matter. (Doc. 82.) After the parties appeared telephonically for a status conference to discuss the effect of Schwartzman's bankruptcy filing and subsequent discharge on the pending motions, the parties filed a joint motion to substitute the Jeanne Anne Burton, Trustee in Bankruptcy for the Estate of Brad Schwartzman, as the plaintiff/real party-in-interest under Rules 17(a) and 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (Doc. 87), which I granted, (Doc. 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Plaintiffs argue that ADP and Barnett \"intentionally altered account numbers and signatures on Trusgan's documents and obtained a check from Chase Bank without authorization from Trusgan or Label while ignoring the correct check that Trusgan sent.\" (Pls.' Br. 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 90-98, 182.) This, they contend, constituted willful misconduct triggering the exception in 11(C) allowing for monetary damages instead of ADP credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Other than Plaintiffs' conclusory statements, the allegations in the Complaint do not suggest that ADP or Barnett's actions were intentional or willful. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Barnett requested a voided check from Schwartzman, twice on April 23, 2014, and again on April 24, 2014. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) On April 24, Barnett or some other ADP employee, in a \"rush[ ] to meet sales quota ... and to enrich himself,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93), \"directly contacted Chase Bank\" without authorization to request a voided check, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91). \"As a result, on April 24, 2014 at approximately 12:43 P.M., a Label check bearing check number '0000' was faxed from Chase Bank to ADP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) ADP then \"wholly ignored\" the correct Trusgan check sent by Schwartzman the following day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) It makes little sense how or why ADP would preemptively contact and receive an incorrect check from Chase without authorization for the purpose of meeting a sales quota, and even less sense that a Chase employee would honor that request. Nevertheless, even if true, ADP's actions-\"wholly ignor[ing] the correct voided check\" with the accurate account information-are negligent at best, and do not rise to the level of willful misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, Section 11(A)'s provision of \"actual damages\" for such willful and intentional\n   misconduct does not include consequential damages. Section 11.D explicitly limits liability with respect to all consequential and indirect damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Neither ADP, nor you will be responsible for special, indirect, or incidental, consequential or other similar damages (including lost profits or damages for business interruption or loss of information) that the other party may incur or experience in connection with this Agreement or the services, however caused and under whatever theory of liability, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Pope Decl. Ex. A \u00b6 11(D).) Thus, even if ADP's conduct was intentional, Plaintiffs would be unable to collect other claimed damages, such as \"financial expense, legal fees and lost sales.\" (Compl. \u00b6 180.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that ADP's limited liability provisions are void because the ADP Defendants \"acted with 'malice, recklessness, or callous indifference' to Plaintiffs' rights when they altered Trusgan's documents and hid their actions to avoid liability.\" (Pls.' Br. 7.) However, ADP's actions do not rise to the high level of extreme culpability such that the liability clause is nullified as a matter of law. At most, the Complaint alleges that Barnett or another ADP employee acted with the purpose of meeting a sales quota.

Selling trademarked goods under its trademarked name is not a violation of the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polymer Tech. Corp. v.

Label's argument that Schwartzman's sales were distinct from Label products by virtue of the quality of service makes no sense in light of the fact that Schwartzman was the Vice President of Sales at Label, making the quality of service he provided one and the same as the quality of service Label provided. Indeed, Label's counterclaims acknowledge that the complaints about \"the fit of the order,\n   delivery times, and customer service,\" were of the type that \"had become routine with respect to Schwartzman's work.\" (Counterclaims \u00b6 39.) At most, Schwartzman was providing the same level of service to Label's customers even when he placed orders with Label suppliers for himself. Thus, there is no distinction between the goods Schwartzman sold as Label goods and actual Label goods supplied under Schwartzman's watch. In other words, the Label Defendants cannot state a claim under the Lanham Act for false association based on Schwartzman selling what he represented to be Label goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Label argues that this statement is false because Schwartzman could not in fact provide the same product. (Label Br. 13.)
