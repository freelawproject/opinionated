(\"Hengbo\") filed this suit against Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\") and 10 Doe Defendants claiming that its contract with Apple to produce high purity alumina melt stock to make glass should be rescinded and that Apple breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Having considered the parties' briefs, the relevant law, and the record in this case, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Hengbo is a limited liability company organized under the laws of China. ECF No. 23 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 3. Hengbo manufactures, among other things, \"high purity alumina melt stock,\" which is used \"to make sapphire glass, a scratch resistant and durable form of glass used in consumer electronics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Apple is a California corporation that develops and sells products such as the Apple iPhone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Hengbo alleges that the names and capacities of the Doe defendants have not yet been ascertained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 23, 2014, Hengbo and Apple signed a Master Development and Supply Agreement (\"MDSA\") and a Statement of Work (\"SOW\") for Hengbo's production of high purity alumina melt stock for use in Apple's products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 6 (citing Compl. Exhs. A &amp; B). Hengbo argues that \"[t]he terms of the\n   <em>\n    MDSA\n   </em>\n   are onerous and unfair to Hengbo, and result directly from Apple's superior bargaining power and abuse thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hengbo pleads that the MDSA imposed obligations upon Hengbo, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Apple [will] \"periodically provide written forecasts indicating Apple's projected demand for each Good (each such forecast, a '\n   <em>\n    Forecast\n   </em>\n   '). Supplier [Hengbo] will accept each such Forecast upon receipt. Supplier [Hengbo] will timely commence the manufacture of Goods in order to deliver the Goods by the dates indicated in each Forecast.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Hengbo [is obligated] to \"accept and timely fulfill all Purchase Orders that Apple, or any Apple-authorized entity issues to procure Goods under this Agreement for use in Apple products (Apple and each of the foregoing entities, an '\n   <em>\n    Authorized Purchaser\n   </em>\n   ') by the delivery date requested in such Purchase Order so long as the number of Goods indicated does not exceed the quantity specified in the applicable Forecast.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"Regardless of initial manufacturing yields or any other circumstance, Supplier [Hengbo] will always timely start the manufacture of the Goods in order to fully and timely meet Apple's Forecasts.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9 (citing Compl. Exh. A \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.1, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By contrast, Hengbo pleads that \"the MDSA did not obligate Apple to do anything.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The MDSA stated: \"Authorized purchasers may, without charge, (i) cancel any Purchase Order, or any portion thereof; or (ii) reschedule the shipment dates of undelivered Goods and/or redirect shipments of Goods to alternate locations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (citing Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 4.2). Hengbo asserts the MDSA \"did not obligate Apple to purchase anything from Hengbo.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The MDSA stated: \"Authorized Purchasers are not obligated to purchase any Goods except pursuant to a Purchase Order it issues. Except for amounts due pursuant to a Purchase Order or SOW, Authorized Purchasers will not be responsible for any costs in connection with the supply or purchase of any Goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Compl. Exh. A \u00b6 4.5). \"In other words,\" Hengbo asserts, \"Hengbo was obligated to produce thousands of metric tons of high purity alumina stock to meet Apple's forecasts, but Apple was not obligated to do anything in return.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Beginning in the year 2014 until November 3, 2014, \"Apple's forecasts required Hengbo to produce hundreds of metric tons\" of high grade alumina stock each month (from June 1, 2014, the forecasts required 454 tons per month).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Because of these forecasts, Hengbo produced thousands of metric tons of high purity alumina stock that ultimately amounted to approximately 2,000 metric tons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16. To make this level of production possible, Hengbo enlarged its production capacity by building a new factory and hiring additional workers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Apple purchased none of the alumina stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Instead, Apple changed its forecast on November 3, 2014 when it \"abruptly reduced its forecasts from 454 metric tons per month to zero.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The result for Hengbo is that approximately 2,000 metric tons of alumina stock remain unused and unbought by Apple or \"any entity acting on its behalf\" in a warehouse in China, a situation Hengbo pleads resulted in $25,000,000 in damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Consequently, Hengbo's Complaint asserts two claims for relief. First Hengbo seeks enforcement of rescission of contract pursuant to California Civil Code \u00a7 1689(b)(2)-(4).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-22. Second, Hengbo alternatively claims a breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hengbo filed this case on January 22, 2018, more than three-and-a-half years after the issues that gave rise to the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. The original version of the Complaint contained certain redactions, so it was accompanied by a Motion to file Under Seal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 4. After Magistrate Judge Cousins denied the Motion to File Documents Under Seal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19, Hengbo refiled its original Complaint without any redactions. ECF No. 23. Apple was served on January 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 2, 2018, the Court granted the parties' stipulation to extend Apple's deadline to answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint to April 20, 2018. ECF No. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 20, 2018, Apple filed its Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint. ECF No. 34 (\"MTD\"). On April 24, 2018, the parties filed a Joint Case Management Statement (\"JCMS\"). ECF No. 37. In the JCMS, the parties discussed their respective stance on the facts, the legal issues, the scope of discovery, and the filing of motions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In particular, the JCMS stated that \"[t]he parties are additionally contemplating, but have not yet decided, whether to move to compel arbitration,\" and that \"Plaintiff reserves its right to move to compel contractual arbitration at a later date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the case management conference (\"CMC\") on May 2, 2018-101 days after Hengbo filed its Complaint-counsel for Hengbo again represented that it had not yet decided whether to seek arbitration and that \"it's just a matter of the client making up their mind.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 43 at 3-4. After the CMC, the Court issued its Case Management Order and gave Hengbo until May 11, 2018 to file a statement regarding whether it intends to move to compel arbitration, and June 1, 2018 to file any motion to compel arbitration. ECF No. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 11, 2018, Hengbo filed its Notice of Intent to File a Motion to Compel Arbitration. ECF No. 44. On June 1, 2018, 43 days after Apple filed its Motion to Dismiss and 131 days after Hengo initiated the lawsuit, Plaintiff Hengbo filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration. ECF No. 45 (\"MTC\"). On June 4, 2018, Hengbo filed an Opposition to Apple's Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 47 (\"MTD Opp'n\"). On June 15, 2018, Apple filed an Opposition to Hengbo's Motion to Compel Arbitration. ECF No. 48 (\"MTC Opp'n\"). On June 19, 2018, Apple filed its Reply to the Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 50 (\"MTD Reply\"). On June 22, 2018, Hengbo filed its Reply to the Motion to Compel Arbitration. ECF No. 52 (\"MTC Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 22, 2018, Hengbo filed an Administrative Motion to Advance the Hearing Date so that this Court would hear Plaintiff's June 1, 2018 Motion to Compel before or at the same time as Apple's March 20, 2018 Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 53. Apple opposed on June 26, 2018. ECF No. 54. Because the Court rules on the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion to Compel Arbitration simultaneously, the Court DENIES AS MOOT Plaintiff's administrative motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As an initial matter, the parties dispute in what order the Court must decide the Motion to Compel Arbitration and the Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff Hengbo says the Court is compelled to address the Motion to Compel first. See MTC 6-8. In response, Defendant Apple asserts it will be prejudiced if the Court decides Plaintiff's\n   later filed Motion to Compel before Apple's earlier filed Motion to Dismiss. MTC Opp'n at 2. However, neither party cites to a Ninth Circuit case that compels the Court to decide a defendant's motion to dismiss and a plaintiff's motion to compel in any particular order, nor does the Court's own review reveal any case law mandating specific action by the Court. Therefore, having surveyed the case law, the Court is not convinced that there is any mandated order in which the court must decide these motions. However, because the Court finds it to be in the interest of efficiency to consider the motions simultaneously, the Court does so, turning first to the Motion to Compel Arbitration. A favorable ruling for Plaintiff on the Motion to Compel Arbitration would eliminate any need to consider the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Before addressing the Motion to Compel Arbitration, the Court must briefly address the Motion to Dismiss. Hengbo's Complaint asserts two claims for relief: rescission and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 23-28. Apple moves to dismiss both claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 1. In its briefing, Hengbo concedes that it \"agrees with Apple that there is sufficient consideration for the MDSA,\" and therefore Hengbo \"withdraw[s] its claim for rescission of the MDSA for failure of consideration.\" MTC at 11; MTD Opp'n at 1 n. 1, 7. The Court agrees with the parties that the contract was supported with adequate consideration because the Agreement required Apple to pay Hengbo up to $8 million for certain equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Exh. B \u00b6 5. Accordingly, Hengbo's claim for rescission must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unidad de Fe y Amor Corp. v.

Cal. June 25, 2009) (\"[T]he claim for rescission ... contemplates the formation of a contract in the first instance.\"). Therefore, the Court DISMISSES Hengbo's claim for rescission with prejudice. The remainder of this order focuses on the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This case presents the unique situation where Plaintiff Hengbo, after filing a complaint in federal court that claimed that there was no valid contract and thus no valid arbitration clause, abandoned that claim, then moved to compel arbitration. Hengbo argues that its claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing should be sent to arbitration because (1) the MDSA contains a valid and enforceable arbitration clause, and (2) Hengbo's claim against Apple falls within the scope of the arbitration clause. MTC at 10-13. Apple responds that Hengbo has waived its right to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC Opp'n at 9-24.

Admittedly, the case law is more robust when a plaintiff opposes a defendant's motion to compel arbitration, not the reverse situation present here. For instance, the Ninth Circuit has said, \"[t]o prove prejudice,\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   must show more than 'self-inflicted' wounds that they incurred as a direct result of suing in federal court contrary to the provisions of an arbitration agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). \"Such wounds include costs incurred in preparing the complaint, serving notice, or engaging in limited litigation regarding issues directly related to the complaint's filing, such as jurisdiction or venue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, much of the inquiry when it comes to a plaintiff claiming prejudice from a defendant's motion to compel arbitration requires the court to determine what expenses were self-inflicted by a plaintiff opting to litigate in the first place and what were a result of a defendant's own delay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Ernst &amp; Young, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120784\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/1072/#p1075\">\n    744 F.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (9th Cir. 2013) (\"[Plaintiff] Ms. Richards was a 'part[y] to an agreement making arbitration of disputes mandatory,' and therefore '[a]ny extra expense incurred as a result of [Ms. Richards's] deliberate choice of an improper forum, in contravention of their contract, cannot be charged to' [defendant].\");\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1124\">\n    829 F.3d at 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (At the point that \"the defendants' actions have shown that they, too, have sought at least for some period of time to attempt to resolve the issue in court rather than in arbitration,\" \"the cost and expenses of litigating in district court are no longer simply 'self-inflicted' wounds on the part of the plaintiffs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   As to the opposite scenario present here where a defendant claims prejudice from a plaintiff's later filed motion to compel arbitration, the case law is less developed. This is likely because of the uniqueness of a situation where a plaintiff, who initially chose federal court, changes its mind and decides to seek arbitration. While the heart of the inquiry should be the same when considering prejudice to a defendant from a plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration, the relevant facts in that inquiry are necessarily different. For one, a defendant is not the party who initiated the litigation; instead a defendant must defend itself in\n   an ever-progressing case. Thus, none of the defense expenses can fairly be said to be \"self-inflicted\" wounds when the plaintiff was the one to file the lawsuit and is also the one that later decides to move to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339769\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1118/#p1124\">\n    829 F.3d at 1126-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As an initial matter then, all of Apple's costs incurred as a result of Hengbo's decision to litigate this case, including its rescission claim, in federal court are fairly attributable to Hengbo. The facts are clear that Hengbo filed suit claiming that the whole contract, including the arbitration clause, was invalid, and Hengbo would not make a decision to arbitrate. Plaintiff's counsel acknowledged this was because the client was still making a decision whether to pursue arbitration, but also that there was a question \"as to whether [the arbitration clause] is enforceable under these circumstances.\" ECF No. 43 at 7. In the meantime, Apple had to move to dismiss because Hengbo had forced Apple to litigate, and its clock to respond to the Complaint was ticking. These costs were prejudicial to Apple, especially when Hengbo now turns around and dismisses half of its complaint to try to get to an arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In response, Hengbo argues that legal expenses alone are insufficient to show prejudice and that\n   <em>\n    UCS\n   </em>\n   is instructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC Reply at 13-15. There, the Ninth Circuit said that defendant AT &amp; T was not prejudiced when AT &amp; T argued only that \"it has incurred substantial costs in litigating this matter,\" because plaintiff's \"request for damages and a jury trial never got past the pleading stage\" and \"the district court proceedings involved primarily a motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451710\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/756/#p765\">\n    298 F.3d at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To let Hengbo get out of the forum it initially chose to pursue a forum it clearly perceives as more favorable at this point would be prejudicial to Apple. Allowing Hengbo to do so would result in a waste of resources, not just for the parties, but also the Court, that had to expend time and effort to honor Hengbo's first choice to seek litigation. Hengbo's actions are the very definition of forum shopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Hengbo counters that the forum shopping cases that Apple cites all involved the situation where arbitration was sought after \"the court issued a ruling that foreshadowed future unfavorable rulings for the movant.\" MTC Reply at 10;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , 829 F.3d as 1128 &amp; n.4 (defendant filed after court denied its motion to dismiss);\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

Cal. Apr. 29, 2015) (same). Hengbo therefore maintains that Apple cannot be prejudiced. The Court is not convinced that Hengbo's distinction is important for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, like the case law on prejudice generally, much of the forum shopping case law focuses on the perspective of whether a\n   <em>\n    defendant'\n   </em>\n   s later filed motion to compel arbitration is prejudicial to a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff.\n   </em>\n   In this context, the forum-shopping inquiry is more complex because it is not immediately obvious if the defendant has selected a forum. By contrast, in the instant case, Plaintiff Hengbo elected to file in federal court so that Hengbo could seek to rescind the contract and arbitration clause. Now that Hengbo concedes that its rescission claim lacks merit and thus withdraws\n   the claim, Hengbo seeks arbitration. Thus, it is clear that Hengbo selected a forum, withdrew its claim, and engaged in forum shopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, to the extent that the available cases do stand for the proposition that an attempt to avoid negative rulings is evidence of forum shopping, the Court finds that this line of argument also demonstrates prejudice. As an initial matter, the Court agrees with Apple that Hengbo should not benefit from the fact that the Court was not able to issue a ruling on Apple's Motion to Dismiss in the 43 days it was pending before Hengbo decided to seek a new forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTC Opp'n at 18-21. That in itself would be prejudicial to Apple.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , 829 F.3d at n. 4 (\"More important, whatever the judge may have done, the defendants\n   <em>\n    sought\n   </em>\n   a ruling on the merits.\"). However, the facts are clear that Hengbo\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   , in effect, receive an unfavorable ruling. Although self-imposed, Hengbo opted to withdraw 50 percent of its Complaint after reading Apple's Motion to Dismiss. The Court therefore finds that the third element of waiver-prejudice-has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that waiver is satisfied by the fact that Plaintiff Hengbo\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , knowing of its right to arbitrate, instead filed a Complaint in federal court, asserted there was no valid agreement and inherently no valid agreement to arbitrate, requested damages and a jury trial, forced Apple to litigate, waited to see Apple's Motion to Dismiss, continued to weigh the decision to arbitrate until this Court imposed a deadline, and then ultimately moved to compel over four months since it first picked this forum. Having found that Hengbo waived its right to arbitrate, the Court therefore DENIES Hengbo's Motion to Compel Arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Apple moves to dismiss Hengbo's claims for rescission and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. MTD at 1. Hengbo concedes that it \"agrees with Apple that there is sufficient consideration for the MDSA,\" and therefore Hengbo \"withdraw[s] its claim for rescission of the MDSA for failure of consideration.\" MTC at 11; MTD Opp'n at 1 n.1, 7. As discussed above, the Court agrees with the parties and dismisses Hengbo's claim for rescission with prejudice. The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion to Dismiss Hengbo's claim for rescission with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Turning next to Hengbo's claim for breach of the implied covenant, Hengbo alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 Implied into the MDSA is an obligation imposed upon Apple-which had unbridled discretion in connection with the MDSA and the forecasts made pursuant thereto-to exercise Apple's discretion in good faith. Specifically, even if the MDSA did not obligate Apple to buy anything from Hengbo, the implied covenant still required Apple to provide realistic, good faith forecasts, as the MDSA obligated Hengbo to produce sufficient material to meet Apple's forecasts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 Apple breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the\n   contract by forecasting 454 metric tons of high grade alumina melt stock from June 1, 2014 to November 3, 2014, when such forecasts grossly overstated Apple's needs during that time period. Apple knew or should have known long before November 3, 2014 that it did not need 454 metric tons of high grade alumina melt stock, and was obligated in good faith to adjust its forecasts and so inform Hengbo.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 As a direct and proximate result of Apple's breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the MDSA, Hengbo was damaged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Importantly, Hengbo hinges its breach allegations on Apple's \"forecasts.\" Apple argues that Hengbo's claim for breach of the implied covenant fails because \"Hengbo alleges that the express terms of the Agreement provide that the volume requirement of the Agreement would be left to the 'unbridled discretion' of Apple and its authorized partners,\" and \"the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot operate to imply terms in the Agreement that contradict its explicit requirements.\" MTD at 3, 12.

For instance, Hengbo's Complaint clearly alleged that Apple had to provide \"realistic, good faith forecasts,\" and that the express terms of the Agreement (that was referenced in and attached to the Complaint) stated that Apple will \"periodically provide written forecasts indicating Apple's projected demand for each Good.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20P.3d%201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Additionally, despite the explicit text of the Agreement with respect to the forecast provision, Apple focuses on some sloppy language that Hengbo placed in its Complaint that Apple maintains dooms Hengbo's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Reply at 8-10. In particular, Apple zeroes in on paragraph 26 of the Complaint where Hengbo stated: \"[i]mplied into the MDSA is an obligation imposed upon Apple-which had unbridled discretion in connection with the MDSA and the forecasts made pursuant thereto-to exercise Apple's discretion in good faith.\" Although it is unfortunate that Hengbo has one broad statement in its Complaint that carelessly fails to specify which part of the Agreement gave Apple \"unbridled discretion,\" the Court is to construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manzarek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552352\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1025/#p1031\">\n    519 F.3d at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and here Hengbo made allegations consistent with the implied covenant. Moreover, the sentence following Hengbo's sloppy statement clarifies that Apple's unbridled discretion specifically went to the purchase provision,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the forecast provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 26. Indeed much of the confusion in Apple's briefing seems to go to the fact that the purchase provision undoubtedly provides for unfettered discretion; the text of the MDSA as to the purchase provision provides that \"Authorized Purchasers [including Apple]\n   <em>\n    are not obligated\n   </em>\n   to purchase any Goods except pursuant to a Purchase Order it issues.\" Compl.

However, while this language looks more like the language in\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Third Music Story\n   </em>\n   , it is not the provision upon which Hengbo bases the breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, because the text of the forecast provision did not confer unfettered discretion on Apple with respect to the forecasting of demand, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stonebrae, L.P. v.

Apple does nothing to explain this difference. Bad faith in the manner Apple argues is therefore not required, and as the California Supreme Court has said, the implied covenant can be breached by objectively unreasonable conduct. Thus, Hengbo has successfully pled a claim for breach of the implied covenant if it has alleged objectively unreasonable conduct on the part of Apple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The parties' dispute ends there because Apple does not argue that Hengbo failed to allege that Apple acted in an objectively unreasonable way. Specifically, Hengbo has alleged that Apple forecasted hundreds of metric tons of high grade alumina stock each month (from June to November of 2014) that lead to the production of over 2,000 metric tons of alumina stock when Apple did not need that stock as evidenced by the fact that this pattern went on for over four months and Apple did not purchase, leading to damages to Hengbo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-18, 23-28. This statement sufficiently alleges that Apple acted in an objectively unreasonable manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In sum, Apple's arguments against Hengbo's breach of the implied covenant claim fail. The Court therefore DENIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Apple's Motion to Dismiss Hengbo's implied covenant claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
