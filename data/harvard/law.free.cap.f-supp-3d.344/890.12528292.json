No. 276), to wit: Claim 21 of the '850 Patent is not enabled because when the claimed integer in claim element H is equal to a negative number or zero, the claimed \"virtual transmission time interval\" becomes a negative time interval or zero time interval, amounting to being able to stop or reverse time, while when the claimed integer is \"very large,\" the claimed invention \"would result in delays that would interfere with the operation of the overall system\" and \"effectively tells the phone it can never transmit.\" (Dkt. No. 616. at 4.) LG asserts that it's expert, Mr. Lanning, presented evidence to this effect, and that Core's expert did not rebut it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing 9/15/16 Morning Session, Dkt. No. 43 at 6:15-8:2; 9/15/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 44 at 42:13-69:15).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Core responds that it is not required to show that non-operable embodiments are enabled, and that LG's expert, Mr. Lanning, agreed that \"one of ordinary skill would know, without undue experimentation, 'that time cannot move backwards,' that 'time cannot stand still,' and that using large integers 'would not make any sense either' as 'the cell phone would never transmit.' \" (Dkt. No. 624 at 1 (citing 9/15/16 Morning Session, Dkt. No. 43 at 8:6-24).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As previously noted by the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The relevant enablement question is whether \"undue experimentation\" is required to identify and practice the operative embodiments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlas\n   </em>\n   , 750 F.2d at 1576 ;\n   <em>\n    Allergan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768295\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1293/#p1309\">\n    796 F.3d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . LG's Motion does not present evidence or argument that any experimentation is necessary to practice claim 21 in light of the specification. LG's only mention of experimentation is contained in the statement \"[t]he specification does not teach a person of ordinary skill in the art how to make or use an inoperable embodiment, and no amount of experimentation could remedy this problem.\" (Dkt. No. 276 at 6). This is not the test for enablement. If it was, any claim that encompasses an inoperative embodiment-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   a claim that fails to remind the user to plug in the computer-would automatically be invalid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Dkt. No. 532 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The situation has not changed. LG presented no evidence at trial that undue experimentation would be needed to determine that negative, zero, and very large integer values would render the embodiment inoperable. While LG asserts that \"[i]t is undisputed that when the integer is negative or zero, the invention would require time to run backwards or stand still-something that the '850 patent specification does not enable a person of ordinary skill (or anyone, for that matter) to do without considerable experimentation,\" the Court finds that the jury likely understood that a person of ordinary skill would not experiment in time travel. Further, while Mr. Lanning testified that \"there's a lot of\n   experimentation that would be required to figure out how large [an integer] is too large,\" (Dkt. No. 43 at 9:18-19,) the question is not whether there is some, or even a large amount, of experimentation, but whether such experimentation was \"undue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atlas Powder Co. v.

The Court finds that there was adequate evidence for a reasonable jury to find that one skilled in art would understand that Claim 21 did not claim time travel; further, as Mr. Lanning did not investigate integers over 4, there is no evidence that large integers are not adequately described, even if such numbers were not ideal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alcon Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237161\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/1180/#p1188\">\n    745 F.3d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]ritten description is about whether the skilled reader of the patent disclosure can recognize that what was claimed corresponds to what was described; it is not about whether the patentee has proven to the skilled reader that the invention works, or how to make it work, which is an enablement issue.\").

Mr. Lanning's full discussion of the Willars Patent was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. What about the Willars patent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. The Willars patent is a patent that's assigned to Ericsson. They're a very large cell phone equipment provider, if you're not familiar with the company. The Willars patent describes how the mobile phone -- how the cell phone, it can go to sleep at times when it doesn't need to receive information or send information to the base station.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   And what's shown by this figure from the Willars patent, it's actually an issued patent. The highlighted boxes or the highlighted sections in yellow are where the cell phone would wake up, listen to the base station, and then also send if it needed to send.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   And so this patent's describing this discontinuous transmission, discontinuous reception where the cell phone doesn't need to stay on and listen all the time nor does it need to try to send all the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (9/15/16 Morning Session, Dkt. No. 43 at 15:7-22.) The Court notes that at no time in this analysis did Mr. Lanning use the phrase \"check to determine\" or compare the Willars Patent to the language of Claim 21 of the '850 Patent. Accordingly, when Mr. Lanning later stated that the \"check to determine\" claim element was met, a reasonable jury could have discounted his otherwise conclusory statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Further, Mr. Lanning's testimony that a person of skill in the art would combine the Samsung and Willars references is limited to \"both of these are patents that relate to the same type of cellular network. They're both in the same technology area. One's from Samsung, which is a large supplier of cellular equipment. The other is Ericsson. That's a supplier of cellular equipment as well. So the engineers -- a person of ordinary skill in the art would be aware of these references and be motivated to combine these two together.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:3-10.) Such conclusory analysis is insufficient for the Court to determine that no reasonable jury could have found to the contrary or determined that Mr. Lanning\n   was not credible, especially in light of Mr. Lanning's earlier comments that cellular equipment engineers would need extensive experimentation to determine that cell phones could not travel through time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:11-14 (\"If you think about it, if that n equals minus, you're asking the cell phone to go back in time.

Accordingly, there was no evidence from which a jury could find that IS-54 anticipates.\" (Dkt. No. 624 at 9 (citing 9/14/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 42 at 127:16-18; 133:4-6).) Core further responded that \"Dr. Fuja provided no testimony as to how or why Claim 19 would have been obvious over IS-54 alone, given at least the predetermined threshold element. Rather, Dr. Fuja made a purely conclusory assertion, which does not suffice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing 9/14/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 42 at 127:16-18; 133:4-6).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Dr. Fuja testified that the second step of claim element [d2] stated \"which additionally contains a bit pattern which deviates from a bit pattern corresponding to a message at most by a pre-determined threshold value.\" (9/14/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 42 at 76:3-5.) On cross examination, Dr. Fuja testified that he had not discussed \"a pre-determined threshold value\" (9/14/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 42 at 127:16-18 (\"Q. Okay. I may have missed it, Dr. Fuja, but did you testify about a pre-determined threshold value on direct? A. I don't recall that I did, no.\").) On re-cross, Dr. Fuja reiterated that he was not asked about the pre-defined threshold. (9/14/16 Afternoon Session, Dkt. No. 42 at 127:16-18 (\"Q. On redirect, you still were not asked about pre-defined threshold, correct? A. That is correct.\").) In light of Dr. Fuja's admissions that he did not discuss a claim element, the Court finds that a reasonable jury could have found that LG failed to prove that the IS-54 reference anticipated Claim 19 of the '536 Patent and the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Motion as to such issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Obviousness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   LG argues that the Claim 19 is obvious in light of the combination of the IS-54 and Brolin references, as well as by the combination of the IS-54 and Davis references. (Dkt. No. 616 at 16-17, 17.) LG's only argument as to the Brolin reference is that \"Brolin teaches using a unique signature to distinguish between one of three transmission modes. One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the method of distinguishing between different transmission modes taught in Brolin with the IS-54 frame stealing solution to address the common problem of transmitting different types of data over the same line.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) LG's only argument as to Davis is that it \"teaches switching between data and speech modes using a parity failed signal coupled with codewords for each of the two modes. One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine the method of distinguishing between data and speech modes taught in Davis with the IS-54 frame stealing solution to address the common problem of transmitting different types of data over the same line.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court finds, as Dr. Fuja admitted, that he never testified as to the \"pre-determined threshold value claim,\" and accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that LG had not presented clear and convincing evidence that all of the elements of Claim 19 of the '536 Patent were found in the prior art, either alone or in combination. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Motion as to such issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
