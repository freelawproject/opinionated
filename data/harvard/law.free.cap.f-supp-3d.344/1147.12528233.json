(Dkt. No. 40.) Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 31, 2018. (Dkt. No. 42.) Defendant filed a reply on September 14, 2018. (Dkt. No. 45.) Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the Court finds the matter suitable for adjudication without oral argument. Based on the reasoning below, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2018, Plaintiff San Diego County Credit Union (\"SDCCU\") filed a complaint against Defendant Citizens Equity First Credit Union (\"CEFCU\") for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of trademarks and related claims. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl.) SDCCU owns over 40 federally registered trademarks in connection with its credit union services, including U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%204%2C560%2C596\">\n    Registration No. 4,560,596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"IT'S NOT BIG BANK BANKING. IT'S BETTER\" (the \"SDCCU Mark\") which issued on July 1, 2014. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 25; Dkt. No. 1-2, Compl., Ex. A.) CEFCU owns U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C952%2C993\">\n    Registration No. 3,952,993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"CEFCU. NOT A BANK. BETTER\" (the \"CEFCU Mark\") which issued on May 3, 2011. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 33; Dkt. No. 1-3, Compl., Ex. B.) Prior to filing the trademark application for the CEFCU Mark, CEFCU conducted a trademark search report and, on information and belief, learned that several third-party credit unions already used trademarks similar to the CEFCU Mark such as \"NOT A BANK - BETTER!\", \"BETTER THAN A BANK\", and \"IT'S NOT A BANK\" (\"Third Party Marks\"). (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SDCCU and CEFCU are both large credit unions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) SDCCU's customers are primarily located in Southern California while CEFCU's customers are primarily located in Peoria, Illinois and northern California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the end of 2008, CEFCU purchased Valley Credit\n   Union in Northern California but did not direct its marketing bearing the CEFCU Mark or CEFCU's Common Law Mark in connection with credit union services outside the Illinois market until June 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) In June 2011, CEFCU started using the CEFCU Mark in connection with marketing campaigns in the Illinois and California markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2016, a CEFCU employee saw a billboard in San Diego, CA containing the SDCCU Mark used to market credit union services and notified CEFCU managers in March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) On May 17, 2017, CEFCU filed a petition for cancellation\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the '596 Trademark Registration No. for the SDCCU Mark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's (\"USPTO\") Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (\"TTAB\") claiming the SDCCU Mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive consumers when viewing CEFCU's Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 39; Dkt. No. 1-5, Compl., Ex. D.) On July 3, 2017, SDCCU filed an Answer and Counterclaim in the cancellation proceeding. (Dkt. No. 29-3, Dabney Decl., Ex. 3.) On August 7, 2017, CEFCU filed an Answer to the Counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4.) On August 28, 2017, SDCCU filed an Amended Counterclaim to which CEFCU timely answered on September 11, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 5. 6.) A scheduling order was issued and discovery has taken place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 7.) On March 23, 2018, CEFCU filed a motion for leave to amend its petition to add an additional ground for cancellation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 17.) Then on May 16, 2018, SDCCU filed this action and moved the PTO for a stay of the cancellation proceedings which the PTO granted on June 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. 1, 23, 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this action, the complaint alleges that the CEFCU Mark is, in fact, more similar to each of the Third Party Marks than it is to the SDCCU Mark. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 7.) Therefore, if CEFCU believes that the scope of protection for its mark is broad enough to encompass the SDCCU Mark, CEFCU materially misrepresented to the USPTO that the CEFCU Mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the other hand, if CEFCU believes that its mark was not confusingly similar to any of the Third-Party marks, the CEFCU Mark cannot be broad enough to encompass the SDCCU Mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In either case, CEFCU's cancellation action and threat of lawsuit are objectively baseless and brought with the subjective intent to harm SDCCU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SDCCU asserts it has a reasonable apprehension that CEFCU will file a lawsuit against it alleging trademark infringement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaint alleges eight causes of action seeking 1) declaratory judgment of non-infringement of CEFCU. NOT A BANK. BETTER.; 2) declaratory judgment of non-infringement of NOT A BANK. BETTER.; 3) declaratory judgment for invalidity of CEFCU. NOT A BANK.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 31, 2018, the Court denied Defendant's motion for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 39.) On August 13, 2018, Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the first four causes of action arguing\n   Plaintiff has not asserted a justiciable claim for alleged infringement under the Declaratory Judgment Act. (Dkt. No. 40.) Defendant additionally moves to dismiss the remaining causes of action for failure to state a claim. In response, Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant's motion to dismiss the seventh and eighth causes of action and agrees to voluntarily dismiss them. (Dkt. No 42 at 31\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss the seventh cause of action for unfair competition under California Business &amp; Professions Code section 17200 and eighth cause of action under California common law as unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiff disagrees arguing it alleged facts to support a cause of action under Rule 9 by asserting the who, what, when, where and how of the alleged fraudulent trademark registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Complaint alleges that on September 1, 2010, CEFCU filed a declaration from its Vice-President, Susan K. Yoder, with the USPTO during the registration of the CEFCU Mark, asserting that the CEFCU Mark was used in interstate commerce as of February 5, 2007 with the intent to deceive the USPTO in order to advance CEFCU's Mark registration. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 88; Dkt. No. 1-4, Compl., Ex. C.) But prior to June 2011, CEFCU did not direct its advertising using its Mark outside of the Illinois market. (Dkt. No. 1, Compl. \u00b6 36.) In addition, Plaintiff alleges that CEFCU falsely stated that its Mark would not likely cause consumer confusion with respect to pre-existing marks of which it was aware including Third Party Marks such as the \"IT'S NOT A BANK\" mark of Warren Federal Credit Union, \"BETTER THAN A BANK\" mark of ABNB Federal Credit Union and \"NOT A BANK-BETTER!\" mark of United 1st Federal Credit Union. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 89.) The false assertion was made with the intent to deceive the USPTO so that its Mark would advance to registration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) CEFCU's Mark would have not advanced to registration if CEFCU had not declared that the CEFCU Mark would not likely cause consumer confusion concerning pre-existing marks for credit union services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On information and belief, the false statements in the declaration filed with the USPTO were willful and meant to deceive and constitute fraud.

Plaintiff alleges the who, what, when, where and how of the alleged false statement made to the USPTO. Defendant's arguments focus on the merits of the claim, which is not appropriate on a motion to dismiss, rather than whether the elements of the claim were properly alleged. Moreover, contrary to Defendant's argument that Plaintiff failed to allege a subjective intent to deceive the PTO with particularity, Rule 9(b) does not require specificity concerning intent but specifically states that [m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally.\" Fed.
