NATHAN, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from Plaintiff Terrance Tears' 2002 implantation with the Greenfield Filter, a vena cava filter manufactured by Defendant Boston Scientific Corporation (\"BSC\"). Tears seeks compensatory and punitive damages from BSC for alleged negligence, strict products liability, breach of express and implied warranties, fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of New York General Business Law (\"GBL\") Sections 349 and 350. Before the Court is BSC's motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons provided below, BSC's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in full with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from Tears' complaint, from the documents incorporated by reference therein, and from the additional materials appended to BSC's filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helprin v. Harcourt, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096411\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/277/327/#p330\">\n    277 F.Supp.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"While the court may not consider matters outside the pleadings, it may consider documents ... incorporated by reference, documents that are integral to the plaintiff's claims, even if not explicitly incorporated by reference, and matters of which judicial notice may be taken.\") (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The inferior vena cava (\"IVC\") is a \"vein that returns blood to the heart from the lower extremities.\" Compl. \u00b6 29. Blood clots can travel through the IVC from the leg or pelvis into the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism, a potentially life threatening condition. To mitigate this risk, individuals susceptible to clotting are often treated with anticoagulants. For individuals \"who are at high risk\" of clotting \"or for whom anticoagulants are contraindicated, doctors may recommend implantation of an IVC filter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. An IVC filter is a medical device that is inserted into the IVC to trap and filter clots from the lower extremities before they reach the lungs. There are two kinds of IVC filters currently on the market: permanent IVC filters, and retrievable IVC filters. Defendant BSC is the manufacturer of the Greenfield IVC Filter, a metal filter designed for permanent implantation \"to prevent, among other things, recurrent pulmonary embolism via placement in the vena cava.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about October 30, 2002, Tears underwent a surgical implantation of the Greenfield Filter following his hospitalization for \"pulmonary embolism related issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. The Filter was implanted in his \"right femoral vein.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. In 2015, Tears \"began experiencing pains and problems in his chest region,\" which can be caused by \"malfunctioning IVC filters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66. On January 15, 2016, an abdominal scan revealed that Tears' IVC filter was located at the level of his L3-L4 vertebrae. On October 11, 2017, Tears filed the instant suit against BSC in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York alleging that the Greenfield Filter is \"unreasonably dangerous\" and \"faulty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3. According to the complaint, Tears suffers \"constant pains in the abdominal region\" and is \"at risk of suffering from serious health complication[s],\" including \"the risk of the filter migrating to the other parts of the vena cava, heart, lungs or other organs\" as a result of the filter's defect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. The complaint further alleges that BSC \"knew its IVC filters were defective in design\" and \"failed to disclose to physicians, patients, or [to Tears]\" the risks associated with permanent implantation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 14, 2017, BSC filed a notice of removal to this Court. Dkt. No. 1. On December 21, 2017, BSC filed a motion to dismiss Tears' Complaint in its entirety. Dkt. No. 5. In response to an Order from the Court, Tears filed a letter on January 18, 2018, announcing its intention to rely on its pleadings rather than take the opportunity to amend. Dkt. No. 14. Tears filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss on January 22, 2018, Dkt. No. 16, and BSC filed its reply on January 29, 2018, Dkt. No. 17. The December 21, 2017 motion to dismiss now before the Court is therefore fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

According to BSC, Tears' injury allegations are either \"(i) conclusory allegations and injuries not alleged to be caused by a defect in Plaintiff's Greenfield filter, [or] (ii) injuries that Plaintiff claims can be caused by IFC filters generally or as to which he is at risk, absent any allegation that he himself has experienced such injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. It is true that many statements in the complaint concerning Tears' injuries are nothing more than conclusory statements, devoid of specific facts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 77 (\"As a direct and proximate result of the wrongful acts and omissions of Defendant, Plaintiff suffered severe injuries, including but not limited to economic damages, severe permanent injuries, emotional distress, psychological trauma of living with a defective product implanted in Plaintiff's body.\").
