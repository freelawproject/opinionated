INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this matter, the Court finds itself in a difficult position; it has been asked to rule\n   on discovery in an action overseen by a different United States district court, the Southern District of Ohio, related to the voting rights of Ohio citizens; an issue with little to no connection to Washington, D.C. Pending before the Court are five motions to quash or enforce subpoenas issued by the Southern District of Ohio seeking documents and testimony from recipients in Washington, D.C. The Plaintiffs in the underlying action-five organizations and several individuals who are Democratic voters living in Ohio-have asked this Court to transfer two of the subpoena disputes back to the Southern District of Ohio, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45. One of the subpoena recipients, E. Mark Braden, has also asked this Court to transfer the disputes in which he is involved. Several of the subpoena recipients, however, resist transfer. Despite their protestations, as explained below, the Court concludes that transfer is appropriate under Federal Rule 45, given the nature of the disputes and the posture and complexity of the underlying action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the underlying action, Plaintiffs are challenging Ohio's 2011 congressional redistricting process-which resulted in the state's sixteen current United States congressional districts-as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2,\n   <em>\n    APRI\n   </em>\n   , S.D. Ohio ECF No. 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs claim that Ohio's congressional districts resulted from \"a coordinated strategy by state and national Republicans to win control of the state legislature for the purpose of controlling the redistricting process.\" Movants' Mem.

Plaintiffs further claim that, having gained control, the Republicans deliberately excluded non-Republicans from the redistricting process and crafted a congressional district map that \"would virtually guarantee\" that Republicans would consistently win twelve districts and Democrats would win four districts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-61. Plaintiffs argue that the state's congressional district map \"intentionally burdens their: (1) First Amendment rights to associate for the advancement of their political beliefs, to express their political views, and to participate in the political process; (2) First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to cast a meaningful vote; and (3) Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection under the law,\" and that it \"exceeds powers granted to the states under Article I of the Constitution.\" RNC Compel Mot. at 1; SAC \u00b6 9. Plaintiffs' complaint, filed in the Southern District of Ohio earlier this year,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeks (1) a declaration that Ohio's congressional district map is unconstitutional; and (2) an order enjoining any further elections under the map and requiring the implementation of a\n   new map for use in future elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   SAC \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties are now in discovery and, as explained in greater detail below, the Southern District of Ohio Judge overseeing the proceedings, Judge Timothy S. Black, has set an expedited discovery and trial schedule. Acting swiftly, so as to complete discovery before the December 19, 2018 deadline, Plaintiffs have subpoenaed several national Republican organizations and individuals associated with those organizations, seeking documents and testimony that Plaintiffs believe will flesh out the alleged conspiracy between national and Ohio Republicans to unconstitutionally redraw Ohio's congressional districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Certain recipients of Plaintiffs' subpoenas have resisted disclosing responsive documents that Plaintiffs believe are not protected by any privilege, and have conducted document searches that Plaintiffs believe are insufficient to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The subpoena disputes involving subpoena recipients located in Washington, D.C. have been raised before this Court, rather than before the Southern District of Ohio, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following is a brief description of the relevant subpoena recipients and their disputes with Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiffs claim that the RSLC, among other national Republican organizations, attempted \"to control the redistricting process in Ohio by guiding state Republican officials in creating a map to maximize the Republican share of Ohio's congressional delegation,\" and that as Chairman Mr. Gillespie was a \"central architect\" of these efforts. Gillespie Compel Mot. at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Morgan is a \"professional demographer\"-an expert in population composition and distribution-who \"regularly provide[s] services to states and localities responsible for drawing electoral maps.\" Decl. of John Morgan (\"Morgan Decl.\") \u00b6 3, Gillespie Compel Opp'n Ex.

In supplying his services, he visited Ohio twice in 2011 to administer \"in-person, on sight training and guidance to the [Ohio] map drawers.\" Morgan Decl. \u00b6 8; SAC \u00b6 49.

Both individuals have resisted searching for and producing documents created prior to 2011, because they claim that those documents are unrelated to the 2011 Ohio redistricting and thus not relevant to Plaintiffs' action.

The Court then considers Plaintiffs' motions to transfer their subpoena disputes with Mr. Gillespie, Mr. Morgan, the RNC, the NRCC, and Mr. Kincaid to the Southern District of Ohio. Because Mr. Braden has consented to the transfer of his subpoena disputes, the Court grants his motions to transfer under Federal Rule 45(f). While Respondents do not consent to the transfer of their subpoena disputes, the Court concludes that the disputes raise \"exceptional circumstances\" warranting transfer, also under Federal Rule 45(f).

As noted, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, the court where subpoena compliance is required may transfer a subpoena dispute to the court that issued the subpoena \"if the person subject to the subpoena consents.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f). The subpoenas served on Mr. Braden were issued from the Southern District of Ohio and require compliance in Washington, D.C., over which this Court has jurisdiction. Moreover, Mr. Braden has consented to the transfer of his motions to quash the subpoenas; in fact, he seeks the transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Braden Transfer Mot.

In light of these considerations, the Court concludes that transferring the subpoena dispute to the Southern District of Ohio promotes Rule 45(f)'s interests in avoiding disruption of the underlying litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

First, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Morgan argue that \"transfer would require new briefing under Sixth Circuit law, which would be expensive and cause further delay.\" Gillespie Transfer Opp'n at 15. However, as noted above, \"transferring a motion to the jurisdiction where the underlying litigation is pending requires few, if any, modifications of the written submissions, [and] does not rise to the level of unfair prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Google, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204930979\">\n    2015 WL 4930979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wultz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5759244\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/304/38/#p46\">\n    304 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   45 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agincourt Gaming, LLC v.

Second, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Morgan express concern that they or their counsel may be required to travel to the Southern District of Ohio to assist in resolving the subpoena disputes. However, the case management plan in the underlying action expressly provides for telephonic hearings, and the 2013 Advisory Committee Note to Federal Rule 45(f)\"encourage[s] [judges] to permit telecommunications methods to minimize the burden a transfer imposes on nonparties, if it is necessary for attorneys admitted in the court where the motion is made to appear in the court in which the action is pending.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(f) advisory committee's note to 2013 amendment. Moreover, Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Morgan admit that their counsel \"are admitted in the underlying matter on behalf of unrelated parties.\" Gillespie Transfer Opp'n at 15. Thus, \"the general interest in protecting local nonparties by requiring local resolution of subpoena-related disputes is significantly reduced because [Mr. Gillespie and Mr. Morgan are] represented by a firm familiar with this litigation and the issuing court.\"\n   <em>\n    Lipman\n   </em>\n   , 284 F.Supp.3d at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   , 307 F.R.D. at 35 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The RNC, the NRCC, and Mr. Kincaid put forth a more nuanced burden argument, but they too fail to persuade the Court that they would be unduly burdened by a transfer. First, they argue that the D.C. Circuit has developed a more fulsome body of First Amendment case law than the Sixth Circuit, and that this Court and this Circuit are \"familiar with cases concerning political party structure and associations and the inner-workings of those associations.\" RNC Transfer Opp'n at 15-16. They claim that they would \"suffer prejudice\" if deprived of access to this base of knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, courts in this Circuit follow the principle that a \"transferee federal court is competent to decide federal issues correctly,\"\n   <em>\n    In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758400,4332389\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/1171/\">\n    829 F.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (D.C.

Second, these Respondents argue that their counsel may be burdened by travel to Ohio, should their subpoena dispute be appealed to the three-judge panel, and should that panel hold oral argument on the appeal. RNC Transfer Opp'n at 16-17. This hypothetical does not persuade the Court that transfer would impose an undue burden on the RNC, the NRCC, and Mr. Kincaid, because \"there is a strong possibility that [Respondents'] counsel will not even need to leave Washington, D.C. to litigate the\" subpoena dispute.\n   <em>\n    Lipman\n   </em>\n   , 284 F.Supp.3d at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Flynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271457\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/216/44/#p47\">\n    216 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   49 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
