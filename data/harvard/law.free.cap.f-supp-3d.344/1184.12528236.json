Rand (\"M.D. Rand\") pleaded guilty and was sentenced for criminal conduct, including involuntary manslaughter, in part related to the death of a patient. That tragic event led to lawsuits against M.D. Rand and ultimately this coverage dispute between M.D. Rand and Rand Family Care LLC's (collectively, \"Defendants\") and Plaintiff MedChoice Retention Group, Inc. (\"MedChoice\"). M.D. Rand's factual admissions that supported his guilty plea necessarily compel a finding for rescission of his MedChoice insurance policy, a result which the Court recognizes does not inure to the benefit of the patient's family and others impacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is MedChoice's Motion for Summary Judgment, or in the Alternative, Partial Summary Judgment (\"Motion\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 65) which it filed after M.D. Rand pleaded guilty (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; ECF No. 52-10). The Court has reviewed Defendants' response (ECF No. 77) and MedChoice's reply (ECF No. 81).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, the Court grants the Motion (ECF No. 65) upon the finding that MedChoice is entitled to rescind the liability policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The MedChoice Insurance Application and Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   M.D. Rand submitted application documents to MedChoice for professional liability coverage in December 2015. (ECF Nos. 52-2; 52-3; 52-5.) At the time, M.D. Rand was aware that at least one of his patients-Michael Yenick (\"Michael\")-had died at the age of 33, that he had prescribed Michael 45 dosages and 180 dosages of oxycodone only several days apart, and that Michael's mother had called him the day before the 45 dosages to warn him that Michael could die from further prescriptions of oxycodone. (ECF No. 77 at 3 (noting that \"Dr. Rand does not generally dispute the facts set forth in Medchoice's timeline. He disputes MedChoice's characterization of the facts, the inferences of the facts and the relevancy of certain facts\"); ECF No. 65 at 9-11 (MedChoice's timeline); ECF No. 52-50 at 7-8.) On October 2, 2015, a coroner requested Michael's medical records from M.D. Rand. (ECF No. 52-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the policy application documents, M.D. Rand responded \"no\" to questions inquiring (\"the Questions\"),\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Are you aware of any potentially compensable events resulting from patient care?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Have there been any injuries to patients or bad outcomes from services rendered by you or anyone in your office?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Do you have knowledge of any claims,\n   <em>\n    potential claims\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   , or suits in which you, your employees, ..., may become involved ...?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Have you had a request for medical records of a patient which has been reported to you current carrier?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Are you aware of any incident from\n   <em>\n    1/1/2011\n   </em>\n   till\n   <em>\n    Present\n   </em>\n   that may reasonably lead to a claim or suit being brought against you, even if you believe the claim or suit would be without merit?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (ECF No. 52-2 at 2; ECF No. 52-3 at 8; ECF No. 52-5 at 2.) (Emphasis added.) M.D Rand also signed the following \"Applicant's representation\": \"I know of no other relevant facts which might affect the underwriter's judgment when considering this application or which might be material to the underwriter's risk.\" (ECF No. 52-3 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   MedChoice attests-and Defendants do not dispute-that it relied on the answers M.D. Rand submitted in his application in deciding to issue a policy to Defendants (\"the Policy\") on January 4, 2016. (ECF No. 65-4 (Nauman Decl) at 3.) The Policy became effective December 15, 2015, and was to expire December 15, 2016, with an extended reporting period of February 13, 2017. (ECF No. 52-12 at 2, 18.) The Policy excludes coverage \"for any claim or potential claim against the named insured of which the name insured was aware, or reasonably should have been aware, prior to the effective date of [the] policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Nor does it cover claims \"arising out of a criminal, dishonest, fraudulent or malicious act or omission by such insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MedChoice aver, again without challenge, that later in January 2016, M.D. Rand requested certain policy limit increases of the Policy and MedChoice issued an endorsement increasing the limits (\"Endorsement\"), based upon the previously submitted application materials. (ECF No. 65-4 (Nauman Decl.) at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July 2017, M.D. Rand pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter for the death\n   of Michael in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rand et. al\n   </em>\n   , No. 3-16-cr-00029-MMD-WGC (\"Criminal Case\"). (ECF No. 52-10 at 4-8.) In the same plea agreement, he also pleaded guilty to the unlawful distribution of a controlled substance to an individual with the initials R.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) As to R.W., M. D. Rand admitted that from January 2011 to April 2016, he without a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice prescribed R.W. a number of opioids, including oxycodone, Percocet, and fentanyl. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Lawsuits for which Defendants Have Received or Seek Liability Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   MedChoice's FAC and Motion concern coverage for three specified lawsuits filed in the Second Judicial District Court in and for the County of Washoe: (1)\n   <em>\n    Cyndi Papez Yenick et al. v. Robert Rand, M.D., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV-16-01004 (\"Yenick Lawsuit\"); (2)\n   <em>\n    Eric Zuhlke et al. v. Robert Rand, M.D., et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV16-01641 (\"Zuhlke Lawsuit\"); and (3)\n   <em>\n    Don Robertson, II, as Special Administrator of Dorothy M. Fribourg; Don Robertson, II, individually as son and heir of Dorothy M. Fribourg v. Robert Rand, M.D.;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rand Family Care\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV 17-0099 (\"Fribourg Lawsuit\"). (ECF Nos. 52-7, 52-8, 52-11.) The three lawsuits allege claims for: medical negligence resulting in wrongful death, deceptive trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and neglect of a vulnerable person based on M.D. Rand's practice of prescribing opioids. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties have resolved the coverage issues concerning the Zuhlke Lawsuit. (ECF No. 85). Thus, only the other two named legal actions remain. The Court will not consider the facts or claims pertaining to the Zuhlke Lawsuit moving forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. MedChoice's Claims and Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The FAC involves five claims for relief. In the first two counts, MedChoice alleges that it is entitled to rescission of the Policy (Count I) and the increase in limits endorsement (Count II) under NRS \u00a7 687B.110. (ECF No. 52.) Count II is asserted as an alternative to Count I. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) As an alternative to the two rescission counts, MedChoice asserts Count III, seeking declaratory relief and arguing non-coverage based on specified exclusions within the Policy going to the Yenick Lawsuit, and that Yenick's claims are outside the scope of the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18.) In Count IV, MedChoice also seeks declaratory relief that it has no duty to defend or indemnify any claim reported or lawsuit filed after February 13, 2017-expiration of the extended reporting period, pertinent to only the Fribourg Lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18; ECF No. 65 at 28.) Count V is contingent on a finding that there is no coverage for the Yenick Lawsuit, and MedChoice seeks a declaration that it is entitled to reimbursement for defense costs expended in that lawsuit, subject to a motion for final judgment and evidence of the expended costs. (ECF No. 52 at 18-19; ECF No. 65 at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MedChoice moves for summary judgment on either bases of rescission, or in the alternative declaratory relief on the remaining specific claims, and declaration on its entitlement to reimbursement claim. (ECF Nos. 65, 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"The purpose of summary judgment is to avoid unnecessary trials when there is no dispute as to the facts before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Nw.

DISCUSSION\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   MedChoice's requests for summary judgment on its first and second claims for relief are specifically made pursuant to NRS \u00a7 687B.110(2), (3). (ECF No. 65.) As a preliminary matter, both claims (Counts I and II) are essentially one and the same, given MedChoice's unchallenged averment that it relied on the answers in the Policy application documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the subject of\n   Count 1- to issue the Endorsement-the subject of Count 2. Accordingly, if M.D. Rand committed a violation of NRS \u00a7 687B.110 when he completed the application documents, both the Policy and Endorsement would be rescinded on that basis. MedChoice particularly asserts that it would not have issued the Policy or Endorsement had it known of the circumstances leading to Michael's death, which M.D. Rand knew, or it had known that M.D. Rand had been prescribing opioids without legitimate medical purpose. (ECF No. 65 at 19-21; ECF No. 81 at 8, 12-14, 18.) The Court agrees with MedChoice and will grant summary judgment on these two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pertinently, NRS \u00a7 687B.110 provides that recovery can be denied under an insurance policy where \"[m]isrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts and incorrect statements\" were made in the policy application that were\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. Material either to the acceptance of the risk, or hazard assumed by the insurer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. The insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract, or would not have issued it at the same premium rate, or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount, or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss, if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   NRS \u00a7 687B.110(2), (3). If either of these factors apply, MedChoice would be justified in rescinding the Policy and Endorsement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v. Prudential Ins.

(ECF Nos. 65, 81.) Defendants, however, without citation to authority, argue that MedChoice cannot base its Motion upon admissions M.D. Rand made as part of his July 2017 guilty plea agreement to argue rescission under NRS \u00a7 687B.110.

The Court will accordingly consider M.D. Rand's July 2017 plea deal in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Here, in pleading to the involuntary manslaughter of Michael,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , M.D. Rand admitted that he:\n   <em>\n    acted\n   </em>\n   with gross negligence, defined as wanton or reckless disregard for human life; and that he either knew that such conduct was a threat to the lives of others or knew of the circumstances that would reasonably cause him to foresee that such conduct might be a threat to the life of others. (ECF No. 52-10 at 4-5.) One factual basis for the plea was that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 22, 2015, [Michael's] mother called and spoke with Dr. Rand, informing Dr. Rand of relevant, present circumstances as to [Michael's] health and substantial risks in terms of Dr. Rand's prescriptions of oxycodone to [Michael], begged Dr. Rand not to prescribe Michael anymore oxycodone, and warned Dr. Rand that he would kill her son if he continued to prescribe [Michael] oxycodone\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The following day M.D. Rand prescribed Michael 45 doses of oxycodone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8556535\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/108/32/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only seven days after that, he prescribed another 180 dosages of oxycodone to Michael. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He admitted to doing so, \"not for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He admitted to acting with gross negligence in so prescribing, particularly in light of circumstances, such as the call from Michael's mother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Michael died on October 2, 2018-two days after he received and filled the prescription for 180 dosages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) As noted, M.D. Rand admits that he knew about Michael's October 2, 2015 death at the time he completed the application (ECF No. 77 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 52-1 at 2 (coroner October 2, 2015, medical record request to M.D. Rand).) These factual and mental state admissions are all incontrovertible information that M.D. Rand knew at the time he applied for the Policy in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   M.D. Rand, however, contends that, at the time he responded to the Questions in the application documents, he answered them truthfully, particularly if the Court views the facts in the light most favorable to him. (ECF No. 77 at 10.) M.D. Rand\n   insists that his knowledge of Michael's death\n   <em>\n    at the time\n   </em>\n   he responded to the Questions do not support MedChoice's arguments that he should have responded in the affirmative to these Questions. He argues he had a reasonable basis to conclude Michael's death was caused by Michael's own conduct because the examining coroner had determined that Michael had died from a combination of alcohol and oxycodone. (ECF No. 77 at 12.) Thus, according to M.D. Rand, he would not have had reason to be aware of a compensable event, of any injuries to patients from services he provided, or of any potential claims against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.) He also implicitly argues that he did not violate NRS \u00a7 687B.110 by making misrepresentations, omissions, incorrect statements, or concealing facts at the time he completed the application documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to M.D. Rand and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, a reasonable jury could conclude that given the Questions on the application documents were so broadly written (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   at Section II.A)-indeed to the extent of being virtually ambiguous to a certain degree-that M.D. Rand did not mislead MedChoice by answering \"no\" to them. A reasonable jury could accept M.D. Rand's explanation that Michael's death having been caused by a combination of alcohol and oxycodone supported his negative responses to the Questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   However, the favorable inferences ultimately cannot prevent summary judgment because of other undisputed facts that M.D. Rand knew at the time he responded to the Questions. Particularly, M.D. Rand does not contest the other information his plea agreement reveals-that beginning years before he applied for the Policy he had a practice of prescribing R.W. various types of opioids for no legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 52-10 at 8-9.) In fact, in the Criminal Case, M.D. Rand admitted that he prescribed significant quantities of oxycodone in varies dosages to R.W. not in the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. (ECF No. 599 at 57-59, 67-68.) He also admitted to acting likewise illegitimately when prescribing the dosages to Michael. (ECF No. 52-10. at 7.) Undoubtedly-and as MedChoice argues-this information was material\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   either to the acceptance of the risk, or hazard MedChoice would assume,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   NRS \u00a7 687B.110(2). Based on the unquestionable admissions in his plea deal, M.D. Rand at minimum made a material misrepresentation when he represented that he knew of \"no other relevant facts which might affect the underwriter's judgment when considering [his Policy application] which\n   might be material to the underwriter's risk.\" (ECF No. 52-3 at 10.) While this catch-all statement is broad when considered in general, it is not when considered in the context of M.D. Rand's admission-that he knew he prescribed significant quantities of opioids outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. Of course, an insurer would not ordinarily jump at the opportunity to insure a doctor unlawfully prescribing opioids. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment on MedChoice's claims for rescission of the Policy and Endorsement pursuant to NRS \u00a7 687B.110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Further, because the Court finds MedChoice is entitled to rescission of the Policy, the Court need not consider the alternative theories of non-coverage concerning either the Yenick or Fribourg Lawsuits (Counts III and VI). Likewise, the Court will grant summary judgment on Count V-a declaration that MedChoice is entitled to reimbursement for defense costs it expended, pursuant to a duty to defend in the Yenick Lawsuit under the Policy which it has been found entitled to rescind.\n   <em>\n    See Great Am. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 943 P.2d at n.6 (\"A\n   <em>\n    priori\n   </em>\n   , where there has been a valid rescission of the contract, there is no longer any contract to enforce.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motion before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is therefore ordered that MedChoice's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 65) is granted in part and denied in part. It is granted as to Counts I and II for rescission. Therefore, Count V is granted. It is denied as to the alternative requests for partial summary judgment-Counts III and IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is further ordered that MedChoice's objection (ECF No. 83) be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    MedChoice moves on the basis of the First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 52) (\"FAC\"), albeit Defendants have not responded to the FAC.

(ECF No. 83.) To the extent MedChoice disputes Defendants' proffered evidence, MedChoice should have asserted their arguments in their reply brief. A separate objection is improper and is an apparent attempt to circumvent LR 7-3(a)'s limit on the length of MedChoice's reply brief. Accordingly, the Court will strike MedChoice's separate objection (ECF No. 83.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Policy defines a \"potential claim\" to mean \"any medical incident which would have put a reasonable person on notice that a written notice or demand to the insured or a lawsuit against the insured may result.\" (ECF No. 52-12 at 15.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Defendants erroneously conflate MedChoice's lawsuit seeking rescission as the equivalent of rescission.
