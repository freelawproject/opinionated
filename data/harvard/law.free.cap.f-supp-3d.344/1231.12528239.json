Carman (Doc. # 73), in which he recommended that the Court grant in part and deny in part Defendant Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. # 43). Plaintiffs, a putative class of Defendant's customers, and Defendant object to portions to the Recommendation. (Doc. ## 76, 77.) For the reasons described below, the Court adopts in part and rejects in part the Recommendation and grants in part and denies in part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant operates more than 2,000 fast-casual Chipotle burrito restaurants across the United States and two quick-serve\n   Pizzeria Locale pizza locations in Colorado. (Doc. # 36 at 11.) It is incorporated in Delaware and maintains its principal place of business in Denver, Colorado. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant experienced a data breach in early 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 43 at 2); between March 24, 2017, and April 18, 2017, hackers utilized malicious software to access the point-of-sale systems at Defendant's locations and stole customers' payment card information and other personal information (the \"Chipotle Data Breach\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant issued a security notice on April 25, 2017, to alert its customers to the Chipotle Data Breach:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   We want to make our customers aware that we recently detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for purchases made in our restaurants.... We anticipate providing notification to any affected customers as we get further clarity about the specific timeframes and restaurant locations that may have been affected. Consistent with good practices, consumers should closely monitor their payment card statements. If anyone sees an unauthorized charge, they should immediately notify the bank that issued the card. Payment card network rules generally state that cardholders are not responsible for such charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Doc. # 36 at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they used payment cards at Defendant's restaurants in the states in which they reside\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   during the Chipotle Data Breach and that their personally identifiable information (\"PII\") was compromised by the breach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Plaintiffs bring this action \"individually and on behalf of others similarly situated\" and seek to recover damages for their alleged loss of time and money \"resolving fraudulent charges ...

Because Plaintiff Lawson had upcoming travel plans, he paid $45 to have the new debit card expedited to him. Unfortunately, despite the attempt to expedite and the money expenditure, a new card did not arrive before he left town. Therefore, Plaintiff Lawson did not have his debit card to use for his travel expenses as he planned.

(Doc. # 73 at 8-12.) The Magistrate Judge inferred from Plaintiff Lawson's allegations that he suffered misuse of his debit card, an actual injury, as \"his issuing bank went to the trouble of closing and reissuing a new payment card because there was some attempted misuse of his payment card.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Magistrate Judge Carman also accepted Plaintiff Lawson's allegation that he suffered actual harm in not obtaining his cash back rewards on his travel expenses because Defendant did not \"explain why the [C]ourt should consider cash back rewards as having no monetary value as a matter of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, he accepted Plaintiff Lawson's allegation that he suffered actual harm in time spent addressing the theft of his debit card information and obtaining a new card. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) As to Plaintiff Lawson's expenditure of $45.00 to expedite delivery of his new card, Magistrate Judge Carman stated that \"plausibly alleges an actual harm for standing\" if Plaintiff Lawson did so \"in the attempt to not lose the cash back rewards he expected on his travel expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, Magistrate Judge Carman concluded that Plaintiff Baker \"plausibly alleges a certainly impending harm or substantial risk thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16.) The Magistrate Judge detailed case law from consumer data breach cases, with a particular focus on the Court's explanation in\n   <em>\n    Engl\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [A] plaintiff demonstrates a cognizable Art. III injury, based on the risk of exposure to future fraudulent purchases or identity theft, by showing that: (i) his or her credit card or other financial or personal data was exposed to hackers in a data breach, and (ii) that there is reason to believe that the hackers or others are making actual fraudulent use of the purloined data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208578252\">\n    2016 WL 8578252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6. He noted, however, that in cases where allegations showed no ongoing potential for harm-where, for example, the information stolen could not enable identify theft-the allegations were held to be too speculative. (Doc. # 73 at 13- 14) (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re SuperValu, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275352\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/763/#p769\">\n    870 F.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769-70 (8th Cir. 2017) ). With respect to Plaintiff Baker's allegations, he determined there was \"a fact issue regarding whether more than just [her] name and credit card account number were stolen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Presumably because Defendant's Motion to Dismiss was before him, Magistrate Judge Carman \"infer[ed] from the allegations ... [the] personal information taken in the Chipotle breach ... could enable fraudulent accounts to be opened in Ms. Baker's name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He therefore concluded that Plaintiff Baker alleges facts sufficient to demonstrate \"a certainly impending harm or substantial risk thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For these reasons, Magistrate Judge Carman recommended denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) as to Plaintiffs Baker and Lawson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Magistrate Judge Carman's Recommendation as to standing was nuanced though; he recommended that the Court dismiss \"allegations of 'lost control over the value of personal information' and overpayment\" because these allegations do not demonstrate injury in fact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiffs do not make independent claims that they lost value in controlling their personal information or that they overpaid Defendant by an indeterminate amount they believed Defendant would spend to make transactions secure.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 36.) One could, as Defendant apparently has, infer from Plaintiffs' Complaint that Plaintiffs have these beliefs, but nowhere in the Complaint do Plaintiffs assert claims based solely on them. There is therefore nothing for the Court to dismiss as to \"allegations of 'lost control over the value of personal information' and overpayment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 73 at 16.) The Court rejects that portion of the Recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Objection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs object only to Magistrate Judge Carman's analysis of Plaintiff Baker's standing. (Doc. # 76 at 3-8.) They argue that Magistrate Judge Carman erred by determining that Plaintiff Baker does not allege an actual injury, only that she alleges a substantial risk that she will be harmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Magistrate Judge Carman briefly stated that Plaintiff Baker \"does not allege actual harm\" because \"she does not allege she spent time or money addressing the fraudulent charges, whether she was deprived of use of her account for a time, nor any expenses incurred from the need to (apparently) close and reopen a new account with a new card number.\" (Doc. # 73 at 10.) Plaintiffs contend that the Magistrate Judge \"overlooked certain allegations\" in the Complaint, such as the allegation that all Plaintiffs suffered \"significant costs associated with ... closing out and opening new credit or debit card accounts or ordering replacement cards,\" and that such allegations \"sufficiently establish injury-in-fact.\" (Doc. # 76 at 3- 4);\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 36 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Magistrate Judge Carman's statement that payment card data alone is not among the types of PII that can enable identify theft is inaccurate. (Doc. # 76 at 4.) They reject his citation to\n   <em>\n    In re SuperValu, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275352\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/763/#p769\">\n    870 F.3d at 769-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because he \"misapplied [its] reasoning,\" and assert that\n   <em>\n    Dieffenbach v.

(Doc. # 76 at 5.) In\n   <em>\n    Dieffenbach\n   </em>\n   , \"scoundrels\" had compromised some of Barnes &amp; Noble's PIN pads and \"acquired details such as customers' names, card numbers and\n   expiration dates, and PINs.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516603\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/826/#p827\">\n    887 F.3d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs, Barnes &amp; Noble's customers affected by the breach, alleged an injury in fact and had standing \"because the data theft may have led them to pay money for credit-monitoring services, because unauthorized withdrawals from their accounts cause a loss (the time value of money) even when banks later restore the principal, and because the value of one's own time needed to set things straight is a loss from an opportunity cost perspective.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516603\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/826/#p827\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516603\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/826/#p827\">\n    at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs urge this Court to therefore find that Plaintiff Baker alleges an actual injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs' objection. First, as to the allegations Plaintiffs contend Magistrate Judge Carman overlooked, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge's decision to not address the general allegations all Plaintiffs allege, as they contain no detail and are not plaintiff-specific. Magistrate Judge Carman did not err by considering only Plaintiff Baker's unique allegations. Second,\n   <em>\n    Dieffenbach\n   </em>\n   did not address whether the plaintiffs alleged an actual injury or that they faced a real and immediate threat of being injured in the future. It therefore does not stand for the proposition that the theft of customers' names, card numbers and expiration dates, and PINs alone constitutes an actual injury. Third, the Magistrate Judge accurately described that a number of courts have reasoned that \"a risk of future identity theft is sufficient for standing only if the data breach exposed the types of PII that can enable identity theft.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 73 at 14-6.) The Court therefore affirms Magistrate Judge Carman's determination that Plaintiff does not allege an actual injury but does sufficiently allege a substantial risk of future injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Magistrate Judge's Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Magistrate Judge Carman conducted a lengthy examination to determine whether a choice of law analysis is required, looking for outcome-determinative differences between the five applicable states' economic loss doctrines. (Doc. # 73 at 18-35.) After detailing his understanding of each state's economic loss doctrine, he concluded that there were outcome-determinative differences between Colorado, Illinois, and Missouri\n   on one hand, where he predicted the economic loss doctrine\n   <strong>\n    would\n   </strong>\n   bar Plaintiffs' negligence claim, \"and Arizona and California on the other,\" where he predicted the economic loss doctrine\n   <strong>\n    would not\n   </strong>\n   bar Plaintiffs' negligence claim.

As Defendant stated in its Motion to Dismiss, \"unjust enrichment requires [P]laintiffs to allege that they conferred a benefit on Chipotle, and that it would be unjust for Chipotle to keep this benefit.\" (Doc. # 43 at 18) (collecting cases). Plaintiffs admit that they \"conferred a monetary benefit upon Chipotle in the form of monies\n   <strong>\n    paid for the purchase of food services\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Doc. # 36 at 52) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Plaintiffs received the food services for which they paid. Defendant was therefore not unjustly enriched by retaining Plaintiffs' payments. Plaintiffs' contorted 'would not have shopped' theory does not change this elementary analysis: Plaintiffs paid for burritos; Plaintiffs received burritos. Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted and must be dismissed.

As the Magistrate Judge explained (Doc. # 73 at 45), Plaintiffs \"do not point to a specific representation or statement ... in which Defendant omitted this fact, which [Plaintiff] Gordon saw and replied upon.\" Magistrate Judge Carman rejected Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs are required to allege a specific representation by Defendant in which Defendant should have disclosed flaws in its data security systems, finding that the case law does not support such a requirement in the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act.

(Doc. # 36 at 61.) Defendant argues in its Motion to Dismiss that \"the California [P]laintiffs fail to allege they ever saw, read, or otherwise were exposed to [Defendant's] claimed omissions or misrepresentations\" and that they therefore cannot satisfy the reliance element of a claim brought under the California Unfair Competition Law. (Doc. # 43 at 21-22.) Magistrate Judge Carman explored case law concerning \"what standard of causation applies for [California Unfair Competition Law] claims based on fraudulent omissions\" and was persuaded by two cases in which California courts declined to\n   dismiss the plaintiffs' fraudulent omission claims because the plaintiffs had sufficiently plead an omission of facts the defendants were obliged to disclose,\n   <em>\n    In re Sony Gaming Networks and Customer Data Security Breach Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928606\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/996/942/#p991\">\n    996 F.Supp.2d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (S.D.

In view of these cases, Magistrate Judge Carman concluded that Plaintiffs \"plausibly allege causation or reliance on Defendant's omission that it was not providing reasonable data security\" and that Defendant \"has not shown that the [law's] reliance element requires pleading any further.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In Claim 9 for Violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Plaintiffs repeats its arguments from Claim 8 that Defendant's \"failure to disclose that its computer systems were not well-protected ... constitutes deceptive and/or unfair practices\" and that they would not have made purchases at Defendant's locations had they known about this non-disclosed fact. (Doc. # 36 at 64-66.) Defendant reprises its argument from Claim 8 too: Plaintiffs cannot meet the reliance element of a claim under the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act because they \"do not allege that they saw and relied upon any statement made by [Defendant] regarding data security.\" (Doc. # 43 at 23.) The Magistrate Judge again rejected Defendant's argument, stating, \"Much as with the UCL claim [Claim 8], Defendant does not show the [California Consumers Legal Remedies Act] claim requires the California Plaintiffs to allege more facts to plausibly suggest they relied on Defendant's omission.\" (Doc. # 72 at 53) (quoting,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mass.

Plaintiffs repeat their previous claim that Defendant \"fail[ed] to disclose that its computer systems were not well-protected.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68.) Defendant argues that Illinois law is clear that \"a plaintiff pursuing a fraud-based Illinois Consumer Fraud Act claim must allege that he or she 'actually saw and was deceived by the statements in question' \" and that Plaintiff Fowler does not allege that she saw and was deceived by any statement. (Doc. # 43 at 24.) Magistrate Judge Carman again determined that the case law Defendant cites do not address deceptive omissions and found Plaintiffs' citations to authority more persuasive. (Doc. # 73 at 57.) He concluded that \"Plaintiffs plausibly allege reliance\" sufficient to survive Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.

Defendant describes the Magistrate Judge's analysis as \"flawed,\" as he did not hold that Defendant had a duty to disclose information to Plaintiffs and \"the relevant law would not support that holding for any of the state laws at issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant is correct that under these states' consumer protection statutes, a plaintiff alleging a fraud-based omission claim must show that the defendant omitted a fact the defendant had a duty to disclose.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Sony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928606\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/996/942/#p991\">\n    996 F.Supp.2d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To be actionable under all three California consumer\n   protections statutes, an omission must be 'contrary to a representation actually made by the defendant, or an omission of a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose.' \")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by Defendant's objection however.

In short, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant omitted material facts, thereby violating several states' consumer protection statutes. Implicit in their argument is that Defendant had a duty to disclose these material facts. That Magistrate Judge Carman did not explicitly discuss Defendant's duty to disclose does not undermine the adequacy of Plaintiffs' Complaint or the accuracy of the Magistrate Judge's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge's conclusion that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged fraudulent omission claims under Arizona's, California's, and Illinois's consumer protection statutes in Claims 6, 8, 9, and 10.

As to injunctive relief, Defendant states that\n   Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief because they fail to show a sufficient likelihood of suffering another data breach.

The Magistrate Judge explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   In the absence of Defendant citing any cases to support the [Unfair Competition Law] does not permit injunctive relief based on a pattern of officially sanctioned behavior, in light of Plaintiffs alleging Defendant experienced a significant data security breach in 2004 and nonetheless chose not to upgrade its [point-of-sale] system to keep pace with data security, if Plaintiffs prove their allegations they could be entitled to injunctive relief. It may be Plaintiffs will have difficulty proving that they would make payment card purchases again at Chipotle, but that appears to be a fact issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Magistrate Judge Carman therefore recommended denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss as to Claim 8. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Defendant's Objection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendant objects that \"the fact that Chipotle encountered a data security incident over ten years ago [does not] support these [P]laintiffs' entitlement to injunctive relief.\" (Doc. # 77 at 13.) Defendant argues that Plaintiffs must personally be at risk of future harm to obtain injunctive relief and that it is \"implausible\" that Plaintiffs will be \"required to go back to Chipotle and purchase a meal with a credit or debit card.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendant's objection \"misses the mark,\" as Plaintiffs do not allege a realistic threat of future harm if or when they make another purchase at a Chipotle location with a payment card.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. # 80 at 12.) Rather, Plaintiffs allege that they \"remain at imminent risk of suffering additional damages in the future\" because their PII \"remains on [Defendant's] insufficiently secured computer systems.\" (Doc. # 36 at 51, 48.) Plaintiffs' belief that they face a continuing risk of data breaches is reflected in their request that the Court order \"the Defendant purge, delete, and destroy in a reasonable secure manner customer data not necessary for its provisions of services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In the Court's view, these allegations sufficiently show that Plaintiffs may again be injured by a data breach, due to Defendant's alleged pattern of neglecting its data security systems and its alleged retention of Plaintiffs' PII. The Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Carman that if Plaintiffs prove a realistic threat of future harm, they could be entitled to injunctive relief under California's Unfair Competition Law.

(Doc. # 36 at 57, 66.) Plaintiff Baker asserts that one unauthorized charge of $49.99 was taken from her account but was ultimately refunded by her bank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Plaintiff Conard claims that after her bank had determined her credit card-\"the primary card Plaintiff Conard uses for daily expenditures because of the rewards benefit\"-had been compromised, she spent approximately twenty hours communicating with her bank and various businesses, \"lost the opportunity to accrue points for purchases\" made on her credit card while she awaited a replacement card, and now spends $131.93 annually on identity theft monitoring services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) The Mercer Plaintiffs report finding a number of pending and posted fraudulent transactions, which their bank ultimately reimbursed; they allege that \"it took a number of weeks and roughly six hours' of [their] personal time to obtain the reversal\" of these charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The Mercer Plaintiffs also claim that while they awaited a new debit card from their bank, \"many of their normal services had been disrupted [and] automated orders ... were delayed and cancelled due to nonpayment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Defendant asserts in its Motion to Dismiss that to state claims under these California statutes, a customer must have suffered damages. (Doc. # 43 at 20, 24.) It argues that Plaintiff Baker, Plaintiff Conard, and the Mercer Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the damages element of the two claims because Plaintiffs acknowledge the unauthorized charges to their accounts were reimbursed by their banks and that any \"alleged time and effort [does not] qualify as actual damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Hannaford Bros.

He first noted that Plaintiffs' seventh claim, for violation of California's Customer Records Act, can stand either on Section 1798.81.5(b) of that act for failing to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices or on Section 1798.82 for failing to promptly notify customers. (Doc. # 73 at 46.) As to Section 1798.81.5(b), the Magistrate Judge recommended denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.) He rejected Defendant's argument that time and effort are not actionable damages, as Defendant's citations to authority did not address claims under the California statutes at issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.) However, as to an alleged violation of Section 1798.82 for failure to promptly notify customers, Magistrate Judge Carman recommended granting the motion in part \"to dismiss only that part of the claim alleging a violation of Section 1798.82 brought by [Plaintiff Baker and Plaintiff Conard.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.) He determined that these two Plaintiffs had learned of and taken action regarding fraudulent charges before Defendant became aware of the Chipotle Data Breach and that they therefore cannot plausibly allege harm from Defendant's delay in notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, as to Claim 9 for violation of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Magistrate Judge Carman observed that Defendant \"did not attempt to rebut\" Plaintiffs' argument that \"any damage\" under the act\n   \"includes pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages alike, including transaction costs and opportunity costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) He therefore concluded that Plaintiffs' allegations of time and effort spent addressing fraud on their accounts \"plausibly allege actionable damages under the [Consumers Legal Remedies Act]\" and recommended denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss with respect to Claim 9. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In Claim 10 for Violation of Illinois's Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, Plaintiff Fowler alleges that as a result of the data breach,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   [she] was required to spend a significant amount of time - at least 30 hours total - making phone calls, monitoring her card transactions, and addressing the unauthorized transactions and account openings/related activity. Plaintiff was also forced to switch over all of her recurring charges from her cancelled card and missed a couple of payments due to this issue. Furthermore, Plaintiff has had to place security freezes with all 3 credit bureaus at her own cost, which will result in difficulty for her opening legitimate accounts under her name when she desires to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   (Doc. # 36 at 8-9.) Defendant asserts in its Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiff Fowler cannot satisfy the statute's requirement of actual damages because she \"acknowledges that the fraudulent charges on the card she used at Chipotle were reimbursed after two brief phone calls\" and that such \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   time and effort is insufficient\" to establish a claim. (Doc. # 43 at 25.) Defendant also argues that Plaintiff Fowler's allegations about fraudulently opened credit cards could not have been caused by Defendant, as \"the alleged compromise of her existing MasterCard at Chipotle ... did not involve her social security number, address, or other personal information necessary to commit that type of fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Magistrate Judge Carman concluded that because \"there is a fact issue whether the data breach involved more PII than payment card information,\" the Court should not dismiss on a motion to dismiss Plaintiff Fowler's allegations about unauthorized accounts being opened in her name. (Doc. # 72 at 57.) He explicitly declined to reach whether Plaintiff Fowler's time and effort is sufficient in itself to satisfy the damages element. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58.) He therefore recommended that the Court deny the Motion to Dismiss as to Claim 10.

Because Plaintiff Lawson had upcoming travel plans, he paid $45 to have the new debit card expedited to him. Unfortunately, despite the attempt to expedite and the money expenditure, a new card did not arrive before he left town. Therefore, Plaintiff Lawson did not have his debit card to use for his travel expenses as he planned. As a result of having been victimized by the Chipotle Data Breach, Plaintiff Lawson has been required to spend time communicating with his bank regarding his compromised card, account transfer, and replacement card.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant argues that \"[t]ime and effort spent addressing an alleged data compromise is insufficient\" to state a claim under Missouri's law.

It also states that it did not inflict the $45.00 fee on Plaintiff Lawson, as Plaintiff Lawson's \"decision to expedite the card was his own choice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Magistrate Judge Carman\n   stated that there is \"a fact issue regarding whether [Plaintiff] Lawson's out of pocket expense should be deemed a damage resulting from the data breach.\" (Doc. # 73 at 59.) Because that issue cannot be resolved on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the Court deny dismissal of Claim 12 and explicitly declined to reach whether Plaintiff Lawson's \"time and effort would in themselves plausibly allege the damages element for this claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.
