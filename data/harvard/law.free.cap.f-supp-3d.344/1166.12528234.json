Durrett Decl. \u00b6 9. 1,743 of those pages were released in full and 10 pages were released in part pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The IRS has submitted \"reasonably detailed, nonconclusory\" affidavits that show \"what records were searched, by whom, and through what process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820209,10509411\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/548/\">\n    23 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The IRS's declarations indicate how the IRS interpreted Plaintiff's FOIA request and its criteria to determine which documents from the 65 boxes were responsive to Plaintiff's request. Plaintiff argues that the IRS's search was unreasonable because documents containing Plaintiff's taxpayer information were commingled with documents containing other taxpayers' information and the IRS \"mark[ed] any document as non-responsive merely because it did not contain Plaintiff's taxpayer information.\" (ECF No. 49 at 3). However, Plaintiff only requested its own administrative file and a search of POA authorizations revealed that \"each taxpayer whose records were in the commingled file had not authorized its records to be disclosed to the other taxpayers.\" Thomas Decl. Exh. A; Thomas Supp. Decl. \u00b6 18. The IRS's search in response to Plaintiff's FOIA request was adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Withholding of Responsive Documents Pursuant to FOIA Exemptions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    10 Pages No Longer Withheld\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The IRS, in its initial motion for summary judgment, indicated it withheld, in part, 10 pages of responsive documents pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). The IRS does not renew its motion for summary judgment as to these potions of the records and indicates that it intends to release these records in full to Plaintiff. (ECF No. 48). Once the IRS releases in full the 10 pages responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request, the IRS has fully discharged\n   its obligations with respect to those pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Remaining \"Non-Responsive\" Documents And Alter Ego Theory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff argues that if the IRS has determined that Plaintiff and another taxpayer are alter egos, and therefore one entity, then the IRS cannot reasonably exclude the other taxpayer's documents as \"non-responsive\" to Plaintiff's FOIA request. (ECF No. 49 at 2). According to Plaintiff, \"a reasonable search ... require[s] the IRS to take note of which other taxpayers it is holding Plaintiff liable for and to then include those specific entities in its search.\" (ECF. No. 49 at 3). Plaintiff further contends that neither statute nor federal regulation bars its request because the names of alleged alter egos were already publicly disclosed in a federal tax lien, thereby authorizing disclosure of their return information and that of other unnamed taxpayers. (ECF No. 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The IRS asserts it need not disclose the return information of alter-ego taxpayers because (1) Plaintiff failed to request such information; (2) such a disclosure under these circumstances would violate certain statutory mandates and federal regulations; and, (3) a rule requiring disclosure upon assertion of alter ego liability contradicts how the IRS treats separate taxpayers and would lead to \"absurd results.\" (ECF No. 50, 54).

(ECF No. 44-1 at 10; ECF No. 52 at 3). The Court agrees in part.\n   <em>\n    Lampert\n   </em>\n   would seem to allow the IRS to confirm that the entities listed on the public federal tax lien are among those whose documents are included in the commingled file.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bonar Decl.

The Internal Revenue Code treats taxpayers as separate entities for tax assessment purposes irrespective of whether they are designated alter egos for collection purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portsmouth Ambulance, Inc. v.
