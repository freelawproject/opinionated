There are currently three motions pending in this case. For the reasons explained below, Chancellor's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied and the other two motions-AngloGold's motion to compel arbitration as to one part of the case and Defendants' shared motion to dismiss another aspect of it-are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about the ownership, operations, and sale of an open-pit gold mining operation in Colorado. Because each of the pending motions relies on a different set facts, the Court discusses here only the background necessary to understand the case's general context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Originally, the mine at issue was owned by the Cripple Creek &amp; Victor Mining Company (\"Victor Mining\"), a 100% subsidiary of AngloGold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19 (Dkt. 7). In 2012, Victor Mining began planning for and building a new high grade mill.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 24-26. Since then, however, the mill has suffered from various structural issues and production problems and has not operated at capacity as a result.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-40, 96, 140. At some point prior to November 2014, a third party allegedly acquired the mineral interests on a plot of land on Victor Mining's property adjacent to the mill, referred to by the parties as MS 9282 (\"the Plot\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-148, 171,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early 2015, AngloGold began marketing Victor Mining for sale and sent Newmont an offer to sell the company.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-46. Wayne Chancellor, who was the Vice President and General Counsel to one of the AngloGold entities during the relevant time period, actively participated in the marketing and sale process on behalf of AngloGold.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. Negotiations proceeded over the next few months. In May 2015, executives from Newmont and AngloGold, including Chancellor, met for two days in New York City, at the offices of AngloGold's outside counsel, Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP, to discuss the transaction, negotiate certain terms of the deal, and finalize the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 58; Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-37 (Dkt. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 8, 2015, Newmont and AngloGold entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") in which Newmont agreed to purchase 100% of Victor Mining's stock for approximately $820 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 2; SPA \u00a7 2.01 (Dkt. 7-1). That price was approximate because the contract permitted the parties to adjust the price after closing through a \"Purchase Price Adjustment\" procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 2.04. The SPA also included a promise by AngloGold to keep Newmont updated on all material business matters and events prior to the deal's closing date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 67, 69; SPA \u00a7 6.01(b). The SPA further provided that any lawsuit arising therefrom would be governed by New York law and that the parties consented to the jurisdiction of and to bring lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 77; SPA \u00a7\u00a7 10.09, 10.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over the next two months, the AngloGold Entities allegedly began experiencing increasingly severe problems with the mill-the result of purported \"design defects.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 78-79. Instead of clearly communicating these problems with Newmont, AngloGold allegedly took various \"steps to hide ... the existence of the increasingly severe problems.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 81;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 82-86.

Chancellor attended the closing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Chancellor Decl. \u00b6 35. According to the Complaint, neither at nor prior to closing did Chancellor or others at AngloGold inform Newmont about the problems that the mill had been having or about any third party's ownership of the mineral interests in the Plot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 136, 138, 145. After closing, AngloGold and Newmont disputed the proper amount of the pertinent Purchase Price Adjustment under the SPA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 156-60, 172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Newmont filed this action on October 19,2017, seeking damages from Defendants relating to the mill's deficiencies, various purported misrepresentations and fraudulent omissions, and the disagreement with respect to the Purchase Price Adjustment. Defendants filed three motions to dismiss or stay this action: (1) a motion to compel arbitration and stay the Purchase Price Adjustment claim; (2) a motion to dismiss Chancellor for lack of personal jurisdiction; and (3) a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claims regarding the third-party mineral interest in the Plot on the merits. Newmont responded in opposition to all three motions, and Defendants replied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Such adjustments had to be submitted according to the following procedure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the \"Statement\") ... setting forth the Adjustment Amount and a certificate of Seller that the Statement has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of this Section....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day following delivery thereof, unless Purchaser gives written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a \"Notice of Disagreement\") to Seller prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall ... only include disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on the Adjustment Amount not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.04.... During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified by Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Purchaser shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the \"Accounting\n   Firm\") for resolution any and all matters that were included by Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SPA \u00a7 2.04(a), (b). The \"Adjustment Amount\" calculated by AngloGold in its Statement was based in part on a \"Net Cash Amount,\" which in turn was calculated by taking \"the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents ... minus ... the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness\" of certain entities as of a particular time.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375853\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/171/#p175\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.04(i).

Newmont responded with its Notice of Disagreement on October 29, 2015, stating that AngloGold had miscalculated the Purchase Price Adjustment by nearly $4.5 million by not counting \"a payment obligation related to a certain 'Sinclair Oil Agreement' \" as an \"Indebtedness\" that impacted Victor Mining's value.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157-159. AngloGold responded on November 18, 2015, stating its view that the Sinclair Oil Agreement did not qualify as an \"Indebtedness\" under the SPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160. The parties never submitted this dispute to an \"independent accounting firm\" under the terms of the SPA. Newmont instead filed this action, seeking determinations from the Court that the Sinclair Oil Agreement should have been counted as an \"Indebtedness\" under the SPA and that the Adjustment Amount should have been altered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the motion to compel arbitration, AngloGold argues that the dispute over whether the Sinclair Oil Agreement qualifies as an \"Indebtedness\" must be resolved by the \"Accounting Firm\" identified in SPA \u00a7 2.04(b). To succeed on this motion, AngloGold must demonstrate (1) that there was a binding arbitration agreement between the parties, and (2) that the dispute at issue here falls within the scope of that agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Specht v. Netscape Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p26\">\n    306 F.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (2d Cir. 2002). There is no dispute that the parties here agreed to resolve \"certain disputes regarding the calculation of post-closing purchase price adjustments by submitting the dispute to an accountant arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 73;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 169. The only question, then, is whether the dispute here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the Sinclair Oil Agreement should have been accounted for as an Indebtedness-fell within the scope of that agreement, To determine \"whether a particular dispute falls within the scope\" of an arbitration clause, the Court must first \"classify the particular clause as either broad or narrow\" and then \"determine whether the dispute is over an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause, or over a collateral issue that is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration clause.\"\n   <em>\n    Louis Dreyfus Negoce S.A. v. Blystad Shipping &amp; Trading Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085996\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/218/#p224\">\n    252 F.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the arbitration agreement is a narrow one, collateral issues will generally fall outside its scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085996\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/218/#p224\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The arbitration provision of the Purchase Price Adjustment is a narrow one that explicitly defines and limits its own scope in two different provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 2.04(b), (d). The problem, however, is that those internal definitions are worded in slightly different ways. On the one hand,\n   \u00a7 2.04(b) provides that Newmont shall provide in its Notice of Disagreement \"only ... disagreements based on mathematical errors\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   based on the Adjustment Amount not being calculated\n   <em>\n    in accordance with this Section 2.04\n   </em>\n   \" and then requires the parties to submit to the Accounting Firm \"for resolution\" the remaining disputes with respect to \"any and all matters that were included by\" Newmont in that Notice of Disagreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.04(b) (emphasis added). On the other hand, \u00a7 2.04(d) provides that \"scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm\" is limited in relevant part to \"whether the Statement was prepared\n   <em>\n    in accordance with the Adjusted Accounting Principles\n   </em>\n   with respect to the matters that were submitted for resolution to the Accounting Firm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.04(d) (emphasis added). The parties now dispute, essentially, which of these definitions applies and, if it is only the one in \u00a7 2.04(d), whether AngloGold's determination with respect to the Sinclair Oil Agreement was made based on the Adjusted Accounting Principles or the terms of SPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the Federal Arbitration Act, when \"the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself,\" then \"any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Moses H.

The Court \"must be mindful of the federal presumption in favor of arbitration, [but] cannot allow that presumption to have the strong effect\" that it would if the arbitration clause were broad.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531522\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/825/#p832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the language of the contract itself provides (1) that Newmont was required to include any disagreement about \"the Adjustment Amount not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.04\" in its Notice of Disagreement, and (2) that the parties were required to submit any dispute included in the Notice of Disagreement that was not amicably resolved to the Accounting Firm \"for resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 2.04(b). It appears from \u00a7 2.04(d) that the parties expected that most, if not all, of such disputes would involve questions of how the Adjusted Accounting Principles should be applied. As to the parties' present dispute, the question of whether a particular contract should have counted as a \"payment obligation\" and \"Indebtedness\" appears inextricably intertwined with the question of whether AngloGold's assessment of the Sinclair Oil Agreement comported with the relevant Accounting Principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   AngloGold for its part appears\n   to have relied on the Adjusted Accounting Principles in implementing and interpreting the terms \"Indebtedness\" and \"payment obligation\" while calculating the Adjustment Amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Notice of Disagreement at 1 (Dkt. 25-5) (stating that, \"[c]onsistent with the Adjusted Accounting Principles, ... the Sinclair Oil Agreement was not booked as a financial liability\" as of the relevant time). Section 2.04 does not explain what role the Adjusted Accounting Principles should play in the Adjustment Amount equation. Yet it specifically provides that the Accounting Firm may resolve disputes over AngloGold's use of those Principles and that the parties must submit to the Accounting Firm \"for resolution\" any dispute over whether the Adjustment Amount was calculated in accordance with \u00a7 2.04.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7\u00a7 2.04(b), (d), Clearly, then, the Principles were to play a role in calculating the Adjustment Amount. Thus, at the very least, whether AngloGold's treatment of the Sinclair Oil Agreement and interpretation of the term \"Indebtedness\" was proper under the Adjusted Accounting Principles is an issue within the scope of both \u00a7 2.04(b) and \u00a7 2.04(d). Accordingly, the Court grants AngloGold's motion to compel arbitration of the Purchase Price Adjustment Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Newmont argues that its Purchase Price Adjustment claim rests on \u00a7 2.04(a)'s covenant that AngloGold's Statement of the Adjustment Amount would be \"prepared in compliance with the requirements of this Section 2.04.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 2.04. According to Newmont, the question of whether AngloGold complied with the equation within that section and the definition of Indebtedness is entirely separate from the question of whether AngloGold complied with the Adjusted Accounting Principles. The inference that Newmont asks this Court to draw, however, is not a reasonable one. Even if Newmont were correct that the definition of Indebtedness was not informed by the Adjusted Accounting Principles-which this Court doubts for the reasons explained above-the SPA still facially required Newmont to include its disagreement with respect to the proper calculation of the Adjustment Amount in its Notice of Disagreement (which Newmont did) and, ultimately, to send that disagreement to arbitration (which it did not).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531522\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/825/#p832\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.04(b). If the Accounting Firm lacked the authority to resolve disputes \"based on the Adjustment Amount not being calculated in accordance with this Section 2.04\"-including the definition of Indebtedness-it would have made no sense to require that the full set of such disputes be sent to the Accounting Firm \"for resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531522\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/825/#p832\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court is not unsympathetic to Newmont's position. To the extent that Newmont can state a claim for breach of the covenant in \u00a7 2.04(a)-which the parties dispute-such a claim explicitly falls outside the authority of the Accounting Firm. The SPA states that the \"Accounting Firm is not authorized to, and shall not, make ... any determination as to compliance by any party hereto with any of its covenants in this Agreement, other than Section 2.04(h).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531522\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/858/825/#p832\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.04(d). As explained above, however, the SPA expressly requires the parties to submit to the Accounting Firm for resolution any disputes with respect to the correctness of AngloGold's calculations under \u00a7 2.04. In light of this language, the Court grants AngloGold's motion to compel arbitration and stays the case as to the Purchase Price Adjustment Claim only.

Chancellor disputes this characterization and avers that he lacked decisionmaking authority in the relevant negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 36. He concedes, however, that he \"traveled to New York for a two-day meeting ... to discuss the SPA's terms\"; that he at minimum attended that meeting \"to support\" AngloGold and \"to provide advice regarding U.S. law\" during the negotiations; and that he \"traveled to New York ... for the transaction's closing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The allegations in the Complaint further indicate that Chancellor, as the Vice President and General Counsel to one of the AngloGold entities, was intensely involved in the contract's drafting and would have been aware of its terms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 130 (\"In the days leading up to the closing, the AGA Defendants, Newmont and several attorneys-including Defendant Chancellor-discussed at length several different amendments to the SPA and its schedules.\"). Nothing in Chancellor's affidavit, meanwhile, indicates that he lacked familiarity with the SPA's terms. Indeed, Chancellor's declaration at least partially corroborates the Complaint in this respect. He avers that he, among other things, \"review[ed] certain transaction documents\"; \"prepar[ed] certain SPA schedules related to legal and land matters\"; and had at least some \"opportunities to review and provide input on the terms of the SPA from the perspective of a U.S. lawyer familiar with the operations at\" Victor Mining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 32, 34.

Well before the closing, those terms declared that the SPA would be \"governed by New York law\" and specifically provided that the parties consented to jurisdiction in this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Newmont brings two claims against Chancellor specifically. First, Newmont asserts that he participated in the fraudulent inducement of Newmont to enter into the SPA by making representations regarding the mine's quality while failing to disclose, for example, his knowledge of the mill's defects, the Victor Mining internal memorandum,\n   and the third-party mineral interests in the Plot.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 175-82. Second, Newmont claims that Chancellor aided and abetted AngloGold's violations of Colorado's securities laws-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that he had knowledge of the fraud AngloGold was allegedly perpetrating in the SPA and provided AngloGold substantial assistance in executing that fraud.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 210-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. New York's Long-Arm Statute Extends to Chancellor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Complaint's uncontroverted allegations make a prima facie case for exercising personal jurisdiction over Chancellor under New York's long-arm statute. Even though Chancellor was not a party to the contract, he admits to having attended a two-day meeting in New York to discuss the SPA's terms, having aided his employers in negotiating specific terms of the SPA while there, and having provided them advice with respect to how U.S. law impacted the transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. These activities, combined with his official attendance at the closing and his familiarity with the contract (presumably including its choice of law provision), are sufficient to satisfy the Court that he purposefully availed himself of \"the privilege of conducting activities\"-including, it seems, the practice of law-\"within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Best Van Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3475913\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/239/#p246\">\n    490 F.3d at 246-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although none of these actions alone would be dispositive, the totality of Chancellor's contacts with New York suffice to establish jurisdiction. Under the circumstances here, the Court concludes that Chancellor transacted business under \u00a7 302(a)(1) when he purposefully traveled to New York and, while in the state, provided legal advice to his employer, assisted with the negotiation and finalization of terms in an agreement that specifically invokes New York law, and attended the closing for that very transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Chancellor responds that his trips to New York were not essential or substantial enough to the formation of the SPA to count as a transaction of business under \u00a7 302(a)(1). There is no\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   requirement, however, that a contract's key terms must be negotiated in the forum state for those negotiations to count as a transaction of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NW Direct Design\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20493348\">\n    1999 WL 493348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"Courts have consistently held that contract negotiations occurring in New York are sufficient to support jurisdiction when they [1] either 'substantially advanced' or were 'essential' to the formation of a contract or [2] if they resulted in a more solid business relationship between the parties.\"). Here, Chancellor participated in the active negotiation of several of the SPA's contract terms, helped to finalize those terms, provided legal advice to his employer about those terms, and attended a closing for the deal-all within the state of New York, This combination of contacts was essential enough to the advancement of the deal and the solidification of the relationship between the parties to satisfy \u00a7 302(a)(1) and to distinguish this case from those where courts have held contacts to be too inconsequential, incidental, or attenuated to convey jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Chancellor relatedly asserts that the reasons he went to New York were outside of his control and that it was essentially arbitrary that the deal ended up being negotiated in part and closed in New York. \"But one can make the same argument for almost any contract,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd. v.

That the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Parke-Bernet\n   </em>\n   acted \"on his own initiative\" was certainly significant to that court's decision, but it does not, as Chancellor appears to argue, create a carte blanche rule that an action cannot be \"purposeful\" if it is taken on behalf of an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A subsequent decision by the New York Court of Appeals further supports the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Parke-Bernet\n   </em>\n   's language cannot be so construed.

His assistance to AngloGold allegedly included his trips to New York, where he purportedly knew of and yet failed to inform Newmont about various matters material to the deal which he was participating in negotiating and closing in New York. It is unclear if any of the specific contract terms that Chancellor says were negotiated in New York-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those \"related to indemnification, labor issues, and corporate structure, as well as the royalty payment,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6 37-are the basis for Newmont's claims against Chancellor specifically. Regardless, the Complaint alleges facts indicating that, during the time Chancellor was in New York, he knew of and yet failed to disclose various purported misrepresentations in the contract. The basis of Plaintiff's claims against Chancellor appears to be that he assisted his employer with finalizing the terms of the SPA, which he did while in New York, and by attending the closing in New York,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Chancellor Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37, all without disclosing the purported defects with the mine, among other things.

Defendants argue that Plaintiff's allegations regarding the Plot are too sparse and inconsequential to support any of Plaintiff's claims to the extent they relate to the Plot and that Newmont's claim for breach of contract is time barred regardless. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that-as to Plaintiff's allegations regarding the Plot only-Newmont's claim for breach of contract is time barred and its claims for fraudulent inducement and securities fraud are not supported by particularized allegations of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the Complaint, Newmont asserts the following as to the Plot and the purportedly undisclosed mineral interests therein:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   145. Newmont also learned after the closing that Defendants had knowingly failed to disclose certain interests in violation of Section 4.05(j) of the SPA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   146.

In any event, the Complaint contains no allegations of fact about how Newmont came to the belief that, as to this particular interest in the Plot, AngloGold owed millions of dollars.

By all accounts, every single other item in Schedule 4,05(j) was accurate. The Complaint includes plenty of allegations of conscious misbehavior and/or recklessness on Defendants' part with respect to their purported attempts to cover up the structural problems with the mine and its mill.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   AngloGold also argues that Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract, to the extent it relates to the Plot, must be dismissed because such a claim is both barred as untimely under the SPA and insufficiently alleges damages under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The SPA provisions most relevant to this claim are sections 4.05, 9.02, 9.05, and 9.07. Section 4.05(j) provides that an attached schedule sets forth \"a true and complete list\" of any \"net profit interests\" or \"payments on or out of production\" to which Victor Mining was subject.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 4.05(j) (Dkt 7-1). That schedule allegedly did not list certain third-party \"mineral interests\" in the Plot. Section 9.02(a), meanwhile, provides that AngloGold would be \"jointly and severally liable\" and would indemnify Newmont for any loss arising from, among other things, \"any representation of [AngloGold] contained in this Agreement not being true and correct when made or at the Closing.\" SPA \u00a7 9.02(a)(i), This right to indemnification is limited by sections 9.02(d), 9.05, and 9.07. Section 9.02(d) states that \"in the absence of fraud\" Newmont's \"sole and exclusive monetary remedy ... shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX.\" SPA \u00a7 9.02(d). Section 9.05 provides that \"[t]he obligations to indemnify\" relevant here \"shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.07, and no claim may be brought with respect to any representation and warranty following such termination\" unless, prior to the termination date, a \"notice\" of claim is sent to the indemnifying party. SPA \u00a7 9.05. Section 9.07, in turn, states that the relevant representations and warranties \"shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article IX and shall terminate on December 31, 2016.\" SPA \u00a7 9.07. Newmont did not file any notice of its claim regarding the Plot with AngloGold prior to December 31, 2016, and it filed the Complaint in this action on October 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The dispute between AngloGold and Newmont as to the interpretation and application of these terms presents two questions for this Court to decide: (1) whether the SPA permits Newmont to bring a breach of contract claim separate from the indemnification procedures of Article IX; and (2) if not, whether the time limit within Article IX applies to the claims here. New York law applies to the Court's interpretation and construction of the SPA's terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 10.10. In interpreting the SPA here, the Court bears in mind that, \"when parties set down their agreement in a clear, complete document, their writing should as a rule be enforced according to its terms\"-particularly when, as here, the contract \"was negotiated between sophisticated business people at arm's length.\"\n   <em>\n    Skanska USA Bldg.

Newmont May Not Pursue an Independent Breach of Contract Claim Under Article IX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court concludes that Article IX of the SPA bars Newmont from pursuing a claim for the breach of the warranty in \u00a7 4.05(j) that is separate from the contract's indemnification procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7 9.02(d). The SPA provides that Article IX is the exclusive remedy \"in the absence of fraud\" and that Newmont waives \"any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have as of the Closing against [AngloGold] arising under\n   or based upon this Agreement, any other Transaction Documents, ... or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and for rights, claims and causes of action arising out of fraud of [AngloGold] ).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12554059,12554060\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/98/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Newmont argues that \u00a7 9.02(d) should be read to carve out any claims \"where there are allegations of fraud\" or \"where there is fraud\" generally,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P's Dismissal Br. at 8 (Dkt. 44). Even if Newmont were correct in its interpretation of the SPA, however, its argument would rely at minimum on the presence of live fraud claims as to the relevant purported breach. The Court has just dismissed Plaintiff's fraud claims for failing to adequately allege fraud as to Defendants' failure to disclose the third-party mineral interests in the Plot. Thus, Plaintiff cannot at this stage argue that its breach of contract claim \"arises out of\" fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Any Indemnification Relief under Article IX is Time-Barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Given that the SPA required Newmont to follow the indemnification procedures in Article IX, the Court must determine whether the time limitations set for claims for indemnification in sections 9.05 and 9.07 are enforceable against Newmont. Those provisions state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   SECTION 9.05.\n   <em>\n    Termination of Indemnification\n   </em>\n   . The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(1) [for \"any representation or warranty of [AngloGold] contained in this Agreement not being true and correct when made or at the Closing\"] ...\n   <em>\n    shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.07, and no claim may be brought with respect to any representation and warranty following such termination\n   </em>\n   ... provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have,\n   <em>\n    before the expiration of the applicable period\n   </em>\n   , previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) pursuant to Section 9.06 to the party to be providing the indemnification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   SECTION 9.07.\n   <em>\n    Survival of Representations\n   </em>\n   . Each Seller Fundamental Representation [defined in SPA \u00a7 9.02(b)(i) to include those in \u00a7\u00a7 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 4.01, 4.02 and 4.11] shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article IX indefinitely and shall not terminate.\n   <em>\n    Each other representation and warranty in this Agreement [including those in SPA \u00a7 4.05] shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article IX and shall terminate on December 31, 2016\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   SPA \u00a7\u00a7 9.05, 9.07 (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   According to AngloGold, these provisions bar any claim Plaintiff might have had for indemnification as to the third-party mineral interests because the Complaint alleges no facts indicating that Newmont ever made a notice of its claim for breach of the warranty in \u00a7 4.05(j) prior to December 31, 2016, and the Complaint itself was filed after that date. \"Parties to a contract may agree to a shorter period of limitations within which an action may be brought so long as the period agreed to is not unreasonably short ...; nevertheless, the intention to establish a shorter period must be clearly set forth in the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Hurlbut v.

The Court disagrees. Sections 9.05 and 9.07 of the SPA plainly bar Plaintiff's claim for indemnification as to the Plot. In no uncertain terms, those provisions state that \"no claim may be brought with respect to any representation and warranty following\" the termination of the relevant warranty on December 31, 2016, unless a specific procedure is followed to preserve the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SPA \u00a7\u00a7 9.05, 9.07. Newmont failed to provide timely notice of its claim as to the Plot. And Plaintiff has cited no case indicating that this Court may ignore the SPA's plain language that \"no claim may be brought\" in such a circumstance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   That the contract failed to use the magic words \"statute of limitations\" is of no consequence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court further rejects Plaintiff's footnoted argument that \"to read Section 9.05 as implicitly eliminating the statute of limitations would render the protections of Section 9.02(d) and Section 9.07 meaningless.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P's Dismissal Br. at 8 n.3. Plaintiff has failed to explain why that would be so, and the Court sees no reasoned basis for it-particularly given that all Plaintiff had to do to avoid the time limit on its claims was to file a notice of the claim by December 31, 2016, and that Article IX limited Newmont's relief only for claims that did not \"arise out of\" fraud, as explained above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court thus grants Anglo Gold's motion to dismiss Newmont's claim for the breach of the warranty in SPA \u00a7 4.05(j). No other aspect of Newmont's breach of contract claim is affected by this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As explained above, AngloGold's motion to compel arbitration is granted and the case is stayed as to the Purchase Price Adjustment claim only; Chancellor's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied; and Defendants' motion to dismiss Newmont's claims relating to the purported third-party mineral interests in a plot of land on Victor Mining's property is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff may amend the Complaint so long as it does so no later than October 18, 2018.
