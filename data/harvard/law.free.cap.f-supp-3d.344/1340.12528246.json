Parrish, United States District Court Judge\n   This matter comes before the court on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Defendant Calfrac Well Services Corporation (\"Calfrac\") moved for summary judgment on each of Plaintiff's three claims on January 11, 2018 (ECF No. 22). On January 12, 2018, Plaintiff IHC Health Services, Inc. (\"IHC\") moved for summary judgment on all claims, as well as on its request for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest (ECF No. 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This dispute involves the denial of benefits allegedly due under a self-funded health benefit plan. Defendant Calfrac funds and administers a health benefit plan for its employees (the \"Plan\") that was established and is operated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Plaintiff IHC is a corporation that operates several hospitals in Utah, including Intermountain Medical Center. Nonparty UMR is a third-party claims administrator hired by Calfrac to provide administrative services for the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   T.Q., a beneficiary of the Plan, was born at Intermountain Medical Center on June 10, 2014 via cesarean section after only 30 weeks of gestation. Complications resulting from his premature birth led to a lengthy period of hospitalization, and by the time T.Q. was discharged on August 17, 2014, he had incurred a hospital bill totaling $443,223.34-$368,983.43 of which Calfrac is alleged to owe after contractual adjustments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because IHC erroneously believed that Blue Cross Blue Shield was the primary insurer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   IHC sought and was granted authorization for T.Q.'s care from Blue Cross Blue Shield at the time of A.Q.'s admission. IHC did not discover its error until September 9, 2014, at which point it submitted the claim to UMR. On December 26, 2014, UMR informed T.Q.'s father, the Plan participant, that Calfrac was denying the claim for failure to obtain prior authorization as required by the Summary Plan Description (\"SPD\" or \"Plan document\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A subsequent appeal did not change this initial determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IHC filed its Complaint on October 3, 2016, alleging three counts against Calfrac: (1) for recovery of plan benefits under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) ; (2) for breach of fiduciary duty under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109, and 1132(a)(2), (3) ; and (3) for failure to produce plan documents under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201024\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) and 1132(c)(1). However, in the course of briefing the instant motions, IHC conceded that (1) it cannot maintain a claim for breach of fiduciary duty alongside a claim for payment of benefits owed, (ECF No. 35 at 2), and (2) Calfrac is not liable for statutory penalties flowing from a failure to disclose plan documents, (ECF No. 37 at 8). As a result, Calfrac is entitled to summary judgment on Counts II and III of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court, then, need only resolve the parties' motions as they relate to plaintiff's first Count-a claim for payment of benefits due under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) -and plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court held oral argument on these motions on September 19, 2018. On the basis of that hearing, the parties' briefs, and a review of the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part each of the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

IHC'S PURPORTED ASSIGNMENT\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Calfrac first argues that this court cannot reach the merits of IHC's claim under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) because that subsection vests a right of action only with a plan's \"participant or beneficiary.\" IHC does not purport to be either, but rather contends it is an assignee of benefits by virtue of a Consent and Conditions of Service form (\"Consent Form\") executed by T.Q.'s mother, A.Q., on May 20, 2014. Calfrac contests the validity of the assignment. Both parties agree, however, that if the\n    purported assignment is valid, IHC stands in the beneficiary's shoes and \"has standing to assert whatever rights [the beneficiary] possessed.\"\n    <em>\n     Denver Health &amp; Hosp. Auth. v. Beverage Distribs. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3816901\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/546/742/#p745\">\n     546 F. App'x 742\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 745 (10th Cir. 2013).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    As an initial matter, the court perceives the need to draw an analytical distinction between two concepts related to the Consent Form that have been largely conflated by the parties' briefs. With few exceptions, the parties' analyses of IHC's standing to pursue this action have confused IHC's assignment of benefits with IHC's appointment as an attorney-in-fact (or personal representative) of the beneficiary. These are distinct legal concepts, which is made clear by both the Consent Form\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    the SPD.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    IHC's Consent Form reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     8. Assignment of Benefits-Attorney-in-Fact.\n    </strong>\n    By signing below, I hereby assign and transfer to the Facility, and to any other health care provider for whom Facility bills, the benefits of any insurance policy or other arrangement that may provide payment for some or all of my care. I\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    authorize and appoint the Facility and anyone it may designate as my attorney-in-fact for purposes of communicating, appealing, negotiating, or otherwise pursuing in its discretion any or all legal remedies with any Insurance company, group, organization, entity or any other payer to obtain payment for the Facility for the services that were provided to me.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    JAR at 1 (emphasis added). Although this provision, as its heading suggests, effects both an assignment of benefits and the appointment of an attorney-in-fact, each sentence has a discrete legal effect. The assignment results in a complete substitution of obligees; the beneficiary transfers any rights to benefits it may have to IHC. The second sentence authorizes IHC to act\n    <em>\n     on behalf\n    </em>\n    of the beneficiary, as an attorney-in-fact, rather than transferring any rights to payment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The SPD similarly contemplates that an appointment of an attorney-in-fact (what the SPD calls a \"Personal Representative\") is not the same as an assignment of benefits:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     Personal Representative\n    </strong>\n    means a person (or provider) who can contact the Plan\n    <em>\n     on the Covered Person's behalf\n    </em>\n    to help with claims, appeals or other benefit issues. Minor Dependents must have the signature of a parent or Legal Guardian in order to appoint a third party as a Personal Representative. If a Covered Person chooses to use a Personal Representative, the Covered Person must submit proper documentation to the Plan stating the following: The name of the Personal Representative, the date and duration of the appointment and any other pertinent information. In addition, the Covered Person must agree to grant their Personal Representative access to their Protected Health Information. The Covered Person should contact the Claim Administrator to obtain the proper forms. All forms must be signed by the Covered Person in order to be considered official.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURES FOR SUBMITTING CLAIMS\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     Most providers will accept assignment\n    </em>\n    and coordinate payment directly with the Plan on the Covered Person's behalf. If the provider will not accept assignment or coordinate payment directly with the Plan, then the Covered Person will need to send the claim to the Plan within the timelines discussed below in order to receive reimbursement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    JAR at 126-27 (emphases added). The SPD prescribes procedures by which a third party might act on the beneficiary's behalf, but this is distinct from the SPD's presumption that a beneficiary will execute\n    an assignment of benefits in favor of a provider.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The parties vigorously dispute whether or not the Consent Form satisfied the Plan's requirements for a valid appointment of a Personal Representative. The resolution of this dispute might have been critical to IHC's claim for statutory penalties under \u00a7 1132(c)(1) because Calfrac would not be liable for failing to produce plan documents unless IHC had the authority to request those documents on the beneficiary's behalf. However, IHC has conceded that Calfrac is entitled to summary judgment on that claim. (ECF No. 37 at 8). Because that claim is no longer at issue, the court need not decide whether the Consent Form complies with the SPD's Personal Representative requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Whether IHC has standing to pursue its claim for benefits under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) turns only on whether T.Q. and IHC have entered into a valid assignment that does not conflict with any terms of the SPD. The court first analyzes the standard of review applicable to Calfrac's refusal to recognize the validity of the assignment, and then turns to the parties' arguments regarding the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Relevant Standard of Review\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Calfrac suggests that its decision declining to recognize the validity of the purported assignment is subject to the same arbitrary and capricious standard as its denial of benefits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 36 at 9. The court agrees, in part. As explained above, an administrator's entitlement to this deferential standard of review stems only from a plan's reservation, in explicit terms, of some measure of discretion. Here, although the SPD vests Calfrac with sole discretion to interpret the plan,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    JAR, 31, it does not extend the same to Calfrac's interpretation of extra-Plan documents like an assignment agreement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Accordingly, to the extent that Calfrac's decision turned on an interpretation of the SPD's requirements for a valid assignment, that determination is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard. However, so far as Calfrac's refusal to recognize the validity of the assignment rests on an interpretation of IHC's Consent Form rather than the SPD, Calfrac is not entitled to any measure of deference.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Having determined the appropriate standard under which the validity of the assignment will be reviewed, the court turns to the parties' arguments regarding the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Does the Consent Form apply to T.Q. in the First Instance?\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    First, Calfrac suggests that the Consent Form on which IHC relies did not effectively assign T.Q.'s benefits to IHC because it was executed by his mother, A.Q., and contains a statement indicating that the signer's relation to the patient is \"self.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 22 at 14. Therefore, the assignment may have been valid as to any rights possessed by A.Q., but not to those possessed by T.Q. Relatedly, Calfrac argues that A.Q.'s execution of the Consent Form twenty days before T.Q.'s birth means it could not have been effective as to T.Q. But these arguments reflect a much too narrow interpretation of the Consent Form, and can be dispensed with by analyzing the entire document.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Two provisions of the Consent Form are relevant to Calfrac's argument. First, the document explicates that its signer \"intend\n    that the following apply to\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of my or all of the patient's inpatient and outpatient care and services in facilities owned or operated by IHC Health Services, Inc.\" JAR, 2 (emphasis added). Later, the Consent Form secures the signer's agreement \"that if I am an obstetrical patient admitted for delivery-or spouse of that patient-my signature below extends my consent and agreement to the terms and conditions of this agreement for my infant(s).\" JAR, 3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Together, these provisions extend the scope of the assignment of benefits to\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    medical services provided by IHC to either A.Q. or T.Q. Calfrac's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive, and it is doubtful that its interpretation of the Consent Form would pass muster even if reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Does the Assignment of Benefits Conflict with the SPD?\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Calfrac devotes much of its argument section to explaining why the Consent Form did not comply with the SPD's requirements for a valid appointment of a personal representative. But as explained above, an assignment is not interchangeable with the appointment of a personal representative or attorney-in-fact. For purposes of standing to challenge a denial of benefits under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), the relevant question is whether the SPD prescribed requirements or procedures necessary for an\n    <em>\n     assignment\n    </em>\n    to be recognized as valid by the Plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Calfrac directs the court to cases in which providers were found to lack standing to sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) because the relevant plan documents explicitly forbade assignments. The court finds these cases instructive, but in ways that militate against Calfrac's conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For example, Calfrac relies on\n    <em>\n     IHC Health Services., Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 2:15-cv-846,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203817682\">\n     2016 WL 3817682\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , * (D. Utah July 12, 2016), a case in which a provider asserting an assignment of benefits was found to lack standing because the plan documents expressly proscribed assignment agreements. Calfrac's reasoning breaks down when it attempts to extend that conclusion to this case because the SPD here contains no such prohibition. Indeed, the only inference that can be drawn from the SPD's declaration that \"[m]ost providers will accept assignment\" is that assignments of benefits are permissive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Accordingly, the court concludes that IHC is a valid assignee of any benefits due to T.Q. by the Plan, and thus has standing to challenge a denial of such benefits under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     B. THE DENIAL OF PLAN BENEFITS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In the Tenth Circuit, a court reviewing an administrator's decision that relies on an interpretation of language in an ERISA plan will first determine whether such language is ambiguous.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Scruggs v. ExxonMobil Pension Plan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480502\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/1356/#p1362\">\n     585 F.3d 1356\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1362 (10th Cir. 2009). In making this determination, a court is to \"consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person\n    <em>\n     in the position of the plan participant\n    </em>\n    , not the actual participant, would have understood the words to mean.\"\n    <em>\n     Weber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752087\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/1002/#p1010\">\n     541 F.3d at 1011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . If the plan documents as a whole are unambiguous, a reviewing court should construe them as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     Weber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752087\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/1002/#p1010\">\n     541 F.3d at 1011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The parties agree that the SPD establishes the following: (1) prior authorization is required for hospital stays that are longer than 96 hours following cesarean sections, and (2) the penalty for failing to obtain prior authorization is a denial of plan benefits. The parties' main dispute revolves around the applicability and appropriate\n    interpretation of the plan's emergency care exception to the prior authorization requirement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Emergency Care Exception\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Calfrac's principal argument on this point is that T.Q.'s medical services cannot fall under the plan's emergency exception because his care did not take place in an emergency room. In support, Calfrac suggests that its interpretation of the SPD's emergency care provision is bolstered by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (\"EMTALA\"), a statutory scheme not in any way implicated here. Calfrac claims that courts interpreting EMTALA have defined emergency care in a way that would exclude these factual circumstances. Because federal courts have come to this conclusion, Calfrac urges, its own conclusion to this effect cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Irrespective of its interpretive value, EMTALA and its judicial interpretations have no place in this court's review because, as the SPD unambiguously explains, \"[a]ny review of a final decision or action of the Plan Administrator or the Third Party Administrators shall be based only on such evidence presented to or considered by [them] at the time it made the decision that is the subject of review.\" JAR, 31;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752087\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/1002/#p1010\">\n     541 F.3d at 1011\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[I]n reviewing a plan administrator's decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard, the federal courts are limited to the administrative record--the materials compiled by the administrator in the course of making his decision.\"). In its initial determination and throughout a subsequent appeal, UMR failed to offer\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    rationale why the plan's emergency care provision did not excuse T.Q.'s failure to obtain prior authorization. The court declines Calfrac's invitation to impute this EMTALA interpretation to its third-party administrator when the record is devoid of even the most cursory of considerations of the emergency care exception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Even if the EMTALA analogy were in play, however, the court would find no reason to look beyond the SPD to find the relevant definition of medical services for which the prior authorization requirement is excused. As the SPD explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    The Covered Person will not be penalized for failure to obtain Prior Authorization if a Prudent Layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect that the absence of immediate medical attention would jeopardize the life or long-term health of the individual.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    JAR, 109. Calfrac has utterly failed to engage with this language in its initial determination, a subsequent appeal, and before this court. Neither has Calfrac pointed the court to any portion of T.Q.'s condition that would fall below this standard. As a result, the court is left to hypothesize an interpretation of this language that would exclude from its reach the circumstances facing T.Q. upon his premature birth. The court concludes that Calfrac's apparent failure to even consider the applicability of this provision was unreasonable,\n    and therefore arbitrary and capricious.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The only argument advanced by Calfrac that rests on an interpretation of the actual Plan document is the dubious claim that the prior authorization requirement applicable to hospital stays exceeding 96 hours after cesarean section operates independently of the emergency care provision. Stated differently, Calfrac argues that the prior authorization requirement in this particular circumstance is absolute and will admit of no exceptions. The court can confidently declare that such an interpretation of the SPD is unreasonable. The only reasonable interpretation of the relationship between the prior authorization requirement and the emergency care provision is that, when triggered, the emergency care provision relieves the plan's beneficiary of the obligation to obtain authorization prior to receiving\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    care.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The SPD as a whole supports this construction of the emergency services exception. The SPD makes explicit that inpatient hospital stays extending more than 96 hours after cesarean section birth are subject to the prior authorization requirement. JAR, 110. The SPD further makes clear that the penalty for failing to obtain prior authorization is the cost of the services for which prior authorization was not received.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752087\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/1002/#p1010\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But the SPD nevertheless declares that \"Prior Authorization\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be required for a stay beyond 48 hours following a vaginal delivery or 96 hours following a Cesarean section.\" JAR, 109 (emphasis added). That the plan\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    require prior authorization for stays exceeding 96 hours after a cesarean delivery only makes sense when viewed alongside the SPD's dispensation for emergency care. That is, the most plausible interpretation of this language is that it contemplates a scenario where, as here, the newborn or its mother, as a result of childbirth complications, \"could reasonably expect that the absence of immediate medical attention would jeopardize the life or long-term health of the individual[,]\" thereby obviating the prior authorization requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As explained above, the record does not evidence that UMR considered, either in its initial determination or a subsequent appeal, that T.Q.'s condition might implicate the emergency care exception. Its failure to do so was unreasonable, and therefore arbitrary and capricious. The court further finds that, T.Q., a premature infant weighing 2.93 pounds who required care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, at least initially met the standard prescribed by the SPD to excuse the prior authorization requirement. Consequently, Calfrac's denial of benefits for T.Q.'s care on grounds that prior authorization was not obtained was unreasonable, and therefore arbitrary and capricious.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    But this does not end the court's review of Calfrac's denial of benefits. The parties agree that even when the emergency care exception is applicable, the SPD requires that the beneficiary contact the Plan's Utilization Review Organization (\"URO\") \"within 24 hours of the first business day after receiving care or after Hospital admittance.\" JAR, 109. The parties further agree that such contact was not made here. Nowhere in its administrative determinations or briefs submitted in connection with these motions did Calfrac suggest that this failure should result in a forfeiture of all benefits. The court had assumed that the omission of this argument reflected Calfrac's reasoned decision not to advance an interpretation that stretches the bounds of even the most deferential standard of review. But at the hearing for these motions, Calfrac argued that its discretionary authority would permit its complete denial of benefits when a beneficiary fails to contact the URO after receiving emergency care.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The SPD is far from clear about what happens in the wake of emergency care. And Calfrac is entitled to considerable deference in its resolution of this uncertainty. But the SPD simply cannot support an interpretation by its administrator that results in the penalty of denied benefits for failure to contact the URO. The SPD goes to great lengths to unambiguously alert the Plan's participants and beneficiaries to the circumstances under which the penalty of a complete denial of benefits will be applied. But nowhere does it alert a beneficiary to the possibility of that penalty upon a failure to contact the URO. And the SPD later injects even more ambiguity into the requirement when it indicates, in connection with the emergency care provision, that \"Covered Persons\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    be required to notify the Plan following stabilization.\" JAR, 126 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Although a construction of the post-emergency care contact provision that would result in the forfeiture of all benefits due to a failure to contact the URO would be clearly unreasonable, the administrator's discretion undeniably extends to interpreting the operation of this ambiguous provision. A reasonable interpretation may well result in a decrease of benefits owed by the Plan. Calfrac could certainly conclude that, had the URO been contacted as the SPD requires, it could have actively intervened to manage the level and duration of care provided to T.Q. Calfrac could further determine that the URO would have successfully constrained the costs flowing from T.Q.'s hospitalization, whether by requiring a lesser level of care as T.Q. improved, or by requiring his discharge when his condition could have been managed on an outpatient basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     C. REMEDIES\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The court's determination that Calfrac's denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious does not automatically entitle IHC to the benefits it seeks. Indeed, the court's \"final task is to determine the proper remedy.\"\n    <em>\n     DeGrado v. Jefferson Pilot Fin. Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3269398\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1161/#p1175\">\n     451 F.3d 1161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1175 (10th Cir. 2006). \"[W]hen a reviewing court concludes that a plan administrator has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in handling a claim for benefits, it can either remand the case to the administrator for a renewed evaluation of the claimant's case, or it can award ... benefits.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3269398\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1161/#p1175\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted). A court should award benefits \"only if the evidence clearly shows that the administrator's actions were arbitrary and capricious or the case is so clear cut that it would be unreasonable for the plan administrator to deny the application for benefits on any ground.\"\n    <em>\n     Caldwell v. Life Ins. Co. of N.

But the court cannot say that this determination is so clear \"that it would be unreasonable for the plan administrator to deny application for benefits on\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    ground.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442719\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/1276/#p1289\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). As explained above, Calfrac retains the discretion to interpret how the plan should take account of a failure to contact the URO, keeping in mind the cost-control rationale underlying that provision. Calfrac's discretion additionally extends to the\n    <em>\n     reasonable\n    </em>\n    determination of when T.Q.'s condition no longer constituted an emergency: that is, at what point in T.Q.'s care would it have been unreasonable for \"a Prudent Layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, [to] expect that the absence of immediate medical attention would jeopardize the life or long-term health of the individual.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Because Calfrac did not interpret the post-emergency care provision in this case, the matter is remanded to Calfrac to resolve these matters and to arrive at any\n    reduction of benefits flowing from a failure to comply with the post-emergency care contact provision. The court expresses no view on these matters, except to say that Calfrac's discretionary authority must be exercised in good faith, and that its determinations on remand may not contravene the court's conclusion that certain interpretations of the SPD would be arbitrary and capricious.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     1.
