The defendant, Medical Mutual Liability Insurance Society of Maryland, asks us to determine whether the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in awarding post-judgment interest, on the reduced judgment, from the date of the original judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The plaintiffs, Williette Davis and Massaquoi Kamara, filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County wrongful death and survivor actions against Doctor Vibhakar Mody, based on alleged negligence in connection with the birth of their son, Sana Kpehe Kamara. The child died when he was about two years old, allegedly as a result of the negligence at the time of his birth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On November 7, 1996, the jury found Dr. Mody negligent and returned verdicts in favor of Williette Davis and Massaquoi Kamara, individually, on the wrongful death claims, and a verdict in favor of the estate of Sana Kpehe Kamara on the survivor claim. On November 13,1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>a judgment was entered on the Circuit Court\u2019s docket as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">Estate of Sana Kpehe Kamara:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Medical Expenses $1,313,283.30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">Noneconomic Damages $2,000,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Williette Davis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">Noneconomic Damages $1,000,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">Massaquoi Kamara:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">Noneconomic Damages $1,000,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">Two days later, on November 15, 1996, Dr. Mody filed a motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, for a remittitur. After numerous pleadings, replies, memoranda, and hearings, the Circuit Court filed an opinion and order on September 11, 1997, making the following determinations. First, the court accepted the parties\u2019 suggestion that the noneconomic damages awarded to the estate of Sana Kpehe Kamara be reduced from $2,000,000.00 to $350,000.00, in light of the then cap on noneconomic damages set forth in Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 ll-108(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Second, the court \u201cdenied Defendants\u2019 Motion for a New Trial, or in the Alternative, Motion for Remittitur, for the noneconomic award to the parents.\u201d Thus, the court did not disturb the wrongful death judgments entered in favor of Williette Davis and Massaquoi Kamara, individually, because the court \u201cfound that the jury awarded these amounts based upon credible evidence and th[e] court was unwilling to invade the jury\u2019s province in that regard.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Third, the court granted in part the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial or a remittitur, limited to the issue of medical expenses awarded to the estate of Sana Kpehe Kamara.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">In light of the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings, the clerk, on September 11, 1997, entered on the docket a \u201ctotal judgment [of] $2,350,000.00 with costs\u201d against the defendants, subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>estate\u2019s 'acceptance of the remittitur. On September 25, 1997, the estate accepted a remittitur reducing the medical expense portion of the survivorship award to zero, and thus reducing the entire survivorship award to $350,000.00. Therefore, the total judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for $2,350,000.00 became final on September 25,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The plaintiffs then sought payment of the judgment from Dr. Mody\u2019s insurance carrier, Medical Mutual Liability Insurance Society of Maryland (Medical Mutual). On February 19, 1998, Medical Mutual tendered payment of Dr. Mody\u2019s insurance policy liability limit of $1,000,000.00 plus post-judgment interest in the amount of $95, 288.32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The post-judgment interest was calculated from September 25, 1997, the date of the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The plaintiffs subsequently filed, directly against Medical Mutual, a \u201cRequest for Writ of Garnishment for Post Judgment Interest,\u201d seeking additional post-judgment interest, on the reduced judgment, in the amount of $206,670.58.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They argued that post-judgment interest should accrue from the date of the original jury verdict assessing liability, which was November 7, 1996. After a hearing, the Circuit Court awarded to the plaintiffs post-judgment interest on the reduced judgment amount but accruing from the date of the original judgment entered by the court on November 13,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Medical Mutual then filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, this Court issued a writ of certiorari. <em>Medical Mutual Liability Insurance Society of Maryland v. Williette Davis, </em>355 Md. 610, 735 A.2d 1105 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>As previously mentioned, Medical Mutual raises a single issue on appeal, namely whether the Circuit Court erred as a matter of law in making an award of post-judgment interest from the date of the original judgment after having reduced the judgment pursuant to Medical Mutual\u2019s post-judgment motions. Medical Mutual contends that interest on a tort judgment begins to run from the \u201cdate of entry of the judgment,\u201d and that in the present case, such entry occurred on September 25, 1997, the date the plaintiffs accepted a remittitur on the jury verdict award and the date on which the judgment became final and appealable. The plaintiffs agree that interest on a tort judgment begins to run from the date of entry of the judgment. They contend, however, that in the present case such entry occurred on November 13, 1996, the date of the original entry of judgment upon the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Under Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 ll-107(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and Maryland Rule 2-604(b), post-judgment interest accrues at the rate of 10% per annum \u201cfrom the date of entry\u201d of the judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cdate of entry\u201d of a judgment is the date on which the clerk of the court makes a written record of the judgment pursuant to Rule 2-601.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this case, there were two differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ent times when \u201cjudgments\u201d were entered on the docket: November 1996 and September 1997. Nonetheless, as November 13,1996, was the first date on which there was \u201centry\u201d of a money judgment, the language of Rule 2-604(b) indicates that post judgment interest would properly begin to run from that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In support of its argument that post-judgment interest should not have begun to run until September 25, 1997, Medical Mutual relies on the definitions of \u201cJudgment\u201d and of \u201cMoney judgment\u201d set forth in Rules l-202(n) and l-202(p). Those definitions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201c(n) Judgment. \u2018Judgment\u2019 means any order of court final in its nature entered pursuant to these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201c(p) Money judgment. \u2018Money judgment\u2019 means a judgment determining that a specified amount of money is immediately payable to the judgment creditor. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Medical Mutual contends that, \u201c[f]or an order to be \u2018final in its nature,\u2019 it must be both appealable and enforceable under the Maryland Rules. * * * [W]hen a party files a motion for new trial in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-533, the Circuit Court retains jurisdiction to affirm, modify, amend, or vacate the judgment. Maryland Rule 8-202(c). Therefore, the judgment cannot be considered \u2018final in its nature.\u2019 For this reason, the Court of Appeals held that the order disposing of the post-trial motion becomes the only final and appealable judgment in the case. <em>B &amp; K Rentals v. Universal Leaf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Tobacco Co., </em>319 Md. 127, 132, 571 A.2d 1213 (1990)....\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 6-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The flaw in Medical Mutual\u2019s argument is that the judgment of November 13, 1996, was final in its nature and was appeal-able at the time of its entry on November 13, 1996. Furthermore, absent any subsequent action being taken, it was \u201cpayable to the judgment creditor.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 2-632(b). If no post-judgment motions were filed, it would be the only \u201cmoney judgment\u201d entered in the case. Consequently, on the date of entry, the November 1996 judgment would appear to have been a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the definitions set forth in Rules 1-202(n) and l-202(p) and thus a \u201cjudgment\u201d for purposes of Rule 2-604(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Medical Mutual\u2019s theory seems to be that any order of a court, which would be a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of Rules l-202(n) and l-202(p) at the time of entry, is actually not a judgment within the meaning of those rules if any action is taken after the date of entry which has the effect of abrogating the order\u2019s finality for purposes of appeal. In the case at bar, Medical Mutual\u2019s motion under Rule 2-533 for a remittitur or new trial, filed within ten days of the November 13, 1996, judgment, rendered the November 13th judgment nonfinal for purposes of appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 8-202(c); <em>B &amp; K Rentals v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., supra, </em>319 Md. at 132, 571 A.2d at 1216 (\u201cConsequently, \u2018when a motion to alter or amend an otherwise final judgment [or a motion for new trial] is filed within ten days after the judgment\u2019s entry, the judgment <em>loses its finality for purposes of appeal,\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d quoting <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940 (1985), emphasis supplied, brackets in original).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>If Medical Mutual\u2019s theory were correct, and if the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in the Maryland Rules meant only a \u201cjudgment\u201d not susceptible of losing its finality by subsequent action, numerous rules would make little or no sense. For example, Rule 2-533 itself, as well as Rules 2-532(b) and 2-534, all provide for various motions to be filed \u201cwithin ten days after entry of judgment,\u201d and, as pointed out above, such motions cause judgments to lose their finality for purposes of appeal. These rules obviously treat as \u201cjudgments\u201d orders similar to the order entered in this case on November 13, 1996. They specifically deal with \u201cjudgments\u201d which lose their finality because motions are filed within ten days. Rules 2-532, 2-533, and 2-534 would be nonsensical if they were using the word \u201cjudgment\u201d in accordance with Medical Mutual\u2019s theory. Other rules also use the word \u201cjudgment\u201d to include an order which is final at the time of entry even though subsequent action may cause the order to lose its finality for purposes of appeal. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rules 2-522(a), 2-535, 2-601, 2-611, 2-613(f), 2-614, 2-615, 2-622, 2-632.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Accordingly, the entry of judgment on November 13, 1996, would seem to constitute the \u201centry\u201d of a \u201cmoney judgment\u201d within the meaning of Rule 2-604(b). We do not, however, intend to suggest that post-judgment interest always begins to accrue whenever a money judgment is entered and is final at the time of entry. Rule 2-604(b) must be applied to various situations in accordance with the purpose of post-judgment interest and the considerable case-law governing the running of post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">This Court has stated that the \u201cpurpose of post-judgment interest is obviously to compensate the successful suitor for the same loss of the use of the monies represented by a judgment in its favor, and the loss of income thereon, between the time of entry of the judgment <em>nisi </em>\u2014 when there is a judicial determination of the monies owed it \u2014 and the satisfaction of the judgment by payment.\u201d <em>I.W. Berman Prop. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Porter Bros., </em>276 Md. 1, 24, 344 A.2d 65, 79 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, upon the entry of judgment on November 13, 1996, there was a judicial determination that the plaintiffs were entitled to at least $2,350,000.00 (the ultimate reduced amount), and no subsequent action changed this judicial determination. While the judgment entered on November 13,1996, lost its finality for purposes of appeal, and might not have been effective for some other purposes, it did not disappear. Furthermore, while the actual November 1996 judgment was later modified, the minimum amount of $2,350,000.00 owed to the plaintiffs was not modified. Therefore, in light of the purpose of post-judgment interest, the plaintiffs were entitled to the loss of income on the $2,350,000.00 from November 13, 1996. Presumably, Medical Mutual earned interest on that sum during the ten-month period from November 1996 to September 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Although the parties have not called to our attention any prior Maryland cases involving the same circumstances as those in the present case, the principles set forth in prior cases clearly support the position of the plaintiffs-appellees and the decision of the Circuit Court. For example, let us suppose that the Circuit Court in September 1997, instead of simply reducing the amount of the November 1996 judgment, had set aside that judgment and either entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Rule 2-532 or awarded a new trial pursuant to Rule 2-533. In this hypothetical scenario, if the plaintiffs had taken an appeal, and if the Court of Special Appeals had reversed the September 1997 judgment and had held that the November 1996 judgment should not have been set aside, post-judgment interest would run from November 1996 rather than from the appellate court\u2019s mandate. The filing of motions under Rules 2-532 or 2-533 within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ten days of the November 13, 1996, judgment would not have prevented post-judgment interest from accruing as of November 13, 1996. <em>See, e.g., Cook v. Toney, 245 </em>Md. 42, 50, 224 A.2d 857 (1966) (\u201cif the motion of [the defendant] Toney for a new trial had been <em>overruled </em>or if the granting of a new trial had ... been <em>reversed </em>by this Court on appeal, the plaintiff would have been entitled to [post-judgment] interest from the date of the original [judgment] against Toney\u201d); <em>Hodgson v. Phippin, </em>159 Md. 97, 101, 150 A. 118 (1930) (where the delay after the verdict was caused by a motion for a new trial, post-judgment interest ran from the date of the verdict, as \u201ca litigant should not be penalized for delay from motions made\u201d); <em>Brown v. Medical Mutual, </em>90 Md.App. 18, 21, 599 A.2d 1201, 1202, <em>cert. denied, </em>326 Md. 366, 605 A.2d 101 (1992) (\u201cas successful plaintiffs in a case in which the trial court\u2019s grant of j.n.o.v. has been reversed on appeal, they are entitled to post-judgment interest from the date of entry of the original judgment on the verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The above-cited Maryland cases stand for the principle that post-judgment motions or appeals, which may cause a money judgment for a plaintiff to lose some aspects of its finality, ordinarily do not have the effect of postponing the accrual of post-judgment interest from the date that the original money judgment was entered. Cases in other jurisdictions, under rules or statutes similar to Maryland Rule 2-604(b), are generally to the same effect. <em>See, e.g., Tinsley v. Sea-Land Corporation, </em>979 F.2d 1382, 1383 (9th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 817, 114 S.Ct. 69, 126 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993); <em>H.J. Inc. v. Flygt Corporation, </em>925 F.2d 257, 261-262 (8th Cir.1991); <em>Northern Natural Gas Company v. O.W. Hegler, </em>818 F.2d 730, 737-738 (10th Cir.1987); <em>Isaacson Structural Steel Co. v. Armco Steel Corp., </em>640 P.2d 812, 818 (Alaska 1982); <em>Pascack Valley Bank and Trust Co. v. Ritar Ford Sales, </em>6 Conn.Cir.Ct. 646, 295 A.2d 667 (1972); <em>Knapp and State of Maryland v.

General Tire and Rubber Co., </em>5 Utah 2d 379, 302 P.2d 712 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Moreover, under circumstances similar to those in the present case, where a judgment in favor of a plaintiff is subsequently reduced via the plaintiffs acceptance of a remittitur, courts elsewhere consistently hold that post-judgment interest runs from the date of the original judgment. <em>See, e.g., Dunn v. HOVIC, </em>13 F.3d 58, 61-62 (3rd Cir.1993) (\u201cWe see no reason why Dunn should be disadvantaged in the calculation of interest because the jury overestimated his damages\u201d); <em>Coal Resources, Inc. v. Gulf &amp; Western, Industries, </em>954 F.2d 1263, 1275 (6th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe remittitur merely reduced the damages by a distinct amount easily determined from the facts of the case. * * * [W]e ORDER that interest on the damages awarded in this case be calculated from the date of the original District Court judgment\u201d); <em>Schulte v. Smith, </em>708 So.2d 138, 140 (Ala.1997) (\u201cWe conclude that interest on the remitted judgment ... accrues from the date the trial court entered the original judgment\u201d); <em>Scioto Memorial Hospital Association, Inc. v.
