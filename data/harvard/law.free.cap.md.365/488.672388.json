Appellant was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County from March 9 through March 12, 1998, after the case was removed from the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, and convicted of felony homicide, robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. A sentencing hearing was conducted on March 17-18, 1998. Appellant was sentenced to death on March 19, 1998. This case is before this Court on automatic appeal pursuant to Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 414 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.) and Maryland Rule 8-306(c). We find no errors that tainted the proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">On April 2, 1997, Edward Joseph Atkinson was shopping at the Structure Store and Small\u2019s Formal Wear located at a mall in Salisbury, Maryland. While arranging to pick up tuxedos at Small\u2019s for a musical theater production he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>directing, he received a page. Atkinson immediately left the mall. Later that day, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Harry Hughes, Jr., a resident of Old Bradley Road in Mardela Springs, Maryland, saw Atkinson driving a black Toyota Canary down Old Bradley Road. Within fifteen minutes, Hughes heard a single gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">On the same day, Atkinson failed to show up for dinner at his home with his parents and for his evening play rehearsal. His mother, Dorothy Atkinson, notified the Maryland State Police that her son was missing. The next day, April 3, 1997, at approximately 9:00 p.m., Maryland State Police officers located Atkinson\u2019s Toyota near Old Bradley Road and found a cowboy boot print in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In the morning of April 4, 1997, Robert Wayne Atkinson, the victim\u2019s brother, and his friend who had joined the search, Sean Thomas Mooney, returned to Old Bradley Road to comb the area for additional information concerning Edward Atkinson\u2019s whereabouts. After following footprints on the ground, Robert Wayne Atkinson discovered his brother\u2019s body in a wooded area. Later that same day, Robert Wayne Atkinson and Sean Mooney also saw a gray colored car driven by the appellant heading towards the crime scene off of Old Bradley Road. The police arrived on the scene and determined that Edward Atkinson had been shot once in the back of the head and dragged to the location where his body was found. The police noticed several additional cowboy boot prints near the body matching the one found the night before by the victim\u2019s car, as well as scuff marks indicating a struggle at the side of the road. The police also discovered that Atkinson\u2019s pockets had been emptied, but a search of the wooded area surrounding the crime scene failed to produce the victim\u2019s wallet and keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In contacting his brother\u2019s credit card companies to report the theft, Robert Wayne Atkinson learned that the cards had been used after his brother had been reported missing. The cards had been used on April 3, 1997, at a Wal Mart ATM in Cambridge, Maryland, at the Tru Blu gas station in Harring<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ton, Delaware, at the Structure and J.C. Penney stores in the Dover Mall, and at Shuckers Pier 13 Restaurant in Dover, Delaware. The personnel interviewed at these locations described the credit card holder as a white male, approximately 6T\" to 6'3\" tall, having medium length dirty blonde to brown hair, and wearing white jeans or pants with a white shirt and cowboy boots. (Two of the Tru Blu gas station attendants subsequently identified appellant as the Atkinson card user.) Composite sketches of the suspect were drawn and circulated on local news stations. During the next two weeks, news reports specifically mentioned the sighting of the murder suspect at the Tru Blu gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On April 15, 1997, James Towers (a resident of Caroline County) was in his home monitoring the police and fire department radio transmissions with his scanner. Towers\u2019 scanner was capable of picking up cellular phone conversations. At some point between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m., Towers overheard a conversation on his scanner where a male and female discussed the importance of staying away from the Tru Blu gas station in Harrington, Delaware. Because he thought this conversation might be related to the news story about the murder, Towers tape-recorded the conversation. Towers notified the Maryland State Police about the tape, who promptly picked up the tape from Towers\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The tape of the phone conversation included a discussion of concealing evidence, as well as descriptions of the geographic area surrounding the couple\u2019s home. Deputy Ronald Russum of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department listened to the tape and identified the female voice as Jona Miles, who turned out to be appellant\u2019s wife. Detective James Fraley of the Delaware State Police identified the voices as Jody and Jona Miles, based on his previous contacts with both individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">By April 22, 1997, after locating Jona Miles\u2019s residence, the Maryland and Delaware State Police applied for search warrants for 292 Cole Britt Lane, Harrington, Delaware and 27880 Whiteleysburg Road, Greensboro, Maryland, properties owned by Jona Miles and her parents. The police executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the warrants on the same day. During the search of the properties, the police seized several items of clothing belonging to appellant and his 1996 W-2 tax statement as well as other papers, a razor, telephone bills, phone numbers from a caller identification box, and other pieces of note paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Later that day, the police placed Jona Miles under arrest and questioned her at the Caroline County Sheriffs Department. Jona Miles gave a statement to the police and assisted them in ascertaining her husband\u2019s whereabouts. She also signed a consent to search form authorizing Corporal Fisher of the Maryland State Police Force to search her trailer located on her parents\u2019 property at 27880 Whiteleysburg Road. Pursuant to the consent to search form, the police seized one pair of black men\u2019s jeans and one pair of tan Structure dress pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Jona Miles admitted that within a week after April 2, 1997, she had thrown two Structure shirts in a dumpster near Route 404 in Centreville, Maryland, and a few days later she had accompanied her husband as he disposed of his cowboy boots in a dumpster behind a shopping center in Milford, Delaware. Ms. Miles also dumped a handgun, holster and ammunition left by her husband in the Choptank River near Denton, Maryland. With the assistance of Ms. Miles, the State Police were able to recover the gun in its holster and the ammunition, but were not able to find the clothing. As a result of information given to them by Jona Miles, the police arrested appellant while he was driving a gray Chevrolet Cavalier on Carmichael Road near a farm where he had been working. The contents of the car, including a cellular phone and the vehicle registration card, were inventoried and seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">During the evening of April 22, 1997, Corporal William V. Benton and Trooper John Psota began interviewing appellant, after he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Within minutes of the beginning of the questioning, appellant admitted that on April 2,1997, he met Edward Atkinson at a rest area near Old Bradley Road. Appellant claimed that he had been sent by a loan shark to collect a package from Atkinson, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>victim did not produce. He stated that he became scared when Atkinson, who, at appellant\u2019s direction, had his back to appellant the entire time, reached inside his jacket. Appellant, concerned that Atkinson had a gun, fired one shot striking the victim in the back of the head.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Afterwards, appellant found and removed Atkinson\u2019s wallet and two briefcases from the car. Although appellant returned to the scene on April 4, 1997 with the intention of burying Atkinson\u2019s body, he fled when he saw all of the police cars in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">On May 9, 1997, appellant was indicted and charged with felonious homicide, robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery, first-degree assault, and use of a handgun in a crime of violence in Wicomico County. On July 29,1997, the state filed a notice of its intention to seek a sentence of death pursuant to Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b). On October 2, 1997, the case was transferred for trial to the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County. The trial court heard pre-trial suppression motions pursuant to Rule 4-452 on January 28, 1998 and February 23-24, 1998, wherein appellant sought to suppress the contents of the taped cellular phone conversation with his wife, the items seized pursuant to the search warrant executed in the early afternoon of April 22, 1997, the items seized pursuant to Jona Miles\u2019s consent to search, the gun and its accessories, appellant\u2019s confession, and his cellular telephone seized pursuant to a post-arrest inventory of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Based on these motions, the trial court ruled to suppress the taped cellular phone conversation as well as evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant where the affidavit of probable cause made explicit reference to the facts contained in the cellular phone conversation as a violation of the Maryland Wiretapping Statute, Maryland Code, Section 10-401 et seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1977,1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). The trial court refused to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the remaining evidence, reasoning that the language \u201cevidence derived therefrom\u201d as contained in the statutory exclusionary provision of the Maryland Wiretapping Act did not include evidence provided by Jona or Jody Miles. On March 12,1998, the jury entered a guilty verdict for first-degree felony murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Appellant was acquitted on the charge of first-degree premeditated murder. Shortly after midnight on March 19, 1998, the jury sentenced appellant to death. The trial court merged the robbery conviction into the armed robbery count and imposed a five-year concurrent sentence for the handgun count. Appellant filed a Motion for New Sentencing and/or Imposition of Life Sentence in Lieu of Death Sentence on March 26, 1998. The trial court held a hearing on this motion on May 7, 1998. The motion was denied on July 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On appeal, appellant urges reversal on the following eight grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">I. Did the trial court err in denying, in part, appellant\u2019s motion to suppress pursuant to the Maryland Wiretapping Act, Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-401 et seq. of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">II. Did the trial court err in failing to fully disclose the contents of a jury note sent to the judge after seven hours of sentencing deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">III. When, after seven hours of deliberations, the jury asked the trial court what to do if they were not unanimous, is it improper for the trial court to instruct the jury that unanimity is an absolute prerequisite and fail to instruct the jury that it could report its lack of unanimity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">IV. Did the trial court improperly limit what the jury could consider as mitigating evidence under section 8(b) of the sentencing form in the instructions provided to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>V. Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury during sentencing that it must find, as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance, that appellant was acquitted of premeditated murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">VI. Were there ambiguities and inconsistencies present in the sentencing verdicts which would require that appellant\u2019s death sentence be vacated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">VII. Did the trial court err in excusing four jurors for cause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">VIII. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to grant defense counsel\u2019s motion for mistrial when it was discovered that the jurors had seen appellant in shackles?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Facts relevant to each issue are set forth as necessary in our consideration of the issues below.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">III. SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE UNDER THE MARYLAND WIRETAPPING ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">A motions hearing was conducted on January 28, 1998, in the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County. As pertains to the issues on appeal before this Court, the motions hearing before the trial court involved the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of the Maryland State Police having secured and used a recording made by a private citizen of a cellular phone conversation between Jona and Jody Miles on April 15, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant argued that the Maryland Wiretap Statute protects all phone conversations, cellular or otherwise. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-401, et seq., of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). Furthermore, appellant argued that evidence obtained in violation of Section 10-402 must be excluded from evidence at trial. Appellant also argued for the suppression of evidence seized pursuant to search warrants executed at Jona Miles\u2019s home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>from appellant\u2019s car following his arrest, as well as suppression of the gun, ammunition and holster recovered by the Maryland State Police in the Choptank River and the statements given to police by both Jona and Jody Miles as evidence derived from the unlawful interception of the cellular phone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At the suppression hearing, the trial court heard testimony from James Towers, the private citizen who taped the cellular phone conversation between Jona and Jody Miles and turned the recording over to the Maryland State Police. Towers testified that he had purchased his Radio Shack scanner several years prior to the recording of the conversation between the appellant and Jona Miles. The scanner in question was commercially available in Radio Shack stores and could monitor up to four hundred channels. Towers explained that he took his scanner to the now defunct Kent Communications in Dover, Delaware, for alterations to enhance its functioning. Towers testified that his scanner.could pick up transmissions from cellular phones, cordless phones, emergency services such as police, fire and ambulance communications, and radio stations. Prior to April 15, 1997, Towers had never recorded a transmission received by his scanner and turned it over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Because the affidavits of probable cause used to obtain search warrants for Jona Miles\u2019s property contained explicit references to the taped conversation, the trial court suppressed the contents of the phone conversation as well as all items seized pursuant to the search warrants. The trial court permitted the State to introduce the evidence to which Jona Miles led the police, namely the .22 caliber gun and its accessories, as well as the confession of appellant, Jody Miles. Appellant argues that this evidence should have been suppressed because of its connection to the wiretapped conversation. We disagree, based upon the attenuation doctrine and its application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In 1977, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act (the Maryland Act), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>codified at Section 10-401 et seq. of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code. The Maryland Act makes the following conduct unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">(1) Wilfully intercept, endeavor to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">(2) Wilfully disclose, or endeavor to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(3) Wilfully use, or endeavor to use, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-402(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). <em>See Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 342-43, 748 A.2d 478, 487-88 (2000); <em>State v. Mazzone, </em>336 Md. 379, 382, 648 A.2d 978, 979 (1994); <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 15-16, 537 A.2d 612, 614, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 832, 109 S.Ct. 90, 102 L.Ed.2d 66 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The model for the Maryland Wiretapping Act was Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2521 (2000) (the Federal Act). The Federal Act was designed to balance the protection of an individual\u2019s privacy with the enforcement of criminal laws. <em>See United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 151, 94 S.Ct. 977, 982, 39 L.Ed.2d 225, 234 (1974); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. at 13, 537 A.2d at 613. The Federal Act sets forth minimum national standards prohibiting both law enforcement officials and private individuals from intercepting and using the contents of oral and wire communications, while allowing law enforcement officials following specific procedures and under specific circumstances concerning the investigation of criminal offenses to obtain a court order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>intercept wire and oral communications related to the commission of a crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The Maryland Wiretapping Act provides broader protection than Title III in that Maryland requires consent from all parties before a conversation may be taped or otherwise intercepted in the absence of a court order authorizing law enforcement officials to conduct a wiretap. <em>See Wood v. State, </em>290 Md. 579, 583, 431 A.2d 93, 95 (1981); <em>see e.g., </em>Richard Gilbert, <em>A Diagnosis, Dissection, and Prognosis of Maryland\u2019s New Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance Law, </em>8 U. Balt. L.Rev. 183, 221 (1979)(explaining that \u201cas written [the Maryland Act] guarantees to the people of Maryland, insofar as the state, itself, is concerned, greater protection from surreptitious eavesdropping and wiretapping than that afforded the people by the Congress\u201d). At the times relevant here, the Maryland Wiretapping Act applied so long as at least one party to the conversation was physically located within the State of Maryland during the phone call.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Mustafa, </em>323 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Md. at 70, 591 A.2d at 483 (applying the Maryland Wiretapping Act to the taping of a conversation by one party to the conversation who was located in the District of Columbia and speaking with a person located in Maryland). Therefore, people using telephones in Maryland \u201cmay ordinarily rely on the fact that their conversation will <em>not </em>be surreptitiously recorded or, at the very least, that, unless done in strict conformance with the State law, a recording of their conversation will not be admitted into evidence in any Maryland court.\u201d <em>See Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 61, 741 A.2d 1162, 1175 (1999)(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Although the Maryland Wiretapping Statute is grounded, to some extent, in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, it contains its own exclusionary provision in Section 10-405 to deter law enforcement officials from unlawful or unauthorized interception of wire and oral communications. This section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of the communication and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of this State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-405 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol.). The exclusionary rule of Section 10-405 mirrors the language of the Federal Act\u2019s exclusionary provision, as both provisions contain prohibitions against the use of not only the unlawfully intercepted communication, but also the \u201cevidence derived therefrom.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We now consider the application of the Maryland Wiretapping Act and its internal exclusionary provision to the facts of this case. On April 15, 1997, appellant called home to his wife, Jona Miles, from a cellular phone in his car.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conversation taped by Mr. Towers emanates from this call. The issue of whether a cellular phone call is protected under the Maryland Wiretapping Statute is a matter of first impression. The Maryland Act defines a \u201cwire communication\u201d as \u201cany aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception (including the use of a connection in a switching station) furnished or operated by any person licensed to engage in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of communications.\u201d \u00a7 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>401(l)(i). The transmission of a cellular phone communication to an ordinary telephone line involves the sound waves of the conversation being transmitted over the cellular phone company\u2019s designated frequency to the cellular phone carrier\u2019s transmitter, which sends the signal over a land-based wire to the ordinary telephone. <em>See generally </em>Raymond C.V. Macario, Cellular Radio-Principles and Design, (2nd ed.1997). The use of the cellular phone company\u2019s transmitter as a switching station for converting the communication to a land-based telephone line places cellular phone technology within the definition of a \u201cwire communication\u201d under Section 10-401(l)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, the Maryland Wiretapping Act specifically provides for the imposition of fines to punish persons who intercept cellular phone conversations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-402(e). The relevant portion states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201c... [A] person who violates subsection (d) of this section is subject to a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">(2) If an offense is a first offense under paragraph (1) of this subsection and is not for a tortious or illegal purpose or for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private commercial gain, and the wire or electronic communication with respect to which the offense occurred is a radio communication that is not scrambled or encrypted, and:... (ii) The communication is the radio portion of a cellular telephone communication, a public land mobile radio service communication, or a paging service communication, the offender is subject to a fine of not more than $500.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Code, \u00a7 10-402(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Because we have determined that cellular phone communications with land phones are protected under the Maryland Wiretapping Act, we must address the existence and extent of any violations of the statute by the Maryland State Police requiring exclusion of the taped cellular phone conversation and any \u201cevidence derived therefrom.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-405. Although Mr. Towers testified at the suppression hearing that he did not know that it was unlawful for him to tape the cellular phone conversation between appellant and his wife, we have held that an intentional interception of such a communication violates the Maryland Wiretapping Act. <em>See Deibler v. State, </em>365 Md. 185, 199, 776 A.2d 657, 665 (2001)(holding that \u201can interception that is not otherwise specifically authorized is done willfully if it is done intentionally \u2014 purposely\u201d). What is clear from Mr. Towers\u2019s testimony at the pre-trial suppression hearing is that he believed the conversation was related to the news story of the murder of Edward Atkinson he had heard previously that day and that the police might be interested in acquiring the information. Although the police were not involved in the initial listening to or the taping of the conversation, the police were aware that the conversation had been taped by Mr. Towers without the consent of the parties to the conversation. This Court discussed the interplay of the statutory exclusionary rule with the other provisions of the subtitle in <em>Perry, </em>wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">To determine whether the disclosure of an intercepted communication is in violation of the subtitle [for purposes of the exclusionary rule of \u00a7 10-405], it is necessary to look at \u00a7 10-402(a)(2) and \u00a7 10-407.

In the instant case, the Maryland State Police did not receive the tape or have authorization to play the tape. Because the actions of the Maryland State Police were not authorized by the statute, we need not determine the willfulness of the police in disclosing the information contained within the tape under Section 10-402(a)(2), for as we have noted, \u201c[w]hether the interception was done willfully or non-willfully, the violation of the person\u2019s right to privacy was the same.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 66, 741 A.2d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The Maryland State Police used the tape of the cellular phone conversation between Jona and Jody Miles for two investigatory purposes in violation of Section 10-405, as they used the tape for voice recognition and to provide facts to set forth in the affidavit for probable cause to search property belonging to Jona Miles and her parents. With regard to the issue of voice recognition, the State asserts that use of the tape to provide voice recognition as an investigative tool does not violate the Fourth Amendment. We agree with the State\u2019s argument that under a Fourth Amendment analysis there can be no privacy expectation in one\u2019s voice. <em>See United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 14, 93 S.Ct. 764, 771, 35 L.Ed.2d 67, 79 (1973)(noting that \u201cthe physical characteristics of a person\u2019s voice, its tone and manner, as opposed to the content of a specific conversation, are constantly exposed to the public\u201d). Nevertheless, a person\u2019s voice is part and parcel of the contents of the conversation. The Maryland Wiretapping Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>provides broader protection than the Fourth Amendment in that it makes it unlawful to \u201cwilfully use, or endeavor to use, the <em>contents </em>of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle.\u201d Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-402(a)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (emphasis added). Thus, the parties\u2019 voices in the conversation would be protected under the statute. <em>See Perry, </em>357 Md. at 70, 741 A.2d 1162, 1180 (1999)(holding that the tape itself and testimony identifying the voices on a tape recording of phone conversation made in violation of Section 10-402 is inadmissible under Section 10-405).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In the instant case, the Maryland State Police disclosed the contents of the tape to two police officers. Deputy Ronald Russum of the Caroline County Sheriffs Department listened to the tape of the cellular phone conversation and was able to identify the female caller as Jona Miles based on his previous contact with her. Detective James Fraley of the Delaware State Police identified the male caller as appellant, Jody Miles, and the female caller as Jona Miles based on voice identification from prior contact with both individuals and from facts discussed in the conversation which disclosed the relative geographic location of the female caller. Thus, the police, as an \u201cauthority of this State,\u201d violated Section 10-405 by using the contents of the communication when they listened to the tape to engage in voice identification of Jona and Jody Miles. Therefore, we agree with the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress the taped cellular phone conversation and any reference thereto from use at trial under Section 10-405.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Subsequent to the voice identification of Jona and Jody Miles by the police, Detective Fraley and Detective Alfred Parton of the Delaware State Police prepared an affidavit and application for a search warrant for the property belonging to Jona Miles and her parents. In establishing probable cause in the warrant application, Detective Fraley and Detective Par-ton made explicit reference to the facts contained in the taped cellular phone conversation, as well as disclosing to the Delaware magistrate that the facts were ascertained through listening to a tape made by a private citizen who intercepted the cellular phone call on his scanner. The search warrant was approved by a Delaware Justice of the Peace and executed on April 22, 1997 at 2:15 p.m., during which the police seized over twenty-four items belonging to appellant. We conclude that, because the contents of the cellular phone conversation were disclosed in the affidavit of probable cause to obtain a search warrant for Jona Miles\u2019s property in violation of Section 10-405, all evidence seized pursuant to execution of this warrant was properly suppressed at trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>We must now consider the scope and application of the statutory exclusionary rule set forth in Section 10-405 with regard to the interpretation of the language \u201cevidence derived therefrom\u201d as we consider whether the trial judge erred in allowing the evidence obtained from leads provided by Jona Miles, including appellant\u2019s black jeans and tan dress pants, and the murder weapon and its accessories to be introduced in evidence at trial. For purposes of analyzing the phrase \u201cevidence derived therefrom,\u201d we note that the primary illegality was the interception of the cellular phone call by James Towers on April 15, 1997. <em>See Deibler, </em>365 Md. at 199, 776 A.2d at 665. Appellant argues that the language \u201cevidence derived therefrom\u201d requires the exclusion of all evidence obtained after listening to the tape, based on the belief that were it not for the violation of the wiretapping statute in listening to the unlawfully intercepted tape, the police would not have discovered the identities of Jona and Jody Miles resulting in both parties arrests, confessions, and additional production of evidence. The State argues the same principles underlying the exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), apply to the interpretation of the language \u201cno evidence derived therefrom\u201d under the statutory exclusionary rule based on the fact that the statutory exclusionary rule is a preventive or deterrent device, such that rulings regarding the exclusion of evidence under Section 10-405 must be narrow enough to accomplish the deterrence goals without sacrificing valid investigatory evidence and material attenuated from taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">When considering the scope of a piece of legislation, this Court has stated, \u201cthe legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself, through its very own words.\u201d <em>Derry, </em>358 Md. at 335, 748 A.2d at 483. If the statutory language \u201cis plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning,\u201d there is no need to look elsewhere to discern legislative intent. <em>See Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 417, 722 A.2d 887, 895 (1999). However, this Court has frequently noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.

Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 387, 614 A.2d 590, 594 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Prior to enactment of the current Maryland Wiretapping Act, this Court considered the scope of the exclusionary provision of the Federal Act as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515. <em>See Carter v. State, </em>274 Md. 411, 423-24, 337 A.2d 415, 422-23 (1975). Following our decision in <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 272, 292 A.2d 86, 95 (1972), where this Court had concluded that wiretapping cases must be considered under whichever statute was more constricting, we examined the facts of <em>Carter </em>under the Federal Act which was more-restrictive than the 1956 Maryland Wiretapping Act. <em>See Carter, </em>274 Md. at 426, 337 A.2d at 424. In <em>Carter, </em>the police had used illegal electronic surveillance in investigating the drug activities of the defendant, included the facts ascertained through the unlawful surveillance in an affidavit for probable cause to obtain a search and seizure warrant for defendant\u2019s apartment, and failed to disclose to the issuing judge the fact that the information contained in the warrant was the product of an unauthorized wiretap in violation of the Maryland and Federal Wiretapping Acts. <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 337 A.2d at 420. We found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">The weight of authority in the state courts is in accord with the view that evidence derived as a result of a prior illegal search for, or seizure of, property, or knowledge gained through such an illegal search and seizure, cannot be used, because of its taint, as a valid basis to justify the existence of probable cause in a subsequent search and seizure war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>rant. <em>See </em>Annot., 143 A.L.R. 135-140 (1943); Annot., 50 A.L.R.2d 531, 569 (1956).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">Thus, if any conversation of Carter or any conversation overheard upon his premises-whether he was present and participating in it or not-was subjected to a search and seizure by the use of any wire tap or eavesdropping device, in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment, as explicated in <em>Alderman v.

Thus, we applied a Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule analysis to use of evidence derived from an unlawful -wiretap in holding that in cases where an affidavit of probable cause to issue a search warrant contained facts tainted by the illegal conduct of the police in the unlawful interception of telephonic communications, an evidentiary hearing must be conducted to determine whether the facts were the fruits of the poisonous tree or whether the taint had been purged by discovery of the facts through an independent source or attenuated from the original unlawful conduct. <em>See Carter, </em>274 Md. at 443, 337 A.2d at 434 (citing <em>United States v.

Giordano, </em>416 U.S. 505, 528-29, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 1833, 40 L.Ed.2d 341, 360-61 (1974). In <em>Giordano, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized the relevance of the attenuation doctrine to the exclusionary provision of the Federal Act by citing a portion of S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. at 96, 106 (1968) which specifically noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cSection 2515 of the new chapter imposes an evidentiary sanction to compel compliance with the other prohibitions of the chapter. ... The provision must, of course, be read in light of section 2518(10)(a) discussed below, which defines the class entitled to make a motion to suppress. It largely reflects existing law. It applies to suppress evidence directly (<em>Nardone v. United States, </em>302 U.S. 379, 58 S.Ct. 275, 82 L.Ed. 314 (1937)) or indirectly obtained in violation of the chapter. <em>(Nardone v.

Nor generally to press the scope of the suppression role beyond present search and seizure law. ... </em>But it does apply across the board in both Federal and State proceeding^].... And it is not limited to criminal proceedings. Such a suppression rule is necessary and proper to protect privacy. ... The provision thus forms an integral part of the system of limitations designed to protect privacy. Along with the criminal and civil remedies, it should serve to guarantee that the standards of the new chapter will sharply curtail the unlawful interception of wire and oral communications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>Giordano, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 529-30, n. 17, 94 S.Ct. at 1833, n. 17, 40 L.Ed.2d at 360-61, n. 17 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has adopted the procedure of having a \u201ctaint hearing\u201d regarding evidence resulting from a wiretap violation wherein the claimant has the initial burden of establishing a taint and the government may demonstrate that the taint was purged. <em>See United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 906 (4th Cir.1990). Thus, not all evidence obtained following an unlawful wiretap must be suppressed under the federal statutory exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Therefore, we find that the scope and meaning of the words \u201cno evidence derived therefrom\u201d as used in the statutory exclusionary rule of the Maryland Wiretapping Act are best analyzed under the attenuation doctrine arising out of cases concerning unlawful searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Ferguson v.

Under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine, evidence tainted by Fourth Amendment violations may not be used directly or indirectly against the accused. <em>See Nardone, </em>308 U.S. at 341, 60 S.Ct. at 268, 84 L.Ed. at 312. However, there must be a \u201ccause-and-effect\u201d relationship or nexus between the \u201cpoisonous tree and its alleged fruit,\u201d so as to prevent \u201can indiscriminate lapse into the logical flaw of <em>post hoc; ergo, propter hoc </em>(after this; therefore, because of this).\u201d <em>State v. Klingenstein, </em>92 Md.App. 325, 360, 608 A.2d 792, 810 (1992), <em>cert. granted, </em>328 Md. 462, 615 A.2d 262 (1992), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>330 Md. 402, 624 A.2d 532 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 918, 114 S.Ct. 312, 126 L.Ed.2d 259 (1993)(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In balancing the protections of the Fourth Amendment with the need for effective law enforcement, the Supreme Court has recognized three methods of purging the taint of the original unlawful conduct in cases where the exclusionary rule applies. First, evidence obtained after initial unlawful governmental activity will be purged of its taint if it was inevitable that the police would have discovered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>evidence. <em>See Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377, 387 (1984). Second, the taint will be purged upon a showing that the evidence was derived from an independent source. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 239-242, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1938-1940, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1164-1166 (1967). The third exception, and the one relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>will allow the use of evidence where it can be shown that the so-called poison of the unlawful governmental conduct is so attenuated from the evidence as to purge any taint resulting from said conduct. <em>See Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), the Supreme Court analyzed the application of the attenuation doctrine \u201cat the crossroads of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 95 S.Ct. at 2256, 45 L.Ed.2d at 420. We adopted the test for attenuation, as set forth in <em>Brown, </em>in <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>301 Md. at 549, 483 A.2d at 1258 (considering the application of the attenuation doctrine to extrajudicial and in-court identification testimony given by the victim of a robbery, where the accused was arrested without probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court developed a three factor test for analyzing whether statements given in custody after the accused waives his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), must be excluded as fruits of an unlawful arrest where the accused was arrested without probable cause. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 591-92, 95 S.Ct. at 2256, 45 L.Ed.2d at 420. In discussing the purpose of the exclusionary rule the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">The rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it. <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960). But despite its broad deterrent purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>States v.

The Court found that although receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings alone is not <em>per se </em>dispositive of the issue of attenuation, it is an important factor in assessing the voluntariness of a confession. <em>See id. </em>at 603, 95 S.Ct. at 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427. The Court held that an analysis of attenuation also requires consideration of the following factors: 1) the proximity between the actual illegality and the evidence sought to be suppressed; 2) the presence of intervening factors; and 3) the flagrancy of the governmental misconduct involved in the case. <em>See id. </em>at 603-604, 95 S.Ct. at 2261-2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Brown, </em>two police officers who had been investigating a recent murder, arrested the defendant without probable cause for the purpose of questioning him about the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 95 S.Ct. at 2256, 45 L.Ed.2d at 420. To accomplish this task, the police broke into the defendant\u2019s apartment, searched it, then waited for the defendant to return to his apartment where the officers held him at gunpoint and placed him under arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 95 S.Ct. at 2256-2257, 45 L.Ed.2d at 421. Following his arrest, the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave two inculpatory statements to the police. <em>Id. </em>at 594-96, 95 S.Ct. at 2257-2258, 45 L.Ed.2d at 421-422. In holding that the defendant\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights alone was insufficient, as an intervening factor, to purge the taint of the defendant\u2019s illegal arrest, the Court emphasized the purposefulness of the official misconduct involved by explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The impropriety of the arrest was obvious; awareness of that fact was virtually conceded by the two detectives when they repeatedly acknowledged, in their testimony, that the purpose of their action was \u2018for investigation\u2019 or for \u2018questioning.\u2019 The arrest, both in design and in execution, was investigatory. The detectives embarked upon this expedition for evidence in the hope that something might turn up. The manner in which Brown\u2019s arrest was effected gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>appearance of having been calculated to cause surprise, fright, and confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 605, 95 S.Ct. at 2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The United States Supreme Court further refined its analysis of the attenuation doctrine set forth in <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>to include an exploration of voluntariness. <em>See United States v. Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. 268, 276-77, 98 S.Ct. 1054, 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d 268, 277 (1978). The case involved a police officer\u2019s unauthorized search of a cash register in a local flower shop and discovery of an envelope containing evidence relating to the gambling activities of Ceccolini. The police officer immediately questioned the clerk at the flower shop concerning the identity of the owner of the envelope without revealing to the clerk what it contained. Four months later the FBI interviewed the flower shop clerk who related what had occurred with the police officer. Thereafter, the Government introduced testimony of the flower shop clerk, who volunteered to testify, at a perjury trial of Ceccolini. Ceccolini argued that the testimony of the clerk should have been suppressed as \u201cfruit\u201d of the police officer\u2019s unlawful search of the register at the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The trial court suppressed the testimony of the flower shop clerk which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court reversed, citing <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>in stating, \u201c[e]ven in situations where the exclusionary rule is plainly applicable, we have declined to adopt a \u201cper se or \u2018but for\u2019 rule\u201d that would make inadmissible any evidence, whether tangible or live-witness testimony, which somehow came to light through a chain of causation\u201d originating with constitutionally violative conduct. <em>Ceccolini, </em>485 U.S. at 276, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277. In <em>Ceccolini, </em>the court eloquently defined the role that \u201clogical\u201d causation has to the defining question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">This, of course, makes it perfectly clear, if indeed ever there was any doubt about the matter, that the question of causal connection in this setting, as in so many other questions with which the law concerns itself, is not to be determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>solely through the sort of analysis which would be applicable in the physical sciences. The issue cannot be decided on the basis of causation in the logical sense alone, but necessarily includes other elements as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 98 S.Ct. at 1059, 55 L.Ed.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Court identified the voluntary aspect of a witness\u2019s testimony as a break in the chain of taint emanating from the unlawful conduct because an individual has the \u201cattributes of will, perception, memory and volition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>324 F.2d 879, 881 (D.C.Cir.1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 1632, 12 L.Ed.2d 498 (1964))(footnotes omitted). The significance of a volitional act of a human being under the exclusionary rule cannot be underestimated because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">[t]he proffer of a living witness is not to be mechanically equated with the proffer of inanimate evidentiary objects illegally seized. The fact that the name of a potential witness is disclosed to police is of no evidentiary significance, per se, because the living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and volition interact to determine what testimony he will give. The uniqueness of this human process distinguishes the evidentiary character of a witness from the relative immutability of inanimate evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 277, 98 S.Ct. at 1060-1061, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277 (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>324 F.2d at 881-882).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In assessing the voluntariness of the witness\u2019s conduct under the attenuation doctrine of the exclusionary rule, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">Witnesses are not like guns or documents which remain hidden from view until one turns over a sofa or opens a filing cabinet. Witnesses can, and often do, come forward and offer evidence entirely of their own volition. And evaluated properly, the degree of free will necessary to dissipate the taint will very likely be found more often in the case of live-witness testimony than other kinds of evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 276-277, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277. Thus, the voluntariness of a person\u2019s actions in providing evidence or testimony should be considered as an intervening factor under the attenuation doctrine. <em>See id. </em>at 278-279, 98 S.Ct. at 1061, 55 L.Ed.2d at 278. This is true even if a putative defendant is involved because exclusion of testimony is a perpetual disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Another factor which not only is relevant in determining the usefulness of the exclusionary rule in a particular context, but also seems to us to differentiate the testimony of all live witnesses \u2014 even putative defendants \u2014 from the exclusion of the typical documentary evidence, is that such exclusion would perpetually disable a witness from testifying about relevant and material facts, regardless of how unrelated such testimony might be to the purpose of the originally illegal search or the evidence discovered thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 277, 98 S.Ct. at 1061, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277-78. We follow the lead of the numerous federal circuits and states that have applied <em>Ceccolini. See Peavy v.

Briggs, </em>709 P.2d 911, 917 (Colo.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The first evidence we must consider is that provided by Jona Miles, who led the police to the discovery of the murder weapon and its accessories in the Choptank River, to appellant\u2019s clothing and to appellant\u2019s whereabouts on the day of his arrest. When Jona Miles was arrested on April 22, 1997, the police gave Jona her <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and she agreed to give a statement to the police. An individual may validly waive his or her Fifth Amendment rights by making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>incriminating statements subsequent to receiving the warnings required by <em>Miranda. See United States v. Carson, </em>793 F.2d 1141, 1150 (10th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 914, 107 S.Ct. 315, 93 L.Ed.2d 289 (1986). While an individual\u2019s waiver of <em>Miranda </em>warnings taken alone would be insufficient to purge the taint of the original unlawful conduct under a Fourth Amendment analysis, Jona Miles\u2019s conduct with regard to her actions following her statement to the police, manifesting those uniquely human attributes of perception, memory and volition, were \u201csufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\u201d associated with the intercepted phone call. <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 602, 95 S.Ct. at 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d at 426 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416-417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 454)(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Following her statement to the police, Jona Miles took the police to the Choptank River to show them where she had disposed of the murder weapon and its accessories, as well as to a dumpster located off of Route 404 near the Choptank River in Denton, Maryland where she had disposed of appellant\u2019s clothing. She also provided the police with information concerning appellant\u2019s whereabouts to assist them in effectuating the arrest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Upon searching the dumpster, the police found that it had been emptied. However, a team of divers was able to recover the weapon and ammunition from the river. The murder weapon, a .22 caliber gun, was admitted in evidence at trial as State\u2019s Exhibit 11, and the box of ammuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tion found with it in the river was admitted as State\u2019s Exhibit 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The police did not coerce Jona Miles in any way, nor did they offer her any leniency in order to induce her statement or compel her to lead them to evidence. Based on our review of the excerpts of Jona Miles\u2019s statement contained in the record,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the police never confronted Jona Miles with the fact that they possessed a tape of the cellular phone conversation between her husband and her. The evidence obtained as a result of Jona Miles\u2019s voluntary conduct need not be suppressed even though the unlawful police conduct in listening to the tape of the cellular phone conversation \u201cwas one step in a series of events\u201d leading up to Jona Miles\u2019s statement and production of evidence. <em>Hooton, </em>662 F.2d at 632 (citing <em>United States v. Leonardi, </em>623 F.2d 746, 752 (2nd Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>447 U.S. 928, 100 S.Ct. 3027, 65 L.Ed.2d 1123 (1980 )). Any taint emanating from the original unlawful disclosure of Jona Miles\u2019s voice to the police in the taped cellular phone conversation in violation of the Maryland Wiretapping Act dissipates at the point where she took the Maryland State Police on a guided tour of the locations where she had disposed of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We also must consider the temporal relationship of Jona Miles\u2019s assistance to the police to the unlawful disclosure of the cellular phone conversation under the Maryland Wiretapping Act. The first factor of the <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>test of attenuation examines the proximity between the time of the initial illegality and the ascertainment of the evidence that a defendant is seeking to suppress. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603-604, 95 S.Ct. at 2261-2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427. The Supreme Court has not set forth \u201cany mathematically precise test for determining at what point the taint has been purged by the lapse of time.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 550, 483 A.2d at 1259. Intervening factors or acts following the original unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ful conduct, however, should be considered in assessing attenuation. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603-604, 95 S.Ct. at 2261-2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427. In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant\u2019s confession was suppressed based in part on the fact that the confession took place less than two hours after the \u201cprimary illegality\u201d of defendant\u2019s unlawful arrest, with no intervening circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. at 2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 428. The original illegality complained of in the instant case took place on April 15, 1997, when James Towers tape recorded the cellular phone conversation between Jona and Jody Miles and turned it over to the police. Both Jona and Jody Miles were not arrested until seven days later. In the interim, and without knowledge that her conversation with appellant had been recorded by a private citizen, Jona Miles disposed of the clothing that appellant purchased with the victim\u2019s credit card at Structure in a dumpster off of Route 404 near Denton, Maryland, and threw the .22 caliber gun, holster, and ammunition into the Choptank River. Jona Miles engaged in two volitional acts with regard to this evidence, first in throwing them away and second in leading the police to the locations wherein she had disposed of them. In both instances, Jona Miles\u2019s conduct weighs of equal significance, as she made conscious choices on both occasions to do what she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Because Jona Miles disposed of the evidence subsequent to the cellular phone conversation and not only disclosed the location of the gun in her statement to the police, but physically took the police to the Choptank River, her conduct with regard to the gun and its accessories was completely free and independent from the information the police may have learned from the taped cellular phone conversation. The dissent concludes that Jona Miles\u2019s statement and assistance to the police was as a result of being confronted with evidence obtained by the police from the illegally intercepted phone conversation. The record, however, does not reflect any disclosure by the police of the fact that they possessed the taped cellular phone conversation. Furthermore, the excerpts in the record of the taped phone conversation contain no references <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>to the Structure store at the Dover Mall, the murder weapon or the Choptank River, all of which were facts that came to be known to the police through their independent investigation. Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in admitting the murder weapon and its accessories to which Jona Miles led the police, as Jona Miles\u2019s voluntary actions purged the taint from the original unlawful disclosure of the taped cellular phone conversation by the police to obtain the initial search warrant under Section 10-405 of the Maryland Wiretapping Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We now consider the admission in evidence at trial of appellant\u2019s black jeans and tan dress pants. Following her arrest, Jona Miles signed a Caroline County Sheriff\u2019s Department consent to search and seize form authorizing the police to conduct a second search of her trailer. During this second search, Corporal Lee Ann Fisher of the Maryland State Police found and seized one pair of black men\u2019s jeans in the rear bathroom clothes hamper and one pair of tan dress pants from Structure on the front porch. These items were admitted jointly at trial as State\u2019s Exhibit 21. Appellant argues that the two pairs of pants should have been suppressed at trial as derivative evidence stemming from the Maryland State Police\u2019s unauthorized use of the taped cellular phone conversation. We disagree. An individual may voluntarily waive his or her Fourth Amendment rights, through \u201can intervening act free of police exploitation of the primary illegality\u201d which is \u201csufficiently distinguishable from the primary illegality to purge the evidence of the primary taint.\u201d <em>See Carson, </em>793 F.2d at 1147-48. The intervening factor of an individual\u2019s voluntariness under Fourth Amendment analysis applies equally to purging the taint associated with the taped cellular phone conversation in the case at bar. Jona Miles\u2019s voluntariness must be considered in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gamble v. State, </em>318 Md. 120, 125, 567 A.2d 95, 98 (1989)(citing <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2048, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 863 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>At the time Jona Miles signed the consent to search and seize form, she knew that she could be charged with criminal conduct for concealing and destroying evidence on behalf of her husband. However, she chose to assist the police, without any promise of leniency, in the investigation. Furthermore, a person in custody may still give valid consent to a search. <em>See Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 402, 545 A.2d 1281, 1290 (1988)(citing <em>United States v. Watson, </em>423 U.S. 411, 424, 96 S.Ct 820, 828, 46 L.Ed.2d 598, 609 (1976)). Thus, the fact that Jona Miles was under arrest at the time she gave her statement to police and signed the consent to search form does not negate the voluntary nature of her actions. Considering the totality of the circumstances, Jona Miles waived her Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights and purged the taint of the original illegality of the taped cellular phone conversation by volunteering information to the police and signing a consent form authorizing the police to return to her trailer and conduct further investigation and seizure of evidence. Thus, the trial judge did not err in allowing the admissibility in evidence of the black jeans and tan Structure dress pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We now consider appellant\u2019s arrest and statement to police. Appellant argues that the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence at trial his post-arrest confession, maps he drew of areas where he disposed of evidence and property belonging to the victim, and his cellular telephone, which had been seized pursuant to a post-arrest police inventory of the gray 1984 Chevrolet Cavalier appellant had been driving at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In the days following Edward Atkinson\u2019s murder, the Maryland State Police and Atkinson\u2019s family and friends gathered evidence about the murderer and his whereabouts. By April 4, 1997, the victim\u2019s brother, Wayne Atkinson, had provided the police with information concerning all of the victim\u2019s credit card accounts, and had determined that the credit card had been used at the Tru Blu gas station in Harrington, Delaware after his brother\u2019s disappearance. Wayne Atkinson went to the Tru Blu and questioned one of the employees who gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>him a description of the card user and the card user\u2019s car. The physical description matched that of appellant. On April 4, 1997, following the discovery of Edward Atkinson\u2019s body, Wayne Atkinson, his friend, Sean Mooney, and Sergeant Bruce Dana and Corporal Cynthia Dougherty of the Maryland State Police all witnessed a gray Chevy Cavalier with Delaware temporary tags, driven by a white male with short dark hair in his twenties talking on a \u201cbag style\u201d cellular telephone in the area of the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Subsequent investigation confirmed the information learned by the police in the first few days of the investigation. The Atkinson family turned over all credit card information to the police, who conducted investigations into the purchases made with the victim\u2019s credit cards. Those investigations included interrogation of the manager and several employees of the Tru Blu, the manager of Structure at the Dover Mall who sold clothing to appellant, the clerk at J.C. Penney\u2019s in the Dover Mall who sold appellant a diamond ring, and a waitress and patrons at Shucker\u2019s Pier 13 Restaurant in Dover where appellant purchased food with the victim\u2019s credit card. All of the merchants provided the police with copies of the receipts from the purchases made by appellant, as well as matching physical descriptions of the appellant. Based on this information, and on detailed assistance from one of the patrons from Shucker\u2019s, the police produced a composite sketch of appellant that was circulated by the local media. All of this information was known to the police <em>before </em>James Towers taped the cellular phone conversation between Jo\u00f1a and Jody Miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Once appellant had been arrested and brought to the Caroline County Sheriffs Department, Corporal William V. Benton of the Maryland State Police interviewed him. Before questioning commenced, Corporal Benton presented appellant with the Maryland State Police Advice of <em>Miranda </em>Rights Form. The <em>Miranda </em>warnings were read to appellant and he acknowledged that he understood his rights prior to signing and dating the form. Corporal Benton asked appellant general questions for a few minutes, and then asked him if he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Edward Atkinson. When appellant denied knowing Atkinson, the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Benton: Jody, would it surprise you if I told you there was a picture of you at the Wal-Mart in Cambridge? WalMart has a camera system inside. There\u2019s an ATM inside. We\u2019ve got a guy that was killed on April the 2nd, 1997. His name was Edward Atkinson. Okay? His brother was riding on that road on, I believe, it was April the 4th and saw a little silver car with Delaware temporary tags with a white male, with brown hair and talking on a cell phone riding on Old Bradley Road. He tried to get the police to stop that car at that time. For some reason, they were taking down the crime scene and they did not. We have reason to believe that was your car that was on Old Bradley Road on that particular day. Okay, it\u2019s the 3rd or 4th of April. And to get back to my point, Wal-Mart in Cambridge has a camera and they have an ATM in the Wal-Mart. Our victim\u2019s credit cards were attempted on April the 2nd, 6:59 and 7:00. And the photo we have at the Wal Mart looks an awful lot like you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Miles: I don\u2019t believe that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">Benton: Well, whether you believe it or not, it\u2019s the truth. Also, at J.C. Penne/s store in Dover, the jewelry section. There was a ring purchased with our victim\u2019s credit card. There\u2019s a photo there that looks an awful lot like you. There\u2019s bubbles everywhere in that ceiling and they have a ton of cameras. Coming in you kept your back to it a little bit, but you couldn\u2019t keep it all the way to it. You walked up to the \u2014 when you\u2019re walking down the aisle. It shows a perfect photo. The Harrington Tru Blu, you had a pair of whitish colored slacks, black cowboy boots, and white shirt that\u2019s buttoned up. They\u2019ve seen you in there. They\u2019ve seen you in there using the victim\u2019s credit card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Miles: I have a white shirt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">Benton: I\u2019m not done. The Structure store in Dover Mall. There\u2019s a ton of Structure clothing that was purchased with our victim\u2019s credit card. The description they give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>fits that of you. I\u2019m not here to bull crap you around, I\u2019m being honest with you. We\u2019ve done a search warrant on your house today. We\u2019ve recovered Structure pants, Structure jeans, Structure shirt that was hidden in Larry\u2019s closet. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Miles: You\u2019re going to find Structure clothes in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">Benton: I\u2019m not going to find this brand new Structure shirt that was hid in Larry\u2019s closet. We\u2019ve recovered a gun from right down here in the river, a little 22 with a long barrel on it. Okay? We\u2019ve recovered clothes from a dumpster right down on 404.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> So, we\u2019re not in here playing games. You\u2019re a smart person; I\u2019m a smart person. But, I\u2019m here to tell you there\u2019s a reason why everything happens. Okay? What I\u2019m here to ask you is for you to tell us why things happen. I know you killed Edward Joseph Atkinson. Okay, I\u2019m not going to sit here and play dumb with you and let you play dumb with me. We\u2019re adult men, it\u2019s time to find out why. I\u2019m not interested in sending you to prison for the rest of your life but I want to know why you killed this man. He\u2019s a pillar in the community, he was active with Community Players and now he\u2019s dead. Jody, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person. Yeah, you\u2019ve been arrested. I know that and you know that. But things happen for a reason. Was somebody pushing you to kill this man?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Shortly thereafter, appellant gave the following account of the events of April 2,1997:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">Miles: I don\u2019t know what the deal was. It don\u2019t necessary have to be money, it could be drugs, it could be a lot of things. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that part of it. I just know that I was supposed to meet the man. You know, like you said. There was no struggle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Benton: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">Miles: The man showed up and there he was. When I was asking him for the stuff, all I said was, you know, I need the package. That\u2019s all he told me. And then he tried to tell me he didn\u2019t have it, he didn\u2019t have none of it and anything like this and when he went to reach in his jacket, I was standing right behind him. And he went to reach in his jacket, I didn\u2019t know what he was getting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">Benton: So, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">Miles: That\u2019s when it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Benton: That\u2019s when what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">Miles: That\u2019s when he got shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Benton: So, you shot him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Miles: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">Appellant subsequently admitted to attempting to use the victim\u2019s credit cards at the ATM in Wal Mart, to purchase gas at the Tru Blu, clothing at Structure in the Dover Mall, a diamond ring for Jona Miles at J.C. Penney\u2019s in the Dover Mall, and food at Shucker\u2019s Pier 13 Restaurant in Dover, Delaware. After he finished his statement, appellant volunteered to draw maps for the police of the location where he stated he had thrown away the victim\u2019s wallets and briefcases.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Appellant demonstrated a willingness to provide information and to locate physical evidence related to the crime through his voluntary statement to the police. <em>See Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 276-77, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277. He received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings in both written and oral form prior to signing a statement waiving his Fifth Amendment rights, and confirmed in his taped confession that he understood his rights and agreed to give a statement to the police. The police never showed any of the illegally-seized evidence gathered prior to Jona Miles\u2019s arrest in questioning appellant. <em>See United States v. McKinnon, </em>92 F.3d at 248. He confessed to the murder of Edward Atkinson shortly after the interview commenced. Appellant could have stopped the questioning at any point during the interview, but he went so far as to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>maps for the police of the locations of evidence related to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">With regard to the second-prong of the <em>Ceccolini Brown </em>test, the police never mentioned the intercepted cellular phone conversation to induce appellant\u2019s statement. The police never disclosed in questioning appellant the contents of the cellular phone conversation, nor the fact that Jona Miles had given them a statement. The dissent excerpts a portion of the interrogation where Corporal Benton informed appellant that the police had seized a new Structure shirt and other clothing purchased at the Structure store with the victim\u2019s credit cards. While the police had, in fact, seized this evidence, they did not show it to appellant just as the police officer in <em>Ceccolini </em>did not show the florist clerk the envelope with money and gambling slips and never made any reference to its contents. Although the seizure of the shirt itself had been accomplished through executing the search warrant based in part on the information contained in the taped cellular phone conversation, the police already possessed copies of receipts from appellant\u2019s purchases from their investigation at the Structure store. One of the Structure receipts, entered in evidence at trial as State\u2019s Exhibit 16-C, lists all of the items purchased by appellant with the victim\u2019s credit card, including a shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The dissent asserts that our analysis \u201cseems to flirt with either independent source or inevitable discovery analysis.\u201d Diss. Op. at 576, n. 2. The independent source doctrine has been applied in case law generally to refer to all evidence acquired in a lawful fashion, untainted by any illegal evidence-gathering activity of the state. <em>See Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 818-14, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3390, 82 L.Ed.2d 599, 614 (1984). This refers to evidence which is different from the evidence originally obtained by unlawful means. <em>Id. </em>The doctrine\u2019s original application in <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920), however, referred to situations where the evidence acquired through untainted means is identical to that which had been obtained through unlawful evidence gathering. <em>See id. </em>at 391-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>92, 40 S.Ct. at 182-83, 64 L.Ed. at 321. Therein Justice Holmes explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all. Of course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 392, 40 S.Ct. at 183, 64 L.Ed. at 321. Thus, the independent source doctrine, similar in effect to the attenuation doctrine, seeks to balance the need to deter unlawful conduct of law enforcement with the public interest in justice by \u201cputting police in the same, not a <em>worse, </em>position that they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred.\u201d <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. at 443, 104 S.Ct. at 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d at 387(emphasis in original). This is accomplished \u201cby allowing the introduction of evidence discovered initially during an unlawful search if the evidence is discovered <em>later </em>through a source that is untainted by the initial illegality.\u201d <em>United States v. May, </em>214 F.3d 900, 906 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In the case before us, we are not concerned with after-acquired untainted evidence which would inspire invocation of the independent source doctrine. Instead, we find it significant that the facts used by the police in questioning appellant were all facts learned by the police through lawful investigative means <em>prior </em>to receiving the tape of the cellular phone conversation from Mr. Towers. The focus of the inquiry concerning the extent of the taint running from the unlawfully intercepted cellular phone conversation should rest with the use which was made of it as opposed to a wide-sweeping prohibition concerning the facts articulated therein. <em>See United States v. Grosenheider, </em>200 F.3d 321, 329-30 (5th Cir.2000)(explaining that the fact that the investigator had effectively seized defendant\u2019s harddrive by maintaining possession of a computer containing evidence of the defendant\u2019s use of child pornography while a warrant for a search of the hard-drive was being obtained did not require exclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>evidence obtained pursuant to a validly authorized and executed search warrant because the investigator did not make any use of the computer prior to obtaining a warrant for the search).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Appellant\u2019s decision to give a statement to the police was voluntary; in fact, it was the product of a volitional act rather than a product of exploitation and manipulation of the unlawful evidence gained from the cellular phone conversation. <em>See Carson, </em>793 F.2d at 1147-1148. The balancing approach to attenuation which has evolved from <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>requires consideration of a totality of the circumstances, including the demeanor of the individual throughout the interrogation, the extent of the individual\u2019s cooperation with the police, and personal circumstances unique to the age, knowledge and experience of the individual. <em>See United States v. Wellins, </em>654 F.2d 550, 555 (9th Cir.1981). At the time appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave his confession, he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This was not a situation involving a \u201ccaged rabbit\u201d who manifested fear and anxiety over his predicament. On the contrary, throughout his confession, appellant remained relaxed and cooperative and never indicated that he wished to stop talking or take a break.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Supreme Court has recognized that, \u201cIn view of the deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule, consideration of official motives may play some part in determining whether application of the exclusionary rule is appropriate <em>after </em>a statutory or constitutional violation has been established.\u201d <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 135-136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1722-1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168, 176-77 (1978)(interpreting the federal wiretapping statute)(emphasis in original). This concept is embodied in the third factor of the <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>test, which requires an examination of the flagrancy of the police misconduct in obtaining evidence from Jo\u00f1a and Jody Miles. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604, 95 S.Ct. at 2262, 45 L.Ed.2d at 427; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>585 F.2d 1234, 1242 (5th Cir.1978)(applying <em>Brown </em>and <em>Ceccolini </em>in holding that the lower court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress where the record indicated that defendant know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a confession and \u201cthe government\u2019s conduct was not flagrant or reprehensible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Maryland State Police never authorized or requested that James Towers record appellant\u2019s cellular phone conversation, nor did the police assist Mr. Towers in the interception.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s analysis of attenuation verges on a traditional tort analysis of proximate cause which while tempting, is inappropriate to an assessment of attenuation of the taint of unlawful police conduct under Fourth and Fifth Amendment jurisprudence. <em>See Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 276, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Although Section 10-405 mandates the exclusion of the tape and its contents from evidence, it would completely contravene the statutory goal to apply a <em>per se </em>exclusion to all evidence obtained thereafter as a result of pursuing an investigation and from the voluntary conduct of witnesses or suspects who provide additional evidence. <em>See United States v. Salgado, </em>807 F.2d 603, 607 (7th Cir.1986)(\u201cThe exclusionary rule is a sanction, and sanctions are supposed to be proportioned to the wrongdoing that they punish.\u201d). Here, the police did exactly what anyone would have expected them to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The conduct of the Maryland State Police in listening to the tape of the cellular phone conversation provided to them by James Towers is completely distinguishable from the flagrant and purposeful misconduct of the police officers in <em>Brown </em>who arrested someone for the sole purpose of engaging in a factual fishing expedition to link that person to an ongoing murder investigation. <em>See Brownn, </em>422 U.S. at 592, 95 S.Ct. at 2256, 45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 420. It cannot be said that James Towers, the private citizen who intercepted appellant\u2019s cellular phone conversation, \u201cacted as an instrument or agent of the state.\u201d <em>State v. Abdouch, </em>230 Neb. 929, 434 N.W.2d 317, 323 (1989) (quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2049, 29 L.Ed.2d 564, 595 (1971)). \u201cThe [exclusionary] rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is to deter \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way-by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d <em>Elkins, </em>364 U.S. at 217, 80 S.Ct. at 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d at 1677. At the hearing on appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress, the trial court aptly stated, \u201cthe horrifying thing about the whole situation, really, is that if the police had done nothing, having this information, I cannot imagine what would have been thought by the public.\u201d The information contained in the cellular phone conversation led the police to believe that appellant and his wife were conspiring to get rid of the evidence. To construe the Wiretapping Act to require us to hold under the unique facts and circumstances of this case that the police should have refrained from listening to the tape provided by Mr. Towers and sat idly by while appellant and his wife eliminated evidence of the crime would produce a result which is \u201cunreasonable, illogical, inconsistent with common sense, and absurd.\u201d <em>Edgewater Liquors, Inc. v. Liston, </em>349 Md. 803, 811, 709 A.2d 1301, 1304 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">While \u201cthe <em>Brown </em>test does not require that each of the factors set forth be resolved in favor of the Government\u201d in order to render evidence admissible under the attenuation doctrine, we find that considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, the balance falls in favor of the State. <em>See United States v. Wellins, </em>654 F.2d at 554. We therefore conclude that the trial judge properly drew the line between the taint of the original illegality of the unlawfully intercepted cellular phone conversation by a private citizen and found attenuation from the taint commencing with Jona Miles\u2019s voluntary statement and assistance to the police, and appellant\u2019s voluntary confession to the murder of Edward Atkinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>IV. RULE 4-326</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">At approximately 4:00 p.m. on March 18, 1998, the jury began deliberations in the sentencing phase of the trial. During the course of the deliberations, the jury sent out three notes. The clerk received the first note at 4:25 p.m. and the second note at 7:48 p.m., requesting beverages and inquiring as to dinner arrangements. The third note, received at 11:20 p.m., contained the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">Section V Para. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">If we are not unanimous, do we enter <em>no </em>automatically or do we need to be unanimous that no <em>is </em>the answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">Section VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">How can we answer this question if we were not unanimous on the <em>no </em>vote.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The trial court informed counsel of receipt of the note and summarized the contents of the note for counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">[T]he thrust of the communication is that the jury is uncertain as to whether they must be unanimous with respect to part 5 \u2014 or Section V, paragraph 2, which is the one very clearly \u2014 because they do have to be unanimous \u2014 I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about in Part 2 but be that as it may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">All right. I think that what we should do is to read them again the instructions with respect to parts \u2014 or to Sections V and VI, that seems, to me, [to] make good sense. I see no reason to backtrack and go over things. I think that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>can safely assume \u2014 I think we should assume that they have winded their way through I through IV in some fashion that is consistent with the instruction. And where they are hung up is their desire to be clarified on whether or not they must reach a conclusion on No. 5. All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apt\">Neither the State nor defense counsel read the note or requested to inspect the note at that time. After healing no objections to his proposed re-instruction of the jury, the trial court reviewed the instructions for Sections V and VI, and advised the jury \u201cyour determination in Section V must be unanimous. Until all 12 of you agree on whether the answer is yes or no, do not go to Section VI.\u201d The jury returned to finish deliberations, and returned a sentence of death at approximately 1:42 a.m. on March 19,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Appellant filed a Motion for New Sentencing And / Or Imposition of a Life Sentence In Lieu of Death Sentence on March 26, 1998 postulating that Maryland Rule 4-326(c) requires the trial judge to repeat verbatim the contents of the jury note for the record. The failure to do so, according to appellant, deprived him of the ability to propose the following: 1) Declare a mistrial based on jury deadlock after reasonable deliberation; 2) Request that the jury be instructed to move on to Section VI to determine whether a sentence of life with or without parole should be imposed; or 3) Request a modified Allen Charge, as approved by <em>Booth v. State, </em>327 Md. 142, 159, 608 A.2d 162, 170 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 988, 113 S.Ct. 500, 121 L.Ed.2d 437 (1992), to reflect that the jurors were unable to agree on Section V. On July 7, 2000, the trial court denied the motion in a written order that stated, \u201cBeyond any doubt, the Court did not follow the plain direction of Rule 4-316(c), as explicated in <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 551 A.2d 156 in that one of the communications was not read <em>verbatim </em>into the record.\u201d (emphasis in the original).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In denying the motion, the trial court concluded that the summary provided on the record by the trial court did not differ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>from the substance of the note such that \u201cthe oversight was purely technical in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The relevant provision, Maryland Rule 4-326(c)(2000 Supp.) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">The court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action before responding to the communication. All such communications between the court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Appellant argues that Rule 4 \u2014 326(c) requires complete, verbatim communication to counsel of the contents of any communication between the jury and the court. The State contends that defense counsel\u2019s failure to request to inspect the jury note prior to the trial judge\u2019s re-instruction of the jury bars consideration of this issue on appeal. In the alternative, the State asserts that the trial judge\u2019s failure to disclose the contents of the jury note in its entirety is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">With respect to preservation of the issue, it is clear that Maryland Rule 8-131 governs the scope of review available in this Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Review is typically limited to questions raised in and decided by the lower court. <em>See Young v. State, </em>220 Md. 95, 99, 151 A.2d 140, 143 (1959), <em>cert. denied </em>363 U.S. 853, 80 S.Ct. 1634, 4 L.Ed.2d 1735 (1960). We have exercised our discretion in some cases including some death penalty cases, to determine all questions briefed and argued by the appellant before this Court even when not tried and decided by the lower court. <em>See Bartholomey v. State, </em>260 Md. 504, 513, 273 A.2d 164, 169 (1971), <em>modified, </em>408 U.S. 938, 92 S.Ct. 2870, 33 L.Ed.2d 759 (1972), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>409 U.S. 901, 93 S.Ct. 180, 34 L.Ed.2d 162 (1972). Although defense counsel did not object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to the summarization of the jury note at the time the note was received, the issue of the trial judge\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 4-326(c) was raised by counsel and decided by the trial court as part of appellant\u2019s post-trial motion and was briefed and argued in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">With respect to the reading of a communication to the jury, this Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">The rules governing communications between the judge and the jury are basic and relatively simple to adhere to in practice. If a judge receives a communication from the jury or wishes to communicate with the jury, he or she is required to notify the parties. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-326(c). The communication with the jury shall be made in open court on the record or shall be made in writing and the writing shall become part of the record. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-326(e). Putting aside certain exceptions not relevant here, the defendant has a recognized right to be present during communications between the judge and the jury during his trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-231 (b); <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 224-25, 638 A.2d 754, 759 (1994); <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 211, 438 A.2d 1301, 1306 (1981)(\u201ca criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of his trial is a common law right [and] is to some extent protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\u201d). These rules are not abstract guides. They are mandatory and must be strictly followed. <em>See Taylor v. State, </em>352 Md. 338, 344, 722 A.2d 65, 68 (1998); <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 222, 638 A.2d at 758.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYu\"><em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 322, 765 A.2d 97, 122-23 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Here the trial court did not give \u201cfull\u201d notification of the contents of the note, because the trial court did not read the note verbatim but merely provided a summary of its contents prior to his discussion with counsel. Reading of the jury note in open court is not the only method of complying with Maryland Rule 4-326(c), as the rule may also be satisfied by filing written communications from the jury to the court in the case file for the action. The filing of the written communication with the action allows the parties to inspect the commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>nication for themselves if they so desire. A failure to provide an opportunity for inspection in order to develop an appropriate response may provide the basis for an error. <em>See Smith v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 624, 505 A.2d 564, 574, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986). In <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 551 A.2d 156 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 15, 575 A.2d 742 (1990), the Court of Special Appeals held that a trial judge must read the contents of any jury communication to the State and defense counsel before allowing the defendant to accept a majority verdict in a situation where the reading of the communication in its entirety would have resulted in his not accepting a majority verdict. <em>See Allen, </em>at 546, 551 A.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In the present case, the trial judge\u2019s failure to read the note, although not a violation <em>per se </em>of Rule 4-326(c), should be reviewed in determining whether the judge\u2019s summarization prejudiced the defendant. The circumstances surrounding the re-instruction of the jury indicate that appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s actions. Appellant was present when the trial court re-instructed the jury regarding Sections V and VI of the sentencing form in compliance with Md. Rule 4-231. <em>See Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 36, 139 A.2d 209, 214 (1958)(explaining that in Maryland \u201cthere can be no valid trial or judgment\u201d unless the defendant has been afforded the right to be present at all stages of the proceedings, including when being re-instructed by the trial court). However, we have stated that, \u201c[w]here the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will ordinarily be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>292 Md. at 219, 438 A.2d at 1310. In the matter now before this Court, neither party objected to the contents of the re-instruction of the jury either prior to re-instruction or prior to the jury rendering its sentencing verdict. Although appellant asserts that defense counsel would have responded differently had counsel been made aware of the actual contents of the jury note rather than the trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>summary, there is nothing on the face of the note which indicates that the jury was deadlocked or otherwise incapable of reaching a decision. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s response to the note indicates that the trial judge did not perceive any jury deadlock which would have warranted a mistrial, that the jurors had deliberated for an unreasonable amount of time, or that the jurors were unable to reach a unanimous decision with regard to Section V. Thus, appellant received the same response from the trial court as he would have received even if he had requested to review the contents of the jury note and presented his motion. Therefore, the appellant was not prejudiced by the failure of the trial court to read the note to counsel prior to re-instruction of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">V. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON UNANIMITY</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In both the original sentencing instructions and the re-instruction by the trial judge after receipt of the jury note at 11:20 p.m., the trial court informed the jury \u201cyour determination in Section V must be unanimous. Until all 12 of you agree on whether the answer is yes or no, do not go to Section VI.\u201d Although the parties approved the sentencing form prior to the trial judge\u2019s instruction of the jury, appellant now takes exception to the language requiring unanimity. Appellant argues that if a jury has deliberated for a significant period of time and requests guidance on how to proceed if the jury is not unanimous, the trial court should be required to instruct the jury that it may simply report its lack of unanimity to the court on the sentencing form.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In sentencing proceedings for criminal acts where the State seeks imposition of the death penalty, \u201c[t]he determination of the court or jury shall be in writing, and, if a jury, shall be unanimous and shall be signed by the foreman.\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(i)(1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). Section 413(k)(2) further provides, \u201c[i]f the jury, within a reasonable time, is not able to agree as to whether a sentence of death shall be imposed, the court may not impose a sentence of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Determination of the reasonableness of the length of deliberations rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Booth, </em>327 Md. at 154, 608 A.2d at 167. Thus, \u201c[t]he Maryland trial judge presiding over a capital sentencing proceeding before a jury basically retains the traditional role of determining whether the jury is hung.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court may consider the nature of the decision before the jury, and the length of the trial in determining whether the jury has exceeded a reasonable time for deliberations. <em>See Colvin-el v. State, </em>332 Md. 144, 181-82, 630 A.2d 725, 744 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>512 U.S. 1227, 114 S.Ct. 2725, 129 L.Ed.2d 849 (1994)(finding no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the jury and enter a sentence of life imprisonment after the jury sent note to the court requesting clarification on the need for unanimity on Sections IV and V of the verdict sheet following eleven and a half hours of deliberations over a two-day period). The jury in the instant case had deliberated approximately seven hours before submitting the note in question to the court at 11:20 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Appellant asserts that instructing the jury in the midst of deliberations concerning the consequences of a jury\u2019s failure to render a unanimous decision does not present the same dangers as providing a similar instruction prior to deliberation where the court may fear that a juror might refrain from making a decision for a little more than a reasonable amount of time so as to prevent imposition of the death penalty, or in the converse, the jury may act hastily in deliberations without giving due consideration to the evidence in rushing towards a death sentence. In <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. 563, 468 A.2d 45 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 993, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 (1984), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Giving the instruction to the jury before deliberation could prompt someone to hold out for just a bit more than a reasonable time to insure that the death penalty was not imposed. It likewise could cause a jury to rush through its deliberations to avoid being called back by the court and told that because a reasonable time had passed without a verdict the sentence would be life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Calhoun, </em>297 Md. at 595, 468 A.2d at 60; <em>see also Ware v.

The United States Supreme Court has declined to mandate that an instruction on the consequences of jury deadlock routinely be given in all capital cases, explaining, \u201cthe Eighth Amendment does not require that the jurors be instructed as to the consequences of their failure to agree.\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 381, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 2098, 144 L.Ed.2d 370, 382, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>527 U.S. 1058, 120 S.Ct. 22, 144 L.Ed.2d 826 (1999). Unless and until the jury makes an unambiguous declaration that it is unable to come to a unanimous decision, the same dangers of undue jury influence as expressed in <em>Calhoun </em>and its progeny remain. The record indicates that the trial judge did not find a clear statement of deadlock from the jury; thus the situation did not warrant mid-deliberation instruction on the failure of unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The jury presented the trial judge in the instant case with a note concerning the application of Sections V and VI of the sentencing form. The judge\u2019s discussion with counsel on the record following receipt of the jury note and his subsequent re-instruction of the jury shows that the judge perceived that the jury was seeking clarification, not that he perceived a jury deadlock. Where the trial judge has exercised discretion and found that the jury has not exceeded a reasonable amount of time in deliberations nor an inability to reach a unanimous decision, the court is not required to provide an instruction to the jury concerning imposition of a life sentence in lieu of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">After re-instruction, the jury returned to deliberate for approximately two hours before rendering a verdict. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>unanimously found that the State had proven that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and unanimously determined the sentence to be death. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s failure upon receiving the 11:20 p.m. jury note to provide an instruction to the jury that it could report its lack of unanimity-</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">VI. CONSIDERATION OF MITIGATING FACTORS UNDER THE SENTENCING FORM AND JURY INSTRUCTIONS:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">At appellant\u2019s request, the trial judge instructed the jury that, \u201c[a]ny factor which causes you to feel sympathy or mercy toward the defendant may be considered by you to be a mitigating factor, so long as such factors are supported by the evidence and are considered by you to be within the framework of the verdict sheet.\u201d Appellant specifically requested this instruction regarding mitigating factors and raised no objection to the trial judge\u2019s instructions or the sentencing form at trial, but now asserts that the instructions and language of the sentencing form may have improperly restricted the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating factors to those facts received in evidence. Generally, appellant\u2019s specific request of this instruction combined with a failure to properly object to it during the sentencing proceedings would constitute a waiver of any objection to the instruction. Although this issue was not properly preserved for appeal, appellant briefed and argued this issue in his appeal to this Court, accordingly, we will exercise our discretion to consider the jury\u2019s findings pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 414(e) of the Maryland Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\"><em>Considerations by Court of Appeals. </em>\u2014 In addition to the consideration of any errors properly before the Court on appeal, the Court of Appeals shall consider the imposition of the death sentence. With regard to the sentence, the Court shall determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>(1) Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">(2) Whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s or court\u2019s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance under \u00a7 413(d); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">(3) Whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s or court\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\"><em>See Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 728, 415 A.2d 830, 847 (1980)(explaining that in capital cases, Section 414(e) directs the Court to consider the factors enumerated therein in addition to those otherwise properly raised before the Court on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The sentencing authority, whether it is a judge or jury, must consider the existence of mitigating circumstances in rendering a sentencing verdict. <em>See Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 729, 415 A.2d at 848. In so considering, the sentencing authority may take into account any facts or circumstances concerning the defendant including but not limited to the evidence presented at the merits and sentencing phases of trial in deciding whether a death sentence would be appropriate. <em>See Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 474-475, 499 A.2d 1236, 1254 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986). The mitigating circumstances do not have to outweigh the aggravating circumstances in order to avoid imposition of the death penalty. <em>See White v. State, </em>322 Md. 738, 746-47, 589 A.2d 969, 973 (1991). Rather, if the sentencing authority has found mitigating circumstances, the death sentence shall be imposed only if the sentencing authority finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Prior to allocution, the trial judge informed the jury that, \u201cthe evidentiary portion of this phase is now concluded. Under the law, the Defendant has a right to address you.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Appellant then gave the following allocution pursuant to Md. Rule 4-343:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">I really don\u2019t know how I got myself in this position. Everyone I know would say that I\u2019m a nice person. I try to help everyone and I never tried to hurt anyone on purpose. In the event that I did get angry, you heard that I would result to walking down the street or walking away from any problems I had. That was one thing I just had a hard time trying not to get angry towards people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">I don\u2019t get enjoyment out of hurting anyone, and anyone can tell you that I try not to do that. I get enjoyment out of making people laugh, smile, and have a good time. If I ever saw a person in need and I could help them, I would definitely try to do that. This is one reason why people don\u2019t see me doing anything like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">People say and do things that they all regret. I\u2019m sure everybody has. This one is at the top of my very long list. I wish that I could change the things that\u2019s happened but I can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t imagine the guilt or sorrow I feel or the pain that the Atkinson must be going through, and I feel just terrible for it but I can\u2019t change anything that\u2019s happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">It\u2019s been said that I had a lot of problems as a child that continued on through my adult life. And at a very early age I resorted to constant drinking and illegal activities to support myself and my alcoholic habits. I would try to hide the truth by lying to policemen, by stealing, or just doing anything illegal to get what I need to support my alcohol habit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">Now, I sit and think with the exception of a very few I try to think of my so-called friends. I never really had so-called friends. I had a lot of drinking buddies or maybe barroom acquaintances but never friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">Alcohol has ruined my life, my kid\u2019s lives, and my relationship with others, and now a large amount of people associated with Mr. Atkinson. I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m standing here convicted of murder when I would never hurt anyone inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>tionally. I regret all the mistakes I\u2019ve made, and I know I can\u2019t makeup for them now. I regret the Atkinsons have loss a son, a brother, and a friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">I know from what I heard Mr. Atkinsons he had a lot of friends, his mother. People could have learned a lot from what he had to offer in the theater and just his friends. I did not know Mr. Atkinson and I\u2019m sure that it is not only my loss but others as well. I have a terrible feeling of guilt about Mr. Atkinson\u2019s death. I was able to see some of the pictures you have viewed as evidence as far as the autopsy and as far as the crime scene went. I get chills every time I see his picture on TV, in the paper, or just in my mind. I wake up in the middle of the night seeing those same pictures, just with all the regrets I have over everything. I can\u2019t believe that I got myself into any kind of situation like this. I care about people and I care about life itself, and I can\u2019t say how sorry I am for the death of Mr. Atkinson or how sorry I am for his family and for his friends. I also have regrets with what this has done to my kids and people close to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">People close to me have made comments and they said if they had done things differently in the past with any situation as far as I went that maybe things wouldn\u2019t be this way today. Maybe if my upbringing was a little bit differently then I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation today. I don\u2019t blame anybody entirely. I blame myself. I take full responsibility for my actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">I can\u2019t sit here \u2014 you did hear things about my mother. I couldn\u2019t sit here and blame my mother for anything. I mean, true, she did things that maybe everybody else thinks is wrong, but there\u2019s other people like yesterday you had my sister testified; she turned out f\u00edne. I can\u2019t blame anyone but I can only myself and my responsibility that I took in this, my drinking problems that I took whenever I constantly did anything I could to drink.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">I want to make it clear also that I have no anger towards any of you jury members. You did exactly what you were asked to do. You sat there and listened and weighed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>evidence like you were told and then you come up with a fair decision. I also wanted it to be known that I have no anger towards Davis Ruark or Sam Vincent, who are only doing the job that they support to uphold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">In the decision I know that the Atkinsons are going to seek closure, and in a way I don\u2019t know that they can ever get closure in any decision that\u2019s made. Bill Cosby I have a article that he wrote that said \u2014 and the loss of his son, any time you bring \u2014 lose somebody you bring into this world there will never be any closure. I have never really got gotten over the loss of my twins. And regrettably no matter what you decide I\u2019m sure that none of the Atkinsons will ever have complete closure either. For this I am truly sorry. Thank you for your time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In <em>Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. 344, 509 A.2d 120 (1986) we noted that \u201cthe allocutory process provides a unique opportunity for the defendant himself to face the sentencing body, without subjecting himself to cross-examination, and to explain in his own words the circumstances of the crime and his feelings regarding his conduct, culpability, and sentencing.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>at 358, 509 A.2d at 127. The sentencing authority may consider the content of the defendant\u2019s allocution in determining the existence of mitigating factors. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>312 Md. 225, 254, 539 A.2d 637, 651 (1988)(finding that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it was \u201cto decide the case only on.. .evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In the instant case, the trial judge instructed the jury with regard to mitigating circumstances as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">In Section IV each of you must determine for yourself whether any mitigating circumstances exist in this case. For the purpose of this sentencing proceeding a mitigating circumstance is anything about the Defendant or about the facts of the case that in fairness or in mercy may make the death sentence an inappropriate penalty for this Defendant. .. This procedure that I have just outlined in broad form is to make certain that each of you gives individual consideration to any mitigating circumstance you personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>find. Let me say that again because that\u2019s important \u2014 that each of you gives individual consideration to any mitigating circumstances you personally find as well as to any mitigating circumstance that all of you unanimously find.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u2756 * * H; Jjs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">In determining whether any mitigating circumstances exist, consider all the evidence presented regardless of who introduced it. Mitigating circumstances must be proven but need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A mitigating circumstance need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">[Section] 8(a) should contain every mitigating circumstance other than the other seven that all of you unanimously find to exist by a preponderance of the evidence. In 8(b) record every mitigating circumstance that at least one but not all of you find have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Any factor that you wish causes you to feel sympathy or mercy toward the Defendant may be considered by you to be a mitigating factor so long as such factor is considered by you to be within the framework of the verdict sheet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Appellant asserts that the references to evidence in the judge\u2019s instructions regarding mitigating factors combined with the judge\u2019s statement prior to the allocution that the \u201cevidentiary portion\u201d of the sentencing proceeding had concluded may have mislead the jurors into thinking that they could only consider facts gleaned from the evidentiary portion of the sentencing phase and trial in weighing mitigating factors, and not, for example, the appellant\u2019s allocution. Appellant also questions the trial judge\u2019s instruction that mitigating factors may be considered so long as the jury found it \u201cto be within the framework of the verdict sheet.\u201d Because the language of Section IV of the sentencing form states, \u201cBased upon the evidence, we make the following determinations as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>mitigating circumstances,\u201d appellant argues that the jury did not give proper weight to his allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In considering the appropriateness of sentencing instructions, we have stated: \u201c[Attention should not be focused on a particular portion lifted out of context, but rather its adequacy is determined by viewing it as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Foster, </em>263 Md. 388, 397, 283 A.2d 411, 415 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 1616, 31 L.Ed.2d 818 (1972). While there is no constitutionally prescribed method of instructing a jury, we have stated, \u201cIt is sufficient from a constitutional standpoint if it is clear from the entire charge considered in context that a reasonable jury could not have misunderstood the meaning and function of mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Calhoun, </em>306 Md. 692, 741, 511 A.2d 461, 486 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 910, 107 S.Ct. 1339, 94 L.Ed.2d 528 (1987)(quoting <em>Peek v. Kemp, </em>784 F.2d 1479, 1494 (11th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 939, 107 S.Ct. 421, 93 L.Ed.2d 371 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Read as a whole, we find that the sentencing instructions urged the jury to consider all of the facts, evidence and circumstances concerning the appellant that may have been mitigating factors, including mitigating factors not listed on the sentencing form. Appellant urged the inclusion of the sentencing instruction for mitigating factors using the language \u201cwithin the iramework of the verdict sheet,\u201d and the trial judge gave the requested instruction. We have previously stated that \u201c[defendants, including those in death penalty cases, will ordinarily not be permitted to \u2018sandbag\u2019 trial judges by expressly, or even tacitly, agreeing to a proposed procedure and then seeking reversal when the judge employs that procedure; nor will they freely be allowed to assert one position at trial and another, inconsistent position on appeal.\u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 289, 696 A.2d 443, 461, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1001, 118 S.Ct. 571, 139 L.Ed.2d 410 (1997). The fact that Section IV of the sentencing form uses the language \u201c[b]ased upon the evidence,\u201d pursuant to Rule 4-343, does not impermissibly limit the sentencing authority\u2019s consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>eration of mitigating factors to items formally received by the court as evidence in either the trial or sentencing phases. The trial judge may use the word \u201cevidence\u201d in instructing the jury as to mitigating circumstances. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that the standard of proof for determining the existence of mitigating circumstances was by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Furthermore, an examination of the completed sentencing form refutes appellant\u2019s argument. Part 8(b) of Section IV allowed the jury to write in any mitigating factors found by at least one, but fewer than all twelve jurors. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(g)(8). Under this provision of the sentencing form, the jury listed \u201cchaotic, disruptive, and violent childhood!;] accepts full responsibility for act and shows remorse!;] life imprisonment without parole is sufficient!;] mercy shown to defendant.\u201d The jury\u2019s finding of these mitigating factors indicates that the jurors considered the substance of the allocution, as it was the only opportunity appellant took to address the jury. We considered these same issues in <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999), where we found that, \u201c[t]he thoroughness of the trial judge\u2019s instructions effectively precluded a juror from not considering a factor he or she perceived as mitigating because it was not \u2018raised by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 173, 729 A.2d at 932. Thus, we find no error in the trial judge\u2019s instructions or in the sentencing form warranting reversal of appellant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">VII. REFUSAL TO INSTRUCT JURY THAT IT MUST FIND, AS A NON STATUTORY MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT APPELLANT WAS ACQUITTED OF PREMEDITATED MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Pursuant to dicta in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 203, 228, 655 A.2d 1311, 1323 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 641, 664 A.2d 885 (1995), appellant requested the following instruction at the sentencing phase of the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In your deliberations in the guilt-innocence phase of this trial you determined that Jody Miles was not guilty of premeditated murder. That finding is a mitigating factor which must be listed under No. 8, and must be weighed and considered by you in reaching a determination of sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The trial court declined to give the requested instruction mandating the finding of a mitigating factor, and instead focused the jury\u2019s attention on the issue of acquittal for premeditated murder as a potential mitigating factor by providing the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">Also, in connection with this eighth category, which is, again, involves mitigating circumstances which you find in addition to the seven which you must consider there, you should give careful consideration to whether or not the circumstances surrounding the murder of Mr. Atkinson in light of your finding of lack of premeditation constitute mitigating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">If all of you find that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Atkinson constitute mitigating circumstances, record such circumstance in 8(a) or record such circumstance in 8(b) if at least one but not all of you find it has been proven \u2014 that has been proven beyond \u2014 or by a preponderance of the evidence. Now, that is not \u2014 that is a direction for you to consider since you found there was no premeditation whether there were other mitigating circumstances or circumstances which you believe to have been mitigating in the murder of Mr. Atkinson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">At the conclusion of the sentencing instructions, appellant excepted to the instructions based on the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it must find the acquittal of premeditated murder as a mitigating factor. The trial court responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">I think that the question is squarely pitched to the jury. I think that\u2019s what <em>Brooks </em>means. I, for one, would be loathed to tell the jury either that it must \u2014 The Court must not reach a mitigating conclusion because I think that to me is of the essence of allowing the jury to do it. It\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>essence of the sentencing function. So, I will respectfully overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">As noted, in <em>Brooks, </em>the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s comments regarding the mandatory inclusion of a non-statutory mitigating factor in a sentencing determination was dicta, as the issue of mitigating factors under the Maryland sentencing scheme had not been raised before the court. <em>See Brooks, </em>104 Md.App. at 229, 655 A.2d at 1323 (explaining that \u201c[a]s we noted at the outset, appellant has not been sentenced to death, and the imposition of the death penalty under the particular circumstances of her case is not at issue\u201d). The trial court cannot mandate that a jury find a mitigating factor under Section 413(g)(8). <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 518, 495 A.2d 1, 17 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986)(explaining that requiring a jury to find a mitigating factor as a matter of law \u201cwould obliterate the jury\u2019s discretion under the provision and jettison the clear legislative intent\u201d). The mandatory mitigating factors which must be considered under the sentencing scheme in capital cases are those set forth in Section 413(g)(l)-(7). Any other facts, evidence, or circumstances urged by appellant to be mitigating circumstances under Section 413(g)(8) have not been deemed mandatory mitigating factors by the Legislature. Permissive mitigating factors are defined solely by the sentencing authority, whether it is a jury or judge, in exercising its judgment and may be included on the sentencing form pursuant to Section 413(g)(8). <em>See Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 608, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2967, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, 992 (1978)(holding in order to meet the constitutional requirements of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, \u201ca death penalty statute must not preclude consideration of relevant mitigating factors\u201d); <em>Bowers v. State, </em>306 Md. 120, 150, 507 A.2d 1072, 1087, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 890, 107 S.Ct. 292, 93 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)(explaining that \u201c[t]he intention is, as we see it, simply that the jury may itself set forth any facts not listed on the submitted form which it believes constitute a mitigating factor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>We have explained that in death penalty cases where the appellant asserts that the sentencing authority failed to consider or find mitigating factors, \u201cthe standard of review is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational sentencing authority could have concluded that the accused failed to prove the claimed mitigating circumstance by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>See Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 362, 473 A.2d 903, 918 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 900, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984)(emphasis in original). In the matter now before us, the trial judge, when he gave the instructions concerning the sentencing form, directed the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that they had acquitted appellant of premeditated murder. The jury was well aware of the fact that appellant had been acquitted of premeditated murder, as the same jury heard both the merits phase and the sentencing phase of the trial. Because the mitigating circumstance of acquittal of premeditated murder is permissive, rather than mandatory, it is well within the realm of possibility that a reasonable sentencing authority could conclude that although the prosecution did not prove its case for premeditated murder at trial, the accused nevertheless committed murder by violently taking the life of another human being without provocation. The sentencing form requires the jury to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors it finds, and in so doing, the jury may exercise the conscience of the community in affording greater weight to the criminal conduct. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction, and no prejudice to appellant in the jury\u2019s consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances absent the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">VIII. WHETHER THERE ARE AMBIGUITIES AND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE SENTENCING VERDICTS REQUIRING APPELLANT\u2019S DEATH SENTENCE TO BE VACATED</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Appellant argues that the combination of the contents of the third jury note, the trial judge\u2019s response to the note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and the inclusion of the statement \u201c[l]ife imprisonment without parole is sufficient\u201d under Section IV, part 8(b) of the sentencing form demonstrates that the jury arbitrarily imposed a sentence of death in this case, requiring that the sentence be vacated. The facts of this case place appellant\u2019s criminal conduct within the framework of Maryland\u2019s capital punishment statute. His conviction for the first-degree murder of Edward Atkinson was based on the felony murder rule. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 410 (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At trial, the jury determined that appellant was a principal in the first-degree in the murder. The aggravating factor found by the jury in its sentencing deliberations was that appellant committed the murder while he was robbing Mr. Atkinson. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> With regard to mitigating circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>jury unanimously found that appellant had not previously committed a crime of violence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 413(g)(1). Under Section IV, part 8(b), some of the jurors listed four additional mitigating circumstances: \u201cchaotic, disruptive, and violent childhood[;] accepts full responsibility for act and shows remorse[;] life imprisonment without parole is sufficient^] mercy shown to defendant.\u201d The jury unanimously voted to impose a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We have held the felony murder rule embodied in Section 413(d)(10) to be a constitutional aggravating factor. <em>See Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 615, 755 A.2d 1088, 1109 (2000); <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>297 Md. at 629, 468 A.2d at 77. Not all crimes defined as felonies under the Maryland Code are included within those offenses enumerated under the felony murder statute. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 410. The felony murders qualifying as an aggravating factor pursuant to Section 413(d)(10) are a select group derived from Section 410, thus narrowly restricting the class of death-eligible felony murders to those felonies deemed most serious by the Legislature, and to those convicted as principals in the first-degree. <em>See Calhoun, </em>297 Md. at 625-626, 468 A.2d at 75. Thus, reading all relevant portions of the statute, the death penalty may only be imposed in Maryland in a narrow class of cases. <em>See id. </em>at 624, 468 A.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The circumstances surrounding the murder of Edward Atkinson fall within that narrow class of criminal activity eligible for the death penalty under Maryland law. In capital cases, the Maryland sentencing scheme requires the jury to carefully weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances such that a death sentence shall only be imposed where a unanimous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>jury finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h), (i). The statute contemplates a weighing of the gravity of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, not merely a numerical tally of whether the mitigating circumstances listed on the sentencing form outnumber the aggravating circumstances. <em>See Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 83, 622 A.2d 727, 729-730 (1993)(affirming imposition of a death sentence where the trial court found the existence of a single aggravating factor under Section 413(d)(10) outweighed the mitigating circumstance of Section 413(g)(4) that defendant could not appreciate the criminality of his conduct due to mental incapacity and five additional mitigating circumstances under Section 413(g)(8)); <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 473 A.2d 903 (affirming death sentence and finding that sentencing authority was not required to find statutory mitigating circumstances despite defendant\u2019s age at time of crime (19), extensive proof of defendant\u2019s history of substance abuse, mental illness and other cognitive impairment, and defendant\u2019s apology and promise that she would never do anything again which would result in her imprisonment). The record before us supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that the statutory aggravating circumstance in Section 413(d)(10), the \u201cdefendant committed the murder while committing... a robbery ...\u201d outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Thus, we do not find any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the sentencing verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">IX.

We review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the potential jurors for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Appellant argues that Fatima Johnson should not have been stricken for cause because she never indicated she would be unable to impose the death penalty. Relevant portions of Ms. Johnson\u2019s voir dire are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">The Court: Now, have you formed or do you have any general attitude about the death penalty or about capital punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">Juror: No, I haven\u2019t formed anything, but well \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I could sentence anybody to death. I don\u2019t know if I could. Depends on what the outcome is going to be. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">The Court: Suppose that you heard the testimony about what the penalty should be \u2014 that is, you heard background about the defendant, and other testimony as to what the penalty should be, you heard the instructions from the judge, you heard from the lawyers arguing both sides of it, you got back and you talked with the other jurors and then, in you[r] own mind, you felt the death penalty was proper and allowed by law, would you be able then to vote for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Juror: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">The State: Do you have any particular religious or moral convictions about the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Juror: No. I just don\u2019t feel in my heart I could do it to anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">The State: Are there any circumstances under which you could impose the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Juror: Only circumstances I could do it if somebody had did it to my family, my child, my husband. But I wouldn\u2019t want that case, so, like I said, I don\u2019t know, until I hear what really went on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">Defense: \u2014 are your feelings such that it would in any way affect your ability to be fair and impartial in determining guilt or innocence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">Juror: I could be fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">Defense: You know, with regard to the question of the death penalty, do you have a totally closed mind to being persuaded by either side as to whether the sentence should be death or life \u2014 we know it\u2019s going to be hard, but the question is do you have a closed mind\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">Juror: No, it\u2019s not closed, but I don\u2019t know if I could say I want someone killed. I mean, you know, I don\u2019t know if I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">The State: If I could ask one follow up. The judge is going to tell you what the law is and you will determine what the facts are. Would you be able to follow the law that the judge instructs you, on the law that the judge says is the law in the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">Juror: Yes, I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>The State: Even if it included the possibility of imposition of the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">Juror: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Appellant also seeks reversal on the basis of the voir dire responses provided by Michael Diffendal, on the basis of alleged ambiguities in Mr. Diffendal\u2019s responses to questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">The Court: So you don\u2019t know whether you would be able to, based upon what you heard and the instructions of the judge as to your responsibilities with respect to the law, if you concluded that the death penalty was proper, you do not know whether would even then be able to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Juror: I don\u2019t know, at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">The Court: \u2014 vote for it?

Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the impression I got .from your last answer is regardless of what the judge instructed you as to the law, that you may [ ] not be in a position to vote for the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">Juror: I guess what I\u2019m saying right now is that I don\u2019t know when it came down to the final making a decision, whether I could or not. I have never really considered it in detail. It\u2019s a big responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">Defense: Sir, just to follow up a little bit more, obviously this is all in a vacuum, and it\u2019s difficult for anyone who has to make that kind of a decision. Can you conceive of any case where the State could convince you that the facts were so bad and the individual was so bad and he deserved the death penalty, you could vote for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Juror: I think that could be a possibility, depending on what the evidence was, but I can\u2019t sit here and say it would be, and it\u2019s something of great responsibility, and something I\u2019ve never had to consider prior to this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Appellant also asserts error with regard to the responses of potential juror Katherine Bishop on the basis that the following responses in voir dire did not indicate that she would be unable to vote for a sentence of death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">The Court: If you were convinced at the end of that proceeding or persuaded that under the law as the judge had given it to you and under the facts which you heard at the original trial with regard to guilt or innocence, the portion of the trial that had to do with the penalty, that the death penalty was proper, could you vote for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">Juror: Whew. I honestly don\u2019t know if I could. That is as close as I can get for you. I can\u2019t give you a yes or no. I don\u2019t make decisions like that, and I can only say that \u2014 I am not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">Juror: Are you asking me if I could vote for the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">Juror: Not the three choices just the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">Juror: I am not sure I could. I am not a big what if, person. That is my honest answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-14\">The Court: Again I am making it easy for you. I\u2019m telling you that you have concluded that it would be proper-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-15\">juror: What are you asking me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">The Court: \u2014 could you vote for the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-17\">Juror: Not as it stands now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-18\">Defense: When you say not as it stands now can you explain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Juror: I am a person that I can\u2019t live through your experience, I have to hear what is going on and he\u2019s asking me what if and I am not a good what if person. Things could change. I guess I am saying if I heard the evidence and thought maybe this would be appropriate, maybe I could. But I just can\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not a blanket person. I don\u2019t see things in black and white, I wish I did it would make my life easier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">Defense: Sure. Obviously it\u2019s very difficult for anyone. At a sentencing proceeding, evidence will be presented and jurors may disagree. And I know you\u2019re not a good what if person, but do you see that there could be a set of circumstances where the State could convince you that the case was bad enough and the facts were bad enough that you could vote for death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">Juror: Not based on what I feel now, probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">Defense: And that would be based on what set of feelings if I might ask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">Juror: I just don\u2019t think anyone has the right, individual or government, to take somebody else\u2019s life. But as I said I have never been personally challenged, nobody\u2019s ever hurt anyone in my immediate family. I could change my convictions probably like that (indicating by snapping fingers).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">Defense: Are you open to be persuaded by the State or completely closed to persuasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">Juror: I\u2019m always open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Appellant also argues that the responses of potential juror Tina Buttner do not indicate an inability to apply the law. The relevant portions of her voir dire are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">The Court: The next question I have is have you formed any opinions for or against the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-13\">Juror: Not yet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m old enough to make that kind of a decision, just yet...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The Court: ... So you hear all this, you hear the evidence about what the penalty should be, you hear the judge\u2019s instructions, you hear the argument of the lawyers and then you go in the jury room and discuss the matter with the other jurors and during all that, you become convinced that in this case, the made up case, that the death penalty would be proper. Would you be able to vote for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Juror: Oh, gee. Oh, gosh. That is very hard. That is a hard decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">The Court: Well it is a hard decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Juror: Um, I don\u2019t know.

I think I probably \u2014 it would be really really hard for me to say that I would want the death penalty for anybody, regardless of the crime that they committed. Unless of course it\u2019s a mass murder or something. Intentionally killing hundreds of people. Serial killers I could probably vote for the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Under Maryland law and the United States Constitution, appellant was entitled to a fair and impartial jury. <em>See Ware v.

The trial court is in the best position to assess potential jurors and strike them from the panel if needed by taking into consideration the potential jurors\u2019 demeanors and credibility. <em>See id. </em>In capital punishment cases, the trial court must consider the potential juror bias arising from venire panel members who possess strong beliefs concerning imposition of the death penalty. <em>See Lockhart v. McCree, </em>476 U.S. 162, 173, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 1764, 90 L.Ed.2d 137, 147 (1986)(holding that \u201cthe Constitution does not prohibit the States from \u2018death qualifying\u2019 juries in capital cases\u201d); <em>Witherspoon v.

As he excused each of these potential jurors, the trial judge com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>mented on his perception of the jurors. With Ms. Johnson, the trial judge was \u201cparticularly persuaded by the fact that she indicates that however she feels, her decision does not involve anything that the Court will tell her.\u201d The trial judge found that Mr. Diffendal could not say what he would do even when given the opportunity to conjure up the most extreme situation, such that he indicated that he would not be able to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. Ms. Bishop, though indicating at the conclusion of questioning that she was \u201calways open,\u201d in the court\u2019s impression did so simply \u201cto indicate her lack of total intransigence.\u201d Ms. Buttner could only tentatively qualify her willingness to accept the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for \u201cmass murder,\u201d regardless of the requirements of the law. Furthermore, the trial judge observed Ms. Buttner\u2019s nervousness throughout questioning, as she gritted her teeth so much that the trial judge queried as to what was the matter with her. For the reasons indicated, we find no abuse of discretion of the trial judge in striking these four potential jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">X. THE APPELLANT IN SHACKLES:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">During the second day of trial on March 10, 1998, appellant was transported to the courtroom for the afternoon session wearing leg and arm shackles. In order to reach the courtroom from the hallway, the appellant had to walk by the jury room where the door inadvertently remained open a few inches. Appellant alleged that he was observed by some of the jurors. Appellant moved for a mistrial, although he did not request that the jurors be polled to determine if any of them had actually seen appellant walking down the hallway in shackles. The trial judge denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We have stated that, \u201ca defendant is entitled to an individualized evaluation of both the need for shackling and the potential prejudice therefrom.\u201d <em>Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 85, 665 A.2d 223, 250 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1148, 116 S.Ct. 1021, 134 L.Ed.2d 100 (1996)(citing <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 583 A.2d 218 (1990)). We review the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>judge\u2019s denial of the motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. The general rule that a mistrial should be granted only for \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d is well settled. <em>See State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 207-08, 567 A.2d 449, 452-53 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 1926, 109 L.Ed.2d 289 (1990) (quoting <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824)). Because the trial judge \u201cis ordinarily in a uniquely superior position to gauge the potential for prejudice in a particular case,\u201d the trial judge is afforded broad discretion in determining the appropriateness of granting the motion for mistrial. <em>Watters v. State, </em>328 Md. 38, 50, 612 A.2d 1288, 1294 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1024, 113 S.Ct. 1832, 123 L.Ed.2d 460 (1993). For the reasons set forth below, no manifest necessity existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The decision as to the method and extent of courtroom security is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Whittlesey, </em>340 Md. at 84, 665 A.2d at 249. This discretion extends to the hallways and corridors leading to and from the courtroom, as the structure of the courthouse and the security available in the building may bear on the trial judge\u2019s decision to utilize shackles on the accused. On review we must ask \u201cwhether the measures utilized were reasonable and whether, given the need, such security posed an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Bruce v. State, </em>318 Md. 706, 721, 569 A.2d 1254, 1262 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>328 Md. 594, 616 A.2d 392 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 963, 113 S.Ct. 2936, 124 L.Ed.2d 686 (1993)(citing <em>Holbrook v.

The prisoner transport vehicles must park on the public street such that all prisoners must be walked across the Courthouse square and enter the building through the front (and only) door to the Courthouse. The trial judge explained the inherent difficulties of the Queen Anne\u2019s County Courthouse in his denial of appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>I simply do not feel that one fleeting glimpse, in the meantime, for the past two days, and at the hearing, when each of the jurors was here when we had the public selection of the jurors and when each juror was interviewed privately, the defendant has been there really indistinguishable from the rest of us... and he has been here and he\u2019s been walking back and forth in this courtroom unshackled to the numerous-and not inordinate, I don\u2019t mean that when I say numerous, but there have been a number of conferences here at the bench and he is really pretty free to go. I have had occasion to look and I was \u2014 I have been very impressed over the years and I was again yesterday, at how really good the detention people are in making themselves obscure...we don\u2019t even know how many, if any of the jurors saw the defendant.

They know that he is in some sort of custody, and they cannot be so naive as to assume that he is being transported back and forth on the outside on the honor system, because it just isn\u2019t that way. If they are, they\u2019re some jurors, but I simply cannot believe that they were.

There is no way possible to avoid that because there is only one way for any human being to get to the second floor courtroom, and it goes for jurors, it goes for guards, it goes for judges, it goes for everybody else. There is just no other way. Unless one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>comes up the fire escape and I have never really seen anyone on the fire escape.

If one turns to the right, at the very end of that hall, again, there is a door, taking up the entire area of the end of the hall, which is the door to the jury room. And then, right adjacent to that door is the door to come into the courtroom that the people from the detention center bring the defendant in, in that door, to the courtroom, and then through a portion of the courtroom to the \u2014 another room, which is the detention room where his transportation accessories are removed, and this would include over coats, rain coats, hats or whatever one is traveling with, and it just so happens that a very necessary traveling accessory of a prisoner is leg irons and hand cuffs, and why is that, it\u2019s to protect everybody and make sure that the person doesn\u2019t escape. It isn\u2019t a question of whether I think that Mr. Miles is going to escape, but, it\u2019s just \u2014 most of us are taught over the centuries that we don\u2019t deal in promises, so I really think that while unfortunate, the situation is absolutely diminimus and I\u2019m glad the jury didn\u2019t hear it, because it\u2019s inconceivable to me that a juror thought anything about it. Frankly I think if they had seen the defendant walking around the hall, with nothing on they would have been astonished, and so, as I said, the detention center people are extremely careful when they are in the courtroom to be themselves unobtrusive, and, since I have been here, at least, the rule has been that we don\u2019t have hand cuffs and leg irons in the courtroom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>unless they have called me in advance and said there is a strong reason for it, that someone it violent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Thus, the trial judge balanced the need to have basic security in shackling appellant while being transported to and from the courtroom while preserving the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial and sentencing by having all shackles removed in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Appellant misplaces his reliance on <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970)(discussing the constitutionality of binding and gagging a disruptive defendant in the courtroom during his trial), and <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (discussing the presence of uniformed state police troopers sitting behind defendants for security purposes). Both <em>Allen </em>and <em>Flynn </em>involved events taking place inside the courtroom, while the jury was present. In the present case, no extraordinary security measures were taken. At all times during the trial and sentencing the appellant wore ordinary clothing and appeared before the jury in the courtroom unshackled.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">As we stated in <em>Bruce v. State, </em>\u201c[t]his one inadvertent viewing of Appellant in handcuffs... did not result in any prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d 318 Md. at 721, 569 A.2d at 1262. Because the jury was never polled to determine whether there was actual prejudice, and there are no facts on the record which indicate an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the appellant in using shackles during prisoner transport, we decline to infer that the jurors who may have witnessed appellant walk down the hall, if any, were biased against the appellant and therefore, find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

The legislature intended to preserve the marital privilege regardless of whether a communication was intercepted by an eavesdropper or by law enforcement officials pursuant to a court order. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, \u00a7 9-105 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (1977, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) (providing that \"one spouse is not competent to disclose any confidential communication between the spouses occurring during their marriage\u201d). <em>See also, Mazzone, </em>336 Md. at 389-90, 648 A.2d at 983.

Prior to receipt of the tape from James Towers, the police had already conducted investigations at the stores where the victim\u2019s credit cards had been used following his disappearance. The police ascertained a physical description of the suspect and circulated it on the local news stations. The victim\u2019s brother had also provided police with a description matching appellant based on his sighting on April 4, 1997, when he discovered his brother's body. Sergeant Bruce Dana and Corporal Cynthia Dougherty of the Maryland State Police also witnessed appellant talking on his cell phone in the gray car near the crime scene that same day. Although Jona Miles's voluntary assistance in ascertaining appellant\u2019s whereabouts on the day of his arrest helped police to locate him more rapidly, the police had already physically identified their suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">.

Although we consider the lack of police involvement in obtaining the tape of the cellular phone conversation between Jo\u00f1a and Jody Miles as a factor in dissipating the taint of this evidence on subsequent evidence received in the case, we decline to go so far as to adopt the \"clean hands doctrine\u201d of <em>United States v.

The judge also found, and the State also does not dispute, that the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant executed on April 22, 1997 was unlawfully seized because it was derivative of the illegal wiretap and, thus, was excluded pursuant to the exclusionary mandate of \u00a7 10-405. Therefore, the sole question presented by this appeal, with respect to appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress, is whether the remaining evidence obtained subsequent to the illegal wiretap and search warrant was admitted improperly in evidence at appellant\u2019s trial because it was derived from the illegally intercepted communication in violation of the exclusionary command of \u00a7 10-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>While the statutory exclusionary rule of \u00a7 10-405 is not dependent upon the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v.

State, </em>274 Md. 411, 422, 337 A.2d 415, 422 (1975) (applying the <em>Wong Sun </em>doctrine to a violation of the Maryland wiretap statute). As a result, the exclusionary rule \u201capplies to any \u2018fruits\u2019 of a constitutional violation \u2014 whether such evidence be tangible, physical material actually seized in an illegal search, items observed or words overheard in the course of the unlawful activity, or confessions or statements of the accused obtained during an illegal arrest and detention.\u201d <em>United States v.

In this case, neither the State nor the majority alleges an independent source for the disputed evidence or inevitable discovery; therefore, the admissibility of the evidence obtained from Jona Miles and appellant\u2019s confession is dependent solely upon application of the attenuation doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>This Court examined the attenuation doctrine in the context of the Fourth Amendment in <em>Ferguson v.

As a result, at the petitioner\u2019s ensuing trial, the court suppressed the physical evidence seized from his person at the time of his arrest, but the trial court permitted the victim\u2019s identification of the petitioner, both at the time of his arrest and in court, to be admitted in evidence, and the petitioner was subsequently convicted of armed robbery and related offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 546-47, 483 A.2d at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">This Court reversed the petitioner\u2019s conviction, ruling that the trial court had erred in not suppressing the extrajudicial identification testimony as the fruit of the petitioner\u2019s unlawful arrest, <em>see id. </em>at 552, 483 A.2d at 1260, although it upheld the court\u2019s admission of the in-court identification of the petitioner because it had an \u201cindependent source.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 556, 483 A.2d at 1262. We found that the causal relationship between the illegal arrest and the subsequent extrajudicial identification of the petitioner was not sufficiently attenuated, primarily on the basis of the temporal proximity between the arrest and the identification, the lack of any meaningful intervening circumstance to break the causal connection, and the purposefulness of the police conduct in conducting the identification \u201cshowup.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 550-52, 483 A.2d at 1259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In examining the <em>Wong Sun </em>attenuation doctrine, courts repeatedly utilize consequential language, such as \u201cexploitation,\u201d \u201cdirect result,\u201d \u201cchain of events,\u201d \u201clink,\u201d \u201cnexus,\u201d \u201cimpetus,\u201d \u201cconnection,\u201d \u201ccausation,\u201d \u201cinducement,\u201d \u201cbasis,\u201d and \u201cproduct\u201d to describe the necessary relationship between a primary illegality and evidence derived therefrom. In assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ing attenuation, courts examine the facts and circumstances of each case in considering four factors: the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings; the temporal proximity of the illegality to the confession; the presence of intervening circumstances; and the purpose and flagrancy of the illegal police conduct. <em>See Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975); <em>Parker, </em>722 F.2d at 186; <em>Ferguson, </em>301 Md. at 549, 483 A.2d at 1258; <em>State v. Jennings, </em>461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In my view, there was no sufficient attenuation to purge the primary taint of the illegal oral acquisition. All of the subsequent evidence presented at the trial was the product of the primary illegality, and the State failed to satisfy its burden to prove attenuation. While Jona Miles and appellant both were given their <em>Miranda </em>warnings, an application of the remaining <em>Brown </em>factors makes clear that the temporal proximity between the illegal wiretap and search warrant and the derivative evidence, the lack of intervening circumstances, and the purposefulness of the illegal police conduct all strongly indicate a direct causal nexus between the illegally seized evidence and the subsequent evidence used by the State at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The illegal wiretap and subsequent search and seizure led the police almost immediately to appellant \u2014 the police identified the voices of Jona Miles and appellant on the basis of the taped conversation; the search and seizure warrant for appellant\u2019s residence was issued within a week of the taped phone conversation having been turned over to the police, on the basis of the contents of that conversation; Jona Miles\u2019s custodial interview was conducted the same day, during which she consented to subsequent searches and seizures and described to police where she had disposed of the murder weapon; appellant was arrested later that evening and confessed after a brief custodial interrogation during which he was confronted with evidence that the police had against him, including the illegally seized evidence; and the police recovered the gun the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Without the primary illegality, it is unlikely that the police would have identified appellant. There certainly were no intervening circumstances to lead them to his door.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police knew or, at the very least, they should have known, that the tape of appellant\u2019s telephone conversation was obtained in violation of the statute and should not have exploited it further to obtain the search warrant for his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Emphasizing the deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule, the majority asserts that the police conduct in this case did not constitute flagrant and purposeful misconduct. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 538, stating that \u201cthe police did exactly what anyone would have expected them to do.\u201d I disagree. The intercepted conversation plainly was obtained in contravention of the wiretap statute. As the majority concedes, \u201cthe police were aware that the conversation had been taped ... without the consent of the parties to the conversation.\u201d Maj. op. at 512. Even if, for some reason not apparent on this record, the police did not know that its further use was illegal, they certainly should have. The law in Maryland is certainly clear that the use of the contents of an unlawfully taped conversation is, in itself, an unlawful act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The majority attempts to distinguish the police misconduct in this case from that in <em>Brown, see id., </em>but the attempt amounts to a distinction without a difference. In <em>Brown, </em>the Court found the police conduct to be purposeful and flagrant because the arrest of the petitioner was obviously improper and investigatory in purpose since it was used to effectuate a search of his home as a search incident to his arrest. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604-05, 95 S.Ct. at 2262, 45 L.Ed.2d 416. The police conduct in this case is directly comparable \u2014 the police listened to an obviously illegally taped conversation and then used its contents to effectuate the search of appellant\u2019s home and seize evidence of his involvement in the murder. The only real difference between the two situations is that, in <em>Brown, </em>the police search was a warrantless one \u2014 a meaningless distinction for the purpose of assessing the purposefulness and flagrancy of the actions of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In addition, the majority claims that construing the wiretap statute to preclude police use of the taped conversation in this case would produce an unreasonable result. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 539-540. On the contrary, such exclusion <em>is mandated </em>by this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 591 A.2d 481 (1991), and <em>Perry v. State, </em>357 Md. 37, 741 A.2d 1162 (1999). In implicitly creating, despite its protestations to the contrary, <em>see </em>maj. op. at 538 n. 14, a new \u201cclean hands\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule of the Maryland wiretap statute, the majority appears to be overruling at least portions of <em>Mustafa </em>and <em>Perry sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Mustafa </em>arose in a context similar to that of the case at bar, when a private citizen, who was not acting at the direction of law enforcement, turned over an intercepted conversation to police. <em>See Mustafa, </em>323 Md. at 71, 591 A.2d at 484. Unlike this case, in which the interception was unquestionably illegal, the communication at issue in <em>Mustafa </em>was intercepted lawfully in Washington, D.C. Nonetheless, this Court held that wiretap evidence intercepted pursuant to more lenient statutory enactments of other jurisdictions is not admissible in Maryland courts unless it complies with Maryland\u2019s more restrictive standards. <em>See id. </em>at 74, 591 A.2d at 485. In doing so, we specifically held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">The exclusionary provision \u00a7 10-405 of the Maryland Act precludes the admission of evidence which was not lawfully intercepted. The language of this section is unambiguous, and provides for no exceptions. There is no indication that the legislature intended to adopt anything but an \u201call-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>encompassing exclusionary rule which it unequivocally fashioned in \u00a7 10-405.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 73-74, 591 A.2d at 485 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In <em>Perry, </em>this Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no coconspirator exception, nor wilfulness requirement, to the exclusionary command of \u00a7 10-405. <em>See Perry, </em>357 Md. at 60-67, 741 A.2d at 1174-78. In <em>Perry, </em>the telephone conversations that the State sought to introduce in evidence had been taped by one of the alleged participants in the crime and had been discovered and seized pursuant to a valid search warrant. <em>See id. </em>at 43, 741 A.2d at 1165. In fact, we specifically noted that \u201c[t]here is no doubt that [the police officer] received the tape by an authorized means; he acquired it through execution of a search warrant, the validity of which is not in dispute. The question, then, is whether the interception ... was \u2018in accordance with the provisions of the subtitle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 741 A.2d at 1176. Once again, this Court reiterated its strict interpretation of \u00a7 10-405 in <em>Mustafa, </em>emphasizing that \u201c[a]ny exception that would make an interception lawful or that would preclude an aggrieved person from moving to suppress an unlawful interception must be \u2018specifically\u2019 provided for in the Act....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 741 A.2d at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The analysis of the exclusionary provision in <em>Mustafa </em>and <em>Perry </em>applies with equal force to the evidence derived from an illegal wiretap in this case because \u00a7 10-405 places the contents of illegally intercepted communications on equal footing with evidence \u201cderived therefrom.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-405 (\u201cWhenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of the communication <em>and no evidence derived therefrom </em>may be received in evidence ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The majority concludes that the \u201cbalance\u201d of factors determining admissibility of the evidence falls in favor of the State. See maj. op. at 539-540. That determination, however, is a legislative one and not for this Court to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">In enacting the strict exclusionary provisions of \u00a7 10-405, the General Assembly made the public policy determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement and the privacy interests of the citizens of Maryland in their wire communications. The Legislature did not choose to adopt the type of sliding scale exclusionary rule that the majority now espouses. As we explained in <em>Perry, </em>\u201c[t]he Legislature has made unmistakably clear that, except as otherwise specifically provided in the subtitle, wire communications are not to be intercepted without the consent of all parties.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>357 Md. at 65, 741 A.2d at 1177.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is true because \u201c[t]he exclusionary provision operates only upon the communication itself, depriving it of evidentiary value, rather than against the person or property of the interceptor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 741 A.2d at 1177-78. Likewise, the fact that the police did not participate in the taping of the conversations at issue in this case is irrelevant to the question of whether their use of the illegally obtained recordings was permissible or whether evidence derived therefrom is admissible in a Maryland court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The record of the suppression hearing in this case shows clearly that the State failed to carry its burden to prove attenuation. Unfortunately, the record from the suppression hearing contains only a few fragmentary excerpts of the illegally wiretapped conversation and the subsequent police interviews of Jona Miles and appellant, which makes it difficult to determine with any certainty the extent to which the primary illegality was exploited in obtaining this later evidence. Cf. maj. op. at 527 n. 12 (acknowledging fragmentary state of Jona Miles\u2019 statement in the record). Nonetheless, since the State bears the burden of proving attenuation, this paucity of evidence should not work to appellant\u2019s detriment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Furthermore, the record before us contains evidence affirmatively demonstrating a substantial nexus between the illegal wiretap and resulting search of appellant\u2019s residence and the evidence obtained from Jona Miles and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">It is important to remember that the analysis of whether evidence to which objection is made was obtained by exploitation of the primary illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint depends primarily upon weighing the facts in the particular case. <em>See United States v. Finucan, </em>708 F.2d 838, 843 (1st Cir.1983); 5 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 11.4 (3rd ed.1996). The excerpts from the police interview with Jona Miles, who was under arrest at the time as an accessory in the alleged crime, demonstrate that <em>police specifically used the contents of the wiretapped conversation in eliciting Ms. Miles\u2019s statements. </em>At different points in the interview, the police informed Ms. Miles that they knew that appellant had called her and told her to get rid of the gun, that she and appellant had talked about his resemblance to the composite photographs that had been broadcast on the local news, and that appellant had informed Ms. Miles that he was at a particular friend\u2019s house when the composites appeared on television, and the police made reference to another friend, \u201cBecky,\u201d whose suspicions about the crime appellant and Ms. Miles had discussed during the wiretapped conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">During the police interview of Jona Miles, the following exchange occurred regarding the contents of the illegally taped conversation between appellant and Ms. Miles about disposing of the murder weapon and the composite photographs on television:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">[POLICE]: The same night <em>he called and told you to get rid of the </em>gun\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">JONA MILES: I saw \u2014 no. I saw him in the afternoon. I saw him on the noon news. I was at a patient\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">[POLICE]: Okay. Was it the same day that <em>he talked to you that night and told you to get rid of the gun? </em>That you saw the composites?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>JONA MILES: Probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">[POLICE]: Okay, so probably on the 15th, which is the day before your doctor\u2019s appointment, you saw the composites?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">JONA MILES: All I remember is it was on the noon news.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">[POLICE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">JONA MILES: I remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">[POLICE]: That night, <em>Jody called you, you two talked about the comparisons between him and the composites:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">JONA MILES: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">The police also interviewed Jona Miles using her cellular telephone conversation with appellant regarding the night that he saw the composites on television at a friend\u2019s house:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-13\">[POLICE]: The night the composites were shown on TV, <em>he told you he was at somebody\u2019s house. </em>Whose house was he at? <em>He said he didn\u2019t really want to look at the TV and act too interested.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">JONA MILES: Cooper\u2019s. Cooper\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-15\">[POLICE]: Jimmy K. Cooper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-16\">JONA MILES: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">Later on in the interrogation, police returned to the subject of appellant\u2019s telephone conversation with Jona Miles about the composites being shown on television:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-19\">[POLICE]: Okay. When you \u2014 why were you so worried and why were you so grateful that <em>Jody called you that night he called you after the composites were up? You said you were on pin and needles waiting for you [sic] to call because you were worried.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-20\">JONA MILES: Just wondering if something happened to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-21\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">During their illegally taped cellular telephone conversation, appellant and Jona Miles engaged in the following discussion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>FEMALE VOICE: Are you sure you\u2019re going to be okay down there:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">MALE VOICE: I don\u2019t know. You know, I was almost thinking about having you call Becky and tell her to leave me a key somewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">FEMALE VOICE: That might not be a good idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">MALE VOICE: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">FEMALE VOICE: Because she asked questions last night. If anything had come up. Yes, she did bring it up to me. You knew she would. I told you she would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">MALE VOICE: Did anything come up what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">FEMALE VOICE: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">MALE VOICE: Anything come up what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">FEMALE VOICE: Remember what you told me you all talked about when I left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">MALE VOICE: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">FEMALE VOICE: Yeah. She just asked me about if you\u2019d heard anything. I said no. Everything\u2019s cool. I said everything\u2019s fine, why? And she brought it up the other day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">The police also exploited this illegally obtained information during their interrogation of Jona Miles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">[POLICE]: Who is Becky? Who\u2019s Becky that\u2019s a friend of yours? <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">MILES: Rebecca Chips.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">The majority sidesteps the crucial causation analysis by pointing out that the police never confronted Jona with \u201cthe fact that they possessed the taped cellular phone conversation.\u201d Maj. op. at 528. This assertion, however, in no way negates the fact that the police confronted her with the <em>contents </em>of those tape recorded conversation. In that way, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Ms. Miles\u2019 statements to police were nonetheless <em>derived from </em>the taped conversations and, therefore, inadmissible under \u00a7 10-405.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Stressing that Ms. Miles voluntarily waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights, the majority asserts that any taint emanating from the illegal wiretap was attenuated in two ways. First, the majority states that the taint dissipated when Jona Miles attempted to dispose of the evidence of the crime. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 527-529. Second, the majority asserts that the taint dissipated at the point at which Ms. Miles \u201ctook the Maryland State Police on a guided tour of the locations where she had disposed of evidence.\u201d Id. at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Courts have universally agreed that the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings <em>alone </em>cannot <em>per se, </em>purge the taint of a prior illegality. <em>See Parker, </em>722 F.2d at 186; <em>People v. Hines, </em>195 Colo. 71, 575 P.2d 414, 416 (1978); <em>State v. Abdouch, </em>230 Neb. 929, 434 N.W.2d 317, 328 (1989); <em>State v. Jennings, </em>461 A.2d 361, 368-69 (R.I.1983); <em>Hart, </em>269 S.E.2d at 809; <em>State v. Williams, </em>162 W.Va. 309, 249 S.E.2d 758, 764 (1978). The voluntary waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is but one factor to be considered in assessing attenuation. In fact, the Court\u2019s specific holding in <em>Brown, </em>upon which the majority relies for its finding of attenuation, was that <em>Miranda </em>warnings issued for the purposes of protecting a suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights are not sufficient, in themselves, to purge the taint of a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603, 95 S.Ct. at 2261, 45 L.Ed.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Furthermore, <em>Brown </em>dealt with a situation where the petitioner\u2019s statements to police had been tainted by his illegal arrest. In deciding that question, the Supreme Court devoted a significant portion of the opinion to discussing the distinction between taint analysis under <em>Wong Sun </em>and the Fourth Amendment and voluntariness under <em>Miranda </em>and the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 597-99, 95 S.Ct. at 2258-59, 45 L.Ed.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The majority here makes the same mistake as the Illinois state courts did in <em>Brown</em>\u2014conflating the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statement with the question of whether that statement was the result of prior illegal police conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If anything, the causal connection between a suspect\u2019s statement and illegal police conduct will be stronger when the prior police conduct is an illegal search and seizure, rather than an illegal arrest, because of the inherent pressure to confess generated by a suspect\u2019s being confronted with tangible evidence that is the result of the illegal search. <em>See </em>discussion and cases cited <em>infra </em>pp. 591-596. Any assessment of the voluntariness of the actions of Jona Miles or appellant must take place against the backdrop of their having been confronted with the fruits of the illegally recorded phone conversation and search and seizure resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The majority also asserts that Jona Miles\u2019 actions in disposing of evidence after the taped phone conversation and in leading the police to the locations of the destroyed evidence somehow attenuated the connection between her statements and the illegally wiretapped conversation. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 527-529. This assertion is opaque, at best, and simply begs the question of <em>why </em>Jona Miles made statements to police and led them to the inculpatory evidence. Jona Miles\u2019 conduct was <em>the result of </em>being confronted with the evidence that the police had obtained from the illegally wiretapped conversation. Her attempts to dispose of evidence of the crime, if anything, demonstrate that, had it not been for the illegally obtained telephone conversation that led the police to her, she never would have come forward on her own and cooperated with the investigation, particularly given her own criminal liability as an accessory. Not only does her disposal of evidence not fulfill the State\u2019s burden to prove attenuation of the causal link between the illegal wiretap and subsequently obtained evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>dence, it effectively rebuts it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, the majority concludes that Ms. Miles\u2019 actions following her statements to the police manifested the \u201cuniquely human attributes of perception, memory and volition,\u201d which were sufficient to purge her confession of the taint of the primary illegality. <em>Id. </em>at 526. I fail to see how those characteristics have any bearing on attenuation in that they are utterly irrelevant to the question of whether her statements were the result of the illegally recorded conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s statement to police. The majority stresses that the police never <em>showed </em>any of the illegally-seized evidence gathered prior to Jona Miles\u2019s arrest in questioning appellant. <em>See id. </em>at 535. Nonetheless, the question is not whether the police visually paraded the evidence in front of appellant, but whether they <em>used it </em>during questioning in order to obtain his confession, which they did when they discussed the evidence with him. The majority asserts that \u201c[t]he police never disclosed in questioning appellant the contents of the cellular phone conversation, nor the fact that Jona Miles had given them a statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The mere fact that the police did not disclose to appellant the <em>existence </em>of the illegal wiretap does not mean that his confession was not derived therefrom pursuant to \u00a7 10-405. During the interrogation, the police confronted appellant with evidence that they seized as a result of the illegal wiretap and subsequent search of appellant\u2019s residence, a fact that even the majority does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>deny. The trial court ruled that the search of appellant\u2019s residence was illegal, as the warrant was based on the illegal wiretap, and the State did not appeal that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The excerpts of the police interrogation of appellant demonstrate that the police informed appellant specifically that they had seized the clothes that he purchased with the victim\u2019s Structure credit card (pursuant to the tainted search warrant) and that they had recovered the gun from the river and more clothing from a dumpster (as a result of Jona Miles\u2019 statements, which themselves are derivative of the illegal wiretap):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">[POLICE]: We\u2019ve done a search warrant on your house today. We\u2019ve recovered Structure pants, Structure jeans, Structure shirt that was hidden in Larry\u2019s closet. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">MILES: You\u2019re going to find Structure clothes in -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">[POLICE]: I\u2019m not going to find this brand new Structure shirt that was hid in Larry\u2019s closet. That belongs to you. We\u2019ve recovered a gun from right down here in the river, a little 22 with a long barrel on it. Okay? We\u2019ve recovered clothes from a dumpster right down on 404. So, we\u2019re not in here playing games. You\u2019re a smart person; I\u2019m a smart person. But, I\u2019m here to tell you there\u2019s a reason why everything happens. Okay? What I\u2019m here to ask you is for you to tell us why things happen. I know you killed Edward Joseph Atkinson. Okay, I\u2019m not going to let you sit here and play dumb with you and let you play dumb with me. We\u2019re adult men, it\u2019s time to find out why. I\u2019m not interested in sending you to prison for the rest of your life but I want to know why you killed this man.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The majority attempts to minimize this disclosure by stressing again that the police did not <em>show </em>the seized clothing to appellant. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 535. I simply fail to fathom how informing appellant that they had seized the damning evidence from his home is any more attenuated from the illegal search and seizure than actually placing it in front of him, nor am I aware of cases from any jurisdiction that recognize this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The majority also attempts to minimize the impact of the disclosure by pointing out that, although the clothing was illegally obtained, the police already had receipts from the Structure store itemizing the clothing that had been purchased with the victim\u2019s credit card. <em>See id. </em>at 535-536. This is precisely why the seized evidence, with which police confronted appellant, was so damning. The items seized from appellant\u2019s home, in conjunction with the receipts that the police already had from the Structure store, directly inculpated appellant in the crime. Clearly, any admissions by appellant, in light of this illegally obtained evidence, were not sufficiently attenuated to be purged of the taint of the primary illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">During the interrogation of appellant, the police also referred to his being at the house of certain of his friends when the composite photographs were displayed on the news and to who was present at the time, information specifically obtained from the wiretapped conversation between appellant and Jona Miles. The following conversation transpired between appellant and Jona Miles during their taped cellular telephone call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">MALE VOICE: There\u2019s a mess of cops up here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">FEMALE VOICE: Over where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">MALE VOICE: On the other side of Denton. But, ah, you know, they sat right there, Jim and Kay, and had a face and a picture and looking right dead at it, you know, I was sitting right next to the television so it\u2019s like side by side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">FEMALE VOICE: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">MALE VOICE: And they said it looked like Richard, whoever Richard is. So, you know, it\u2019s sort of iffy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">During the police interrogation of appellant, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">MILES: I was at different people\u2019s houses. I lay a composite at these houses and I\u2019d make sure I was there when the news hit. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">[POLICE]: One of them being Jim McKay [sic]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>MILES: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">[POLICE]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">MILES: And I sat there and, you know, they sat right there and they said it looked like some other guy. They said (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">[POLICE]: Richard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">MILES: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">It is mindboggling how the majority can assert, given this factual record, that the statements of Jona Miles and appellant, as well as the physical evidence derived therefrom, are not the direct result of the illegally wiretapped conversation and the search executed on its basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The majority again appears to confuse derivative evidence attenuation analysis, under the Fourth Amendment and Maryland wiretap statute, and the question of voluntariness under the Fifth Amendment with respect to appellant\u2019s statements to police. The majority emphasizes that appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary and volitional based on his demeanor during the interrogation, the extent of his cooperation with the police, and his personal circumstances of age, knowledge and experience. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 536-538. As we explained <em>swpra, </em>while voluntariness is <em>one </em>factor to be considered under <em>Brown, </em>it is hardly determinative of the question of whether appellant\u2019s statements were derived from the illegally recorded conversation and subsequent search of his residence \u2014 a question that, in my view, is not sufficiently dealt with in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The chronology of events in this case is very similar to those reviewed by the Supreme Court of Nebraska in <em>Abdouch. </em>In that case, the defendant was convicted of manufacturing marijuana after the trial court had suppressed evidence from an illegal search of her residence but admitted her subsequent custodial statements after finding that they were freely and voluntarily made. <em>See Abdouch, </em>434 N.W.2d at 321. The Nebraska Supreme Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, finding that her statements to police were \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d of the illegal police search because the police had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>detailed for her, during their interrogation, the evidence that was seized before the defendant admitted her participation in the marijuana production. <em>See id. </em>at 329. In doing so, the court emphasized the significant differences, for the purposes of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, between a custodial statement resulting from an illegal arrest and one resulting from an illegal search, concluding that, when a suspect is confronted with evidence discovered during an illegal search, there has clearly been an exploitation of the primary illegality because, once the suspect has realized the evidence that the police have seized, that realization plays a significant role in encouraging him or her to confess by demonstrating the futility of remaining silent-because the suspect has, in effect, been \u201ccaught red-handed.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Furthermore, the court made clear that, while giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect is <em>a </em>factor to be considered in attenuation analysis, the warnings alone are not sufficient to break the causal chain between the illegality and subsequent confession, particularly where the primary illegality was an illegal search and seizure. The court noted that the warnings cannot neutralize the inducement to confess that is furnished by confronting the suspect with illegally obtained evidence that demonstrates guilt and the futility of remaining silent. <em>See id. </em>at 328; <em>cf. Pau\u2019u, </em>824 P.2d at 835-36 (holding that the government\u2019s burden to show that a confession is voluntary is particularly heavy when the defendant is under arrest and that the waiver is invalid if it is induced by a prior illegality).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island reached a similar conclusion in <em>Jennings. </em>In that case, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter and possession of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in part on the basis of a detailed confession that he made to police. <em>See Jennings, </em>461 A.2d. at 363. The trial court had suppressed physical evidence taken during an illegal search of the defendant\u2019s apartment, but had admitted the defendant\u2019s subsequent confession that he gave after the police had confronted him with the illegally seized evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 364. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>that his confession had been tainted by the exploitation of the illegal search of his dwelling. <em>See id. </em>at 368. The court held that the exclusionary rule applies \u201cwhen the giving of a statement is induced by confronting a suspect with illegally seized evidence,\u201d unless the state can show attenuation. <em>See id. </em>The court also found that voluntariness was \u201cmerely a threshold requirement,\u201d <em>id., </em>such that giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings alone \u201cdoes not per se make any subsequent statement sufficiently a product of free will to break the causal connection between the confession and the unlawful action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">The record discloses that the confession was made immediately upon defendant\u2019s being confronted with the information that the police had possession of the gun as a result of an illegal search and seizure. There was no time lapse. There were no intervening events to break the causal chain other than the reading of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which does not per se purge the taint of the illegality. Additionally, the use of the product of the illegal police conduct to induce defendant to change his story has the quality of purposefulness which the Fourth Amendment seeks to protect against. A reading of the record reveals that the defendant\u2019s sudden willingness to incriminate himself was the result of his being confronted with the illegally seized evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">We therefore find that the confession was obtained by the exploitation of the illegal search and seizure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 369 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">This case is also similar to <em>Williams, </em>in which the defendant was convicted of first degree murder after the trial court had denied his motion to suppress the victim\u2019s watch, which he alleged had been seized illegally, and all of his inculpatory statements made subsequent to that seizure. <em>See Williams, </em>249 S.E.2d at 760. The Supreme Court of West Virginia reversed his conviction. After finding that the watch had been seized illegally, the court went on to rule that the defendant\u2019s confessions also should have been suppressed because they were induced by the illegally seized evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 764. The court found that the defendant\u2019s first confession was made immediately after being confronted with the victim\u2019s watch and was, therefore, a product of the exploitation of the illegality. <em>See id. </em>The court then found that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of showing that the defendant\u2019s subsequent confessions were not the product of the first. <em>See id. </em>The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">There is no evidence demonstrating a break in the causative link running between the confessions in this case. The State did not meet its burden, and we must presume each confession was the product of the preceding illegalities. The fact that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given prior to each confession is not sufficient standing alone to purge the primary taint of the illegal search and seizure. Had the defendant also been informed that the victim\u2019s watch and his first confession could not be introduced at trial against him in the State\u2019s case in chief, a different outcome might obtain as to the subsequent confessions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Also similar is <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>474 Pa. 512, 379 A.2d 72 (1977), in which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found that a suspect\u2019s statement to police was derivative of an illegal search and should have been suppressed. In that case, the appellant was convicted of rape, conspiracy, and second degree murder after the trial court granted his motion to suppress certain evidence seized by police, but admitted his subsequent inculpatory statement. <em>See id. </em>at 73. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that, since the search of the appellant\u2019s house was illegal, his subsequent statement was inadmissible because the Commonwealth failed to establish that it was sufficiently purged of any taint from the unlawful activity. <em>See id. </em>The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">In this case, the typewritten statement used against appellant at trial was obtained as a direct result of the unlawful search. The police obtained the statement as a result of three factors: (1) appellant\u2019s arrest and the extended custodial interrogation which followed; (2) confrontation of appellant with the fact that evidence had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>obtained during the unlawful search of his house; and (3) confrontation of appellant with information obtained from [his coconspirator].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 76. The court held that the appellant\u2019s custody and arrest were the direct product of the illegal search because the police did not suspect the appellant until after the search was conducted and because evidence found in the illegal search formed the basis for probable cause to arrest him. <em>See id. </em>The court found that the appellant\u2019s incriminating statements were derivative of the illegal search because they were obtained after he was confronted with evidence found during the illegal search. <em>See id. </em>Finally, the court found that the appellant\u2019s statements were also derivative of the illegal search because they were made after he was confronted with information given to the police by his coconspirator, which in turn was the result of the illegal search. <em>See id. </em>at 77. Clearly, the same analysis applies almost verbatim to the case at bar. <em>Cf. United States v. Johns, </em>891 F.2d 243, 245-46 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that attenuation is a question of the substantiality of the taint-if the role of the illegality is insubstantial, then suppression is inappropriate, but if the illegality is \u201cthe impetus for the chain of events\u201d leading to the derivative evidence, then it is \u201ctoo closely and inextricably linked to the discovery for the taint to have dissipated\u201d); <em>United States v. Cales, </em>493 F.2d 1215, 1215-16 (9th Cir.1974) (holding that derivative evidence must be suppressed if an illegal wiretap tended \u201csignificantly to direct the investigation toward the specific evidence sought to be suppressed\u201d); <em>Amador-Gonzalez v. United States, </em>391 F.2d 308, 318 (5th Cir.1968) (holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was the direct result of the illegal discovery of narcotics and that the taint of the illegally seized evidence had not been removed); <em>United States v. Schipani, </em>289 F.Supp. 43, 62 (E.D.N.Y.1968), <em>aff'd, </em>414 F.2d 1262 (2nd Cir.1969) (\u201cIf illegally secured information leads the government to substantially intensify an investigation, all evidence subsequently uncovered has automatically \u2018been come at by exploitation of that illegality.\u2019 The unlawful search has set in motion the chain of events leading to the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>evidence.\u201d); <em>State v. Blair, </em>691 S.W.2d 259, 263 (Mo.1985) (holding that the defendant\u2019s palm and finger prints and statements were properly suppressed because they resulted from an unlawful arrest and search).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The majority relies upon <em>United States v. Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. 268, 98 S.Ct. 1054, 55 L.Ed.2d 268 (1978), as support for the proposition that the link between the illegal wiretap and the evidence obtained from Jona Miles and appellant was sufficiently attenuated. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 522-527. In fact, citing <em>Ceccolini, </em>the majority asserts that \u201cthe voluntariness of a person\u2019s actions in providing evidence or testimony should be considered as an intervening factor under the attenuation doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Ceccolini </em>is misplaced. The Supreme Court in <em>Ceccolini </em>found that there was sufficient attenuation between an illegal search and the live testimony of a witness at trial, <em>see Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 273, 98 S.Ct. at 1058-59, 55 L.Ed.2d 268, but did so because it found that the evidence indicated \u201coverwhelmingly that the testimony given by the witness was an act of her own free will in no way coerced or even induced by official authority\u201d as a result of the illegal search. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 98 S.Ct. at 1062, 55 L.Ed.2d 268. Most significantly, in reaching that conclusion, the Court specifically emphasized that the illegally obtained evidence was not used in questioning the witness. Moreover, substantial periods of time elapsed between the time of the illegal search and the initial contact witness and the testimony at trial; the witness\u2019s identity and her relationship to the defendant were well known to the investigators prior to the illegal search; and the police did not conduct the illegal search and seizure with the intent of finding a witness to testify against the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 279-80, 98 S.Ct. at 1062, 55 L.Ed.2d 268. Clearly, none of those factors outlined by the Supreme Court exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Furthermore, <em>Ceccolini </em>deals with the application of the attenuation doctrine to live-witness testimony at trial. The exploitation of the illegal search in this case led the police not merely to the live-witness <em>testimony </em>of a particular witness, but to appellant\u2019s identity, the identity of an accessory (Jona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Miles), the murder weapon, and other physical evidence. In fact, the <em>Ceccolini </em>analysis is informed by the degree of free will exercised by the witness in testifying. The Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe greater the willingness of the witness to freely testify, the greater the likelihood that he or she will be discovered by legal means. Witnesses are not like guns or documents which remain hidden from view until one turns over a sofa or opens a filing cabinet.\u201d <em>Ceccolini, </em>485 U.S. at 276, 98 S.Ct. at 1060, 55 L.Ed.2d 268. The question of whether Jona Miles could have testified, had the trial judge suppressed all of the derivative evidence (including her statement to police), is the only question on which <em>Ceccolini </em>would shed light.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">This rationale was shared by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Ramirez-Sandoval, </em>872 F.2d 1392, 1396 (9th Cir.1989). In that case, the United States District Court suppressed physical evidence and contemporary statements discovered as the result of an illegal search, but permitted witness testimony regarding identification of the defendants and their illegal immigration scheme pursuant to the inevitable discovery doctrine. <em>See id. </em>at 1394. Citing <em>Ceccolini, </em>the Court of Appeals ruled that the testimony should not have been admitted, either on the basis of the attenuation doctrine or inevitable discovery. <em>See id. </em>at 1396. With respect to attenuation, the court found that the testimony had been induced by the illegal search. <em>See id. </em>at 1397. The court distinguished <em>Ceccolini </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">This case is unlike <em>Ceccolini. </em>First, the illegally obtained documentary evidence was clearly used by Officer Torres in questioning the witnesses. Second, no time elapsed between the illegal search and the initial questioning of the witnesses. Third, the identities of the witnesses were not known to those investigating the case. In all likelihood, the police and the INS would never have discovered these witnesses except for Torres\u2019 illegal search. Finally, although the testimony was voluntary in the sense that it was not coerced, it is not likely that these witnesses would have come forward of their own volition to inform officials that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>they were illegally transported into the country by the appellant. It seems clear that their testimony was induced by official authority as a result of the illegal search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Clearly, all four of the distinguishing factors identified by the Court of Appeals (use of the illegally obtained evidence in questioning, lack of time lapse, discovery of the identity of witnesses solely by means of the illegal search, and no independent reason to come forward) exist just as strongly in the case of Jona Miles\u2019s and appellant\u2019s statements to police. <em>See United States v. Rubalcava-Montoya, </em>597 F.2d 140, 143 (9th Cir.1979) (holding that, under <em>Ceccolini, </em>since there was no evidence in the record that the prosecution witnesses made an independent decision to come forward and since they were discovered as a direct result of an illegal search, the government failed to rebut the logical inference that the search induced their testimony); <em>United States v. Marder, </em>474 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.1973) (holding that \u201cif the identity of a government witness and his relationship to the defendant are revealed because of an illegal search and seizure, the testimony of such witness must be excluded\u201d unless the government can show an independent source or attenuation, including the consideration of whether the witness would have come forward on her own); <em>United States v. Tane, </em>329 F.2d 848, 853 (2nd Cir.1964) (holding that the grand jury testimony of the defendant\u2019s coconspirator was derivative of an illegal wiretap because the witness\u2019s identity was derived from the wiretap, the witness was unwilling to testify or inculpate himself until the wiretap conversation was revealed, and the government did not show attenuation sufficient to break the nexus between the tap and the testimony); <em>Cephas, </em>291 A.2d at 111 (\u201cThe primary question ... is not whether the witness voluntarily plead guilty and testified, rather it is <em>why </em>she chose to do this.... [TJhese choices on her part flowed directly from the exploitation of the search and thus the taint remains.... For the police to conduct an illegal search during which they discover physical evidence and a witness ..., and for a court to suppress the physical evidence but not the witness would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>seemingly be allowing the authorities to do indirectly what they cannot do directly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The State has failed to meet its burden of showing that the taint of the prior illegal wiretap and illegal search had been dissipated or that there was an independent source for the evidence. Accordingly, I would reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress all of the evidence derived from the illegal wiretap of his cellular telephone conversation, including the evidence obtained from Jona Miles and appellant\u2019s statement to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge ELDRIDGE join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. The majority seems to flirt with either independent source or inevitable discovery analysis, without explicitly doing so, by arguing that the police had other investigatory leads directing them to appellant, <em>see </em>maj. op. at 536-537, and by describing Jona Miles\u2019s cooperation as voluntary assistance. <em>See id. </em>at 527-530. Nonetheless, the State has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating either that the evidence used to convict appellant was derived from a source independent of the primary illegality in this case or that the evidence used at appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>trial would have been discovered absent the illegally taped telephone conversation and subsequent search warrant. The majority's allegation that \u201cthe police had already physically identified their suspect,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 526 n. 11, merely because they had a physical description of a person who had been seen near the crime scene during the police investigation, is a far cry from the proof necessary to make the derivative evidence resulting from the illegal seizures in this case admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\">. The majority accuses this dissent of verging \u201con a traditional tort analysis of proximate cause....\u201d Maj. op. at 538. We agree that the attenuation doctrine does not require a strict but \u2014 for test of causation. Nonetheless, in determining the admissibility of derivative evidence under the Maryland wiretap statute, courts are guided by the statutory exclusionary command that no evidence \u201cderived from\u201d any intercepted communication may be received in evidence. See \u00a7 10-405. Under the attenuation doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the question of whether evidence <em>derives from </em>an illegally intercepted transmission is a question of <em>causation. See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>pp. 503- 505.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">. In fact, the Maryland General Assembly acquiesced in this Court's broad interpretation of \u00a7 10-405 when it amended the enumerated offenses of \u00a7 10-402 and \u00a7 10-406 of the Maryland wiretap statute in 2000, after this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Mustafa v.

State, </em>357 Md. 37, 741 A.2d 1162 (1999), but did not amend the exclusionary provision of \u00a7 10-405. <em>See </em>2000 Maryland Laws ch. 288, at 1690-91 (codified as amended at Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 10-402, 10-406 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b615-19\">. Although the reference to \u201cBecky\u201d may seem to be innocuous, it is the effect of being confronted with the contents of the illegally taped telephone conversation that creates the sense of the futility of noncooperation in the suspect, independent of the incriminating nature of those contents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">. In fact, the majority notes that the police did not coerce Ms. Miles, offer her leniency, or compel her to lead them to evidence. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 527. These questions, while crucial to determining whether her statement was voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, are insufficient to establish attenuation of the violation of her statutory privacy rights under the Maryland wiretap statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. Attempting to dispute the claim that the record excerpts establish that Ms. Miles\u2019 conduct was the result of being confronted with the illegally obtained evidence, the majority points out that the excerpts of the taped phone conversation contain no references to the Structure store at the Dover Mall, the murder weapon, or the Choptank River, \u201call of which were facts that came to be know to the police through their independent investigation.\u201d Maj. op. at 529. Again, the majority here appears to be engaging in independent source analysis without explicitly stating so. More importantly, for the purpose of attenuation doctrine, the police, in fact, did <em>not </em>come to discover the murder weapon in the Choptank River through \"independent investigation,\u201d but rather <em>solely </em>as the result of Ms. Miles\u2019 statements to them. Were it not for the illegally wiretapped conversation and the subsequent use thereof by police, there would have been no evidence linking appellant to the murder in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
