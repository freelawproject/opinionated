Part of that legend, added some 600 years after the event, was that one person in the town, a tailor named Tom, had the temerity to glance upon the noblewoman as she proceeded on her mission and was immediately struck either blind or dead. This probably-mythical tailor became known to history as Peeping Tom.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">This case involves another peeping Tom \u2014 petitioner Thomas Deibler. Deibler gazed not upon a woman on horseback, but upon a woman taking a shower. By use of a camera with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>audio accompaniment that he hid in the bathroom of his friend\u2019s home, he surreptitiously spied upon his friend\u2019s aunt as she took a shower and otherwise used the bathroom. Unlike Tom the tailor, Deibler was struck neither blind'nor dead for his inexcusable breach of common decency. He was, however, convicted in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of violating the Maryland Wiretap Law (Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-402(a)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article). For subsequent conduct, he was convicted as well of violating Article 27, \u00a7 555A(2) of the Code, which prohibits the making of repeated telephone calls with the intent to annoy or harass.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The issue arising from his conviction for telephone misuse is fact-based and rather straightforward. The question emanating from the wiretap conviction is a legal one we have not previously addressed. Section 10-402(a)(l) makes it unlawful for a person <em>wilfully </em>to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether willfulness, for purposes of \u00a7 10-402(a)(l), requires knowledge on the part of the defendant that his or her action is unlawful\u2014 that it is prohibited by the statute. Our answer is that it does not so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On June 19, 1999, Deibler was at the home of his friend, Scott Bagdasian, helping Scott and his grandfather prepare the family boat for the summer. Scott\u2019s aunt, Mary, was also at the home. At some point, Ms. Bagdasian took a shower in her parents\u2019 main bathroom. When she finished, she noticed a book of matches lying underneath a basket of wash cloths on the sink and, upon removing them for fear that they might fall into the hands of small children in the house, observed some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>wires going into and out of the towel basket. In the basket itself, she discovered a black box to which the wires were attached. Ms. Bagdasian did not know what the item was and examined it several times. After dressing, she called her father into the bathroom and, together, they examined the box. Noticing that the wires ran behind the splash panel of the sink, she opened the drawers of the sink cabinet and, in one of them, found a video camera. Unable to view the tape in the camera because the battery was dead, Ms. Bagdasian removed the entire apparatus. She was able later to watch the tape and saw that it revealed her going to the bathroom, taking a shower, and drying herself, as well as her father and her examining the box. The tape also recorded the conversation she and her father had.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Ms. Bagdasian and her father testified that they had not given permission to anyone, including Deibler, to place the camera in the bathroom or to record any conversation. She said that, upon watching the tape, she became aware that Deibler had placed the camera, \u201cbecause he videotaped himself setting it up.\u201d When Deibler came back into the house and entered the bathroom, Ms. Bagdasian listened at the door and heard him \u201crouting [sic] through the drawers.\u201d When he came out, \u201che was kind of turning in circles and as white as a ghost, because he knew that the camera was gone.\u201d Ms. Bagdasian turned the tape over to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Deibler stipulated at trial that his countenance and his voice were, indeed, on the tape and that \u201che did place that tape in the bathroom.\u201d The tape was played at trial, and the court announced that it was able to hear \u201ca snippet\u201d of conversation. Defense counsel acknowledged that he, too, could hear voices on the tape and that Deibler \u201cdoes not deny that there are voices on there.\u201d Ms. Bagdasian testified that she was able to ascertain from the tape the conversation she had with her father in the bathroom, and she identified the voices on the tape as those of her father and herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>David Cordle, the chief criminal investigator for the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, stated that, in response to Ms. Bagdasian\u2019s complaint, he met with her and watched and listened to the tape. After some background investigation, he obtained a search warrant for Deibler\u2019s home and, in execution of the warrant, observed and seized a considerable amount of video, recording, and other electronic equipment. Cordle then contacted Deibler who, in a subsequent conversation, acknowledged that the equipment found in the Bagdasian bathroom was his and that this was essentially \u201cvoyeurism taken a step too far.\u201d Cordle demonstrated and explained in court that, in order to record sound, an audio wire had to be plugged into the video device.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">For reasons not clearly explained in the record before us, Cordle investigated other possible surreptitious filming of women by Deibler and spoke to some of them. About three weeks after his initial conversation with Deibler, upon returning from vacation, Cordle found three messages on his telephone voice mail, all of which, it was stipulated, were from Deibler. The first message was very brief. Deibler said that Cordle had made it \u201cpersonal.\u201d That was followed by the sound of Deibler cocking an automatic weapon and the closing comment, \u201cLater.\u201d With respect to the sound of a weapon, Deibler stipulated at trial \u201cthat he did in fact do that. He did go like that with his weapon.\u201d Cordle testified that the message put him in fear that \u201csomeone was going to try to harm myself or my family.\u201d In the second message, Deibler complained that Cordle was \u201ctalking to people you had no business talking to for any reason,\u201d that Deibler did not \u201cappreciate that,\u201d that he felt it was \u201cway out of line,\u201d and that it was \u201creally starting to piss me off.\u201d In the midst of some obscenities, Deibler threatened to get an attorney \u201cand go after you.\u201d The third message stressed Deibler\u2019s view that Cordle had no case against him. None of the evidence seized, he asserted, was incriminating, and the tape found in the Bagdasian home did not constitute a violation of the wiretap law, in his opinion, because the Bagdasians were aware of the camera before they began speaking, indicating knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>their conversation was being recorded. Deibler added in the third message an accusation that Cordle had \u201chit on\u201d one of Deibler\u2019s friends, who would be prepared to testify in court to the harassment, and he asked that Cordle call him. Cordle stated that the three messages could have been left at any time on July 28, 29, or 30, 1999. One final call was made by Deibler, in which he left his cell phone number on Gordie\u2019s pager.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">After listening to the four messages, Cordle called Deibler at home but, unable to reach him, left a message on his voice mail that Cordle wanted the calls to stop and that, if they did not, he might file additional charges against Deibler. No further calls were made to Cordle thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On this evidence, the court, sitting without a jury, convicted Deibler of violating \u00a7 10-402(a)(l), by willfully intercepting an oral communication, and of Article 27, \u00a7 555A(2), by making repeated telephone calls to Cordle with the intent to annoy or harass him. Upon those convictions, Deibler was sentenced to an aggregate of five years in prison, with all but six months suspended, the six months to be served in home detention. Deibler appealed, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>on our own initiative, before any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, to consider whether (1) the element of willfulness in \u00a7 10-402(a) requires knowledge on the part of the defendant that his conduct was unlawful, (2) Mr. and Ms. Bagdasian had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their intercepted conversation when (allegedly) it occurred after they discovered the recording device, and (3) the trial court erred in concluding that the three calls made to Cordle constituted a pattern of repeated calls with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">\n<em>The Wiretap Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-402(a)(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article makes it unlawful for any person to \u201c[wjilfully intercept ... any wire, oral, or electronic communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>cation.\u201d As we noted in <em>Perry v. State, supra, </em>357 Md. at 64, 741 A.2d at 1177, the violation of that provision carries both criminal and civil sanctions\u2014 \u00a7 10-402(b) makes the violation a felony; \u00a7 10-410(a) creates a civil cause of action against the perpetrator; and \u00a7 10-405 makes the product of the unlawful interception inadmissible in evidence against the victim of the interception. Although the Court of Special Appeals has interpreted the element of willfulness as requiring that the interceptor know that his or her conduct is unlawful, <em>see Hawes v. Carberry, </em>103 Md.App. 214, 222, 653 A.2d 479, 483 (1995) and <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland, </em>104 Md.App. 1, 23-24, 655 A.2d 1, 11-12 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>342 Md. 363, 676 A.2d 65 (1996), we have not previously addressed the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">A computer search reveals that the word \u201cwillful,\u201d in one form or another, appears 547 times in the Maryland Constitution, Code, and Rules in a variety of contexts. As the Supreme Court has noted, it \u201cis a \u2018word of many meanings,\u2019 and \u2018its construction [is] often ... influenced by its context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 141, 114 S.Ct. 655, 659, 126 L.Ed.2d 615, 622 (1994) (quoting from <em>Spies v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 492, 497, 63 S.Ct. 364, 367, 87 L.Ed. 418, 422 (1943)). Perkins and Boyce agree, observing that, as used in criminal statutes, the word has been construed to mean \u201conly intentionally or purposely as distinguished from accidentally or negligently and does not require any actual impropriety,\u201d but that it has also been held to require \u201ca bad purpose or evil intent.\u201d R. Perkins and R. Boyce, Criminal Law 875-76 (3d ed.1982). <em>See also </em>S. Brogan, <em>An Analysis of the Term \u201cWillful\u201d in Federal Criminal Statutes, </em>51 Notre Dame Lawyer 786 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Brogan notes that the term, as used in Federal criminal statutes, \u201chas defied any consistent interpretation by the courts, while legislatures have similarly neglected to clearly define its meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. He points out that \u201cwillful\u201d has received four different constructions from the courts. The first, and most restrictive, is that an act is willful only if it is done with a bad purpose or evil motive \u2014 deliberately to violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the law. A second interpretation considers an act to be willful \u201cif it is done with an intent to commit the act and with a knowledge that the act is in violation of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787. That construction does not require that the defendant possess a sinister motivation, but, like the first interpretation, it does require knowledge that the act is unlawful. The third interpretation \u201crequires only that the act be committed voluntarily and intentionally as opposed to one that is committed through inadvertence, accident, or ordinary negligence.\u201d Under that approach, \u201c[a]s long as there is an intent to commit the act, there can be a finding of willfulness even though the actor was consciously attempting to comply with the law and was acting with the good faith belief that the action was lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>What is required is \u201can objective intent to commit the act but not necessarily a knowledge that the act will bring about the illegal result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, Brogan notes that some courts have gone so far as to find an act willful even though it was not committed intentionally, but through oversight, inadvertence, or negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The United States Senate Judiciary Committee has recognized the bewildering array of definitions given to the term as used in Title 18 of the U.S.Code. In Senate Report No. 307 (97th Congress, 1st Session, 1982), filed in connection with the proposed Criminal Code Reform Act of 1981, the Committee concluded that judicial construction of \u201cwillful\u201d has been \u201coften inconsistent and contradictory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64. It noted that the courts had defined a \u201cwillful\u201d act as \u201can act done voluntarily as distinguished from accidentally, an act done with specific intent to violate the law, an act done with bad purpose, an act done without justifiable excuse, an act done stubbornly, an act done without grounds for believing it is lawful, and an act done with careless disregard whether or not one has the right so to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Committee recommended eliminating the word from the Federal Criminal Code. <em>Id </em>at 65.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>We too have construed \u201cwillful\u201d in several different ways. In <em>Ewell v. State, </em>207 Md. 288, 299, 114 A.2d 66, 72 (1955), we noted that \u201c[t]he term \u2018willfully\u2019 in criminal statutes has been said \u2018... to characterize an act done with deliberate intention for which there is no reasonable excuse ... \u2019 \u201d (quoting in part from <em>Rosenberg v. State, </em>164 Md. 473, 476, 165 A. 306, 307 (1933)). <em>Ewell </em>involved a prosecution for criminal non-support, and we held that, to sustain the conviction, there must be evidence that the defendant \u201cintentionally refused to support his wife, although he had the capacity to do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">For purposes of the perjury law \u2014 willfully making a false oath or affirmation-we said that, \u201c[t]o be willful, the false oath must be deliberate and not the result of surprise, confusion, or bona fide mistake.\u201d <em>State v. Devers and Webster, </em>260 Md. 360, 372, 272 A.2d 794, 800, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 824, 92 S.Ct. 50, 30 L.Ed.2d 52 (1971). With respect to the arson law, which made it unlawful to \u201cwillfully and maliciously\u201d set fire to certain structures, we distinguished \u201cmaliciously\u201d from \u201cwillfully\u201d and held that the latter was \u201ccommonly interpreted as meaning \u2018intentionally,\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. 469, 475, 403 A.2d 788, 792 (1979), or as requiring a \u201cdeliberate intention to injure the property of another.\u201d <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 68, 512 A.2d 358, 369 (1986). In <em>McBurney v. State, </em>280 Md. 21, 29, 371 A.2d 129, 134 (1977), we observed that \u201cwillfully\u201d could connote either \u201cintentionally or purposely as distinguished from accidentally or negligently\u201d or \u201csomething more \u2014 that the acts were done with an actual impropriety, that is with a bad purpose or without justifiable excuse.\u201d The prosecution was of an attorney for willfully violating a statute precluding attorneys from co-mingling client funds and using them for an unauthorized purpose. We concluded that the element of willfulness did not make the offenses specific intent crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and that \u201c[a] practical effect of the requirement of a \u2018wilful\u2019 violation as a condition for conviction is to remove the offenses beyond any doubt from being considered as <em>malum 'prohibitum </em>which would dispense with the necessity for even a general criminal intent so that the mere fact of the commission of the prohibited acts would support a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29 n. 6, 371 A.2d at 134 n. 6. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 482-83, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In attorney grievance matters based on the willful failure to file tax returns, we have defined willfulness in the context of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 to be the \u201cvoluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty\u201d not requiring a deceitful or fraudulent motive. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 309, 635 A.2d 382, 387 (1994); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176, 191, 711 A.2d 193, 200 (1998). A \u201cwilful violation\u201d of the insurance law, we said in <em>Nuger v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>238 Md. 55, 67, 207 A.2d 619, 625 (1965), means \u201can intentional act of omission or commission.\u201d The element of willfulness in the crime of murder requires \u201ca specific purpose and design to kill.\u201d <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Most of these interpretations, although not all, have been consistent with the third approach noted by Brogan \u2014 requiring only that the act be committed intentionally, rather than through inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">When construing a statutory tem, of course, we need to give it the contextual meaning most probably intended by the Legislature, and, if the term is not susceptible to a single common meaning, we must look at relevant legislative history in an attempt to discern that intent. We have pointed out many times that, notwithstanding some important additional protections included in the Maryland wiretap law, our law generally \u201cis modeled upon the federal act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, and extensively tracks its provisions.\u201d <em>Wood v. State, </em>290 Md. 579, 583, 431 A.2d 93, 95 (1981); <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 69, 591 A.2d 481, 483 (1991). In particular, \u00a7 10-402(a)(1), making it unlawful for any person willfully to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cept, endeavor to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept any wire communications, is almost identical to the version of \u00a7 2511(1) of the Federal Act that was in effect in 1977, when \u00a7 10-402 was enacted. We may look, then, to see how that version of the Federal Act has been interpreted. <em>Kassap v. Seitz, </em>315 Md. 155, 553 A.2d 714 (1989); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 537 A.2d 612, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 832, 109 S.Ct. 90, 102 L.Ed.2d 66 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Notwithstanding the considerable legislative history of the Federal wiretap law, enacted as Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, scant attention appears to have been given by Congress to the use of the word \u201cwillfully.\u201d The only reported reference to the term is in Senate Judiciary Committee Report No. 1097, at 93, where the Committee simply noted the requirement that a violation of \u00a7 2511(1) be \u201cwillful to be criminal\u201d and cited, in parenthesis and without explanation, <em>United States v. Murdock, </em>290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933). <em>Murdock </em>involved the prosecution of a taxpayer for refusing to give testimony concerning certain deductions on his tax return. Such refusal was punishable only if \u201cwillful,\u201d and the Court was called upon to determine whether a refusal based on a subjective good faith belief that the answers might tend to incriminate the defendant was \u201cwillful.\u201d In that context, the Court noted that the word \u201coften denotes an act which is intentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental,\u201d but that, when used in a criminal statute, \u201cit generally means an act done with a bad purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 54 S.Ct. at 225, 78 L.Ed. at 385. The Court went on to observe that the word \u201cis also employed to characterize a thing done without ground for believing that it is lawful,\u201d or conduct \u201cmarked by careless disregard whether or not one has the right to so act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394-95, 54 S.Ct. at 225, 78 L.Ed. at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Although the Senate Committee\u2019s focus was on the word in a criminal context, a violation of \u00a7 2511(1) also entails civil liability, and, as noted, the courts have concluded that the word \u201cwillfully\u201d means the same for both purposes. <em>See Citron v. Citron, </em>722 F.2d 14, 16 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>466 U.S. 973, 104 S.Ct. 2350, 80 L.Ed.2d 823 (1984); <em>Malouche v. JH Management Co., Inc., </em>839 F.2d 1024, 1025-26 (4th Cir.1988). The <em>Citron </em>court, noting the Senate Committee\u2019s reference to <em>Murdock, </em>held that the word \u201cwillfully\u201d denoted \u201cat least a voluntary, intentional violation of, and perhaps a reckless disregard of, a known legal duty.\u201d <em>Citron, </em>722 F.2d at 16. The <em>Malouche </em>court reached the same conclusion, determining that the plaintiff in a civil action under the Act was required to establish \u201can intentional or reckless disregard of its legal obligations\u201d by the defendant. <em>Malouche, </em>839 F.2d at 1026. <em>See also Benford v. American Broadcasting Co., </em>649 F.Supp. 9, 10 (D.Md.1986). As noted, the Court of Special Appeals has adopted a similar view. <em>See Hawes v. Carberry, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 222, 653 A.2d at 483; <em>Fearnow v. Chesapeake Telephone, supra, </em>104 Md.App. at 23-24, 655 A.2d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Notwithstanding these decisions, there is significant evidence that Congress did <em>not </em>intend the word \u201cwillfully,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2511, to have such a restrictive meaning-to require that the person intercepting a communication know that his or her conduct was unlawful, or that the person act with reckless disregard of whether the conduct was lawful, or that the interception be made for an improper motive or bad purpose. An early clue appears in an article written by one of the principal draftsmen of the Federal law, Professor G. Robert Blakey, of the Notre Dame Law School. In <em>A Proposed Electronic Surveillance Control Act, </em>43 Notre Dame Lawyer 657, 666 (1968), Professor Blakey also cites <em>Murdock </em>in noting that violations must be willful but concludes only that \u201cgood faith mistakes under the statute will not be subject to criminal sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In 1986, Congress decided that the word was too amorphous and replaced it throughout the wiretap law with the word \u201cintentionally.\u201d Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-508. The House version of the bill, which made many other changes to the law, kept the term \u201cwillfully,\u201d but the House Judiciary Committee made clear that it did not intend for the word to have too restrictive a meaning. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>House Report 99-647 (90th Congress, 2d Session, accompanying HR4952), the Judiciary Committee, citing Brogan\u2019s article in 51 Notre Dame Lawyer, noted that the courts had construed \u201cand misconstrued\u201d the term and declared its intent that it \u201chave the same meaning as the term intentional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. The term \u201cintentional,\u201d it said, \u201cdoes not require that the act was committed for a particular purpose or motive,\u201d and, by retaining the term \u201cwillful,\u201d the Committee \u201cprecludes the application of civil or criminal liability for acts of inadvertent interception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. The Senate decided to eliminate the word altogether, and its decision ultimately prevailed. Its intent was clearly expressed: \u201cThe purpose of this amendment is to underscore that inadvertent interceptions are not crimes under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act [the Act that made the amendments to \u00a7 2511].\u201d Senate Report 99-541 at 23, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1986, 3555 at 3577. The Senate reverted to the views expressed five years earlier in connection with the proposed Criminal Code Reform Act of 1981: \u201cA common means to describe conduct as intentional, or to say that one causes the result intentionally, is to say that it is done or accomplished \u2018on purpose.\u2019 \u201d Senate Report 99-541 at 23, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1986 at 3577 (quoting from House Report 97-307, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In <em>Earley v. Smoot, </em>846 F.Supp. 451, 453 (D.Md.1994), the court regarded the 1986 amendment as \u201cdiluting] the standard of proof from wilfulness to mere intent, after holdings that the wilfulness standard required proof of knowledge of the unlawfulness of the interception.\u201d Under the \u201cintent\u201d standard, the court concluded that liability could be imposed under \u00a7 2511(1)(a) \u201cmerely for intentional \u2014 in the traditional sense of purposeful \u2014 conduct, without a showing of disregard of a known legal duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It held that \u201ca defendant who actually intercepts a conversation in a prohibited fashion need not be proved to have known his conduct was illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the second conclusion as to what is required, but we are inclined to the view that, by substituting the word \u201cintentional\u201d for \u201cwilful,\u201d Congress was not intending to \u201cdilute\u201d the standard as much as to return it to what Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>initially had in mind. We draw from the various Senate and House Reports quoted above a belief on the part of Congress that some of the Federal courts had misconstrued the legislative intent, principally from the cryptic reference in Senate Report 1097 to the <em>Murdock </em>case, and that its intent could be made more clear if it simply eliminated the word \u201cwillful,\u201d which was the source of the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As we indicated, this moderate conception of the required mental state \u2014 purposeful conduct, requiring neither a bad motive nor knowing unlawfulness \u2014 comports, for the most part, with how we have defined \u201cwillful,\u201d as the term is used in other Maryland criminal statutes. It is a sensible and appropriate definition, given its application not only to criminal prosecutions under \u00a7 10-402(b), but also to civil liability under \u00a7 10-410 and suppression motions under \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2014 408(i) and 10-405. We hold, therefore, that, for purposes of \u00a7 10-402(a), and thus for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 10-405, 10-408(i), and 10-410, an interception that is not otherwise specifically authorized is done willfully if it is done intentionally-purposely. That excludes interceptions arising from inadvertence or simple negligence, which may occur in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It was never in dispute that Deibler placed the recording device, with an audio attachment, into the Bagdasian bathroom deliberately and intentionally. There was not even a hint of inadvertence in his doing so. The question, then, is whether the evidence sufficed to show that he intended to intercept an oral communication. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that the wiretap law prohibits the interception only of wire, oral, or electronic communications, as those terms are defined in \u00a7 10-401. Clearly, there was no interception of a wire or electronic communication here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion 10-401(2) defines an \u201coral communication\u201d as \u201cany conversation or words spoken to or by any person in private conversation.\u201d Ordinarily, the interception of such a conversation anticipates an aural interception \u2014 hearing the conversation directly or making a recording of it that can be listened to simultaneously or at a later time, and thus, in <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 537 A.2d 612 (1988), we held that a video surveillance, though in many respects a greater intrusion on privacy than an audio surveillance, was not prohibited by \u00a7 10-402.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The unlawfulness in this case thus hinges on Deibler\u2019s interception of the words spoken by Mary Bagdasian and her father, through the audio recording attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Deibler does not contest that the audio recording attachment was intentionally and deliberately installed for the purpose of intercepting any sounds emanating from the bathroom. His point is that no words or conversation were uttered by the Bagdasians until <em>after </em>they had discovered the hidden equipment, that they were therefore on notice that their conversation was being recorded, and that, accordingly, they could have no legitimate expectation of privacy with respect to that conversation. Deibler made that argument to Cordle in one of his telephone messages, and he makes it again to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Deibler\u2019s argument fails in this case because it is not supported by the facts. When Ms. Bagdasian discovered the black box, she did not know what it was; nor did her father when he first examined it. The conversation that was recorded \u2014 at least part of the conversation recorded \u2014 involved the two discussing what the item was. Not until Ms. Bagdasian opened the cabinet drawer and saw the camera itself did she realize that someone had been videotaping her, and not until she actually played the tape in her friend\u2019s VCR did she realize that her voice had been recorded. Mr. Bagdasian gave similar testimony. He did not know when he first observed the device that he was being recorded: \u201cAt that particular time I didn\u2019t know what it was, at first. We \u2014 my daughter asked me if I knew anything about it, or what it was all about, and I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On this record, it is clear that Deibler intentionally and deliberately intercepted an oral communication in violation of \u00a7 10-402, and that his conviction under that section is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\n<em>Telephone Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Maryland Code, Article 27, \u00a7 555A makes it unlawful for a person to make use of telephone facilities or equipment for certain anonymous calls, for certain obscene calls, and \u201cfor repeated calls, if with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass one or more persons.\u201d We are concerned here with the quoted part, which requires proof of three things: criminal agency \u2014 that the defendant made the calls; that there were \u201crepeated calls\u201d; and that the calls were made with one of the requisite intents.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Criminal agency has been conceded, and Deibler does not directly contest that three calls (or four, if the one leaving his cell phone number is counted) may qualify as \u201crepeated.\u201d He concedes as well that the first call, in which the sound of an automatic weapon being cocked was recorded, suffices as being with the intent to annoy or harass. His argument is that, given that there were only three calls made within a short period of time to a public official, that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>direct conversation but only a voice-mail message, and that only the first call could be regarded as made with the intent to annoy or harass, there was insufficient evidence to show a violation of the statute. He cannot properly be convicted, he avers, on the basis of just one annoying or harassing call. He is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Statutes like \u00a7 555A have been enacted by Congress and by many States. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223, prohibiting obscene or harassing telephone calls in the District of Columbia and in interstate or foreign commerce; <em>see also Validity, Construction, and Application of State Criminal Statute Forbidding Use of Telephone to Annoy or Harass, </em>95 A.L.R.3d 411 (1979 and 2001 Supp.). As might be expected, the cases arising under these statutes have involved a variety of fact patterns which, together with variations in the wording of the statutes, account for decisions affirming or reversing particular convictions. Courts have looked, among other things, to the number of calls, when during the day or night they were made, the period during which the calls were made, whether the calls were clustered or strung out over a period of time, the relationship between the caller and the victim, the nature and content of any message imparted during the calls, whether the caller remained anonymous, and, though not controlling, the effect of the calls on the victim, in determining the caller\u2019s intent. <em>See, </em>in Maryland, <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 94, 337 A.2d 476 (1975); <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 271, 356 A.2d 277 (1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>279 Md. 255, 368 A.2d 468 (1977); <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 517, 387 A.2d 306, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 740 (1978); <em>see also </em>cases reviewed in the A.L.R. annotation cited above, 95 A.L.R.3d 411 (1979 and 2001 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">We have found no case quite like the one before us in which a conviction has been sustained. The second and third calls were, in some respects, intemperate, but they really relayed nothing more than Deibler\u2019s concern and frustration over Cordle\u2019s investigation. The only threat made was to take legal action, and, when Cordle demanded that the calls cease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>they did. We do not believe that the three calls made in this case sufficiently evidenced any of the requisite intents.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">JUDGMENT ON CRIMINAL INFORMATION K-1999-1480 (WIRETAP) AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT ON CRIMINAL INFORMATION K-1999-1479 (TELEPHONE ABUSE) REVERSED; COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANT AND ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">HARRELL, J., dissents and files opinion in which BELL, C.J. and BATTAGLIA, J. concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">.

The proposed legislation would have reduced from 78 to four the mental states for criminal culpability \u2014 intentional, knowing, reckless, and negligent.

The failure of the bill is not important with respect to the issue here. Of significance is the Committee\u2019s concern, in 1981, over the array of definitions given to the term \"willful\u201d \u2014 a concern that led, five years later, to the deletion of that term from the Federal wiretap law, for much the same reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">.

We note that, in 1999, the Legislature addressed the problem of video surveillance of events in private residences and made it unlawful for a person to \"place or procure another to place a camera on real property on which is located a private residence for purposes of conducting deliberate surreptitious observation of a person inside the private residence.\u201d <em>See </em>1999 Md.

The Majority\u2019s conclusion as to the interpretation to be given the willfulness/wilfulness element of the wiretap law, Maryland Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 10-402(a)(1), (Maj. Op. at 198-200) is wrong. 1 continue to \u201cadhere like a barnacle to the clear definition of wilfulness provided in <em>Benford [v.

Carberry, </em>103 Md.App. 214, 220-222, 653 A.2d 479, 482-83 (1995). The Majority opinion fails to persuade my small mind (I authored the <em>Fearnow </em>opinion while serving on the Court of Special Appeals) that maintaining consistency in this regard is foolish.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, although Deibler\u2019s conduct was morally reprehensible, the record of his trial fails to provide evidence of the degree of wilfulness required under Maryland\u2019s wiretap statute and, thus, his conviction thereunder should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">I also disagree with the Majority\u2019s reasoning and resolution of Deibler\u2019s telephone abuse conviction. Maj. Op. at 201-203. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Despite the Majority\u2019s inability to find a \u201ccase quite like the one before us in which a conviction has been sustained\u201d (Maj. Op. at 202), the present case is not so rare that we should overlook fundamental principles such as: (1) we review the record below by considering \u201cwhether, after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d <em>(Jackson v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); and, (2) it is the responsibility of the trier of fact, not us, to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts, to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, and to resolve conflicts in the evidence (e.g., <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The trial co.urt listened to the tapes of the three conversations and to Deibler\u2019s explanation that his intent was only to protest what he regarded as Cordle\u2019s lack of professionalism in his handling of the investigation. The court expressly disbelieved that explanation and found a lack of credibility in Deibler\u2019s testimony. The first message, with the cocking of the gun, the court found to be clearly threatening and with the intent to annoy or harass. With respect to the other two messages, the court found Deibler\u2019s tone to be angry and sarcastic, that he \u201cunleashed a stream of profanity to express his discontent\u201d but did little to articulate any specific complaint. In one, he threatened to \u201cgo after\u201d Cordle, which the court found, in conjunction with the cocking of a gun in the first message, to constitute more than simply a complaint or a threat merely to take legal action against Cordle. For those reasons, the court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Deibler \u201cdid make repeated calls, with the specific intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass and embarrass Mr. Cordle, in a deliberate attempt to persuade him to terminate his investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We do not view each call an isolation, to see if it, alone, can be regarded as made with one of the requisite intents. When there are repeated calls, we must look at them together, to see if, from the aggregate, there is such an intent. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>here supports the court\u2019s finding that Deibler made the calls with the intent to annoy or harass Cordle, in an effort to cause him to curtail his investigation. The anger and the threat to \u201cgo after\u201d Cordle exhibited in the second call can take on a special meaning when coupled with the more blatant threat implicit in the first call. The innocent explanation offered by Deibler simply was not believed. The evidence sufficed to support the conviction. Therefore, I would affirm Deibler\u2019s conviction of the telephone abuse law.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Chief Judge Bell authorizes me to state that he joins only that part of this dissent regarding the wiretap conviction. He agrees with the majority regarding the telephone abuse conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA authorizes me to state that she joins only that part of the dissent regarding the telephone abuse conviction. She agrees with the majority regarding the wiretap conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\">. \u201cA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson, <em>Essays.
