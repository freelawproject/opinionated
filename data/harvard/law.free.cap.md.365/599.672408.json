Galloway, Jr., Petitioner, while serving a sentence for prior convictions, was charged with harassment and stalking, pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 121A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for letters he wrote from prison to the victim of the crimes for which he was imprisoned. On 26 October 1998, a pre-trial hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on Galloway\u2019s written motion to dismiss challenging the constitutionality of the statute on its face and as applied to his conduct. After hearing argument from the parties and upon their urging, the court reserved its ruling on the motion. Petitioner then waived his right to a jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>and agreed to proceed with a bench trial on an agreed statement of the facts and a not guilty plea. Galloway moved for judgments of acquittal at the end of the recitation of the agreed facts. The court took the case under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The Circuit Court, in a written opinion and order dated 28 October 1998, denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal with regard to the charge of harassment. The court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted the motion for judgment of acquittal, as to the charge of stalking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 4 November 1998, after entertaining further argument from counsel, the court found Galloway guilty of the crime of harassment. Sentencing proceeded immediately, and Galloway was sentenced to 90 days incarceration for the conviction. On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Galloway\u2019s conviction of harassment. <em>Galloway v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 89, 744 A.2d 1070 (2000). We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Galloway v. State, </em>358 Md. 608, 751 A.2d 470 (2000). We agreed to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">Did the trial court err in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and in convicting him of harassment under Md.Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Art. 27 \u00a7 121A, now codified with minimal changes as \u00a7 123, specifically in the face of a challenge that the statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face and as applied to Petitioner and in the face of a challenge that the facts did not support such a conviction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In 1995, Galloway was convicted of stalking and kidnapping Kimberly Javin (Javin), his \u201ccommon law wife.\u201d For these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>crimes, he was sentenced to twelve years incarceration at the Maryland Correctional Training Center (MCTC). It was while serving this sentence that it was alleged that he committed the crime of harassment which is the subject of the present case. According to the agreed statement of facts, between 11 April 1997 and 11 March 1998 he sent 122 letters to Javin at her residence. In addition, he sent an additional 11 letters to her in care of Javin\u2019s parents to their home address. Both before and after 17 April 1997, Javin, her parents, Galloway\u2019s former attorney in the kidnapping/stalking case, and the assistant warden and a correctional psychologist at MCTC, requested of Galloway that he not send letters to Javin. The prosecution, at the 4 November 1998 hearing, stated that at least five people, including Javin, told Galloway <em>directly </em>to stop writing these letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">By stipulation, the parties agreed that Javin, if called to testify, would state that \u201cthe letters seriously alarmed her and caused her to fear for her life on or after ... [Galloway\u2019s] release date, which she believ[ed] to be April of 1999.\u201d It was agreed further that Javin would testify that her fears stemmed from the fact that Galloway was serving a prison term after having been convicted of stalking and kidnaping her on 20 March 1995. As a condition of his sentence and future probation flowing from those crimes, Galloway was to have no contact with Javin. The parties also agreed that Javin felt that Galloway\u2019s continuing reference in his letters to Javin \u201cto him being Moses and the enforcer of the law and God\u2019s and Jesus\u2019s ambassador mean[t] that he [would] kill her so that they [could] be with God,\u201d notwithstanding that one of the letters containing this language began with the words \u201c[n]othing in this letter is meant to be a threat.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Galloway was charged with harassment and stalking. Maryland Code, (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 123, the harassment statute, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">(a) <em>Course of conduct defined. </em>\u2014 In this section \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d means a persistent pattern of conduct, composed of a series of acts over a period of time, that evidences a continuity of purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">(b) <em>Applicability. </em>\u2014This section does not apply to any peaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">(c) <em>Prohibited Conduct. </em>\u2014 A person may not follow another person in or about a public place or maliciously engage in a course of conduct that alarms or <em>seriously </em>annoys another person:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">(1) With intent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(2) After reasonable warning or request to desist by or on behalf of the other person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">(3) Without a legal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">(d) <em>Penalty </em>\u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The trial judge acquitted him of the stalking charge, but found him guilty of the harassment charge. Galloway argued that \u00a7 123 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under the U.S. Constitution<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of harassment under \u00a7 123. According to the trial judge, \u00a7 123 is neither unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The judge, in his written opinion, stated that \u00a7 123 is \u201cconstitutional as ... [it] does not suffer from vagueness\u201d and \u201cthat the meaning of the statutes have been fairly ascertained by judicial determinations.\u201d (Citing <em>Streater v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 267, 704 A.2d 541 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999); <em>Pall v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 242, 699 A.2d 565 (1997)). The trial court also concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support Galloway\u2019s conviction of harassment based on the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7ro\">In sending the victim over 130 letters over the course of eleven months, the Court can find that [Galloway] maliciously engaged in a course of conduct that seriously alarmed and annoyed the victim. In repeating the same messages and expressing [Galloway\u2019s] desire to reunite with the victim, the Court can find that Defendant intended to harass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the victim. As [Galloway] admits in his letter that he knew that victim did not want him to contact her, the Court can find that [Galloway] received a reasonable request to desist. As these were personal letter [sic], the Court can find that they served no legal purpose. Therefore, the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, agreeing that the language of \u00a7 123 was neither vague nor overly broad and that there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In this opinion, we shall address the following: (1) is \u00a7 123 unconstitutionally vague; (2) is \u00a7 123 unconstitutionally overly broad; and, (3) if \u00a7 123 can withstand constitutional scrutiny, was the evidence adduced against Petitioner sufficient to support a finding of harassment. We determine, after examining the legislative history of \u00a7 123 and surveying the treatment accorded similar statutes by other courts, that a reasonable person standard should be read into the language of subsection (c)(1) of \u00a7 123, and with that judicial gloss, \u00a7 123 survives constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We further conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support Petitioner\u2019s conviction of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">II. Constitutionality of \u00a7 123</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In determining the constitutionality of statutes, \u201c[t]he basic rule is that there is a presumption\u201d that the statute is valid. <em>State v. Wyand, </em>304 Md. 721, 727, 501 A.2d 43, 46 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Supermarkets Gen. Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 409 A.2d 250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1095, 106 S.Ct. 1492, 89 L.Ed.2d 893 (1986). We are reluctant to find a statute unconstitutional if, \u201cby any construction, it can be sustained.\u201d <em>Beauchamp v. Somerset County, </em>256 Md. 541, 547, 261 A.2d 461, 463 (1970). If, however, a statute violates a \u201cmandatory provision\u201d of the Constitution, \u201cwe are required to declare such an act unconstitutional and void.\u201d <em>Id.; see Cohen v. Governor of Maryland, </em>255 Md. 5, 22, 255 A.2d 320, 328 (1969). Therefore, if it is established that a statute is vague \u2014 offends due process<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014 and/or overbroad \u2014 sweeps within the ambit of constitutionally \u201cprotected expressive or associational rights\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 then the statute is unconstitutional. The party attacking the statute has the burden of establishing its unconstitutionality.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Beau</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>champ, </em>256 Md. at 547, 261 A.2d at 463 (citing <em>National Can Corp. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>220 Md. 418, 153 A.2d 287 (1959), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>361 U.S. 534, 80 S.Ct. 586, 4 L.Ed.2d 538 (1960)). Petitioner fails to shoulder this burden in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><em>A. Legislative </em>History, <em>of \u00a7 123</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">According to the 1986 Maryland Laws, chapter 721, the purpose of \u00a7 123 is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">prohibiting a person from following another person in a certain manner or from engaging in certain other conduct under certain circumstances; defining a certain term; providing penalties for a violation of this Act; providing that this act does <em>not </em>apply to certain conduct; and generally relating to the crime of harassment. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>There is no documentation in the bill file regarding whether this statute was modeled after that of another state, even though, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>other states have used identical or similar language in fashioning their harassment statutes and in defining the term \u201charass\u201d in their statutes. The only other insight provided is in the <em>Summary of Committee Report on House Bill 381 </em>(the bill from which the harassment statute came) prepared by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. According to the <em>Report, </em>the proposed harassment statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">will help law enforcement agencies in their attempts to defuse ongoing feuds and longstanding disputes between neighbors, former boyfriends and girlfriends, and adults which arise on a daily basis. The Baltimore Police Department testified that police departments\u2019 hands are virtually tied without this legislation. House Bill 381 would give law enforcement personnel the opportunity to avoid extreme situations which occur due to harassment and would allow the police to diffuse potentially harmful activity This bill also provides a vehicle for the relief of many victims of harassment who are without legal means to otherwise deal with the problem of harassment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Summary of Comm. Rep. on H.B. 381, </em>at 1-2 (1986). Though this <em>Report </em>is helpful in elaborating on the purpose of the harassment statute, it does not mention whether the Maryland statute was modeled after the harassment statutes of other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>B. Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Petitioner argues that the statute\u2019s use of the words \u201charass,\u201d \u201cannoy,\u201d \u201calarm,\u201d and \u201cwithout legal purpose\u201d in \u00a7 123(c) and \u201cpolitical views or ... information\u201d in \u00a7 123(b) are unconstitutionally vague, even in light of <em>Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 569 A.2d 604 (1990), which advances the proposition that one must apply normal meanings to words of common understanding. Petitioner further maintains that the \u201cuse of these undefined terms effectively reduces the statutory language to such a state of uncertainty that it fails to delineate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the proscribed conduct in a clear and comprehensible manner creating an ambiguity of constitutional dimension which leaves individuals guessing at the statute\u2019s scope.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 7. We disagree and conclude that, after applying <em>Eanes v. State,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the language of \u00a7 123 withstands constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The void-for-vagueness doctrine as applied to the analysis of penal statutes requires that the statute be \u201csufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 8, 616 A.2d 1275, 1278 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Connolly v. General Const. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926)); <em>see Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 458-59, 569 A.2d at 615; <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 120, 389 A.2d 341, 345 (1978). A statute must fit this standard so as not to offend due process rights. <em>See supra </em>note 7. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute \u201cabut[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u201d it \u201coperates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.\u201d Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to \u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone ... than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-99, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (alterations in original) (footnotes omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">A well grounded principle in federal constitutional law is that, when considering the void-for-vagueness doctrine, courts consistently consider two criteria or rationales. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278; <em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 459, 569 A.2d at 615; <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 120-21, 389 A.2d at 345. The first rationale is the fair notice principle that \u201cpersons of ordinary intelligence and experience be afforded a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that they may govern their behavior accordingly.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 121, 389 A.2d 341); <em>see Ferro v. Lewis, </em>348 Md. 593, 607, 705 A.2d 311, 318 (1998). The standard for determining whether a statute provides fair notice is \u201cwhether persons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at [the statute\u2019s] meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8, 616 A.2d at 1278 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 607, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2913, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). A statute is not vague under the fair notice principle if the meaning \u201cof the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, <em>if </em>they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d at 348 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 460, 569 A.2d at 615-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The second criterion of the vagueness doctrine regards enforcement of the statute. This rationale exists \u201cto ensure that criminal statutes provide \u2018legally fixed standards and adequate guidelines for police, judicial officers, triers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>fact and others whose obligation it is to enforce, apply and administer the penal laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 8 9, 616 A.2d at 1278 (quoting <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 121, 389 A.2d 341). To survive analysis, a statute must \u201ceschew arbitrary enforcement in addition to being intelligible to the reasonable person.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d at 1279. In <em>Bowers, </em>we determined that, as to this standard, a statute is not unconstitutionally vague</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">merely because it allows for the exercise of some discretion on the part of law enforcement and judicial officials. It is only where a statute is so broad as to be susceptible to irrational and selective patterns of enforcement that it will be held unconstitutional under this second arm of the vagueness principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346; <em>see Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 464, 569 A.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">As a general rule, the application of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is based on the application of the statute to the \u201cfacts at hand.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346 (citing <em>United States v. Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S.Ct. 316, 46 L.Ed.2d 228 (1975); <em>United States v. Mazurie, </em>419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975); <em>United States v. National Dairy Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 32-33, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963)). Thus, \u201cit will usually be immaterial that the statute is of questionable applicability in foreseeable marginal situations, if a contested provision clearly applies to the conduct of the defendant in a specific case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">If the challenged statute, however, encroaches upon fundamental constitutional rights, particularly First Amendment guarantees of free speech and assembly, then the statute should be scrutinized for vagueness on its face.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number><em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 624, 645 A.2d 22, 33 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1130, 115 S.Ct. 942, 130 L.Ed.2d 886 (1995). Thus, \u201cnot only may the two vices of inadequate notice and insufficient adjudicative [or enforcement] guidelines be present, but in addition the indefiniteness of the statute itself may inhibit the exercise of protected freedoms.\u201d <em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 122, 389 A.2d at 346 (citing <em>Winters v. New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 509, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948); <em>National Dairy Corp., 372 </em>U.S. at 36, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561). Because of the potential \u201cchilling effect\u201d that vagueness can have on First Amendment liberties, permitting a defendant to challenge a statute on its face for vagueness becomes a \u201crule of standing which allows a defendant to challenge the validity of a statute even though the statute as applied to the defendant is constitutional.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Ayers, </em>335 Md. at 625, 645 A.2d at 33. As we stated in <em>Bowers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">So considered, the principle is essentially a rule of standing, permitting a defendant to challenge the validity of a statute as applied to marginal cases, even though the acts for which he has been charged may be squarely within the coverage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the statute. Once it is determined, however, that a strict specificity standard ought to apply in any given case, the criteria for measuring the validity of a statute under the vagueness doctrine are the same as in a non-First Amendment context: fair warning and adequate guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><em>Bowers, </em>283 Md. at 123, 389 A.2d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals has determined that a telephone harassment statute using the words \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201charass\u201d is not unconstitutionally vague,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Caldwell v.

In short, even if arguably otherwise deficient, \u00a7 123 is salvageable because we shall employ a limiting construction to the statute to ensure that it provides a standard of conduct and indicates whose sensibilities are to be offended. <em>See, e.g., Schochet v.

Moreover, \u00a7 123 has inherent limitations. The statute requires a reasonable warning to desist, does not apply to \u201cany peaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others,\u201d and mandates that there be no \u201clegal purpose\u201d for the activity. <em>Cf. </em>Boychuk, <em>supra, </em>at 791-92 (contending that providing an exemption of constitutionally protected activity or a court\u2019s assuming that a state legislature did not intend to prohibit any constitutionally protected conduct remedies vagueness problems (citing Richard H. Fallon, Jr., <em>Making Sense of Over breadth, </em>100 Yale L.J. 853, 862 (1991))). Lastly, \u00a7 123 requires specific intent on the part of the offender, which assists in alleviating vagueness difficulties. <em>See, e.g., Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>i.

The harassment statute in question in <em>Norman </em>stated that harassment is committed \u201c \u2018if with intent to <em>harass, annoy, </em>or <em>alarm </em>another person,\u2019 such person \u2018engages in conduct or repeatedly commits acts that <em>alarm </em>or <em>seriously annoy </em>another person and that serve no <em>legitimate purpose.\u2019 \u201d Norman, </em>703 P.2d at 1266 (emphasis added) (quoting Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-9-11(1)(d) (1978)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Colorado court based its reasoning on one of its earlier opinions, <em>Bolles v. People, </em>189 Colo. 394, 541 P.2d 80 (1975), which held that the use of the words \u201charass\u201d and \u201cannoy\u201d in subsection (l)(e) in the harassment statute was unconstitutionally broad.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Norman, </em>703 P.2d at 1266 (referring to Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-9-11(1)(e), which stated: \u201c(1) A person commits harassment if, with intent to <em>harass, annoy, </em>or <em>alarm </em>another person, he ... (e) communicates with a person, anonymously or otherwise by telephone, telegraph mail, or any other form of communication, in a manner <em>likely to harass or cause </em>alarm.... \u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The court in <em>Norman </em>found fault with the phraseology of the statute. According to the court, the statute did not define any legislative concern, and the statute covered \u201cany and all conduct, by any person.\u201d <em>Norman, </em>703 P.2d at 1267. The court continued: \u201c[a]n actor, a clown, a writer or a speaker all might be subject to criminal prosecution because their acts are perceived by some official to annoy or alarm others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the statute was subject to such generality that it \u201cexceeds the bounds of flexibility constitutionally available to the legislature,\u201d and, more importantly, that subsection (1)(d) \u201ccontains no <em>limiting </em>standards to assist citizens, courts, judges or police personnel to define what conduct is prohibited and, conversely, what conduct is permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As we shall discuss further, Maryland\u2019s statute, though also employing the words \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201calarm,\u201d contains limiting language, and we are further willing to read a limiting \u201creasonable person\u201d standard into the statute. <em>Cf. </em>Boychuk, <em>supra, </em>at 788 (contending that either a <em>judicial </em>or legislative formulation of an objective standard by which to judge harassment would save the statutes from constitutional demise). Moreover, Petitioner misapplies the <em>Norman </em>case in arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>for its application to \u00a7 123. The Colorado Supreme Court later emphasized that the phrases \u201cintent to annoy\u201d and \u201cintent to alarm\u201d alone are not unconstitutionally vague, but rather, coupled with restrictive language, other subsections of the same harassment statute withstand constitutional scrutiny. <em>See People v. McBurney, </em>750 P.2d 916, 919-20 (Colo.1988) (stating that the <em>previous </em>sections of the <em>predecessor </em>harassment statute, as in <em>Bolles, </em>were not unconstitutional because of the \u201cmere presence of the words \u2018annoy\u2019 and \u2018alarm,\u2019 but because these words were applied to <em>all </em>forms of communication, which obviously contained no particularized standards to limit the scope of the offense\u201d (citing <em>Bolles, </em>541 P.2d at 82-83)). The limiting language found significant in <em>McBumey </em>confined the statute only to harassing or obscene telephone calls. <em>Id. </em>(discussing Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18 \u2014 9\u2014lll(l)(e) (1986), which includes that a person commits harassment if, \u201cwith intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, he ... [i]nitiates communication with a person, anonymously or otherwise by telephone, in a manner intended to harass or threaten bodily injury or property damage, or makes any comment, request, suggestion, or proposal by telephone which is obscene\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Petitioner also relies on <em>Kansas v. Bryan, </em>259 Kan. 143, 910 P.2d 212 (1996) in which the Supreme Court of Kansas held the Kansas stalking statute to be unconstitutionally vague due to its use of the terms \u201cannoy,\u201d \u201calarm,\u201d and \u201charass\u201d and without defining an objective standard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Bryan, </em>910 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>217, 219. According to the court\u2019s construction, the statute in question employed an objective standard in relation to a course of conduct that alarms, annoys, or harasses a person, but not in relation to the \u201cfollowing\u201d of a person that achieves the same effect. <em>Id. </em>The Kansas court concluded that, following the reasoning in <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the lack of an objective standard incorporated in the language of the statute with regard to the act of \u201cfollowing\u201d a person, frames the statute so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>that it is unconstitutionally vague; the finder of fact is left without an objective standard by which to examine, and anyone subject to the law is deprived of an objective standard by which to determine, what the crime of stalking constitutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Bryan, </em>910 P.2d at 220-21. It appears that the Kansas court did not consider reading into the statute a reasonable person standard. We easily set apart our statute from that of the Kansas statute. The Maryland statute does not employ the word \u201creasonable\u201d with some terms, but not others, in the same manner as the Kansas statute<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and contains further limiting provisions, discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Petitioner incorrectly relies on the Fifth Circuit case, <em>Kramer v. Price, </em>712 F.2d 174 (5th Cir.1988), <em>vacated, </em>723 F.2d 1164 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which actually bolsters the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>a judicial gloss of a reasonable person standard to rescue a statute from threatened unconstitutionality. Moreover, the Texas harassment statute, which the decision examines, is worded quite differently from Maryland\u2019s statute, except that both use the words \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201calarm.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Kramer, </em>the Fifth Circuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding, affirmed a federal district court\u2019s holding that the Texas harassment statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, <em>Kramer v. Texas, </em>605 S.W.2d 861 (Tex.Cr.App.1980) (en banc), affirmed Kramer\u2019s conviction under the statute. <em>Kramer, </em>712 F.2d at 175. Relying on <em>Coates, supra </em>note 16, the Fifth Circuit found the statute unconstitutionally vague because neither the statute nor the court\u2019s construction of it provided a standard of conduct or indicated whose sensibilities must be offended. The court stated: \u201cThe Texas courts have made no attempt to construe the terms \u2018annoy\u2019 and \u2018alarm\u2019 in a manner which lessens their inherent vagueness. Of greater importance, the Texas courts have refused to construe the statute to indicate whose sensibilities must be offended.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Kramer, </em>712 F.2d at 178 (footnotes omitted) (citing <em>Kramer, </em>605 S.W.2d 861; <em>Collection Consultants, Inc. v. Texas, </em>556 S.W.2d 787 (Tex.Cr.App.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The Fifth Circuit identified as a difficulty that the \u201cTexas court refused to narrow the statute by, for example, holding that it applies to writings which would annoy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>hypothetical reasonable person </em>and that its standard does not vary with the sensitivity of each complainant.\u201d <em>Kramer, </em>712 F.2d at 178 n. 6. The court continued that it could not limit the construction of a statute on appeal when an accused is tried and convicted under a broad construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>(relying upon <em>Ashton v. Kentucky, </em>384 U.S. 195, 86 S.Ct. 1407, 16 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966)). In the present case, we narrow the construction of the statute by application of a reasonable person standard to save it from possible unconstitutional vagueness. Petitioner also notes that in <em>Kramer </em>the Fifth Circuit stated that the intent requirement \u2014 intent to annoy\u2014 does not \u201csave\u201d the statute from vagueness \u201cbecause the conduct which must be motivated by intent, as well as the standard by which that conduct is to be assessed, remain vague.\u201d <em>Kramer, </em>712 F.2d at 178. We agree that a specific intent requirement alone does not \u201csave\u201d a statute, but we have declared that it is helpful in \u201creliev[ing] the statute of the objection that it punishes without warning an offense of which the accused was unaware.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 9, 616 A.2d at 1279 (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Screws v.

In addition, as discussed <em>infra, </em>neither the conduct motivated by the intent nor the standard applied to Maryland\u2019s statute remains constitutionally vague after applying a narrower construction as we have.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Petitioner also relies on <em>Oregon v. Sanderson, </em>33 Or.App. 173, 575 P.2d 1025 (1978), <em>overruled in part, Oregon v. Schwartz, </em>173 Or.App. 301, 21 P.3d 1128, 1134 (2001), in which the Court of Appeals of Oregon declared that state\u2019s harassment statute unconstitutionally vague. The statute provided that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he ... [ejngages in a course of conduct that alarms or seriously annoys another person and which selves no legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Sanderson, </em>575 P.2d at 1026 (quoting Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 166.065(l)(d)). The Oregon court had particular difficulty with the phrase \u201calarms or seriously annoys\u201d because it \u201cgives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>no basis to distinguish between anti-social conduct which was intended to be prohibited and socially tolerable conduct which could not reasonably have been intended to be subject to criminal sanction.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Sanderson, </em>575 P.2d at 1027. The <em>Sanderson </em>court refused to apply a limiting construction because it decided that such a limiting judicial construction is only possible \u201cif the underlying purpose of the statute is apparent from the statute\u2019s prior judicial interpretation or legislative history,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that, in this instance, the statute was enacted too recently to have acquired a \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d and that the \u201clegislative history indicates an intention to create a catchall offense.\u201d <em>Sanderson, </em>575 P.2d at 1028. We reach the opposite conclusion with regard to \u00a7 123 because, although its legislative history does not dictate how the phraseology came about, that history does provide insight into the legislative purpose, whereas the Oregon court determined that its statute\u2019s legislative history intended to enact a catchall provision \u2014 \u201ca dragnet provision ... to reach myriad forms of harassment that cannot be specifically enumerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals of Oregon in <em>Oregon v. Schwartz, </em>173 Or.App. 301, 21 P.3d 1128, 1134 (Ct.App.2001), expressly \u201crepudiated\u201d the quote in <em>Sanderson </em>that the \u201cfundamental flaw of the statute at issue\u201d is that \u201cit gave no basis to distinguish between anti-social conduct which was intended to be prohibited and socially tolerable conduct which could not reasonably have been intended to be subject to criminal action.\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>21 P.3d at 1134 (internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>omitted) (quoting <em>Sanderson, </em>575 P.2d at 1027). The court reasoned in <em>Schwartz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">[A]n argument that a statute covers too much ground can never, standing alone, support a vagueness challenge. As a matter of logic, the conclusion that a law is insufficiently definite to provide guidance to its potential violators and enforcers simply does not follow from the premise that the statute criminalizes too broad a category of conduct. Secondly, such an argument cannot provide the bases for an overbreadth claim, because \u201c[a] legislature can make a law as \u2018broad\u2019 and inclusive as it chooses unless it reaches into constitutionally protected ground.\u201d ...

The definition of \u201cannoy\u201d is \u201cto disturb or irritate especially by repeated acts.\u201d Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 47 (10th ed.1993).

It follows that \u00a7 123 was in no way intended to cover such situations as repeated phone calls from creditors. Employing a reasonable person standard further ensures that the \u00a7 123 is limited to its intended purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The last aspect of Petitioner\u2019s vagueness argument is whether \u201cwithout <em>legal </em>purpose\u201d is constitutionally adequate. The courts have come down on either side of the fence regarding the issue of whether \u201cwithout <em>legitimate </em>purpose\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Compare Oregon v. Norris-Romine, </em>134 Or.App. 204, 894 P.2d 1221 (1995) (concluding the phrase \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d was unconstitutionally vague), <em>review denied, </em>321 Or. 512, 900 P.2d 509 (1995), <em>with Kansas v.

This same language in either a harassment or a stalking statute has not been challenged in any other jurisdiction. The language, however, when looked at in conjunction with the rest of the statute and with the underlying purpose of the statute, has a definite and clear meaning that helps in setting the boundaries for the enforcement of \u00a7 123. <em>See Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 480, 754 A.2d 1004, 1012 (2000) (stating that if a statute is clouded by ambiguity or obscurity, it is necessary not only to consider the literal and usual meaning of the words, but their meaning in light of setting, objectives, and purpose of enactment); <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994) (same); <em>Williams, </em>329 Md. at 15-16, 616 A.2d at 1282 (We must discern \u201clegislative intent from the entire statutory scheme, as opposed to scrutinizing parts of the statute in isolation.\u201d); <em>see also Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 327, 558 A.2d 715, 721 (1989) (\u201c[I]n addition to considering the specific words of the statute, we may consider the general history and prevailing mood of the legislative body with respect to the type of criminal conduct involved.\u201d). It is apparent that this language was included in the statute to help in avoiding application of the statute to such situations as, but not limited to, protected political and religious leafleting, commercial solicitations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>other types of informational leaflets or contacts such as store openings and community action programs. This language is of the same tenor as used by other jurisdictions that have stalking and harassment statutes that contain the phrase, or some variation of, \u201cdoes not include constitutionally protected activity.\u201d Those jurisdictions have not determined that such a phrase is unconstitutionally vague. <em>See, e.g., Bouters v. Florida, </em>659 So.2d 235 (Fla.1995) (holding Florida\u2019s stalking statute, which contained the language \u201c[c]onstitutionally protected activity is not included\u201d in the \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d definition and constitutional protected activity includes \u201cpicketing or other organized protests,\u201d was not impermissibly vague), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 894, 116 S.Ct. 245, 133 L.Ed.2d 171; <em>Johnson, </em>648 N.E.2d at 668-69 (determining that an Indiana stalking statute specifically excluding constitutionally protected activity such as \u201clawful picketing pursuant to labor disputes\u201d from its ambit was not unconstitutionally vague); <em>Saunders, </em>695 A.2d at 722 (finding that a stalking statute, which specifically excluded \u201cconstitutionally protected activity\u201d from the definition of \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d was not unconstitutionally vague). We conclude that the language in the Maryland statute is in no way unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">None of the words and phrases under scrutiny in \u00a7 123 are unconstitutionally vague. They have a common meaning and understanding known to the person of common or average intelligence. Moreover, employing a reasonable person standard and the inherent specific intent requirement alleviates further potential doubt. Finally, a potential offender does not have to be wary of unanticipated criminal liability because of the condition that there be a reasonable request to desist. In the present case, Javin, her parents, the assistant warden and psychologist at the prison, and Petitioner\u2019s former counsel told Petitioner not to send letters to Javin. Despite these warnings, Petitioner proceeded to send a large volume of additional letters to Javin within a relatively short period of time. The facts of the present case are also congruent with the intended purpose of the statute. As the Court of Special Appeals stated, \u201c[i]t strains credulity to suggest that ... [Petitioner] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>could not reasonably understand that these letters would alarm or seriously annoy a woman who [was] the victim of his prior crimes of kidnapping and stalking.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>130 Md.App. at 96, 744 A.2d at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>C.

The U.S. Supreme Court explained that \u201c[a] clear and precise enactment may nevertheless be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 114, 92 S.Ct. at 2302, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (footnote omitted). The purpose of the over breadth doctrine \u201cis designed to protect First Amendment freedom of expression from laws written so broadly that the fear of punishment might discourage people from taking advantage of that freedom.\u201d <em>Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 36, 641 A.2d 870, 878 (1994) (citing <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 611-13, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915-17, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); <em>Curran v.

The concern is that an overbroad statute may, by that very fact, have a chilling effect on free expression. That is, if a statute is to be struck down as overbroad, it must appear that the statute\u2019s very existence will inhibit free expression. The doctrine is \u2018strong medicine\u2019 and should be applied sparingly. It should not be invoked when a limiting construction can be placed on the statute. Because the over breadth doctrine involves a challenge to the facial validity of a statute, a court should not resort to it unless there is a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protection of parties not before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqhi\"><em>Eanes, </em>318 Md. at 464-65, 569 A.2d at 618 (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the over breadth doctrine to a wide spectrum of cases ranging from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>statutes that regulate only the spoken word to those that involve \u201cexpressive\u201d conduct. <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 613-16, 93 S.Ct. at 2916-18, 37 L.Ed.2d 830.

Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect \u2014 at best a prediction \u2014 cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615-16, 93 S.Ct. at 2917-18, 37 L.Ed.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Explained in another way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">[P]articularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-9\"><em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 615, 93 S.Ct. at 2918, 37 L.Ed.2d 830.

We conclude that the reasoning of those states that have determined that their similar harassment statutes do not transgress the confines of the over breadth doctrine are more persuasive, taking into account the mandates of the doctrine and the language of \u00a7 123. In following these states, we further determine that \u00a7 123 sanctions conduct that is within the state\u2019s power to prohibit and that any overbreadth that the statute arguably may be subject to is not substantial in relation to that conduct which \u00a7 123 is meant legitimately to prohibit (or protect).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Many states have concluded that their harassment statutes are not overbroad because of their statutory requirements for purposeful conduct, such as in the present case, requiring an \u201cintent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other person.\u201d In <em>Connecticut v. </em>Snyder, 49 Conn.App. 617, 717 A.2d 240 (1998) the Appellate Court of Connecticut concluded that that state\u2019s harassment statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad as it applied to conduct. The statute states that a person is guilty of harassment when \u201cwith intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, he communicates with a person by telegraph or mail, by electronically transmitting a facsimile through connection with a telephone network, by computer network ..., or by any other form of written communication, in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.... \u201d <em>Snyder, </em>717 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>A.2d at 241 (second alteration in original) (quoting Conn.

Anonymous, </em>34 Conn.Supp. 689, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978), the Connecticut court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">The over breadth principle is not violated by the unrestricted scope of the messages which the statute may ban because it is the manner and means employed to communicate them which is the subject of the prohibition rather than their content. The statute is not flawed because a recital on the telephone of the most sublime prayer with the intention and effect of harassing the listener would fall within its ban as readily as the most scurrilous epithet. The prohibition is against purposeful harassment by means of a device readily susceptible to abuse as a constant trespasser upon our privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Snyder, </em>717 A.2d at 243-44 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Anonymous, </em>34 Conn.Supp. 689, 389 A.2d 1270). The <em>Snyder </em>court further acknowledged thusly with respect to mailings, such as in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWxe\">Since the statute proscribes conduct, rather than content of the mailings, the risk that the statute will chill people from the exercise of free speech is minor compared with the unfortunately prevalent misuse of the postal system to harass others and invade their privacy. Thus, because this statute prohibits intentional harassment by means of the mail and does not seek to regulate the content of such mailings, we hold that first amendment freedoms are not involved and the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APF\"><em>Snyder, </em>717 A.2d at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Taravella, </em>133 Mich.App. 515, 350 N.W.2d 780 (1984), the Court of Appeals of Michigan determined that Michigan\u2019s telephone harassment statute prohibited conduct rather than pure speech and, as such, was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The Michigan court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">Do telephone calls by an angry parent to a student with failing grades, by a dissatisfied consumer or by a disgruntled constituent, if accompanied by language thought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u2018offensive\u2019 by the recipient of the call, subject the caller to criminal sanctions under the statute? In each case, defendant claims, the caller\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right of free speech might \u2018annoy,\u2019 \u2018frighten\u2019 or be considered \u2018obscene\u2019 or \u2018harassing\u2019 by the listener. Thus, under defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, if is the listener\u2019s perception or characterization of the nature of the call which would control. We disagree. The statute clearly provides that the focus is on the caller; <em>it is the malicious intent with which the transmission is made that establishes the criminality of the conduct.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>Taravella, </em>350 N.W.2d at 784 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">On the same note,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> in <em>Idaho v. Richards, </em>127 Idaho 31, 896 P.2d 357 (Ct.App.1995), the Court of Appeals of Idaho determined that a harassment statute is not overly broad because the statute prohibited \u201conly telephone contacts made with a specific and exclusive <em>intent </em>to \u2018annoy, terrify, threaten, intimidate, harass or offend,\u2019 \u201d which is not protected speech but conduct, and the statute did not proscribe telephone calls made \u201cwith a legitimate intent to communicate.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>896 P.2d at 362 (emphasis added). The court, quoting from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">The government has a strong and legitimate interest in preventing the harassment of individuals.... \u2018Prohibiting harassment is not prohibiting speech, because harassment is not a protected speech. Harassment is not communication, although it may take the form of speech. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>prohibits only telephone calls made with the intent to harass.

In the present case, conduct that otherwise qualifies as unlawful harassment is not protected merely because it came to Javin\u2019s or her parents\u2019 home in the form of letters delivered through the United States Postal Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 123 expressly eliminates constitutionally protected speech from its ambit. Section 123 \u201cdoes not apply to any peaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others\u201d and the conduct to be prohibited must have no \u201clegal purpose.\u201d Other states have concluded that similar restrictive language helps to abate any over breadth. <em>Cf. </em>Boychuk, <em>supra, </em>at 788 (suggesting that employing language in stalking and harassment statutes that \u201cspecifically except[s] protected activities from the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>statute\u201d would aid in ensuring that such statutes do not \u201cinfring[e] on legitimate activities\u201d). In <em>People v. Shack, </em>86 N.Y.2d 529, 634 N.Y.S.2d 660, 658 N.E.2d 706 (1995), the New York Court of Appeals determined that the New York harassment statute\u2019s limiting clause \u201c \u2018without legitimate purpose of communication\u2019 ... expressly excludes constitutionally protected speech from its reach [and] plainly distinguishes this statute from those which impose criminal liability for \u2018pure speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shack, </em>658 N.E.2d at 710. The court concluded that because of the restrictive clause the defendant could not rely successfully on the First Amendment to support a challenge to its facial validity, <em>id., </em>and it is this limitation that distinguishes the statute from those harassment statutes that have been declared unconstitutionally broad. <em>Shack, </em>658 N.E.2d at 711 (citing <em>People v. Klick, </em>66 Ill.2d 269, 5 Ill.Dec. 858, 362 N.E.2d 329 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In <em>McKillop v. Alaska,, </em>857 P.2d 358 (Alaska Ct.App.1993), the Court of Appeals of Alaska also determined that a harassment statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The court noted that the harassment statute had the potential, in addition to prohibiting conduct, \u201cto punish political speech or other legitimate communication upon proof that one of the speaker\u2019s subsidiary motives was to annoy the listener.\u201d <em>McKillop, </em>857 P.2d at 365. The court further stated: \u201cWe agree that a person engaging in advocacy or criticism may legitimately intend to annoy or disturb his or her listeners. Nevertheless, \u2018the right of every person to be left alone must be [weighed] in the scales [against] the right of others to communicate.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKillop, </em>857 P.2d at 364 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Rowan v. United States Post Office Dept., </em>397 U.S. 728, 736, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 1490, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970)).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To avoid an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>overbroad construction, the court interpreted the statute \u201cto prohibit telephone calls only when the call has no legitimate <em>communicative purpose, </em>when the caller\u2019s speech is devoid of any substantive information and the caller\u2019s sole intention is to annoy or harass the recipient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On the same note and most recently, the Supreme Court of Kansas, in <em>Kansas v. Whitesell, </em>270 Kan. 259, 13 P.3d 887 (2000), determined that a stalking statute, worded similarly to \u00a7 123, was not unconstitutionally overbroad.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">A criminal statute should not infringe upon the First Amendment. The First Amendment, however, is not an impenetrable shield which protects any speech or conduct, whatsoever, with disregard to its harm and effect. Despite our First Amendment rights, we are not free to harm others under the guise of free speech. \u201cAs speech strays further from the values of persuasion, dialogue and free exchange of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ideas, and moves toward willful threats to perform illegal acts, the State has greater latitude to regulate expression.\u201d <em>People v. Borrelli, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 703, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 851 (2000) (referring to <em>Shackelford v. Shirley, </em>948 F.2d 935, 938 (5 Cir.1991)). \u201cApplication of the overbreadth doctrine ... is, manifestly, strong medicine. It has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>Broadrick, </em>413 U.S. at 613, 93 S.Ct. 2908.

The state may penalize threats, even those consisting of pure speech, provided the relevant statute singles out for punishment threats falling outside of the scope of the First Amendment protection.... In this context, the goal of the First Amendment is to protect expression that engages in some fashion public dialogue, that is \u2018communication in which the participants seek to or are persuaded; communication which is about changing or maintaining beliefs, or taking or refusing to take action on the basis of one\u2019s beliefs.... A statute that is otherwise valid, and is not aimed at protected expression, does not conflict with the First Amendment simply because the statute can be violated by the use of the spoken words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\"><em>Whitesell, </em>13 P.3d at 901 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Borrelli, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at 714, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 851 (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462; <em>Aguilar v.

These cases, however, do not discuss statutes with the restrictive language of \u00a7 123 \u2014 \u201cdoes not apply to any peaceable activity intended to express political view or provide information to others\u201d \u2014 and are worded quite differently from \u00a7 123. For instance, in <em>Bolles v. People, </em>the Supreme Court of Colorado found that the Colorado harassment statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because the dictionary definitions of \u201cintent to alarm\u201d and \u201cannoy,\u201d as used in the statute, would render criminal such acts as forecasting a storm and warning against illnesses. <em>Bolles, </em>541 P.2d at 81. The court concluded that even reading in restrictive language such as \u201cno legitimate purpose\u201d would not save the statute from being over-broad, but instead would inject vagueness into the statute. <em>Id. </em>As discussed, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 123 does not contain the language \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d but employs instead \u201clegal purpose,\u201d which is more restrictive, in addition to the restriction that \u00a7 123 does not apply to \u201cpeaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others.\u201d We conclude that other out-of-state cases, on which Petitioner relies, are distinguishable from the present case.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Petitioner contends that the evidence presented in the agreed statement of facts in the present case was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>dent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Petitioner was guilty of violating \u00a7 123. We disagree. We have dedared that upon appellate review the \u201capplicable standard is whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056, 1057 (1986); <em>see State v.

Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323, 331 (1998); <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Applying this standard, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Petitioner\u2019s conviction of harassment. Petitioner sent Javin 122 letters to her place of residence between 11 April 1997 and 11 March 1998. He also sent an additional 11 letters to Javin at her parent\u2019s residence during this period. Javin had a specific reason to fear Petitioner due to the fact that at the time that he sent the letters, he was serving a finite prison term, 12 years, for previously stalking and kidnapping Javin. Petitioner also was ordered, as part of his earlier sentence, to have no contact with Javin. Moreover, it was stipulated that Javin\u2019s testimony would be that, because of the letters, she feared that Petitioner would kill her when he was released from prison, which she believed would be in April 1999. Additionally, Javin, her parents, Petitioner\u2019s former attorney, and the assistant warden and the correctional psychologist at the prison, had requested, both before and after 17 April 1997, that Petitioner not send letters to Javin.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Petitioner maintains that the letters were part of \u201ca peaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others\u201d and that they had a \u201clegal purpose\u201d so that \u00a7 123 did not apply to his conduct. According to Petitioner, the \u201cletters were basically <em>intended </em>to provide religious information to Javin, to express concern for her religious future and to convince Javin of Petitioner\u2019s love for her.\u201d (Emphasis added). After the initial few letters, however, Galloway was warned multiple times that Javin did not wish to receive communications from him. Those instructions notwithstanding, he continued his course by sending a large number of additional letters. From this, a reasonable fact-finder reasonably could conclude that Galloway\u2019s intent was, in fact, to harass Javin, rather than merely to engage in a peaceable activity, with a legal purpose. We have stated that \u201cthe determination of an accused\u2019s intention is, in the first instance, for the trial judge, when sitting without a jury, and this determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 590, 606 A.2d 265, 268 (1992) (citing <em>Taylor v. State, </em>238 Md. 424, 433, 209 A.2d 595, 600 (1965)), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 945, 113 S.Ct. 390, 121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992). Furthermore, \u201csince intent is subjective and, without the cooperation of the accused, cannot be directly and objectively proven, its presence must be shown by established facts which permit a proper inference of its existence.\u201d <em>Raines, </em>326 Md. at 591, 606 A.2d at 268 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Earp, </em>319 Md. 156, 157, 571 A.2d 1227, 1233 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s explicit and implicit conclusions that the letters were meant beyond a reasonable doubt, (1) to harass, alarm, or annoy Javin and (2) necessarily were not intended as the dissemination of mere religious instruction. <em>See supra </em>note 3. It was not necessary, as Petitioner contends, that the trial judge specifically discuss whether the exceptions of \u201cpeaceable activity\u201d and \u201clegal purpose\u201d applied to the present case. It was enough that the trial judge found that the harassment elements of the statute had been satisfied. Taking into account the plethora of let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ters, Petitioner\u2019s prior convictions of stalking and kidnapping Javin, and the numerous requests for Petitioner to stop sending the letters, the trial judge could find, as Javin herself did, that the frequent references in the letters to Petitioner being \u201cMoses and the enforcer of the law and God\u2019s and Jesus\u2019s ambassador\u201d meant that Petitioner intended to kill her so that they could be together again, but in a non-corporeal way. Although the threat may not have been explicit, and even considering that some of the letters began with such statements as \u201c[njothing in this letter is meant to be a threat,\u201d a threat reasonably may be inferred considering all of the circumstances presented and the other language in the letters. <em>See supra </em>note 3. As the Court of Special Appeals stated, \u201c[a] person of common intelligence would have no trouble understanding that frequent written communication by a convicted felon to the home of a person whom he previously kidnapped and stalked, will seriously annoy or alarm the recipient.\u201d <em>Galloway, </em>130 Md.App. at 100, 744 A.2d at 1076. Analogously, as noted above, we have acknowledged previously that the commission of a \u201cbattery or assault and battery referred to in the protective order ... may have special relevance to the intent\u201d element of \u00a7 123. <em>Streater, </em>352 Md. at 816, 724 A.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Furthermore, sufficient evidence supported the conclusion that the act of writing and mailing the letters was malicious and was not, as Petitioner argues, merely a minimal intrusion that Javin could have avoided by throwing out the letters, unopened, that came from Petitioner or bore his return address at MCTC. It is true that Javin, after receiving and reading a few of the letters, could have stopped reading them; however, the sheer volume of letters received from the known source and the pre-existing circumstances that created the background context surrounding the letters from that source are enough to support a finding of malice and more than a minimal intrusion. The mere sending and receipt of that volume of letters, coming after the warnings to Galloway, even had Javin not opened them, supported a reasonable inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of Galloway\u2019s unlawful intent and the adverse effects on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to find Petitioner\u2019s sending of the letters was a malicious engagement in a course of conduct that alarmed or seriously annoyed Javin (or a reasonable person in the same circumstances) and that Petitioner engaged in this course of conduct with the intent to harass, alarm, or annoy Javin. Petitioner received several reasonable warnings and requests to desist such conduct. It also is evident from the record that Petitioner acted without a legal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-15\">.

While these principles are generally applicable in resolving constitutional challenges, nevertheless, when a statute or other government action interferes with speech or other freedoms protected by the First Amendment and Articles 36 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the statute or other government action is subject to scrutiny and must be justified by a showing of sufficient governmental interest.

George Galloway and Kimberly Javin had formerly lived together, and later Javin terminated the relationship. Thereafter, in 1995 Galloway was convicted of stalking and kidnapping Javin and was sentenced to prison for 12 years with all but seven years suspended. He was to be on probation for the suspended portion and was directed, as a condition of probation, to have no contact with Javin. Nevertheless, the case at bar is not a prosecution based on Galloway\u2019s 1994 and 1995 conduct and is not a proceeding based upon an alleged violation of probation. Although the majority indicates that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d in the present case properly took \u201cinto account ... Petitioner\u2019s prior convictions\u201d and \u201cthe pre-existing circumstances\u201d (opinion at 651, 652), the majority does not suggest that Art. 27, \u00a7 123, is limited to circumstances where there was prior criminal involvement with the victim. Furthermore, nothing in the statutory language would support such a limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>tion. Persons who have never previously been convicted of any criminal offense are equally subject to \u00a7 123. In addition, the majority appears to rely on the 1995 convictions only as evidence that Galloway in 1997 and 1998 had the \u201cintent to harass, alarm, or annoy\u201d Javin. While this inference may be debatable, it clearly has no bearing upon the vagueness or overbreadth of the statutory language or whether other statutory requirements were met.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">This case is also not concerned with the restrictions upon First Amendment or other constitutional rights which may legitimately be imposed upon inmates of a correctional institution because of security or other \u201cneeds and exigencies of the institutional environment,\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d 935, 950 (1974). Thus, regulations placing certain types of restrictions upon mail which an inmate may send from the institution to someone on the outside, or upon mail which an inmate may receive from someone on the outside, may be valid. <em>See, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 548-555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1879-1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447, 474-479 (1979); <em>Secretary v. Allen, </em>286 Md. 133, 137-141, 406 A.2d 104, 106-109 (1979); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>285 Md. 458, 462-469, 404 A.2d 257, 260-263 (1979). Again, \u00a7 123 is not limited to inmates of an institution, and the majority does not suggest otherwise. Section 123 applies to persons who are not, and have never been, in a correctional institution or place of detention. The only relevance of Galloway\u2019s inmate status may be to the statutory requirement in \u00a7 123(c)(3) that the proscribed conduct be \u201c[wjithout a legal purpose.\u201d Maryland correctional institutions, pursuant to regulations, can censor mail sent by inmates to persons outside of the institutions. <em>See </em>COMAR 12.02.20.02 <em>et seq. See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Thomas v. State, supra, </em>285 Md. 458, 404 A.2d 257. The letters sent by Galloway to Javin were permitted by the institutional authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Furthermore, unlike <em>Rowan v. United States Post Office Department, </em>397 U.S. 728, 90 S.Ct. 1484, 25 L.Ed.2d 736 (1970), relied on by the majority, the case at bar does not involve a clearly and narrowly written statute authorizing a carrier <em>(e.g., </em>the Post Office Department) to refrain from delivering <em>advertisements </em>to recipients who have notified the carrier that they do not wish to receive them, and which is enforceable by a <em>civil </em>remedy. Instead, this is a criminal prosecution, under a vague statute, of one who has repeatedly sent first class mail, expressing feelings, religious views, and apologies, to a person who did not wish to receive such mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Finally, while the majority refers to the principle that the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact \u201c \u2018will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly erroneous\u2019 \u201d (opinion at 650), it should be emphasized that there was no dispute about the basic or historical facts in this case. The case was tried entirely on a written agreed statement of facts which the prosecuting attorney read into the record, plus one additional fact agreed to by the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, and 13 of the letters which were submitted to the trial court as \u201csample[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In addition, contrary to the statement in the majority opinion, the trial judge made no finding that the letters \u201cwere not intended as the dissemination of mere religious instruction.\u201d (Opinion at 650). In rendering his verdict, the trial judge expressly made only one finding of fact, namely that \u201cthe intent of the defendant\u2019s letters was clearly to annoy or to harass.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No finding was made concerning the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>in \u00a7 123(b) for \u201cpeaceable activity intended to ... provide information to others.\u201d At the time the verdict was rendered, no finding was made relating to the element of the offense in \u00a7 123(c)(3) that the conduct be \u201c[wjithout a legal purpose.\u201d No finding was made that the letters themselves contained threats. And, in this connection, Ms. Javin\u2019s statement to the trial court indicated that the grounds for her fears were primarily the events in 1994 and 1995 rather than the letters. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201cMS.

For example, in <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena v. Pr.

It makes no practical difference whichever way it is viewed. The Legislature, in Ch. 129 of the Acts of 1976, expressly stated its intention that the statute should not apply \u2018whenever constitutionally protected rights would be impaired.\u2019 Consequently, from a technical viewpoint, if the retroactive application of the 1976 tax statute to the recordation of written instruments at various times between September 1968 and 1976 would impair taxpayers\u2019 constitutional rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>then, as a matter of legislative intent, the statute does not apply. However, in order to determine the application of Ch. 129 on this statutory interpretation ground, it is obviously necessary to resolve the constitutional question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>See also Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

The majority states that, instead of an intent to harass, alarm, or annoy \u201cthe other person,\u201d a \u201creasonable person standard should be read into the language of subsection (c)(1) of \u00a7 123, and with that judicial gloss, \u00a7 123 survives constitutional scrutiny.\u201d (Opinion at 610-611). Thus, in lieu of \u201cthe other person,\u201d the object of the intent set forth in subsection (c)(1) becomes \u201ca reasonable person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">This Court, however, has generally declined to re-write or insert words into statutory language in order to save the constitutionality of statutes. Just this year, in <em>Montrose Christian School v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 594-596, 770 A.2d 111, 128-129 (2001), we refused to construe the word \u201cpurely\u201d in a statute as \u201cprimarily\u201d or \u201csome\u201d in order to uphold the statute under the First Amendment and Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Instead, we held the statute unconstitutional, pointing out that a substitution of saving language \u201c \u2018would be to re-draft the statute under the guise of construction,\u2019 \u201d <em>Montrose Christian School v.

State, </em>320 Md. 714, 729, 580 A.2d 176, 183 (1990), that \u201c \u2018[gjeneral statutes ..., which, if given their broadest and most encompassing meaning, give rise to constitutional questions, have regularly been the subject of narrowing constructions so as to avoid the constitutional issues.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion at 619). As pointed out in the <em>Schochet </em>opinion, however, there was statutory \u201csilence\u201d on the coverage issue there involved, and there was a long line of decisions in this Court confirming that the statute did not apply under the circumstances of that case. <em>Schochet, </em>320 Md. at 731-734, 580 A.2d at 184-185. The statute involved in the case at bar, however, is not \u201csilent\u201d with regard to the object of the intent set forth in subsection (c)(1). Under the plain language of subsection (c)(1), the defendant must have the intent to \u201charass, alarm, or annoy <em>the other person\u201d </em>and not to \u201charass, alarm or annoy\u201d an objective <em>\u201creasonable person\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Moreover, there is no long line of decisions by this Court applying Art. 27, \u00a7 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Furthermore, in the <em>Schochet </em>case the narrowing interpretation of the statute was employed to reverse the defendant\u2019s criminal conviction; thus, no issue concerning unfair retroactivity was involved. In the present case, however, the defendant allegedly committed the offense and was convicted prior to this Court\u2019s placing a \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the statute. <em>See, e.g., Marks v.

Harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">\u201c(a) <em>Course of conduct defined. </em>\u2014 In this section \u2018course of conduct\u2019 means a persistent pattern of conduct, composed of a series of acts over a period of time, that evidences a continuity of purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-14\">(b) <em>Applicability. </em>\u2014 This section does not apply to any peaceable activity intended to express political views or provide information to others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-15\">(c) <em>Prohibited conduct. </em>\u2014 A person may not follow another person in or about a public place or maliciously engage in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>course of conduct that alarms or seriously annoys another person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">(1) With intent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">(2) After reasonable warning or request to desist by or on behalf of the other person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">(3) Without a legal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">(d) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The conduct proscribed by the statute is set forth in subsection (c), and the State must prove four distinct elements to bring the conduct within the prohibition of subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\"><em>First, </em>the State must prove either that the defendant followed another person in or about a public place or, alternatively, that the defendant maliciously engaged in \u201cconduct that alarms or seriously annoys\u201d the other person. The alternative \u201cengaged in conduct\u201d element was allegedly involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\"><em>Second, </em>under subsection (c)(1), the State must prove that the defendant acted with one of the alternative requisite intents, namely to harass or to alarm or to annoy the other person. Interestingly, with respect to \u201cannoy,\u201d under the initial language of subsection (c) the conduct must in fact \u201cseriously\u201d annoy the other person, whereas the accompanying intent under subsection (c)(1) does not require \u201cserious\u201d annoyance. Also, the prohibited course of conduct under the initial part of subsection (c) is limited to that which alarms or seriously annoys, but the accompanying intent under subsection (c)(1) adds \u201charass\u201d to \u201calarm, or annoy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\"><em>Third, </em>under subsection (c)(2), it must be shown that the defendant had, prior to the charged conduct, been given a reasonable warning or request to desist. This may be the only element of the offense which is set forth with reasonable clarity and is not muddled by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>Fourth, </em>under subsection (c)(3), the prosecution must prove that the defendant acted \u201c[without a legal purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In a case where the State establishes the various elements of the offense set forth in subsection (c), the defendant nevertheless cannot be convicted under \u00a7 123 if his conduct fell within either of the exceptions delineated in subsection (b). Subsection (b) excepts from the coverage of the statute peaceable activity which is intended either \u201cto express political views\u201d or to \u201cprovide information to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Subsection (a) of the statute is the definitional subsection, although it contains a partial definition of only one of the phrases in the statute, namely \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d The statute contains no definitions of \u201charass, alarm, or annoy.\u201d It contains no definitions of the element \u201c[w]ithout a legal purpose\u201d or of the exception for \u201cproviding] information to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Where the conduct prohibited by \u00a7 123 consists of sending communications, the majority indicates that the prohibition relates to \u201c \u2018the manner and means employed to\u2019 \u201d send the communications \u201c \u2018rather than their content\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the statute proscribes conduct, rather than the content of the mailings\u2019 \u201d (opinion at 642, quoting from a Connecticut case). The majority shortly thereafter again indicates that \u201c \u2018[t]he statute is not directed at the content of speech\u2019 \u201d (opinion at 643, n. 35, quoting from a Pennsylvania case). The majority goes on to note that \u201ccontent must be examined\u201d but states that where there is an intent to harass, alarm, or annoy, the content \u201cno longer falls under protected speech\u201d (opinion at 644, n. 36). Later in the opinion, the majority reiterates that content is irrelevant because \u201c[t]he mere sending and receipt of that volume of letters, coming after the warnings to Galloway, <em>even had Javin not opened them, </em>supported a reasonable inference of Galloway\u2019s unlawful intent and adverse effects on the victim.\u201d (opinion at 651-652). The majority\u2019s position seems to be that, where the State establishes the intent, effect, and warning elements of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2), the content of the speech is utterly irrelevant. The majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>view of the statute is puzzling in light of the distinct requirement in subsection (c)(3) that the State prove that the conduct is \u201c[w]ithout a legal purpose\u201d and the exceptions in subsection (b) for the \u201cexpress[ion] of political views\u201d and \u201cprovid[ing] information to others.\u201d How does a court conclude that the sending of letters is without a legal purpose, or is not the expression of political views, or is not the providing of information, without looking at the content of the letters? Somewhat inconsistently, the majority opinion later relies upon the religious <em>content </em>of the letters as evidence supporting a finding which \u201cthe trial judge <em>could\u201d </em>make with regard to Galloway\u2019s intent, (opinion at 651, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">When the prohibited conduct involves speech or the sending of communications, it seems clear that \u00a7 123 is concerned with the <em>content </em>of the speech or communications. This is shown by the exceptions in subsection (b) and the \u201clegal purpose\u201d element in subsection (c)(3). Accordingly, \u00a7 123, when applied to oral or written speech or communications, requires the \u201capplication of the most exacting level of First Amendment scrutiny,\u201d rather than \u201cthe intermediate level of scrutiny,\u201d <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. F.C. C., supra, </em>512 U.S. at 661-662, 114 S.Ct. at 2469, 129 L.Ed.2d at 530. Under either level of scrutiny, however, the statute suffers from overbreadth. Moreover, the inconsistency in the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute, with respect to content, helps make a vague statute even vaguer.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Throughout much of the majority opinion, the Court relies upon the \u201c[without a legal purpose\u201d element in subsection (e)(3) and the exceptions in subsection (b) as \u201climiting language\u201d and \u201cinherent restrictions\u201d having \u201ca definite and clear meaning that helps in setting the boundaries for the enforcement of \u00a7 123\u201d (opinion at 620-622, 627, 630-631, 637). The majority further points to subsections (c)(3) and (b) as \u201crestrictive language [which] helps to abate any overbreadth\u201d (opinion at 644). The Court also relies on these provisions in distinguishing the Maryland statute from statutes in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>jurisdictions which have been held unconstitutional on over-breadth and/or vagueness grounds <em>(e.g., </em>opinion at 620, 648-649).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">After placing so much reliance upon subsections (c)(3) and (b) as \u201cinherent restrictions,\u201d however, the majority goes on in the later part of its opinion to construe and apply these provisions in a way that renders them largely nugatory. At the very least, the majority\u2019s construction and application of subsections (c)(3) and (b) leave a reader in total bewilderment as to the meaning of the provisions. Instead of helping to cure the overbreadth and vagueness associated with \u00a7 123\u2019s prohibition against annoying or alarming conduct, the majority\u2019s construction and application of subsections (c)(3) and (b) exacerbate the statute\u2019s overbreadth and vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">As previously discussed, subsection (c)(3) requires the State to prove, as an element of the \u00a7 123 offense, that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201c[wjithout a legal purpose.\u201d If this provision were given its plain, broad, ordinary meaning, it would materially help to overcome the overbreadth and vagueness inherent in a prohibition against annoying or alarming conduct. Under the plain language of subsection (c)(3), as applied to letters, an illegal purpose would be if the letters solicited someone to commit a crime, or were involved in a criminal conspiracy, or contained threats in violation of another statute, or contained matter in violation of federal law or postal regulations, or were smuggled out of a correctional institution in violation of prison regulations, or discussed plans for an escape from prison. Many other examples of illegal purposes could be set forth. But what is illegal about a series of letters, presumably permitted by prison and postal regulations, from an obsessive former boyfriend containing expressions of religious beliefs, emotional feelings, and apologies for past conduct? In this connection, the trial judge\u2019s remarks to Galloway when he was first sentenced to prison in 1995 are pertinent. Judge Thieme, the sentencing judge, then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUF\">\u201c[Y]ou can write her every day. There is nothing I can do about it. ' You can call her on the phone; there is nothing I can do about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The trial judge in the case at bar, in his opinion denying the defendant\u2019s pre-verdict motions, seemed to hold that Galloway\u2019s letters were without a legal purpose because they were \u201cpersonal.\u201d He did not explain why a \u201cpersonal\u201d communication is without a legal purpose, whereas a non-personal communication would have a legal purpose. If the meaning of subsection (c)(3) is that all \u201cpersonal\u201d conduct is \u201c[wjithout a legal purpose,\u201d the subsection would do very little to cure the overbreadth and vagueness inherent in a statute punishing annoying or alarming conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The majority indicates, and I agree, that \u201clegal purpose\u201d has a clearer and more definite meaning than the phrase \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d found in some statutes which have been invalidated in other jurisdictions, and that \u201c \u2018[l]egal\u2019 derives from or is found in law,\u201d whereas \u201c \u2018legitimate\u2019 ... encompasses that which is legal and beyond.\u201d (Opinion at 636-638). The majority fails to tell us, however, what is not \u201clegal\u201d with respect to sending letters of the type here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Finally, the majority simply concludes its opinion by stating: \u201cIt also is evident from the record that Petitioner acted without a legal purpose.\u201d (Opinion at 652). We are not informed as to what in the record makes this evident. The Court today gives utterly no meaning to subsection (c)(3) and proceeds as if the element were not in the statute. Under these circumstances, the majority\u2019s repeated reliance upon subsection (c)(3), as restrictive language helping to cure \u00a7 123\u2019s overbreadth and vagueness, leaves one dumbfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The same is true of the majority\u2019s treatment of the exception in subsection (b) for \u201cpeaceable activity intended to ... provide information to others.\u201d Again, if this exception were given its plain, broad, ordinary meaning, it would also help in curing the overbreadth and vagueness in the statutory prohibition against annoying or alarming conduct. And the majority initially indicates that the exception is broad, exempting from the statute\u2019s coverage \u201c \u2018constitutionally protected activity.\u2019 \u201d (opinion at 638). Nevertheless, the majority goes on to hold that Galloway\u2019s letters expressing religious views, feel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ings, and apologies do not constitute the expression of constitutionally protected activity. Under the majority\u2019s opinion, it would appear that the conduct of a minister of a religious sect, who repeatedly sends unwanted letters or pamphlets setting forth religious views similar to Galloway\u2019s, to persons who are seriously annoyed by them, would not fall within the exception in subsection (b) and could be criminally punished. On the other hand, according to the majority, repeated \u201ccommercial solicitations\u201d and the sending of \u201cleaflets\u201d concerning \u201cstore openings\u201d (opinion at 638), are protected by the exception in subsection (b). The distinctions suggested by the majority concerning subsection (b) are, to say the least, puzzling.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">With regard to both the \u201clegal purpose\u201d element in subsection (c)(3) and the exceptions in subsection (b), the majority\u2019s ultimate position is set forth towards the end of the opinion where the Court states (Opinion at 650, emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApFA\">\u201cAfter the initial few letters, however, Galloway was warned multiple times that Javin did not wish to receive communications from him. Those instructions notwithstanding, he continued his course by sending a large.number of additional letters. From this, a reasonable fact-finder reasonably could conclude that <em>Galloway\u2019s intent was, in fact, to harass Javin, rather than merely to engage in a peaceable activity, with a legal purpose.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The majority seems to be saying that, if the intent element of subsection (c)(1) is established, then the \u201cpeaceable activity\u201d exceptions in subsection (b) are inapplicable and the \u201c[wjithout legal purpose\u201d element in subsection (c)(3) is proven. This approach renders subsections (b) and (c)(3) entirely nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Obviously, under the structure and wording of the statute, one can send a communication with more than a single intent. One can intend \u201cto harass, alarm, or annoy,\u201d and also intend to furnish information. If conduct is not accompanied by an \u201cintent to harass, alarm, or annoy,\u201d the conduct is not prohibited, and there is no occasion to consider the statutory exemptions in subsection (b) for political views or the providing of information. The exception in \u00a7 123(b) for the expression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>political views or the communicating of information only becomes pertinent and meaningful when the expression or communication is with the intent to harass, alarm, or annoy. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, if a candidate for public office repeatedly mails a \u201cplethora\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of campaign literature to a particular person, after having been informed that the recipient does not wish to receive such political literature, a fact-finder could determine that the candidate had an intent to annoy and that the candidate violated this criminal statute despite the exception for the expression of political views. I do not believe that either the language of \u00a7 123 or the First Amendment or Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights would permit this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Similarly, the \u201c[wjithout legal purpose\u201d element in subsection (c)(3) is totally distinct from the \u201cintent\u201d element in subsection (c)(1). Under Art. 27, \u00a7 123, the State must prove both that the defendant had the \u201cintent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other person\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201c[wjithout a legal purpose.\u201d The majority, by contrasting the intent to harass with legal purpose, and suggesting that the intent to harass negates any legal purpose, has merged two distinct elements into one. Furthermore, under the majority\u2019s view of the Maryland statute, neither subsection (b) nor subsection (c)(3) can serve as language limiting the over-breadth and vagueness inherent in subsections (c) and (c)(1). If proof of the intent element in (c)(1) means that (b) and (c)(3) are inapplicable, they are obviously not restrictions upon the statute\u2019s broad punishment of intentional annoying or alarming conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The majority opinion acknowledges that courts in other jurisdictions have held that harassment statutes, prohibiting conduct intended \u201cto alarm, annoy, or harass\u201d another person, are unconstitutionally overbroad and/or vague. In fact, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>majority of cases over the past 30 years, dealing with the constitutionality under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of harassment statutes similar to Maryland\u2019s Art. 27, \u00a7 123, have held that such statutes are unconstitutional. The Court today, however, purports to distinguish some of those cases on the grounds that the Maryland statute has \u201cinherent limitations\u201d such as the requirement of no \u201clegal purpose\u201d in subsection (c)(3) or the exception for \u201cproviding] information to others\u201d in subsection (b), and that the Maryland statute \u201cis salvageable because we shall employ a limiting construction\u201d by inserting the words \u201creasonable person\u201d in subsection (c)(1). (Opinion at 619). The majority also announces that \u201cwe shall not follow those jurisdictions that have found harassment statutes to be unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">For the reasons set forth above in Part II B of this dissenting opinion, the \u201c[wjithout legal purpose\u201d element in subsection (c)(1), and the exceptions in subsection (b), as construed and applied by the majority today, are not \u201cinherent limitations.\u201d Instead, the majority\u2019s interpretation and application of those provisions enhance the statute\u2019s overbreadth and vagueness. Furthermore, as discussed below, the insertion of \u201creasonable person\u201d language in subsection (c)(1) does not cure the inherent vagueness and overbreadth of a statute which criminally punishes one who intentionally \u201cannoys\u201d or \u201calarms\u201d someone else, regardless of whether the latter is a \u201creasonable person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In rendering his verdict, the trial judge specifically found that Galloway intended \u201cto annoy or to harass\u201d within the meaning of subsection (c)(1) (emphasis supplied). The judge, however, did not explain the difference between \u201cannoy\u201d and \u201charass,\u201d if any, and did not say which intent Galloway had.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 611-614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 1687-1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214, 217 (1971), held that an ordinance which criminally punished persons who assembled on a sidewalk and engaged in \u201cconduct\u201d which was \u201cannoying to persons passing by\u201d was \u201cunconstitutionally vague because it subjects the exercise of the right of assembly to an unascertainable standard, and unconstitutionally broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>because it authorizes the punishment of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d As to vagueness, the Supreme Court continued (402 U.S. at 614, 91 S.Ct. at 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d at 217-218):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY2\">\u201cConduct that annoys some people does not annoy others. Thus, the ordinance is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all. As a result, \u2018men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u2019 <em>Connally v. General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322, 328.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201cIt is said that the ordinance is broad enough to encompass many types of conduct clearly within the city\u2019s constitutional power to prohibit. And so, indeed, it is. The city is free to prevent people from blocking sidewalks, obstructing traffic, littering streets, committing assaults, or engaging in countless other forms of antisocial conduct. It can do so through the enactment and enforcement of ordinances directed with reasonable specificity toward the conduct to be prohibited. <em>Gregory v. Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 118, 124-125, 89 S.Ct. 946, 950, 953-954, 22 L.Ed.2d 134, 139-140, 143-144 (Black, J., concurring). It cannot constitutionally do so through the enactment and enforcement of an ordinance whose violation may entirely depend upon whether or not a policeman is annoyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The same may be said of the \u201cconduct\u201d prohibited by \u00a7 123. Except for the statement in subsection (a) that the conduct must be a pattern consisting of a series of acts, neither the words of the statute nor the majority opinion in this case tell us what type of \u201cconduct\u201d is prohibited. The word \u201cconduct\u201d itself covers virtually the entire range of human activity, and the only statutory limitation as to the type of conduct is that it be repeated and seriously annoying or alarming.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The majority\u2019s insertion of a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard does little or nothing to cure the vagueness. The Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Coates </em>is still applicable even with the insertion of a reasonable person standard, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c[cjonduct that annoys some [reasonable] people does not annoy others.\u201d 402 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>U.S. at 614, 91 S.Ct. at 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d at 217. Repeated letters from an obsessive former boyfriend, setting forth his feelings, apologizing for past conduct, and expressing his religious views, might annoy some reasonable recipients but not annoy other reasonable recipients. While some reasonable persons might be annoyed, other reasonable persons might simply ignore such letters, or suggest that the sender \u201cget a life,\u201d or suggest that he seek professional help, or view him as immature and foolish, or merely feel sorry for him. Although almost anyone who had previously been a victim of the type of criminal activity that Galloway had committed in 1994 and 1995 would be annoyed and alarmed by the repeated letters, neither the statute nor the majority\u2019s interpretation of it is confined to this situation. As earlier discussed, \u00a7 123 is not limited to circumstances where there was prior criminal involvement with the victim, or prior threats of harm, or a prior domestic violence protective order. Such a limited statute might well pass constitutional muster. Such a statute, in the language of <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>would appear to be \u201cdirected with reasonable specificity toward the conduct to be prohibited.\u201d 402 U.S. at 614, 91 S.Ct. at 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d at 217.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The prohibition of annoying conduct in \u00a7 123, however, particularly as interpreted by the majority, is as vague as the prohibition in the statute involved in <em>Coates.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Coates </em>also found that the statute involved was overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>saying (402 U.S. at 615-616, 91 S.Ct. at 1688-1689, 29 L.Ed.2d at 218, footnotes and citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cBut the vice of the ordinance lies not alone in its violation of the due process standard of vagueness. The ordinance also violates the constitutional right of free assembly and association. Our decisions establish that mere public intolerance or animosity cannot be the basis for abridgment of these constitutional freedoms.... The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not permit a State to make criminal the exercise of the right of assembly simply because its exercise may be \u2018annoying\u2019 to some people. If this were not the rule, the right of the people to gather in public places for social or political purposes would be continually subject to summary suspension through the good-faith enforcement of a prohibition against annoying conduct. And such a prohibition, in addition, contains an obvious invitation to discriminatory enforcement against those whose association together is \u2018annoying\u2019 because their ideas, their lifestyle, or their physical appearance is resented by the majority of their fellow citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Similarly, the First and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as Articles 36 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, would ordinarily preclude a state from criminally punishing one who writes letters expressing feelings, religious views, and apologies, to someone with whom the writer had previously cohabited. Again, while these constitutional provisions might allow such punishment under the particular facts of the present case, neither the statutory language nor the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute is so limited. As the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>and numerous other cases, conduct otherwise protected by the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ment cannot be prohibited or punished merely because it annoys, or angers, or offends, or induces unrest, or is objectionable to, or is obnoxious to others. <em>See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 408-409, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342, 356 (1989) (relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Coates v. Cincinnati); City of Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 459-467, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508-2512, 2512, 96 L.Ed.2d 398, 410-415 (1987) (same); <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 521-528, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105-1109, 31 L.Ed.2d 408, 413-418 (1972); <em>Cohen v.

Moreover, the \u201cother persons\u201d referred to in these and similar cases have often been large segments of the general public; consequently, they would seem to include \u201creasonable persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The majority distinguishes the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>saying: \u201cThe Maryland statute is distinguishable because it proscribes a course of conduct and requires specific intent on the part of the defendant ...\u201d (opinion at 622, n. 16). The ordinance involved in <em>Coates, </em>like \u00a7 123, prohibited \u201cconduct\u201d which was \u201cannoying.\u201d While the <em>Coates </em>ordinance may not have required repeated activity, this difference has little or no relevance to the vagueness or overbreadth inherent in punishing \u201cannoying\u201d conduct. The factor of repetition does not clarify the vagueness or over-breadth associated with the words \u201cannoy\u201d or \u201calarm.\u201d The same is true of the adjective \u201cserious\u201d which modifies \u201cannoy.\u201d While the requirements of repetition or seriousness may slightly reduce the number of prosecutions under the statute, they shed no light on what constitutes the prohibited \u201cannoying'conduct.\u201d Moreover, where activity is protected by the First Amendment and Articles 36 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, the protection applies to repeated activity as well as a single episode.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Likewise, the requirement of a specific intent to annoy or alarm in subsection (c)(1) of the Maryland statute does not cast any light on what type of conduct is criminally \u201cannoying\u201d or \u201calarming.\u201d The same vague and broad language used in the initial part of subsection (c) is also used in subsection (c)(1) containing the intent requirement. Prohibiting <em>intentional </em>unknown conduct is just as vague as prohibiting unintentional unknown conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Furthermore, activity protected by the First Amendment and Articles 36 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights remains protected when it is intentional. In fact, most conduct protected by the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion is intentional. With a few exceptions not applicable here, neither the element of intent nor the element of malice removes from oral or written speech the protections of the First Amendment and Articles 36 and 40 of the Declaration of Rights. As the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, </em>485 U.S. 46, 53, 108 S.Ct. 876, 880, 99 L.Ed.2d 41, 50 (1988),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cmany things done with motives that are less than admirable are protected by the First Amendment. In <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964), we held that even when a speaker or writer is motivated by hatred or illwill his expression was protected by the First Amendment.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\"><em>Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>as well as many other cases invalidating statutory provisions which attempt to punish annoying conduct, are not distinguishable from the present case on any principled or logical basis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A case involving a prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>under a harassment statute similar to Maryland\u2019s, for mailing a large number of \u201cannoying\u201d written documents, is <em>Bolles v. People of Colorado, </em>189 Colo. 394, 541 P.2d 80 (1975). The facts in <em>Bolles </em>were that the defendant mailed to various homes 2400 pieces of mail. Each piece of mail contained, in a plain envelope, \u201ctwelve points of information regarding abortion and its practice.... It also included a color brochure portraying numerous aborted fetuses and one live baby.\u201d <em>Bolles, </em>189 Colo, at 396, 541 P.2d at 81. The defendant was prosecuted under a Colorado statute which was more limited than Maryland\u2019s, and which provided for the punishment of one who \u201ccommunicates with a person, anonymously or otherwise by telephone, telegraph, mail, or any other form of communication, in a manner likely to harass or cause alarm,\u201d and with the \u201cintent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person.\u201d In holding that the statute was overbroad and unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the Supreme Court of Colorado stated (189 Colo, at 397-398, 541 P.2d at 82):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cHowever, a statute intended to proscribe unprotected activity must not also proscribe activity protected under the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201cIn short, in the First Amendment area, a statute must be narrowly drawn to implement legitimate and constitutional legislative purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cThe statute before us in this case is anything but narrowly drawn. It could, of course, be relied upon to punish for obscene, libelous, riotous communication which is probably constitutionally permissible. Yet the crucial factor is that this statute could also be used to prosecute for communications that cannot be constitutionally proscribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cTo illustrate the overbreadth of this statute, it is useful to first define some of the significant terms used in the statute. According to <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, </em>(3d ed. Unabridged, 1961), \u2018annoy\u2019 means \u2018to irritate with a nettling or exasperating effect.\u2019 \u2018Nettling\u2019 means \u2018to arouse displeasure, impatience, or anger in: provoke, vex.\u2019 \u2018Alarm\u2019 means \u2018to arouse to a sense of danger; to put on the alert; to strike with fear; fill with anxiety as to threaten danger or harm.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">\u201cIf we substitute these definitions in place of the terms used in the statute, we find that one is guilty of the crime of harassment if he intends to \u2018alarm\u2019 another person-arouse to a sense of danger-and communicates to that other person in a manner likely to cause alarm. It would therefore be criminal in Colorado to forecast a storm, predict political trends, warn against illnesses, or discuss anything that is of any significance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">\u201cSo, also, if one has the intent to annoy \u2014 to irritate with a nettling or exasperating effect \u2014 and he communicates with another in a manner that is likely to cause alarm \u2014 to put on the alert \u2014 he too is guilty of harassment. The absurdity of this is patently obvious to anyone who envisions our society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in anything but a state of languid repose. The First Amendment is made of sterner stuff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The lower court in the <em>Bolles </em>case had \u201cattempted to save the statute from successful constitutional attack by engrafting onto it a statement that it applied only to conduct engaged in for \u2018no legitimate purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bolles, </em>189 Colo. at 398, 541 P.2d at 83. The Colorado Supreme Court, however, pointed out that the inserted language itself \u201cinjects a vagueness into the statute which cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The same is true of the \u201c[wjithout legal purpose\u201d element of the Maryland statute as construed and applied by the majority today.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">With respect to the prosecution\u2019s argument in <em>Bolles </em>that a recipient\u2019s \u201cright of privacy in the home justifies the broad wording of the subsection in question\u201d (189 Colo, at 399, 541 P.2d at 83), the Supreme Court of Colorado responded <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apd\">\u201cUse of the mail to convey one\u2019s message no doubt encroaches on the sanctity of the home; however, the intrusion into the recipient\u2019s privacy is only minimal since he is not only free to discard at once any mail that he does not wish to receive, but can also ensure that he will not receive any more like it from the sender. <em>See Rowan v. United States Post Office Department, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Factually similar to the present case is <em>Kramer v. Price, </em>712 F.2d 174 (5th Cir.1983), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge John Minor Wisdom, held that the Texas harassment statute was unconstitutionally vague. The Texas statute was also more specific than Maryland\u2019s harassment statute, as the proscribed conduct under the Texas statute was limited to certain types of telephone and written communications. It provided for the punishment of one who intentionally \u201ccommunicates by telephone or in writing in vulgar, profane, obscene, or indecent language or in a coarse and offensive manner\u201d and, by such \u201caction intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly annoys or alarms the recipient,\u201d 712 F.2d at 176. The defendant in the <em>Kramer </em>case was a former girlfriend of John Keiser, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>cohabited with Reiser, and who, after Reiser\u2019s marriage to another woman, had mailed to him letters and postcards that \u201cwere so voluminous that they filled two to three grocery sacks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175 n. 1. Also, one of the letters was clearly threatening to Reiser\u2019s and his wife\u2019s new baby. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, relying on and quoting from <em>Coates v. Cincinnati, supra, </em>and pointing to the \u201cinherent vagueness\u201d in \u201cthe terms \u2018annoy\u2019 and \u2018alarm,\u2019 \u201d held that \u201cthe statute falls on vagueness grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Other cases holding similar statutory language unconstitutional, on overbreadth and/or vagueness grounds, include, <em>e.g., People v.

Moreover, \u00a7 123 itself might well be constitutional if the majority were willing to give effect to the plain language of subsection (b) which broadly exempts the providing of information and of subsection (c)(3) which requires the State to prove illegality of purpose. Giving effect to the plain language of subsections (b) and (c)(3) would substantially limit and clarify the broad and vague words in (c) and (c)(1). Of course, giving effect to the words of subsections (b) and (c)(3) would require a reversal of Galloway\u2019s conviction in the present case. With all due respect, it is anomalous that the majority is willing to re-write subsection (c)(1) in order to sustain the conviction, but it is not willing to apply the literal language enacted by the General Assembly in subsections (b) and (c)(3) which would result in a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">This case is a classic example of the saying that hard cases make bad law. No reasonable person would condone Galloway\u2019s atrocious conduct. Nevertheless, sustaining his conviction and 90 day additional sentence is not worth obfuscating the language of statutory provisions or failing to apply important constitutional safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge RAKER have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein and join this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\">. The majority states (opinion at 609, n. 5) that the petitioner \"makes no arguments under the Maryland Constitution or Declaration of Rights.\u201d The single question presented in the petition for a writ of certiorari, and repeated verbatim in the petitioner's brief, was not limited to the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Constitution. Instead, the question presented was broadly worded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYEX\">\"Did the trial court err in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and in convicting him of harassment under Md.

The majority seems to assert that the petitioner\u2019s over-breadth and vagueness arguments in his brief and reply brief are based solely on federal constitutional grounds and not on state constitutional grounds. Except for a few references on two different pages to \"First Amendment guarantees,\u201d or \"liberties\u201d or \"expression,\u201d the petitioner's overbreadth and vagueness arguments in his briefs are general and equally applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment or the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Moreover, in cases decided by the Court of Special Appeals, or by a circuit court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the issues before this Court are determined by the certiorari petition, any cross-petition, and any order of this Court limiting or expanding the issues.

As pointed out above, however, \u00a7 123 is not such a statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. Furthermore, the overbreadth doctrine would not be applicable in the <em>Rowan </em>situation because \"the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.\u201d <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v.

This paragraph was from the trial judge\u2019s written opinion of October 28, 1998, denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial judge rendered his verdict at a proceeding on November 4, 1998, after hearing arguments on \"guilt or innocence as to the harassment charge.\u201d Thereafter on November 4th, the trial court went on to conduct a sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\">.

The majority opinion in the present case relies on <em>Monhollen </em>(opinion at 629-631), although the statute involved in <em>Monhollen </em>was obviously more restrictive, clear, and specific than Maryland\u2019s Art. 27, \u00a7 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\">. In a much more limited statute than Art. 27, \u00a7 123, the insertion of a \"reasonable person\u201d standard might help to cure some of the vagueness. This was the situation in the Indiana case relied on by the majority (opinion at 628, n. 25), where the statute was restricted to harassing telephone calls. <em>Kinney v. Indiana, </em>404 N.E.2d 49 (1980). Furthermore, the <em>Kinney </em>case involved only a challenge under the Indiana constitution. This was also the situation in the California case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>relied on by the majority (opinion at 628) where the stalking statute there involved was more limited than \u00a7 123, as it required <em>inter alia, </em>a \"credible threat ... with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear of death or great bodily injury.\" <em>The People v. Ewing, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 199, 210, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 184 (1999). In addition, the conviction in <em>Ewing </em>was reversed for insufficient evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\">. The majority (opinion at 631-632) relies on two cases for the assertion that a requirement of repeated conduct mitigates against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>vagueness, namely <em>United States v. Smith, </em>685 A.2d 380 (D.C.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 856, 118 S.Ct. 152, 139 L.Ed.2d 98 (1997), and <em>Johnson v. Indiana, </em>648 N.E.2d 666 (Ind.App.1995). Both of these cases involved stalking statutes which were much more restrictive than Maryland's broad harassment prohibition in Art. 27, \u00a7 123. In fact, the Maryland prohibition against stalking is in an entirely different statute, Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.). Art. 27, \u00a7 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\">. The majority opinion in the case at bar also suggests (opinion at 622, n. 16) that the holdings of <em>Coates v. Cincinnati </em>were \"put in doubt\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>the opinion in <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972). An examination of the subsequent Supreme Court cases reveals utterly no basis for the majority\u2019s suggestion. <em>Colten v. Kentucky </em>involved a disorderly conduct statute which was entirely different from either the statute involved in <em>Coates </em>or the Maryland statute involved in the present case. The statute involved in <em>Colten </em>specifically prohibited the refusal \"to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse,\u201d and the defendant there did refuse to comply with such lawful crder of the police. The statute in <em>Colten </em>was so different from the statute in <em>Coates </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Colten </em>opinion does not even cite <em>Coates. </em>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has cited <em>Coates </em>with approval and relied on <em>Coates </em>in numerous cases decided after <em>Colten. See, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342, 356 (1989); <em>City of Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 465 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2511-2512 n. 15, 96 L.Ed.2d 398, 414 n. 15 (1987); <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v.

The majority opinion correctly points out (opinion at 624-625) that the United States Court of Appeals in <em>Kramer, </em>with regard to vagueness, relied upon the failure of the Texas Courts to interpret the statute as incorporating a \"reasonable person standard.\u201d What the majority opinion overlooks or blurs, is that the court in <em>Kramer </em>found <em>two </em>\u201cinfirmities\u201d in the Texas statute which could have been cured by state court interpretations but were not. The first was that the \"Texas Courts have made no attempt to construe the terms 'annoy\u2019 and 'alarm' in a manner which lessens their inherent vagueness.\u201d 712 F.2d at 178. The second was that \"the Texas courts have refused to construe the statute to indicate whose sensibilities must be offended.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While the <em>Kramer </em>court may have emphasized the second infirmity, the opinion clearly indicates that either would require the invalidation of the statute on vagueness grounds. In the context of the Maryland statute, for the reasons previously set forth, I do not believe that the insertion of a \"reasonable person\u201d standard cures either the vagueness or the overbreadth. In this connection, it should be noted that the <em>Kramer </em>opinion was limited to the ground of vagueness; it did not discuss overbreadth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\">. At times the majority opinion in the case at bar makes flat statements about what is and what is not covered by Art. 27, \u00a7 123, without setting forth any satisfactory basis for the statements. For example, as to whether the prohibition of \"a course of conduct that alarms or seriously annoys another person\u201d covers \"[tele]phone calls from creditors,\u201d the majority states that the statute \"was in no way intended to cover such situations,\u201d and cites its discussion of the legislative history. (Opinion at 635-637). Nothing in the legislative history set forth in the majority opinion <em>(id. </em>at 612-613) lends the slightest support to the majority\u2019s assertion. While the report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, quoted by the majority, refers to \"disputes between neighbors, [and] former boyfriends and girlfriends,\u201d the report goes on to refer to harassment generally. What might be covered beyond neighbor disputes and boyfriend-girlfriend disputes is not disclosed by either the legislative history or the statutory language. The history and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>statutory language set forth in subsection (c) and (c)(1) are certainly broad enough to cover unwanted repeated telephone calls from creditors and tele-marketers, particularly at dinner time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
