Amongst his customers was one Mrs. Pica named in the information. Evidence was presented on the part of the People tending to show that on October 21, 1921, defendant delivered to Mrs. Pica a quantity of coal, that he told Mrs. Pica he had delivered two tons and he would call on Saturday, give her a slip and collect for the same, that he had paid $19.00 or $20.00 for the coal and that he wanted $26.50 for the two tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Two inspectors of weights and measures for the city of Mew York, on the afternoon of October 21, observed defendant with his horse and wagon enter the coal yard of the Wyoming Valley Company, drive upon the scales and after his wagon was weighed drive into the coal yard, load his wagon with coal, then pass out on to the scales where the wagon and contents were again weighed, the scales indicating 3,450 pounds of coal on the wagon, for which the weighmaster gave defendant a ticket showing that amount and told him it cost $19.15 at $11.25 a ton. Defendant paid the price, took the ticket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>drove directly to the house of Mrs. Pica and delivered the coal in the cellar. He was followed by the inspectors. After the coal was delivered defendant was about to get upon his wagon when he was approached by the inspectors and asked how much he charged for coal. Defendant replied $13.25 a ton. One of the inspectors disclosed his identity and said \u201c let us go into the cellar;\u201d they went and there found Mrs. Pica, the purchaser, her son and the man who assisted defendant in carrying in the\" coal. In the presence of the defendant, the inspector said to Mrs. Pica, \u201c This man says he delivered coal to you at $13.25 a ton.\u201d Mrs. Pica replied, \u201c That\u2019s what he told me,\u201d and the inspector further testified as follows: \u201c I said, \u2018 How much coal did you order?\u2019 She said, \u2018 two tons.\u2019 I turned to defendant and says, \u2018 How much coal did you deliver here ? \u2019 He says, <em>\u2018 </em>two ton.\u2019 I said, <em>\u2018 </em>Are you sure you delivered two tons to this woman? \u2019 He said, \u2018 Sure.\u2019 I said, \u2018 You charged her $13.25 a ton ? \u2019 He said,\u2018 Yes.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Did you collect ? \u2019 He said, <em>\u2018 </em>Ho, I didn\u2019t collect for it yet, but it is all right, I know the people.\u2019 I said tti him, \u2018 Are you sure you delivered two tons of coal to this woman ? \u2019 He said, <em>\u2018 </em>Sure.\u2019 I said to him, \u2018 Mow why do you lie, you didn\u2019t have two tons of coal on your wagon, why did you tell the woman you had two tons ? \u2019 \u2018 Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018 Inspector it was two hundred pounds short.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Give me the ticket for that coal.\u2019 \u201d Defendant then gave the inspector a ticket showing he had purchased coal from William Mungasser, and said that ticket represented the coal that he bought, that it was two hundred pounds short.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The inspector then said to defendant: \u201c Why this [ticket] is from the Mungasser Goal Company; you didn\u2019t get that coal there; you didn\u2019t have 3,150 pounds.\u201d He said: \u201c I did.\u201d The inspector said: <em>\u201c </em>We followed you from the Wyoming Valley Company where you bought 3,450 pounds; give us that ticket.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t have it, and the inspector said: <em>\u201c </em>You give us that ticket or I will bring you to the station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>house and find it.\u201d He then produced a ticket from the Wyoming Valley Company, and the inspector said: \u201cThat\u2019s the ticket, that\u2019s what we saw you buy and that\u2019s what you delivered as two tons,\u201d and gave defendant a summons. Both tickets were received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The evidence of the inspector was corroborated by the second inspector and in material respects by the son of Mrs. Pica, who testified that defendant told his mother in reply to a question put by her as to how many tons he had delivered, \u201c Two tons,\u201d that he had paid $19 or $20 for it and he wanted $26.50 for the two tons, and heard defendant tell the inspector that he had delivered two tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of the transaction was that after Mrs. Pica asked him for two tons of coal that he replied: \u201c I will fill up the wagon, whatever it goes you get.\u201d \u201c Then when I brought the coal and I delivered it she asked me, \u2018 how much is this ? \u2019 \u2018 Well,\u201d I said, <em>\u2018 </em>This bill it cost me $19.00'or $20.00, I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Have you got the money ? \u2019 She said, \u2018 Ho, I will pay you little by little, just as I can,\u2019 and I said, \u2018 When you have paid, then I will give you the bill.\u2019 Then I came out, it was all over and I met the inspector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Whether or not Mrs. Pica contracted with defendant to purchase and defendant to sell to her two tons of coal, and defendant claimed to have delivered to Mrs. Pica two tons of coal, and knowingly delivered but 3,450 pounds of .coal, while charging her for two tons, was a question of fact for determination by the Court of Special Sessions which resolved the question adverse to the defendant, and such conclusion was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The evidence adduced upon the trial has been quoted for the purpose of aiding in the solution of a well-defined construction of section 2411, Penal Law, which has been overlooked in the decision in this case and a reiteration of which may be a guide to the courts in future cases arising under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In People v. Sheffield Farms-Slawson-Decker Co. (206 N. Y. <em>79) </em>we had under consideration an appeal by the defendant from a conviction of a violation of section 2411, Penal Law. The defendant there was charged and convicted of having sold and delivered to one Mills several boxes of butter upon representation that each box contained two pounds while as matter of fact it was found that each box contained several ounces less weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Construing section 2411, Penal Law, we held that the offense ' which the statute -creates may be committed in one of two ways: (1) By using a false weight, measure or other apparatus, with knowledge that the same is false; (2) by knowingly delivering less than the quantity represented. In other words, that the section of the law relates to a single misdemeanor, and it is, therefore, immaterial by what particular means the statute may be violated. The purpose of the statute is to enforce honest dealing by punishing frauds and the protection of the public against false weights and measures. .</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The defendant here was charged with knowingly delivering 3,450 pounds of coal, which was loss than the quantity purchased and represented by defendant as having been delivered, to wit, two tons. The fact is evident that the Special Sessions found that Mrs. Pica ordered two tons of coal; that defendant delivered to her 3,450 pounds, representing the quantity to be two tons; that defendant had the slip showing the true weight in his possession, and, therefore, when he delivered the coal upon the representation that the quantity delivered was two tons, he knowingly delivered less than the quantity he represented. Such conclusion, when made upon evidence tending to sustain the same, is sufficient to justify a finding of violation of the statute. Neither is it material that Mrs. Pica did not pay for the coal at the time of delivery of the same. Defendant was privileged to sell and she to purchase the same on credit. The section of the Penal Law omits reference to the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of terms of sale or payment and in the present case was violated if at all by defendant knowingly delivering less than the quantity represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Counsel for defendant relies solely on the case of People v. Goldberg (146 App. Div. 950) as sustaining his position that the Appellate Division was in error in granting a new trial and failing to discharge' defendant. We reach a contrary conclusion. In that case, as stated in the opinion therein delivered, it appeared that defendant, who was engaged in business as a butcher, was charged with a violation of section 2411, Penal Law, in that he sought to charge for a turkey claimed by him to weigh eleven pounds when, in fact, it weighed but ten and one-half pounds. The court stated there was no claim that false weights were used and that the conviction must rest, if at all, on the contention that defendant had injured or defrauded the purchaser in some way by delivering less than the quantity of the article as represented; that as the purchaser did not retain possession of the turkey and the sale was never actually consummated he was not injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In view of our decision in People v. Sheffield Farms-Slawson-Decker Co. (supra), if defendant in the Goldberg Case had weighed the turkey upon his scales and such scales showed eleven pounds, whereas in truth and in fact the fowl weighed only ten and one-half pounds, upon ample evidence of such fact and knowledge on his part he might have been convicted of using false weights for determining the quantity of the commodity irrespective of the person to whom the sale was proposed to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Akin to the case at bar we have had occasion to pass upon appeals in actions brought to recover a penalty for violation of municipal ordinances prohibiting the offer for sale of any commodity at a greater weight than the true weight thereof, and construed the ordinances as a prohibition against defraud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ing purchasers of commodities when sold by weight or measure. (City of New York v. Steen, 233 N. Y. 595.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Our conclusion is that the Appellate Division was in error in the determination made in its order. As the People did not seek a review of the same by cross-appeal, we are required to affirm the order in so far as it grants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Hiscock, Ch. J., Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Crane, and Andrews, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
