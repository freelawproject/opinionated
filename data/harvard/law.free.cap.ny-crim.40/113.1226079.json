My opinion is that such omission is not criminal. A strict construction limits the meaning of these words of the statute to the kind of service prescribed in the law, namely, \u201c water, heat, light, power, elevator service, telephone service \u201d or other service of a like kind and which serves to accomplish the same results and purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">I vote to sustain the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Justices Salmon and Herrman also voted to sustain the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
