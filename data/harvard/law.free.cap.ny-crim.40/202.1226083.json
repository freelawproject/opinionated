It appears from all the evidence in the case that what the defendants actually did was to take off their clothes in a secluded spot and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to go in swimming in trunks or bathing suits, in a place which was private property and remote from any public highway and a considerable distance from the nearest dwelling, being a farm house, in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">We do not think that the evidence returned establishes the facts charged in the complaint or any disorderly conduct tending to a breach of the peace by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Judgment of conviction reversed on the facts, complaint dismissed, defendants discharged and the fines paid by the several appellants ordered to be returned to them respectively. (All concur.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
