The statement of the magistrate that the defendant had a \u201c very bad record \u201d is not borne out by the return on appeal. In fact, a certified copy of the complaint, which is made part of the return, has endorsed thereon \u201c No Previous Record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The defendant having actually been incarcerated in the workhouse since his conviction on November 1, 1922, we order that the judgment of conviction shall be modified to the time of imprisonment already served, and that, as modified, the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
