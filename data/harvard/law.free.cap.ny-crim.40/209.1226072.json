J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The information before the magistrate in this case charged the defendant with being a vagrant under provisions found in article 8 of the Tenement House Law, section 150. As necessary proof in such case, it must appear that the acts committed occurred in a tenement house. Therefore, the fact of the place being a tenement house is of the essence of the offense here charged. There is no proof in the record returned that the place specified was a tenement house. \u201eThe fact that the defendant did not specifically point out this defect in the proofs against him will not sustain the judgment in the absence of such proofs. The rule is well stated by Mr. Justice Mullin in Babcock v. People (15 Hun, 347) at pages 352, 353, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u201c When the public prosecutor fails to prove some fact on the trial that is necessary to be proved, .in order to justify a conviction, the prisoner\u2019s counsel must call the attention of the court and counsel to the omission; and if he does not, and conviction follows, the prisoner cannot afterward insist upon the defect of proof as a ground for reversing the judgment. But when there is in fact no legal proof of the offense charged in the indictment, it is the duty of the court to direct a verdict in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>favor of the accused, or upon appeal to reverse the. judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">I therefore vote to reverse the judgment and order a new trial in the Magistrate\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Judgment of conviction reversed for errors of fact and a new trial is ordered to he held in the City Magistrate\u2019s Court, Twelfth District, Borough of Manhattan, on the 2d day of January, 1923, at the opening of court thereof. Bail one thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
