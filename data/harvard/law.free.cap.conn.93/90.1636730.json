On December 27th, 1917, the plaintiff, while employed in unloading bags of coal from the defendant\u2019s wagon, froze the fingers of both hands. He notified his employer the next morning, and was advised to consult a physician. The employer intended to indicate to the plaintiff that he should have medical attention at the expense of his.employer; but the representative of the employer corporation, who talked with the plaintiff, did not express that intention, nor did he provide medical attention. The plaintiff did not consult any physician, and attempted to treat the fingers at home. About two weeks after the injury he did consult a physician and then received treatment at the Hartford Hospital. Had he received prompt medical attention the period of disability would have been considerably shortened. The Commissioner also found, as conclusions, that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was not unreasonable, that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and that as a result of the injury the plaintiff had been since January 6th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>1918, totally incapacitated and would continue to be incapacitated for several weeks. Compensation was awarded beginning January 13th, 1918. The Superior Court made no change in or addition to the Commissioner\u2019s findings of facts, but in its memorandum of decision directed that the award be set aside on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was due to his own neglect.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\"><em>William H. Macdonald, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-7\"><em>Joseph Shelnitz, </em>for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-8\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">The ruling of the Superior Court, that compensation should have been denied because the plaintiff\u2019s condition was due to his own neglect to accept or provide medical service until about two weeks after the injury, is erroneous, for the reason that the statute itself provides that the penalty for such neglect shall be a suspension of all right of compensation <em>\u201c </em>during such refusal or failure.\u201d General Statutes, \u00a7 5347. Possibly an employee\u2019s refusal to accept or failure to provide medical treatment, might be carried to such an extent as to amount to wilful and serious misconduct, which, by analogy with \u00a7 5341, would justify a denial of any compensation whatever; but this is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Since the compensation award began as of January 13th, 1918, more than two weeks after the injury, and therefore after the plaintiff first consulted a physician, the award would be unobjectionable, even if the appeal record were in such form as to make it possible for us to reject the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was reasonable and to adopt the contrary conclusion emphatically expressed in the memorandum of decision filed by the Superior Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It is apparent from the memorandum that the trial court reached its conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was unreasonable and negligent, by independently weighing the evidence before the Commissioner, as contained in a certified transcript accompanying the appeal. We cannot follow the court into that field of inquiry, because the findings of subsidiary facts on which the Commissioner based his conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was reasonable, stand uncorrected on the record. That being so, they furnish the only bases of facts for testing the correctness of his conclusions, either in the Superior Court or in this court; and so tested, his conclusion is unquestionably sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">It may also be observed that there was no occasion for a certified transcript of the evidence on the appeal to the Superior Court, because none of the reasons of appeal asked for the correction of any specific finding of a subsidiary fact. The Superior Court may, by an order in the nature of writ of <em>certiorari, </em>require the whole or any part of the transcript of evidence to be certified up and make it a part of the appeal record, whenever it appears necessary to do so in order to protect the substantial rights of parties not represented by counsel, but ordinarily no part of the evidence before the Commissioner , should be certified to the Superior Court unless the reasons of appeal ask for the correction or omission of some specific finding as to a subsidiary fact, or the addition of a material fact not found. The first and second reasons of appeal on this record, which allege that \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to warrant\u201d the Commissioner in finding (a) that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and (b) that as a result of the injury the claimant was incapacitated as found, do not present any assignable reasons of appeal. They simply invite the Superior Court to ignore the Commissioner\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of subsidiary facts and to retry the ultimate issues upon an independent examination of a transcript of the evidence before the Commissioner. We have repeatedly held that this cannot be done. \u201cThe court cannot review conclusions of facts made by a Commissioner which merely concern the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 153, 93 Atl. 245. \u201cThe Superior Court cannot on appeal retry the facts.\u201d <em>Kennerson </em>v. <em>Thames Towboat Co., </em>89 Conn. 367, 370, 94 Atl. 372. \u201cThe power of the Superior Court in the correction of a finding of the Compensation Commissioner is analogous to, and its method of correcting the finding similar to, the power and method of this court in correcting the findings of the Superior Court.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>90 Conn. 444, 446, 97 Atl. 328. \u201cThe trial court does not retry the facts. It decides the appeal upon the finding as made by the Commissioner, unless the appeal assigns, as error, the finding or omission to find any facts, and the court finds that facts have been found or omitted which, if found, in accordance with the evidence, would affect the result. \u2022 The right of the trial court to correct the finding of the Commissioner is similar to that exercised by us upon a proper appeal over the finding of a trial court.\u201d <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Latham, </em>92 Conn. 87, 90, 101 Atl. 492. The reference in <em>Blanton </em>v. <em>Wheeler &amp; Howes Co., </em>91 Conn. 226, 99 Atl. 494, to the introduction of evidence in the Superior Cotut, must be understood as restricted to evidence offered for the purpose of correcting the appeal record so as to make it present the questions which the appellant desires to have reviewed by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">There is error, and the cause is remanded with direction to enter a judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">In this opinion the other judges, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
