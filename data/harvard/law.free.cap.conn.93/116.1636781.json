So long as any of the mortgage indebtedness remained, the plaintiff was not entitled to have the mortgage discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">The plaintiff says in her brief: \u201cThe principal questions involved are two in number: first, whether after the giving of a mortgage, an amount found due on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>oral accounting and involving items having nothing whatever to do with the mortgage debt, can by an oral agreement be brought within the mortgage security.\u201d The trial judge expressly states that he has not ruled upon this question, and that the only ruling made by him was that none of the claims of the plaintiff, as to the payment of the balance due upon the mortgage, could be sustained. In view of this ruling the question did not arise in the case and ought not to have been made a part of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The second question which the plaintiff characterizes as of principal importance is, that, a judgment having been rendered upon the equitable issues for the defendant, another judge \u201cwhile the case is still to the jury, and without further evidence,\u201d could not render a final judgment upon the legal issue involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">It would be a sufficient answer to this claim to point out that the final judgment recites that \u201cthe court having heard the parties finds the legal issues in favor of the defendant.\u201d Nothing in the record contradicts this finding, and since the appeal does not question its accuracy, we are bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Aside from this, the legal damage claimed is that which flows from the failure to execute and deliver a quitclaim of the mortgage after the same had been paid. Since the finding is that the mortgage has not been paid, there exists no basis for a claim for legal damages, and there was no occasion for the court to grant a further hearing; a judgment upon the claim for legal damage follows this finding as a matter of course, and that, too, without a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The only other ruling complained of is the order that the equitable issues \u201cbe tried by the court and tried first.\u201d The case presented upon these issues was one which, prior to January 1st, 1880, was properly cognizable in equity, and an order that the equitable issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>be tried to the court, was one within the discretion of the court, as was, too, the order that these issues be tried first. General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 5752-5755.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
