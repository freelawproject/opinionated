The automobile at the time of the accident was in the exclusive control and custody, of the Blue Ribbon Garage. When the accident took place the plaintiff had applied for the registration of this automobile in her name. This was issued to her the day after the accident happened. At this time the automobile bore the numbers and nameplate of the Blue Ribbon Garage, issued by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. It was conceded that the automobile of the plaintiff at the time of the collision was operated by one Edward J. Kiely, father of the plaintiff, a person more than sixteen years of age, and that Kiely had not, at that time, obtained from the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a license to operate a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the State; that at the time of the collision, Kiely, operating the automobile of the plaintiff, was accompanied by one Emil Engleman, an employee of the Blue Ribbon Garage, who had been licensed previously to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of the State, and that Engleman at this time did not have with him his license card issued to him by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">In the complaint negligence was alleged, among other things, in driving the automobile at a dangerous and unlawful rate of speed, without regard for the safety and rights of others lawfully using the highway; in not having the automobile equipped with proper appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>anees for stopping; and in not giving the plaintiff the right of way when she was approaching an intersecting street on the defendants\u2019 right-hand side of the roadway, as required by the Public Acts of 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">These allegations were denied, and the defendants in their answer and in the second defense also, averred that the motor vehicle which was alleged to have been injured by the negligence of the defendants, was not, at the time of the injury claimed, operated in accordance with the statutes of the State of Connecticut, nor was it then registered in accordance with the statutes regarding the registration, numbering, use, licensing and speed of motor vehicles; and that it was not operated by a person legally authorized or licensed to operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of Connecticut.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">Section 1565 of the General Statutes, on which defendants rely, is as follows: \u201cNo recovery shall be had in the courts of this state by the owner of a motor vehicle which has not been legally registered in accordance with sections 1524, 1525, 1526, 1527 or 1528, for injury to person or property received by reason of the operation of such motor vehicle upon any public highway, unless such motor vehicle is the property of a nonresident and is within the provisions of section 1537; nor shall such recovery be had if said motor vehicle be legally registered but was being operated by an unlicensed person in violation of any provision of sections 1530, 1531 or 1532.\u201d Section 1552, relating to the construction of the Motor Vehicle Law, provides that \u201cthis chapter shall be construed with reason and in a manner to cause no undue hardship to any person who is not wilfully or knowingly guilty of a violation thereof. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">The reasons of appeal assign error in failing to direct a verdict for the defendants, in the refusal of the court to charge as requested, and in the charge as given.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Robert H.

Upon this branch of the case the jury were instructed as follows: \u201cThe defendants further claim that because it is admitted that the chauffeur, while a licensed driver, did not have his license with him at the time of the collision, the plaintiff is prevented from a recovery in this case. I instruct you that that is not the law. If you find the facts to be as claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, to wit, that the chauffeur was a licensed driver and that he was called away suddenly from his work upon some other car to take out this agent of the plaintiff to instruct him in the operation of this ear, then temporarily in the custody of the garage, his employer, the fact that he forgot to take his license with him does not of itself prevent a recovery in this case.\u201d This instruction was correct. Subsection \u201c (c) \u201d of \u00a7 1532 of the General Statutes, provides that the operator\u2019s license shall be carried by the licensee and shall be subject to examination upon demand by any proper officer. But if an operator has fully complied with the law and obtained a valid and subsisting license, he does not become an \u201cunlicensed person\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1565, merely by omitting to carry it on his person. The penalty for faffing to carry a license is fixed by \u00a7 1554, which provides for a suspension of the license for not more than thirty days for a first violation, and not less than thirty nor more than sixty days for a third or subsequent violation. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The defendants also claimed that the court below erred in not holding that the plaintiff could not recover because it appeared that no registration certificate was carried on her automobile the day it was injured. Upon this point the jury were properly instructed as follows: \u201cYou have the uncontradicted testimony that it had the dealer\u2019s evidence of its registration, to wit, his numbers, upon the car. . . . If it was so registered, was it then being used by the chauffeur, who was an employee of the dealer, for a purpose incidental to the legitimate business of the Blue Ribbon Garage, in instructing this purchaser\u2019s agent to operate that car? If you do so find, then I charge you that the law does not require that he should have had the registration card of the dealer-in the car at that time in order that the plaintiff may recover. You can see readily the reason for that, because a dealer might have a dozen or fifty cars for those five days in his possession, and he gets a general registration card which permits him, during that limited period, to put his dealer\u2019s mark or numbers upon the car, and it would be physically impossible to put that registration card, which consisted of one piece of paper for all those cars, in each car.\u201d The Motor Vehicle Act (General Statutes, \u00a7 1527), provides, among other things, that \u201cmanufacturers, dealers and repairers shall not be required to carry their certificates upon the motor vehicles registered under the provisions of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The failure of the trial court to direct a verdict is not in this State assignable error. See <em>Lines Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford City Gas Light Co., </em>89 Conn. 117, 125, 93 Atl. 129, where the subject is fully considered, and the fact pointed out that the party aggrieved by such failure has his remedy by motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the evidence. -</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>It appears that the only evidence offered as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages was the bills that she was obliged to pay for the repairs of her car, which amounted to $139.80. The defendants contend that the court did not, \u201cas was its duty, charge the jury that they could render no verdict assessing damages for the plaintiff since no evidence, necessary for them to calculate the measure of damages, had been submitted. \u201d The only recovery sought by the complaint was for damages to the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. It is not claimed by the defendants that these expenses were unreasonably incurred in an endeavor to repair the damages which the plaintiff had sustained by the collision with the defendants\u2019 automobile. Evidence of the cost of repairs of the automobile was admissible as proof of the difference between the value of the automobile before the accident and after it occurred. This difference was the measure of damages that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
