More particularly, the claim is that the only evidence tending to prove any agreement to pay the plaintiff anything for his indorsem\u00e9nts relates to an alleged agreement for the payment of $10,000 out of any profits which might be realized from the sale of bonds, or the sale of the properties themselves; and that as there was no attempt to prove that any such profits were realized, no foundation was laid for any recovery on the second count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\">The reasons of appeal assign as error the refusal of the court to charge, as requested, that because of the absence of any evidence of profits the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant on the second count; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict on the second count and grant a new trial; and those portions of the charge in which the court instructed the jury that on the evidence before them they might draw their own conclusion as to whether the agreement was for <em>\u201ca </em>payment out of profits or a payment out of proceeds of sale. If out of profits, there can be no recovery because no profits have been shown. If out of the proceeds of the sale, then that objection does not lie in the way.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-6\"><em>William F.

Carmody, </em>for the appellant (defendant ).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>Edmund Zacher, </em>for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\"> The court, although requested, declined to hear more than two counsel for the appellant,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b338-8\">Beach, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azy\">The trial judge, in one of the several parts of the charge excepted to, summed up the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the terms upon which he was to receive $10,000 for his indorsements, as follows: \u201cThe first time that Mr. Nichols went over it he spoke of it as being paid out of the profits of the scheme, and the second time, upon cross-examination when pressed more fully by counsel for the defense, he said why, no, it was not ,the profits of the scheme, it was the sale of the properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">So far as we can see the only substantial question on this appeal is whether the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination is fairly susceptible of the interpretation which the trial court thus put upon it, and which the jury evidently accepted as its true significance. If so, it affords a sufficient basis for the charge and the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">That part of the cross-examination which the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>court referred to, is as follows: \u201cQ. Wasn\u2019t that the first statement he made? A. I beg pardon. Q. If the bonds were sold, or when they were sold, he would give you $10,000? A. Not bonds alone; when the properties were disposed of; I think the properties were included in it, the whole thing. Q. Didn\u2019t he say in the first statement he made to you that if the bonds were sold, or when they were sold, he would give you this $10,000? A. As I recollect it, it was when the bonds were sold and the whole property was disposed of, then the payment would be made. Q. You said in your direct testimony, did you not, that when the bonds were sold you would- A. I might have said bonds. I might have been a little careless about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Defendant\u2019s claim is that this cross-examination relates to the time when the money was to be paid, and not to the fund out of which it was to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Assuming that the testimony is on its face capable of the construction which the defendant puts on it, the issue as to the proper significance of oral testimony is primarily one of fact for the jury. They have put their own construction on it, and the only question now open is whether they exceeded the bounds of reason and fairness in doing so. If it were necessary to support their construction by analysis, it would be enough to point out that the cross-examiner himself framed his question in the alternative, \u201cif the bonds were sold, or when they were sold,\u201d and put the two phrases together as if they were two different ways of saying the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
