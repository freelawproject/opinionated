About nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon of August 1st, 1917, he left his employer\u2019s yard with a wagon containing two tons of coal for the purpose of making delivery of it at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>point about a mile distant. The day was an excessively hot one, as had been several days immediately preceding. Upon his arrival at the place of delivery he rested a few minutes and then began to shovel out the coal. There was no shade at the point where the wagon was standing, and the direct rays of the sun beat upon him as he worked. Between ten and eleven o\u2019clock, when he had already shoveled out about half of his load, he was overcome by the heat, got out of the wagon and laid down upon the grass beside it. After lying there a few minutes he got up, staggered through the next yard and, after proceeding a few hundred feet, collapsed, stricken with a heat or sunstroke. Later in the same day he died therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">Heatstroke or sunstroke, as it is also called, is caused by a disturbance of the portion of the brain controlling the regulation of heat in the human body. Cunningham\u2019s employment did not expose him in a substantially greater degree to heat and the effects of the sun, than that to which others in the same employment were exposed, and did not expose him in a greater degree than many other out-of-door workers were exposed. His exposure in his employment was, however, far greater than the exposure- of the community, and the risk to him from heat and the effects of the sun were substantially greater than that of the community.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-7\"><em>Thomas P. Dunne </em>and <em>Arthur B. O\u2019Brien, </em>for the appellants (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-8\"><em>Philip Pond </em>and <em>William H. Hitchings, </em>for the appellees (defendants).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-9\">Pbentice, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3W\">Upon the hearing before the Commissioner two controlling inquiries were presented, upon both of which the defendants contended for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>negative reply, to wit: (1) Did the deceased, in succumbing to a heat or sunstroke, suffer a personal injury within the meaning of our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act; and (2) if so, did that injury arise out of his employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Before us, defendants\u2019 counsel abandoned their contention as to the first of these inquiries, and conceded that under our recent decision in <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>Spier, ante, </em>p. 151, 105 Atl. 340, the Commissioner was not in error in his conclusion that the deceased received a personal injury within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Their second claim, that the injury did not arise out of his employment, which the court below sustained, was, however, strenuously pursued. The principles applicable in determining whether or not an employee\u2019s injury is to be regarded as arising out of his employment, were fully discussed and declared in <em>Larke </em>v. <em>Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>90 Conn. 303, 97 Atl. 320. There, speaking generally, we said (p. 309) that \u201cif the nature of the employment, or the conditions under which it was pursued, or the exposure to injury it entailed, or the doing of something incidental to the employment, was a proximate cause of the injury, it arises out of the employment.\u201d Speaking more specifically upon the subject of exposure as a factor in determining whether a resulting injury is to be regarded as arising out of the injured person\u2019s employment, we said that the test was to be found in the answer to the inquiry whether or not the employee was injured as a result of a greater exposure to the cause of injury than that to which persons generally in that locality were subjected, p. 309. In <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>Spier, ante, </em>p. 151, 105 Atl. 340, we reiterated the same principle in substance, when we said that \u201can employment will be the proximate cause of an injury, when the injury is the natural and necessary incident of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>employment, or when the employment brings with it greater exposure to injurious results than the exposure to which persons generally in that locality are subjected, and such injurious result occurs in the course of that employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The Commissioner\u2019s finding in the present case is that the deceased\u2019s exposure was far greater than that of the community generally, and the risk from heat and the effects of the sun substantially greater than that of the community. Applying the prescribed test to these facts as found, the right of the claimant to receive an award of compensation is established, if the finding is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"ArG\">The reasons why it should not stand are not apparent to us. Conditions indicative of the deceased\u2019s special exposure to risk from the effects of the sun and heat are not, to be sure, as pronounced as they were in the case of the heat victim in <em>Ahern </em>v. <em>Spier, ante, </em>p. 151, 105 Atl. 340. But the subordinate facts found plainly disclose the existence of such conditions. Cunningham, at the time he was overcome, was engaged in shoveling coal, a task alike strenuous and well calculated to aggravate the normal effect of a superheated atmosphere and the rays of a hot sun. He was shoveling coal from a wagon which presumably from its use was blackened with coal dust and, therefore, especially attractive to the sun\u2019s rays. As he was shoveling he necessarily disturbed the coal, thus presumably discharging into the air he breathed more or less dust. It is apparent, therefore, that his employment differentiated his exposure to physical harm from that to which the members of the community generally were exposed. The peril which he faced was made up hot merely of the conditions produced by the heat and the rays of the sun beating down upon him, but of those conditions plus those other aggravating ones which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>attended the work which he was doing in the pursuit of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">There is error, the judgment of the court setting aside the Commissioner\u2019s award is set aside and the cause remanded for the rendition of a judgment affirming the award of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
