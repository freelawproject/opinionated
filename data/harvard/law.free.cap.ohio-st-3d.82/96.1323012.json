Applicant\u2019s current application for admission to the bar is disapproved. Applicant is permitted to reapply for admission to the practice of law in Ohio by submitting a new application that contains complete, up-to-date information on all matters raised by the local admissions committee as well as any new matter that may have arisen after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

I agree with the majority in disapproving the application for admission, but I would not allow the applicant to reapply. Applicant\u2019s long history of problems demonstrates a basic character flaw and a lack of high standards of integrity and honesty. He has demonstrated that he is not qualified to reach the high ethical standards demanded of our bar. Therefore, I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to allow him to reapply.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
