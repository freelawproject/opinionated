For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, vacate the judgment of the trial court, and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">In <em>Taylor, </em>Luke Scargill and Bobby Lee Taylor were employees of a metal manufacturing concern known as Alumax, Inc. Scargill was injured and Taylor was killed as a result of an explosion that occurred while aluminum scrap was being fed into a crusher machine at Alumax. Scargill and the administrator of Taylor\u2019s estate filed suit against Academy Iron &amp; Metal Company (\u201cAcademy Iron\u201d), the supplier of the aluminum scrap. The plaintiffs sought recovery against Academy Iron for products liability. Academy Iron then filed a third-party complaint against Alumax, alleging that Scargill\u2019s personal injuries and Taylor\u2019s death had been caused by the intentional tortious acts of the employer. The third-party complaint sought indemnification from Alumax to Academy Iron for any damages for which Academy Iron was found to be liable in the underlying actions of Scargill and Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">Alumax moved to dismiss the third-party complaint for failure to state a claim. Academy Iron later sought leave to file an amended third-party complaint to add a claim for contribution. The amended third-party complaint was filed along with the motion for leave to amend. Thereafter, the trial court dismissed Academy Iron\u2019s third-party complaint, apparently holding that Academy Iron had no standing to bring an action against Alumax due to the immunity provided to complying employers under R.C. Chapter 4123, Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The dismissal of the third-party complaint (in which Academy Iron had asserted only a right to indemnification) implicitly disposed of the claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>contribution that Academy Iron had attempted to assert in its amended third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Academy Iron settled the claims in the underlying actions by Scargill and the administrator of Taylor\u2019s estate, but appealed the dismissal of the third-party complaint. On appeal, the court of appeals in <em>Taylor </em>affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the third-party complaint was precluded by former R.C. 4121.80. Upon further appeal, this court, by a divided (five-to-two) vote, affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">At the outset of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Taylor, </em>the <em>Taylor </em>majority noted that, pursuant to Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 4123.74, employers who comply with Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws are immune from damages for employee injuries that arise in the course of the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 150-152, 522 N.E.2d at 466-467. The majority observed that \u201c[a]s these provisions <em>[i.e., </em>Section 35, Article II and former R.C. 4123.74] explicate, the General Assembly, in carrying out its constitutional mandate and adopting a workers\u2019 compensation law, provided complying employers with immunity from damages for employee injuries that arise in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 522 N.E.2d at 467. The <em>Taylor </em>majority also noted that an employer is not immune from damages for employee injuries caused by the intentional tortious conduct of the employer, since such conduct falls outside the scope of employment and workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. However, following a brief discussion of the holding in <em>Blankenship, </em>the court in <em>Taylor </em>found that Academy Iron, which the court labeled a \u201cthird-party tortfeasor,\u201d lacked standing to pursue the third-party complaint for indemnification. <em>Id. </em>at 152-153, 522 N.E.2d at 467-468.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The <em>Taylor </em>court reached its conclusion on the issue of standing based on a single statement in <em>Blankenship </em>that \u201c <em>\u2018an employee </em>may resort to a civil suit for damages.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Taylor </em>at 152, 522 N.E.2d at 467, quoting <em>Blankenship </em>at 613, 23 O.O.3d at 508, 433 N.E.2d at 576. Specifically, the <em>Taylor </em>majority interpreted that statement as barring suit by anyone other than the employee or the employee\u2019s legal representative. <em>Id. </em>at 152, 522 N.E.2d at 468. Thus, the court in <em>Taylor </em>concluded that third-party tortfeasors have no standing to bring a civil suit against an employer \u201calleging that the employer committed intentional torts leading to an employee\u2019s work-related death, disease, or injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 522 N.E.2d at 468. The <em>Taylor </em>court also attempted to bolster its conclusion in this regard based on the immunity granted to complying employers under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Id. </em>at 150-153, 522 N.E.2d at 466-468. Additionally, the court went on to hold that Academy Iron could not recover from Alumax on any theory of implied or equitable indemnification, since Alumax had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>never expressly waived immunity from suit stemming from Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 4123.74. <em>Id. </em>at 153-154, 522 N.E.2d at 468-470. Therefore, the court in <em>Taylor </em>held, at paragraphs one through three of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201c1. Only an employee or his legal representative, not a third-party tortfeasor, may bring a civil suit against an employer alleging that the employer committed an intentional tort leading to an employee\u2019s work-related death, disease, or injury. <em>(Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>[1982], 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 614, 23 O.O.3d 504, 508, 433 N.E.2d 572, 577, certiorari denied [1982], 459 U.S. 857, 103 S.Ct. 127, 74 L.Ed.2d 110, followed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>A third-party tortfeasor has no standing to bring an indemnification claim against an employer, who is acting in compliance with the Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law, for damages suffered by an employee in the course of or arising out of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201c3. Relief from common-law liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act extends to eases in which a third-party tortfeasor, having paid damages to an employee or his estate, seeks indemnity from the employer on the ground that the liability of the employer is primary or active and the liability of the third-party tortfeasor is secondary or passive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The dissent in <em>Taylor </em>pointed out an array of problems and inconsistencies with the rationale and holdings of the majority opinion in that case. <em>Taylor, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 155-163, 522 N.E.2d at 470-477 (Douglas, J., dissenting). The dissent noted, among other things, that the majority in <em>Taylor </em>had misused a statement from <em>Blankenship </em>to reach a conclusion that was absolutely inconsistent with the underpinnings of <em>Blankenship </em>and its progeny. <em>Taylor </em>at 157-158, 522 N.E.2d at 472-473. The <em>Taylor </em>dissent took issue with the majority\u2019s reliance on the immunity provided to complying employers under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and suggested that it should now be clear \u201cthat intentional misconduct by an employer which results in an injury to his employee is outside the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that the employer in such cases is not entitled to the protections afforded by the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157-158, 522 N.E.2d at 472. Likewise, the dissent in <em>Taylor </em>noted that \u201c[i]f the conduct of [Alumax] was indeed intentional, an assumption that the majority acknowledges must be made, then the protections of the workers\u2019 compensation system have no relevance whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 522 N.E.2d at 472. The dissent concluded that Academy Iron\u2019s amended third-party complaint had stated a claim for contribution under former R.C. 2307.31, as well as a claim for indemnity. <em>Id. </em>at 157-159, 522 N.E.2d at 471-473. Additionally, the dissent in <em>Taylor </em>went on to address the constitutionality of former R.C. 4121.80 (an issue not decided by the <em>Taylor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>majority), and concluded that the statute represented an invalid exercise of legislative authority. <em>Id. </em>at 161-162, 522 N.E.2d at 475-476.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The following passage from the <em>Taylor </em>dissent dealt with issues concerning former R.C. 4121.80, but the passage adequately summarizes the rationale of the entire dissent that employers have no immunity or special protection from civil liability for employee injuries that are caused, in whole or in part, by the intentional tortious conduct of the employer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">\u201cInjuries resulting from an employer\u2019s intentional torts, even though committed at the workplace, are utterly outside the scope of the purposes intended to be achieved by Section 35 [Article II of the Ohio Constitution] and by the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act]. <em>Such injuries are totally unrelated to the fact of employment. </em>When an employer intentionally harms his employee, that act effects a complete breach of the employment relationship, and for purposes of the legal remedy for such an injury, the two parties are not employer and employee, but intentional tortfeasor and victim. If the victim brings an intentional tort suit against the tortfeasor, it is a tort action like any other. The employer has forfeited his status as such and all the attendant protections fall away.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 162, 522 N.E.2d at 476 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, this court adopted the rationale of the above-quoted passage from the <em>Taylor </em>dissent in holding that former R.C. 4121.80 was, in fact, unconstitutional. <em>Brady </em>at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729, quoting <em>Taylor </em>at 162, 522 N.E.2d at 476 (Douglas, J., dissenting). <em>Brady </em>recognized that employer intentional torts \u201cwill always take place outside\u201d the employment relationship. <em>Brady </em>at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729. <em>Brady </em>does not, however, expressly or impliedly overrule <em>Taylor. </em>The constitutionality of former R.C. 4121.80 was not addressed by the <em>Taylor </em>majority, and <em>Brady </em>did not address the issue whether a third-party tortfeasor has standing to bring an action against an employer for intentionally tortious conduct that injures an employee. Nevertheless, <em>Brady </em>does effectively repudiate the rationale of <em>Taylor, </em>insofar as <em>Taylor </em>was predicated on the theory that workers\u2019 compensation statutes can insulate an employer from common-law liability for damages caused by the employer\u2019s intentional tortious conduct in the workplace. Specifically, <em>Brady, </em>like the dissent in <em>Taylor, </em>recognizes that an intentional tort committed by an employer against an employee necessarily occurs outside the scope of the employment relationship and, thus, outside the realm of any protections afforded to complying employers by Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Brady </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">To apply <em>Taylor </em>in the case at bar would preclude Nationwide, as subrogee of the rights of a \u201cthird-party tortfeasor,\u201d or as assignee of the Conleys\u2019 claims, from maintaining suit against Brown for Brown\u2019s alleged activity in having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>committed an intentional tort in the workplace and having caused or contributed to the injuries sustained by David Conley. This is so, of course, because <em>Taylor </em>holds, among other things, that \u201c[o]nly an employee or his legal representative, not a third-party tortfeasor, may bring a civil suit against an employer alleging that the employer committed an intentional tort leading to an employee\u2019s work-related death, disease, or injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>36 Ohio St.3d 149, 522 N.E.2d 464, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Nationwide is neither the \u201cemployee\u201d nor the employee\u2019s \u201clegal representative\u201d within the meaning of <em>Taylor. </em>Rather, Nationwide is a \u201cthird-party tortfeasor,\u201d insofar as Nationwide stands in the place of Rexcon as subrogee of Rexcon\u2019s rights against Brown. Furthermore, according to the holdings and rationale of <em>Taylor, </em>Nationwide would have no standing to maintain claims against Brown because of the immunity conferred upon complying employers under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">However, upon a careful review of <em>Taylor, </em>the dissent in <em>Taylor, </em>and our decision in <em>Brady, </em>it is now absolutely clear to us that <em>Brady </em>and the dissent in <em>Taylor </em>are consistent with Ohio law and the case of <em>Blankenship </em>and its progeny, whereas the majority opinion in <em>Taylor </em>is not. We find that <em>Taylor </em>was bad law when it was first decided, and that it remains bad law today. The rationale in <em>Taylor </em>for finding a lack of standing for \u201cthird-party tortfeasors\u201d is, as the court of appeals\u2019 majority recognized, \u201cless than convincing.\u201d Employer immunity under Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has no relevance whatsoever where, as here, the employer has allegedly committed an intentional tort against an employee. Because employer intentional torts \u201cwill always take place outside\u201d the employment relationship <em>(Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729), workers\u2019 compensation law has no connection with suits alleging an employer intentional tort. We can perceive of no legitimate reason why Brown, simply because it is an employer, should be absolved from civil liability to Nationwide if, in fact, an intentional tort was committed. An employer who commits an intentional tort against an employee in the workplace is to be treated the same as other persons or entities that may be called upon to answer for the injurious consequences of their own tortious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Accordingly, in keeping with the rationale of <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, and its progeny, we now hold that an employer is not immune from civil liability for employee injuries, disease, or death caused by the employer\u2019s intentional tortious conduct in the workplace, since such conduct necessarily occurs outside the employment relationship. Additionally, we hold that a suit against an employer alleging that the employer committed an intentional tort leading to an employee\u2019s injury, disease, or death may be maintained by the employee or his or her legal representative, an assignee of the right of action against the employer, or any other person or entity with a statutory or common-law right to recover against the employer, including a third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>party tortfeasor with a statutory or common-law claim for contribution or for indemnification, or the subrogee of the third-party tortfeasor\u2019s rights or claims. <em>Taylor </em>is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In the case at bar, Nationwide\u2019s status as subrogee of Rexcon\u2019s rights, and as assignee of the Conleys\u2019 claims, clearly provides the basis for Nationwide\u2019s interest and standing to maintain suit against Brown for all or part of the proceeds that have been paid by Nationwide to the Conleys on behalf of Rexcon. Nationwide, as assignee of the Conleys\u2019 causes of action for intentional tort, is entitled to assert <em>claims </em>for full recovery against Brown and, also, as subrogee of Rexcon\u2019s right, if any, to indemnification, including implied or equitable indemnification of the type at issue in <em>Taylor, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 149, 522 N.E.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Moreover, insofar as Nationwide\u2019s complaint was based on an asserted right to contribution, we find that former R.C. 2307.31 and 2307.32(C) (now R.C. 2307.32 and 2307.33[C]) provided a clear basis for Nationwide\u2019s interest and standing to maintain its claims against Brown. Former R.C. 2307.31(A) provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c[WJhere two or more persons are jointly and severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them. The right of contribution exists only in favor of a tortfeasor who has paid more than his proportionate share of the common liability, and his total recovery is limited to the amount paid by him in excess of his proportionate share. No tortfeasor is compelled to make contribution beyond his own proportionate share of the common liability. There is no right of contribution in favor of any tortfeasor who intentionally has caused or intentionally has contributed to the injury or loss to person or property or the wrongful death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Former R.C. 2307.31(B) provided that a tortfeasor who entered into a settlement with a claimant was not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability was not extinguished by the settlement. Former R.C. 2307.31(C) permitted a liability insurer that discharged the obligation of a tortfeasor to be subrogated to the tortfeasor\u2019s right of contribution \u201cto the extent of the amount it has paid in excess of the tortfeasor\u2019s proportionate share of the common liability.\u201d Former R.C. 2307.31(G) and 2307.32(C) permitted enforcement of the right to contribution by separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Here, Nationwide settled with the Conleys on behalf of Rexcon. The Conleys assigned claims to Nationwide as part of the settlement. The covenant obtained by Nationwide in connection with the settlement may be viewed as having extinguished Brown\u2019s liability, if any, to the Conleys. Nationwide may therefore be entitled to contribution from Brown to the extent of the amount Nationwide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>has allegedly paid in excess of Rexcon\u2019s proportionate share of the common liability of Brown and Rexcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Nevertheless, Brown protests that <em>Taylor </em>has the effect of advancing important public policy interests and that <em>Taylor </em>should be preserved to bar claims such as those advanced by Nationwide. Specifically, Brown argues that \u201c[i]n its decision in <em>Taylor, supra, </em>this Court determined that employer intentional tort claims are personal to the employee. If the employee chooses not to pursue such a claim, no one else can do so. That decision provides an important check on fiivolous lawsuits mounted by opportunists and, thus, satisfies policy concerns raised by the availability of an employer intentional tort theory.\u201d However, the solution to such \u201cfrivolous\u201d lawsuits is in the use of a Civ.R. 56 summary judgment motion challenging the merits of the claims or, perhaps, through the use of Civ.R. 11. The appropriate solution is not (and cannot be) to bar the courthouse door to possibly meritorious claims of intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Brown also argues that <em>Taylor </em>is consistent with the wishes of the General Assembly \u201cto rein in, not expand, employer intentional tort as a theory of recovery by injured workers beyond the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d Brown\u2019s argument concerning the desires of the General Assembly is apparently based on R.C. 2745.01 and former R.C. 4121.80. However, former R.C. 4121.80 was struck down in <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, paragraph two of the syllabus, as an invalid exercise of legislative authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, as Brown readily concedes, R.C. 2745.01, which became effective November 1, 1995, is not applicable in this case and, thus, we refrain from any further comment concerning that statute or the expression of legislative intent accompanying the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, vacate the judgment of the trial court, and we remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-9\">Resnick, F.E.

BP Chemicals, Inc. </em>(Nov. 18, 1997), Allen App. No. 1-97-32, unreported, 1997 WL 729098, discretionary appeal and cross-appeal allowed (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1500, 691 N.E.2d 1061.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKg\">concurring in judgment and syllabus only.
