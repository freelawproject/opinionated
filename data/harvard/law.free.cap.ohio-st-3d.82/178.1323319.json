Election of IEC compensation, however, puts an affirmative burden on claimant \u2014 he or she must prove actual IEC and a causal relationship to the allowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 533 N.E.2d 775; <em>State ex rel. Apgar v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 5, 535 N.E.2d 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Claimant\u2019s argument is based on a faulty premise. IEC is not established \u2014 as claimant believes \u2014 by the mere showing of diminished or no wages. Former R.C. 4123.57(A) speaks to impaired earning <em>capacity, </em>not simply to impaired earnings. <em>State ex rel. Eaton Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 180, 183-184, 610 N.E.2d 992, 995. Thus, \u201cthe mere fact that a claimant has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>employed is not dispositive of the impaired-earning-capacity issue.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pauley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 263, 264, 559 N.E.2d 1333, 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Impaired earning capacity \u201cconnotes not what claimant <em>did </em>earn but what he or she <em>could have </em>earned.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Eaton, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 184, 610 N.E.2d at 995. <em>Eaton </em>states that \u201ccapacity,\u201d while statutorily undefined, \u201clogically encompasses the universe of jobs that a claimant, at a given time, and based on age, education, skills, physical ability, etc., can do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This, in turn, requires the claimant to present evidence regarding working skills and opportunities. <em>Pauley. </em>Where a claimant does not do so, the commission does not abuse its discretion in denying IEC compensation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In this case, claimant produced no such evidence. Again, claimant simply asserted an absence of wages in support of her claim of a one hundred percent impairment of earning capacity. She has not, therefore, sustained her burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Claimant also argues that the regional board order is evidentiarily deficient because it did not explain why it vacated the district hearing officer\u2019s order. This is not true. The regional board order states two bases for its decision: (1) a lack of evidence establishing an IEC and (2) claimant\u2019s failure to causally relate any alleged impairment exclusively to the allowed conditions. The order, therefore, satisfies both <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, and <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b274-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
