For the reasons to follow, we find that she does.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">R.C. 4123.512 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-15\">\u201c(A) The claimant or the employer may appeal an order of the industrial commission * * * in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-16\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">\u201c(D) Upon receipt of notice of appeal the clerk of courts shall provide notice to all parties who are appellees and to the commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201cThe claimant shall, within thirty days after the filing of the notice of appeal, file a petition containing a statement of facts in ordinary and concise language showing a cause of action to participate or to continue to participate in the fund and setting forth the basis for the jurisdiction of the court over the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The phrase \u201cother than a decision as to extent of disability\u201d encompasses a wide range of issues, not all of which are reconcilable with a claimant\u2019s duty under section (D) to establish a right or continued right to participate in workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Recognizing this incompatibility, <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175, paragraph one of the syllabus, held that only decisions involving a claimant\u2019s right to participate could be appealed. The most basic right-to-participate issue is a claim\u2019s initial allowance, and from this the current debate takes shape. Claimant believes that the commission essentially overextended itself in vacating the entire DHO order. Claimant alleges that the causal relationship between death and employment is uncontroverted. Consequently, the commission should have left this element of the order intact and vacated only that portion naming M.J. Construction as the employer. Claimant alleges that the propriety of this extension is truly at issue, which \u2014 citing <em>Saunders, </em>infra\u2014 makes it other than \u201cright to participate.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">First, claimant\u2019s assertion that causal relationship is undisputed is false. M.J. Construction vigorously disputes that allegation. Second, claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>State ex rel. Saunders v. Metal Container Corp. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 85, 556 N.E.2d 168, is misplaced. In <em>Saunders, </em>the claimant industrially injured his back. His self-insured employer accepted the claim and listed the allowed condition as \u201cback, sprfain] back.\u201d Later, however, the employer noticed that the commission was broadly listing the allowance as \u201cback\u201d on subsequent orders, and it asked the commission to clarify the allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The commission narrowed the allowance to \u201clumbosacral strain with degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine,\u201d and claimant objected. When the case ultimately came before us, the commission and employer asserted that claimant had an adequate remedy by way of appeal. We disagreed, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\u201cAppellants, however, misdefine the issue before us. The relevant question here is not one of appellee\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund for a \u2018back\u2019 injury but is instead whether a mistake sufficient to invoke the continuing jurisdiction provisions of R.C. 4123.52 existed. We find this latter question to be the proper subject for a writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 556 N.E.2d at 170.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Claimant overlooks a key distinction between this case and <em>Saunders. </em>In <em>Saunders, </em>the named employer did not dispute that claimant had been injured in the course of and arising out of his employment. The employer agreed that the claim should be allowed \u2014 the only question was for what condition. <em>Saunders </em>was correct, therefore, in finding'that the most basic right-to-participate question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>was not at issue. That having been settled, the ancillary continuing jurisdiction question necessarily fell outside the right to participate and was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">That is not the case here. M.J. Construction does not agree that this claim should be allowed. To the contrary, as the named employer, it vigorously denies that it is in any way responsible for decedent\u2019s death. Thus, the baseline right-to-participate question is still at the forefront of this case, rendering <em>Saunders </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">This distinction highlights a major flaw in claimant\u2019s position. The questions of employer identity and death compensability cannot be separated in this instance. It is not enough to establish that death arose out of employment. A claimant must also establish that death arose from employment with <em>the employer named on the application for death benefits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s suggestion, the commission cannot simply substitute one employer for another while leaving death compensability intact, for to do so raises serious due process implications. When a surviving spouse flies a death claim, he or she is making a most serious allegation against an employer \u2014 that employment therewith caused the death of another. Under claimant\u2019s proposal, another employer could be substituted for M.J. Construction without any opportunity to defend itself against the death claim. This is unacceptable and explains why the commission vacated the entire order allowing this claim against M.J. Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We instead find persuasive <em>State ex rel. Burnett v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 266, 6 OBR 332, 452 N.E.2d 1341. In that case, decedent had worked for over thirty years with numerous employers, most of which had exposed him to asbestos. When decedent died of asbestos-induced cancer, his widow filed a death claim against Peek-Hannaford &amp; Briggs Co., a company for which claimant had worked for only five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Both the DHO and regional board allowed the claim. The commission reversed after considering evidence that indicated that decedent had no asbestos exposure at Peck-Hannaford. The widow appealed to the common pleas court and filed for mandamus with the court of appeals. We affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the writ after finding that claimant had an adequate remedy at law via an appeal of the common pleas court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">As to claimant\u2019s last proposition, we state simply that the dispositive issue in this case is not M.J. Construction\u2019s right to have filed a belated appeal under R.C. 4123.522. Claimant\u2019s reliance on <em>Afrates, supra, </em>in this respect is, therefore, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b510-5\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E.
