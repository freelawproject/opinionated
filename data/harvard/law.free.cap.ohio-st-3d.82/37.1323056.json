In response, Wilson-Simmons filed a motion to strike the sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>department\u2019s motion because it was filed after the sheriffs department had filed an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We overrule Wilson-Simmons\u2019s motion to strike. Contrary to her claims, the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and therefore can be raised at any time during the proceedings. <em>In re Byard </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 294, 296, 658 N.E.2d 735, 737, citing Civ.R. 12(H)(3); S.Ct.Prac.R. X(2) (\u201cAll original actions shall proceed under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, unless clearly inapplicable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">As to the merits of its motion, the sheriffs department contends that the court should dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction Wilson-Simmons\u2019s discrimination and attorney fee claims under Sections 1983 and 1988, Title 42, U.S.Code because the federal district court\u2019s October 1997 judgment is <em>res judicata </em>on these claims. The sheriffs department\u2019s contention lacks merit. <em>Res judicata </em>is an affirmative defense that does not divest the second tribunal of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Whitehall ex rel. Wolfe v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 656 N.E.2d 684, 687; <em>State ex rel. Flower v. Rocker </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 160, 162, 6 O.O.3d 375, 376, 370 N.E.2d 479, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In addition, the sheriffs department\u2019s additional claim, that this entire action is moot because Wilson-Simmons\u2019s only reason for seeking e-mail records was to support her federal case, is meritless. Wilson-Simmons\u2019s purpose in requesting these records is irrelevant. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Fant v. Enright </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 186, 610 N.E.2d 997, syllabus (\u201cA person may inspect and copy a \u2018public r\u00e9cord,\u2019 as defined in R.C. 149.43[A], irrespective of his or her purpose for doing so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Based on the foregoing, we overrule the sheriffs department\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">\n<em>Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Following the submission of evidence and briefs pursuant to our alternative writ and schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs, Wilson-Simmons filed a motion for partial summary judgment, and the sheriffs department filed a motion to strike Wilson-Simmons\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">We grant the sheriffs department\u2019s motion to strike Wilson-Simmons\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Civ.R. 56 motions for summary judgment are clearly inapplicable in original actions in this court under the procedure specified in S.Ct.Prac.R. X. See <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Schroeder </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 580, 581, 669 N.E.2d 835, 837. Following the submission of evidence and briefs in an original action in this court under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(6) and (7), the case is ready to be \u201ctried\u201d on the merits. No summary judgment motion is necessary or appropriate. Here, the parties, including Wilson-Simmons, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>already presented evidence and briefs on the merits. Her subsequently filed motion for partial summary judgment is merely a poorly disguised attempt to authenticate evidence that was the subject of the sheriffs department\u2019s motion to strike evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\n<em>R.C. lJp9.JpS; Public Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Wilson-Simmons contends that she is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the disclosure of the requested e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426, 639 N.E.2d 83, 89. A \u201cpublic record\u201d is \u201cany record that is kept by any public office * * R.C. 149.43(A)(1). R.C. 149.011(G) broadly defines \u201crecords\u201d to include \u201cany document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office.\u201d See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 245, 246-247, 643 N.E.2d 126, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The sheriffs department asserts that the requested e-mail does not constitute \u201crecords\u201d for purposes of R.C. 149.011(G), and therefore it is not accessible as \u201cpublic records\u201d under R.C. 149.43. The sheriffs department is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The requested e-mail does not constitute \u201crecords\u201d for purposes of R.C. 149.011(G) and 149.43. R.C. 149.43(A)(1) \u201cdoes not define a \u2018public record\u2019 as any piece of paper on which a public officer writes something.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Steffen v. Kraft </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 439, 440, 619 N.E.2d 688, 689. \u201cTo the extent that any item * * * is not a \u2018record,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>does not serve to document the organization, etc., of the public office, it is not a public record and need not be disclosed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Enright, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 188, 610 N.E.2d at 999. If, as alleged by Wilson-Simmons,' the requested e-mail consists of racist slurs against her by individual co-workers, then, although reprehensible, the e-mail does not serve to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the sheriffs department. There is no evidence or allegation that the alleged racist e-mail documented sheriffs department policy or procedures. It was allegedly circulated only to a few co-workers and was not used to conduct sheriffs department business.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">This conclusion, that the requested e-mail is not a record for purposes of R.C. 149.43, is supported by both state and federal precedent. See <em>Steffen, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 439, 619 N.E.2d at 689 (\u201cA trial judge\u2019s personal handwritten notes made during the course of a trial are not public records.\u201d), and cases cited at 67 Ohio St.3d at 440, 619 N.E.2d at 689; <em>Internatl. Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v. Voinovich </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 372, 654 N.E.2d 139 (Governor\u2019s personal calendars and appointment books did not constitute records subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43 because they did not serve to document any official activities or functions.); <em>Bur. of Natl. Affairs, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Justice </em>(C.A.D.C.1984), 742 F.2d 1484, 1492 (\u201cWhere, as here, a document is created by an agency employee, consideration of whether and to what extent that employee used the document to conduct agency business is highly relevant for determining whether that document is an \u2018agency record\u2019 within the meaning of FOIA [the federal Freedom of Information Act].\u201d); <em>Gallant v. Natl. Labor Relations Bd. </em>(C.A.D.C.1994), 26 F.3d 168, 172 (\u201c[E]ven though employing agency resources in the creation of the correspondence is a relevant factor in the agency record analysis, the utilization of agency resources in this case is not as significant as the other factors employed in our precedents, which compel a conclusion that the * * * correspondence was personal, rather than attributable to the agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Therefore, although the alleged racist e-mail was created by public employees via a public office\u2019s e-mail system, it was never used to conduct the business of the public office and did not constitute records for purposes of R.C. 149.011(G) and 149.43.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Bureau of Natl. Affairs </em>and <em>Gallant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In addition, even assuming that the requested e-mail constitutes \u201crecords\u201d under R.C. 149.011(G) and 149.43, Wilson-Simmons would still not be entitled to a writ of mandamus. Due to Wilson-Simmons\u2019s more than two-year delay in bringing this action after the sheriffs department refused to provide access to the requested e-mail without Wilson-Simmons\u2019s paying a reconstruction fee, the requested records are no longer available. <em>State ex rel. Leonard v. White </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 516, 517, 664 N.E.2d 527, 528, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Mengel </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 197, 198, 580 N.E.2d 1085, 1086 (\u201cThe Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, does not require that a public office create new documents to meet a requester\u2019s demand.\u201d). There is no evidence or assertion that the sheriffs department violated any applicable records retention provision by writing over the records in the routine operation of its computer system. See <em>Cal-Almond, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Agriculture </em>(C.A.9, 1992), 960 F.2d 105, 109, citing <em>Nolen v. Rumsfeld </em>(C.A.5, 1976), 535 F.2d 890, 891 (\u201cAbsent a showing that the government has improperly destroyed \u2018agency records,\u2019 FOIA does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>these records to be recreated.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Thompkins </em>(July 14, 1995), Summit App. No. 16937, unreported, 1995 WL 434353 (\u201cRespondents submitted an affidavit which said that it is routine practice to erase and recycle hearing tapes thirty days from issuance of the hearing decision. This court cannot order a public agency to provide copies of items that do not exist.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Wilson-Simmons contends that she is nevertheless entitled to a writ of mandamus despite the nonexistence of the requested e-mail because she is also challenging the sheriffs department\u2019s charge for reconstruction of e-mail and standard fee schedule. This contention is meritless. Under R.C. 149.43(C), a mandamus action is appropriate only \u201c \u2018[i]f a person allegedly is aggrieved by the failure of the governmental unit to promptly prepare a public record and make it available to the person for inspection in accordance with [R.C. 149.43(B) ].\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Wadd v. Cleveland </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 50, 52-53, 689 N.E.2d 25, 28. Because the records requested by Wilson-Simmons were not records for purposes of R.C. 149.43, she was not aggrieved so as to be entitled to a writ of mandamus. Additionally, she is thus not entitled to attorney fees under R.C. 149.43(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Sections 1983 and 1988, Title k2, U.S.Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">To the extent that Wilson-Simmons seeks a writ of mandamus and attorney fees pursuant to Sections 1983 and 1988, Title 42, U.S.Code, she has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law through her Section 1983 action in federal court and an appeal from the adverse judgment rendered by that court. <em>State ex rel. Carter v. Schotten </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 89, 91-92, 637 N.E.2d 306, 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\n<em>Other Motions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The parties\u2019 remaining motions and requests are moot. Denial of the writ and attorney fees is warranted even if we considered Wilson-Simmons\u2019s amended complaint and all of her submitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Based on the foregoing, we deny the writ and the request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. In so holding, we reject the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s broader assertion that <em>no </em>public office e-mail would ever be public records under E.C. 149.011(G) and 149.43. In other words, sometimes, public office e-mail can document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the public office. See <em>Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President </em>(C.A.D.C. 1996), 97 F.3d 575 (access to e-mail relating to government activities sought under FOIA); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Margolius v. Cleveland </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 456, 461, 584 N.E.2d 665, 670, holding that it is unnecessary for an expression to be in a particular medium for it to be a public record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
