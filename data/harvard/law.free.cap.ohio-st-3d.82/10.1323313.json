Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) currently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c(A) No person shall abandon, or fail to provide <em>adequate support </em>to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c(3) The person\u2019s aged or infirm parent or adoptive parent, who from lack of ability and means is unable to provide adequately for the parent\u2019s own <em>support\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The record in this case reveals that appellee used a substantial portion of her savings to provide her mother with a nice home and comfortable surroundings. Appellee also made sure that the house was kept in a clean condition and that her mother was properly fed and clothed. Nevertheless, appellant, the state of Ohio, contends that such support was not enough. Appellant argues that, for purposes of R.C. 2919.21(A)(3), the term \u201csupport\u201d includes both financial and nonfinancial considerations. In this regard, appellant asserts that the court of appeals erred in reversing appellee\u2019s convictions because there was evidence that Rosella\u2019s death was caused by appellee\u2019s failure to provide her mother with needed medical attention and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">However, appellant\u2019s contentions are severely undercut by the 1973 Technical Committee Comment to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, which explicitly states that R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) \u201cdeals only with nonsupport and <em>contains no elements of neglect </em>or abuse, which are dealt with in section 2919.22 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court of appeals concluded that the comment resolved any uncertainty as to whether the General Assembly intended to include nonfinancial support factors within the purview of R.C. 2919.21(A)(3). Specifically, the court held that \u201c[a] reading of the statute and ensuing comments establishes the legislature intended to require adult children to assume financial responsibility for their aged parents, if the parents lack the financial resources to provide for themselves. The comments specifically state the section contains no elements of abuse and neglect, thereby implying the duty of care imposed by the statute is a purely financial one. The comments further state abuse and neglect are covered by R.C. 2919.22, a section that applies only to child dependents. There is no parallel section in the [Rjevised [C]ode imposing a similar duty upon adult children to care for and protect aged dependent parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">We agree with the well-reasoned conclusions reached by the court of appeals. R.C. 2919.21 does not define the term \u201csupport,\u201d nor does it provide any guidance with respect to specific legal duties owed by an adult child to a dependent parent. However, the accompanying comment to R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) expressly provides that the statute contains no elements of <em>neglect </em>or abuse. To that end, we can only assume, as did the court of appeals, that the General Assembly intended the term \u201csupport\u201d to include only necessary financial assistance for a dependent parent. Clearly, if the General Assembly had intended the term \u201csupport\u201d to automatically include additional nonfinancial support factors, it could have easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>done so. Thus, given the mandates of R.C. 2901.04(A),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Committee Comment to R.C. 2919.21, we find that R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) requires an adult child to provide adequate financial support for his or her dependent parent if the parent is in need of financial assistance and the adult child has the financial means to provide such support.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The term \u201csupport,\u201d as used in R.C. 2919.21(A)(3), does not encompass nonfinancial support considerations. In so holding, we also specifically reject appellant\u2019s suggestion that we should apply the holding and rationale of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Holder </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 374, 594 N.E.2d 981, to the case now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In <em>Holder, </em>the defendant was convicted of nonsupport under R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) for failing to provide his mother with adequate nourishment and medical care. On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction, finding that R.C. 2919.21(A)(3) encompassed financial as well as nonfinancial support considerations. Specifically, the court in <em>Holder </em>held that \u201c[r]eading R.C. 2919.21 <em>in pari materia </em>with R.C. 3113.04[A], it is clear that the legislature contemplated more than simply financial nonsupport and intended a broader definition for the term \u2018support\u2019 than that contained in the Committee Comment following R.C. 2919.21. Indeed, it is logical to conclude that such support should include proper care, feeding and medical attention, all of which were lacking as adequately demonstrated by the record herein.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>72 Ohio App.3d at 376, 594 N.E.2d at 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The court of appeals in the case at bar concluded, and we agree, that the <em>Holder </em>court applied an overly expansive interpretation of the term \u201csupport,\u201d failing to give little, if any, weight to the comment accompanying R.C. 2919.21(A)(3). In this regard, the court in <em>Holder </em>completely ignored R.C. 2901.04(A), which requires that criminal statutes defining offenses or penalties be strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused. Moreover, the appellate court\u2019s reliance on R.C. 3113.04(A)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>clearly misplaced. Granted, R.C. 3113.04(A) \u201cmentions\u201d R.C. 2919.21. However, R.C. 3113.04(A) simply concerns the proper method and means by which a sentence can be suspended after a conviction under R.C. 2919.21 and before the sentence is actually imposed. To be sure, R.C. 3113.04(A) has no application to the case at bar. In any event, the term \u201csupport\u201d is not defined anywhere in R.C. 3113.04(A). Further, although the statute refers to \u201cother dependentes],\u201d nowhere in R.C. 3113.04(A) does it expressly provide that aged or infirm parents who have not received medical attention are in the group of \u201cdependents\u201d at whom the statute is directed. Thus, we find the Twelfth District Court of Appeals\u2019 rulings in <em>Holder </em>not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Furthermore, we agree with appellee that an expansive interpretation of R.C. 2919.21(A)(3), as urged by appellant, could result in continued unwarranted prosecutions of adult children who have elderly parents who may be in need of medical attention or care but have refused to seek treatment for their conditions. The problem is even further compounded if the adult child is separated geographically from his or her elderly parent. Hence, we can only presume that the General Assembly, in enacting R.C. 2919.21(A)(3), was aware of the endless problems that could possibly arise if the term \u201csupport\u201d was intended to include nonfinancial factors. See R.C. 1.47.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, we do not believe that the General Assembly intended to place adult children in such untenable situations and create fertile grounds for unreasonable and excessive prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the court of appeals in this case that while it appears that appellee failed to provide her mother -with needed medical care, appellee did not violate R.C. 2919.21(A)(3). Absent further guidance by the General Assembly in this area, an adult child\u2019s duty in these types of cases rests upon a moral obligation, not an obligation enforceable by law. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and order that charges against appellee be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
