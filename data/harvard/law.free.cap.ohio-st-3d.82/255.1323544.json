As the board correctly noted, the practice of law includes representing others with regard to their causes of action for personal injury, communicating with insurance companies about claims, making representations to creditors on behalf of third parties, and advising persons of their rights, and the terms and conditions of settlement. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Fehler-Schultz </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 452, 597 N.E.2d 79; <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. George </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 267, 74 O.O.2d 425, 344 N.E.2d 132.
