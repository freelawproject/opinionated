See, also, R.C. 3921.05.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To that end, a fraternal benefit society may enter into contractual obligations to provide, among other benefits, death, endowment, annuity, and life insurance payments to its members and their dependents. R.C. 3921.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">R.C. 3921.24 provides an exemption from certain taxes for fraternal benefit societies. R.C. 3921.24 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201cEvery fraternal benefit society organized or licensed under this chapter is hereby declared to be a charitable and benevolent institution, and <em>all of its funds </em>are exempt from all state, county, district, municipal, and school taxes other than franchise taxes and taxes on real estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">United contends that R.C. 3921.24 (former R.C. 3921.40)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> exempts fraternal benefit societies like itself from assessment of the state use tax. Specifically, United argues that the General Assembly intended to provide fraternal benefit societies with an exemption from \u201call\u201d taxes except franchise taxes and taxes on real estate. Therefore, United asserts that the BTA erred in affirming the use tax assessment imposed by the commissioner. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with United.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">It is well established that \u201c[statutes relating to the exemption or exception from sales or use taxes are to be strictly construed, and one claiming such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>exemption or exception must affirmatively show his right thereto.\u201d <em>Celina Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bowers </em>(1965), 5 Ohio St.2d 12, 34 O.O.2d 7, 213 N.E.2d 175, paragraph one of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Philips Industries, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 100, 101, 524 N.E.2d 161, 161-162. Further, \u201c[o]ur duty is limited to a determination of whether the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In arguing that it is exempt from paying the use tax, United has set forth a selective reading of R.C. 3921.24. By its very terms, the statute does not exempt United from paying use taxes. Instead, R.C. 3921.24 specifically states that \u201cfunds\u201d of a fraternal benefit society are exempt from \u201call state, county, district, municipal, and school taxes other than franchise taxes and taxes on real estate.\u201d United gives little, if any, significance to the term \u201cfunds,\u201d which precedes the language \u201call state * * * taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The term \u201cfunds\u201d is not defined in R.C. Chapter 3921. The BTA therefore looked to a definition of the term as it was defined in a former edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. The BTA also analyzed how the term was used in former sections of R.C. Chapter 3921 and how it is currently being used. The BTA then concluded, and we agree, that the term \u201cfunds\u201d generally involves money or other liquid assets held by a fraternal benefit society to accomplish the society\u2019s purposes. Specifically, the BTA correctly observed that \u201cthe term \u2018funds\u2019 as used in [former] R.C. 3921.40 means and includes the fund or funds which are maintained and invested as prescribed by law to carry out the purposes of the society. It is these funds and the investments of these funds which are intended to be exempt from taxation except for the levy of franchise tax upon the net worth of the society and levy of tax upon its real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">United asserts that the BTA\u2019s decision was premised on an improper \u201cnarrow\u201d interpretation of the term \u201cfunds.\u201d United points to R.C. 3921.22(B), which provides that a fraternal benefit society can create and apply any \u201cfunds\u201d necessary to carry out \u201cany purpose\u201d permitted by the laws of the society. Therefore, according to United, the purchases in question should be exempt from the use tax because it used \u201cfunds\u201d to purchase the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">However, it is clear that R.C. 3921.24 exempts from taxation a fraternal benefit society\u2019s funds, not transactions on which Ohio imposes a use tax. The BTA correctly determined that the use tax levied by the commissioner was not upon the funds held by United. Rather, the tax assessment was issued \u201cupon the various items of office materials that were needed and utilized by the society in conducting its affairs.\u201d Thus, the use tax is not a tax on the funds of a fraternal benefit society.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">R.C. 5741.02(A) levies \u201can excise tax * * * on the storage, use, or other consumption in the state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>this state of any service provided.\u201d R.C. 5741.04 requires the consumer to pay the tax to the vendor based on the purchase price. In <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 331, 333, 21 O.O.3d 208, 210, 423 N.E.2d 479, 481, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cThe use tax levied under R.C. Chapter 574\u00cd is an <em>excise tax, </em>not an <em>ad valorem </em>tax. As such, it is imposed \u2018neither on the ownership of property, nor is it with respect to such ownership. It is not a tax \u201claid directly on persons or property.\u201d * * * It is a tax assessed for some special privilege or immunity. * * * \u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Howell Air, Inc. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 32, 34 [51 O.O.2d 62, 63, 257 N.E.2d 742, 743]. The use tax, therefore, is not a tax laid upon the property, itself, but, rather, \u2018is a tax upon the privilege of use of property * * <em>Federal Paper Bd. Co. v. Kosydar </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St.2d 28, at 32 [66 O.O.2d 82, 85, 306 N.E.2d 416, 419]. Under the statutes in question, \u2018 \u201cuse\u201d means and includes the exercise of any right or power incidental to the ownership of the thing used.\u2019 R.C. 5741.01(C).\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Accordingly, the commissioner did not assess a tax on the funds of United. Rather, the commissioner properly assessed a tax on United\u2019s exercise of its privilege to use the items it purchased, measured by the purchase price of the items. The BTA correctly decided this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Finally, United argues that we should examine R.C. 3921.24 in light of R.C. 5739.02(B)(12) to understand how the two statutes parallel each other in support of United\u2019s position. United does not claim exemption directly under R.C. 5739.02(B)(12). Instead, United asserts that this statute reveals the General Assembly\u2019s intention to exempt charitable institutions and institutions with charitable purposes from sales and use taxes. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The BTA properly rejected United\u2019s argument. First, R.C. 3921.24 does not exempt fraternal benefit societies on the basis of their status as charitable and benevolent institutions. Instead, R.C. 3921.24 simply designates them as such institutions and independently exempts their funds from various taxes. Second, R.C. 5739.02(B)(12) exempts sales of tangible personal property or services to \u201cnonprofit organizations operated exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d (The exemption is made applicable to the use tax by R.C. 5741.02.) The statute then defines charitable purposes, but the definition does not include the purposes of a fraternal benefit society. Consequently, we find that R.C. 5739.02(B)(12) fails to support United\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Thus, we hold that United is not entitled to an exemption from payment of the use tax with respect to the purchases in question. The decision of the BTA was both reasonable and lawful. . Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

R.C. 3921.05 provides that \u201c[a] fraternal benefit society shall operate for the benefit of its members and their beneficiaries by providing any of the benefits set forth in section 3921.16 of the Revised Code, and by operating for social, intellectual, educational, charitable, benevolent, moral, fraternal, patriotic, or religious purposes for the benefit of its members and any other persons as determined by the society.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\">. United\u2019s actual arguments focus on former R.C. 3921.40. United, however, agrees that Am.Sub. H.B. No. 468 (enacting current R.C. 3921.24) did hot change \u201cthe substance\u201d of former R.C. 3921.40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b431-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">dissenting. Because I would find that a plain reading of former R.C. 3921.40 (now R.C. 3921.24) exempts fraternal benefit societies from sales and use taxes, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">A fraternal benefit society operates for the social, intellectual, educational, charitable, benevolent, moral, fraternal, patriotic, or religious benefit of its. members. R.C. 3921.05. Because charitable organizations perform a valuable service to society that is to be encouraged, the General Assembly has expressly declared fraternal benefit societies to be charitable and benevolent institutions. R.C. 3921.24. The General Assembly, recognizing the unique nature of fraternal benefit societies and the services they provide to members, has enacted laws providing tax exemptions for these organizations in R.C. 3921.24 and, by implication, in R.C. 5739.02(B)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">R.C. 3921.24 (substantively the same as the statute at issue, former R.C. 3921.40) states two basic concepts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\"><em>\u201cEvery fraternal benefit society </em>* * * is <em>hereby declared to be a charitable and benevolent institution, </em>and <em>all of its funds are exempt from all* </em>* * <em>taxes </em>other than franchise taxes and taxes on real estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">First, the statute expressly exempts a fraternal benefit society from taxes (except franchise and real estate taxes) on \u201call of its funds.\u201d Although the statute does not define \u201cfunds,\u201d the word is commonly understood to broadly signify monies and assets. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (3 Ed.1992) 735, defines \u201cfunds\u201d as \u201c[available money.\u201d Black\u2019s-Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 673, states that \u201cfunds\u201d includes \u201cmoneys and much more * * * and in broader meaning may include property of all kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">There is no language in the statute that limits the meaning of \u201cfunds.\u201d Yet the BTA found it necessary to interpret the word. The majority affirmed the BTA\u2019s finding that the term \u201cfunds\u201d is restricted to \u201cthe fund or funds which are maintained and invested as prescribed by law to carry out the purposes of the society.\u201d There is no reasonable or legal basis to narrowly define the word funds to limit the tax exemption that, I believe, the General Assembly conferred upon fraternal benefit societies. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that words used in a statute are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless otherwise indicated. <em>Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emp. v. Twin Valley Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 178, 181, 6 OBR 235, 237, 451 N.E.2d 1211, 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>However, even if we accept such a narrow interpretation, a logical progression in the analysis is that United Transportation Union Insurance Association (\u201cUnited\u201d) uses its \u201cfunds\u201d to make necessary purchases to carry out the purposes of the society. The funds are exempt from all taxes (except franchise and real estate taxes), and consequently, the use of the funds, including purchases made with the funds, should be likewise exempt from taxes. The purchases become other property and part of the exempt funds just as real estate would if purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The majority labels the use tax as a \u201ctax on United\u2019s exercise of its privilege to use the items it purchased.\u201d Yet, no matter how the tax is described, the consequence of the BTA\u2019s finding is that United\u2019s funds, in this case, funds used to purchase necessary items for the operation of the fraternal benefit society, are being taxed. This taxing policy serves only to discourage a fraternal benefit society from providing services and benefits to its members in order to avoid taxation on the use of the funds. Because the exemption applies to <em>all </em>taxes, with the exception of franchise and real estate taxes, I believe this interpretation violates the express terms of former R.C. 3921.40 and the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Second, the statute also states that the exemption applies to \u201call * * * taxes other than franchise taxes and taxes on real estate.\u201d There is no express exclusion for sales and use taxes. I do not believe we should read additional exclusions into the statute. Had the General Assembly intended also to exclude sales and use taxes, it could have done so. The plain, ordinary meaning of the statute exempts fraternal benefit societies from <em>all taxes </em>other than those expressly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In addition, R.C. 5739.02(B)(12) also supports United\u2019s position that the General Assembly intended fraternal benefit societies to be exempt from sales and use taxes. The BTA rejected United\u2019s argument on the basis that the purposes of a fraternal benefit society are not included within the charitable purposes enumerated in the statute. Although fraternal benefit societies are not specifically identified in R.C. 5739.02(B)(12), many of the functions they perform are so delineated. But because the General Assembly has expressly designated fraternal benefit societies as charitable and benevolent institutions in R.C. 3921.40, no further inquiry need be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">I believe the language in the statute reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent to exempt fraternal benefit societies from <em>all </em>taxes (except franchise and real estate taxes), including sales and use taxes. Therefore, I would reverse the decision of the BTA as being unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
