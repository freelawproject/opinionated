Draganic v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 461, 663 N.E.2d 929. There, we reversed the decision presently relied upon by the court below, and held that the commission was not bound by a prior interlocutory order for the award of permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Our decision in <em>Draganic </em>disposes of all the issues currently presented but one \u2014 claimant\u2019s request for relief pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. Upon review, we find relief consistent with <em>Gay </em>to be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">We initially find \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant is medically capable of sustained remunerative employment. Drs. Brown and Zellers found claimant physically capable of sustained remunerative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>employment. Dr. Altman made a similar finding with regard to claimant\u2019s allowed psychiatric condition. Finally, Dr. Holbrook felt that the conditions cumulatively permitted sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Turning to the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis, we find that it satisfies the requirements of <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. Stressing claimant\u2019s relatively young age and her education, the commission found claimant to have many sedentary career options both within and outside the field of health care. While the claimant has asked us to view her education in a less favorable light than did the commission, we decline to so do, recognizing the commission\u2019s exclusive role as interpreter of evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Accordingly, our finding of <em>Noll </em>compliance negates claimant\u2019s eligibility for relief under <em>Gay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b199-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.
