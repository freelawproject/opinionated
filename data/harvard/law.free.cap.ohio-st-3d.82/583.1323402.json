See <em>State ex rel. MTD Products, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 593, 596, 669 N.E.2d 846, 849; <em>State ex rel. Jeep Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 64, 67, 577 N.E.2d 1095, 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The commission also argues that \u201c[e]ven assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that there was disputed evidence as to maximum medical improvement before the commission, the termination date of October 31, 1993 was proper and not an abuse of discretion.\u201d However, we recently held in <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 516, 696 N.E.2d 1069, at the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">\u201cThe appropriate date on which to terminate disputed temporary total disability compensation on the basis of maximum medical improvement is the date of the termination hearing, and the commission may not declare an overpayment for payments received by the claimant before that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Accordingly, claimant was entitled to TTD compensation until April 18, 1994, and the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b678-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas,' Resnick, F.E.

I agree that the conflicting evidence of MMI entitled Spurgeon to receive temporary total disability compensation for the period from November 1, 1993 to April 18, 1994. In accordance with my dissent in <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 516, 696 N.E.2d 1069, however, the right to receive is not equivalent to the right to retain.'
