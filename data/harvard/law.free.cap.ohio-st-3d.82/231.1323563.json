Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Contrary to Kroger\u2019s proposition, there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that the allowed conditions on which the commission relied in assessing PTD are indeed permanent. Dr. Weaver characterized claimant\u2019s psychological conditions as permanent in 1988. Kroger responds that his report should be removed from consideration because he refers to claimant\u2019s adjustment disorder as one that <em>developed </em>as a result of the industrial injury rather than one that was <em>aggravated </em>by it \u2014 the latter term being expressly contained in the formal order of allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">We do not find this distinction to merit evidentiary disqualification, having recently recognized that some latitude is necessary when dealing with psychological diagnoses. In <em>State ex rel. Kroger Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 483, 687 N.E.2d 446, the allowed psychiatric condition was \u201canxiety disorder with panic attacks.\u201d Throughout the numerous medical reports of record in that case, however, claimant\u2019s condition was variously referred to by her attending psychiatrist as \u201cpost-traumatic stress disorder (secondary to industrial accident)\u201d and/or \u201cdysthymia.\u201d Kroger objected when temporary total disability compensation was based on one of those alternative diagnoses. We rejected Kroger\u2019s argument, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201cCompensable disability must arise exclusively from the claim\u2019s allowed conditions. <em>Fox v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569, 55 O.O. 472, 125 N.E.2d 1. Ideally, the diagnosis contained on a disability form should mirror exactly the condition(s) allowed by the commission, and where it does not, closer examination may be warranted. Some degree of flexibility, however, seems particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>important when dealing with psychiatric conditions. As the Washington Supreme Court observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201c \u2018Psychology and psychiatry are imprecise disciplines. Unlike the biological sciences, their methods of investigation are primarily subjective and most of their findings are not based on physically observable evidence.\u2019 <em>Tyson v. Tyson </em>(1986), 107 Wash.2d 72, 78, 727 P.2d 226, 229.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court, in a criminal case, made a similar comment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201c \u2018Psychiatric diagnosis, in contrast, is to a large extent based on medical \u201cimpressions\u201d drawn from subjective analysis and filtered through the experience of the diagnostician. This process often makes it very difficult for the expert physician to offer definite conclusions about any particular patient.\u2019 <em>Addington v. Texas </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 418, 430, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1811, 60 L.Ed.2d 323, 333.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cThe reference to the nature of psychological diagnoses does not imply that these diagnoses are freely interchangeable. Clearly, major depression and paranoia are not the same and, in this case, all three disorders, PTSD, dysthymia, and anxiety disorder with panic attacks, are distinct. Nevertheless, we find that the multiple psychological diagnoses are not fatal to claimant\u2019s compensation application. There are three reasons for this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cFirst, regardless of the label attached, Dr. Blythe consistently referred to the same symptoms as being the cause of disability. Second, many of the symptoms are common to all three maladies. This largely explains why Dr. Blythe has had difficulty categorizing the disorder. Finally, Dr. Blythe has always related the relevant symptomatology to the industrial accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cCumulatively, this indicates that the debilitating symptoms are industrially related. This is not a situation in which diagnostic flexibility will allow a physician to surreptitiously treat a claimant for a nonindustrial ailment. The problem seems to rest solely on Dr. Blythe\u2019s understandable inability to affix a single diagnosis to symptoms that fit several categories. For these reasons, the commission\u2019s reliance on Dr. Blythe\u2019s reports is not an abuse of discretion * * <em>Id. </em>at 489^490, 687 N.E.2d at 452.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">In this instance, Dr. Weaver clearly related claimant\u2019s adjustment reaction \u2014 by name \u2014 to her industrial injury. We do not, therefore, find that Dr. Weaver\u2019s description of claimant\u2019s condition invalidates his opinion as to the permanency of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Kroger also argues that Dr. Weaver\u2019s report is too old to be probative. This assertion, however, ignores the commission\u2019s role as exclusive evaluator of evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. In this case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>commission apparently found that Dr. Weaver\u2019s assessment of permanency was unaffected by the passage of time. This was within the commission\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">There is also \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the permanency of claimant\u2019s allowed physical conditions. Dr. Budde stated in 1986 that claimant\u2019s cervical and lumbar conditions had reached maximum medical improvement/permanency. Kroger again asserts the report\u2019s age as a defense \u2014 an argument we reject for the reasons given above. We also do not find that the validity of Dr. Budde\u2019s conclusion is affected by the fact that in 1986, claimant\u2019s cervical condition was not yet an allowed condition. Legal recognition of a condition does not change the condition\u2019s medical characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Kroger lastly argues that the commission\u2019s order does not satisfy <em>Noll. </em>This contention is unpersuasive. After finding claimant to be medically capable of sustained remunerative work, the commission was required to examine claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors and their effect on claimant\u2019s re-employment potential. <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946. The commission did this and explained its findings within its order. This explanation, while brief, is nevertheless sufficient to satisfy <em>Noll. </em>The commission found that claimant\u2019s age, education, and work history were obstacles that, when combined with her medical condition, removed her from the labor force. <em>Noll </em>requires no more in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
