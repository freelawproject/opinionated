In determining a sanction to be imposed, we consider the duty violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the injury caused, and the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Warren Cty. Bar Assn. v. Bunce </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 112, 115, 689 N.E.2d 566, 568, and cases cited therein. In this matter respondent should not have performed legal services for others after his appointment as referee/magistrate, however minor those services might have been. Nevertheless, we note that respondent was not attempting to profit by these activities and that none of respondent\u2019s clients was harmed by his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The sanction imposed on respondent by the probate court was to discharge him from his position as referee/magistrate.
