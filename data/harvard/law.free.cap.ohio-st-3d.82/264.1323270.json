Thereafter, compensation is requested under section (D)(1). The commission denied wage loss compensation, but the court of appeals returned the cause to the commission for further consideration pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. Claimant disagrees, and urges us to proceed directly to a wage loss award, citing <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. For the reasons to follow, we reject claimant\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The proximity of claimant\u2019s motor vehicle accident to his industrial injury complicates the case, and finding any residual injuries has been difficult, even for claimant\u2019s attending physician. For example, on September 13, 1990, Dr. Smith, despite a favorable prognosis, was still concerned about the claimant\u2019s return to his former job and encouraged lighter work. At the time of his auto accident, claimant still had not been released to return to his former job. To the contrary, just a week before, Dr. Smith had postponed claimant\u2019s return to February 1, 1991 \u2014 a fact that the commission overlooked in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">In contrast to this evidence is Dr. Smith\u2019s January 13, 1992 letter. There, he appears to backtrack from his earlier indication that claimant had post-motor-vehicle-accident residual injuries. Instead, Dr. Smith appears to attribute all of claimant\u2019s medical conditions to the auto accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">This evidentiary uncertainty supports the court of appeals\u2019 decision to return the cause for further consideration. Dr. Smith\u2019s September 13, 1990 comment\u2014 on which the commission exclusively relied \u2014 does not support the conclusion that claimant\u2019s allowed conditions had fully resolved prior to the motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>accident. On the other hand, the January 13, 1992 letter negates the claimant\u2019s assertion that he had permanent residual injuries that conclusively established a right to wage loss compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">A claimant cannot base a compensation request even partially on non-allowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. Non-allowed conditions, however, do not bar compensation if the allowed conditions, in and of themselves, also generate the required amount of disability. Applying both principles here, we conclude that there is a significant period over which claimant may or may not be eligible for wage loss compensation. The court of appeals, therefore, properly returned the cause to the commission for <em>Noll </em>consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AGv\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b362-9\">F.E.
