Martin Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 25 OBR 331, 333, 496 N.E.2d 478, 480. This case revolves around the first element, <em>i.e., </em>whether McGlone was handicapped. At the time this case arose, the predecessor to the current R.C. 4112.01(A)(13) was .in effect, and it defined \u201chandicap\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">\u201c \u2018Handicap\u2019 means a medically diagnosable, abnormal condition which is expected to continue for a considerable length of time, whether correctable or uncorrectable by good medical practice, which can reasonably be expected to limit the person\u2019s functional ability, including, but not limited to, seeing, hearing, thinking, ambulating, climbing, descending, lifting, grasping, sitting, rising, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>related function, or any limitation due to weakness and significantly decreased endurance, so that he cannot perform his everyday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship and vulnerability to what are considered the everyday obstacles and hazards encountered by the non-handicapped.\u201d 143 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In the current version of R.C. 4112.01(A)(13), even if a person is not handicapped, he can gain the protection of handicap discrimination laws if he is \u201cregarded [by an employer] as having a physical or mental impairment.\u201d While the \u201cregarded as handicapped\u201d language was not part of the statute when this case arose, the pertinent Administrative Code section in effect at the time, Ohio Adm.Code 4112-5-02(H), included in its definition of a \u201chandicapped person\u201d \u201cany person who is regarded as handicapped by a respondent.\u201d We therefore find that it was appropriate for the OCRC and the reviewing courts to consider whether the city perceived McGlone as handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The question before this court then is whether a person can be foreclosed from a particular job based upon a physical impairment without at the same time being handicapped, or perceived as handicapped, under former R.C. 4112.01(A)(13), and therefore due the protections of the Ohio Civil Rights Act. We find that McGlone was neither handicapped nor perceived as handicapped by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">To find that McGlone was handicapped, we would have to conclude that his nearsightedness was a \u201cmedically diagnosable, abnormal condition which is expected to continue for a considerable length of time * * * which can reasonably be expected to limit [his] functional ability * * * so that he cannot perform his everyday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship and vulnerability to what are considered the everyday obstacles and hazards encountered by the nonhandicapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">There is no dispute that McGlone\u2019s 20/100 vision is a medically diagnosable condition that is expected to continue. Whether that condition limits his functional ability so that he cannot perform his everyday routine living and working without significantly increased hardship is another matter. The record shows that McGlone leads a normal life. The fact that he wears eyeglasses or contact lenses is not a significant hardship. It is a common burden shared by millions, including a majority of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">McGlone\u2019s nearsightedness has led to one major hardship in his life, his inability to become a firefighter. But the statute speaks in terms of \u201ceveryday routine living and working.\u201d It is a broad reference to a general quality of life. The handicap discrimination statute was designed to protect those who live with a handicap that significantly affects the way they live their lives on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The federal Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) is similar to the Ohio handicap discrimination law. It defines a disability as a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of [an] individual.\u201d Section 12102(2)(A), Title 42, U.S.Code. We can look to regulations and cases interpreting the federal Act for guidance in our interpretation of Ohio law. <em>Little Forest Med. Ctr. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 607, 575 N.E.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In its interpretation of the ADA, Section 1630.2(j)(3), Title 29, C.F.R. discusses what factors should be considered in determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u2018With respect to the major life activity of working\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201c(i) The term <em>substantially limits </em>means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities. <em>The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">There is no evidence that McGlone\u2019s vision disqualified him from a class of jobs or a wide range of jobs. The city merely precluded him from one position, firefighter. In <em>Bridges v. Bossier </em>(C.A.5, 1996), 92 F.3d 329, the court held that an applicant who was disqualified from performing firefighting jobs for the city based on a mild form of hemophilia was not disabled under the ADA, since the field of firefighting jobs was too narrow a field to constitute a \u201cclass of jobs.\u201d We agree with the <em>Bridges </em>court\u2019s interpretation that the position of firefighter does not constitute a class of jobs, but is merely one job. We further conclude that the inability to perform a single job does not present significantly increased hardship to a person\u2019s everyday routine living and working.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Other federal courts have refused to find that nearsightedness constitutes a disability. In <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(C.A.10, 1997), 130 F.3d 893, plaintiffs, twin sisters, were denied employment by United Air Lines for failure to have uncorreeted vision of 20/100 or better in each eye. The <em>Sutton </em>court found that the impairment did not substantially limit a major life activity, and that the sisters were not disabled. In <em>Chandler v. Dallas </em>(C.A.5, 1993), 2 F.3d 1385, 1390, the court held that a person is not handicapped if his vision can be corrected to 20/200. In <em>Joyce v. Suffolk Cty. </em>(E.D.N.Y.1996), 911 F.Supp. 92, a plaintiff denied a job as a police officer because of impaired eyesight was found not to have a disability. See, also, <em>Walker v. Aberdeen-Monroe Cty. Hosp. </em>(N.D.Miss.1993), 838 F.Supp. 285; <em>Trembczsynski v. Calumet City </em>(Aug. 31, 1987), N.D.Ill. No. 87 C 0961, unreported, 1987 WL 16604.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>We conclude that McGlone\u2019s 20/100 vision is not a handicap under the statute. His vision problem did not create significantly increased hardship in McGlone\u2019s functional ability to perform his everyday living and working.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We further conclude that the city did not perceive McGlone as handicapped. We stated above that the inability to perform a single job because of an abnormal condition does not transform that condition into a handicap. The city in this case considered McGlone nearsighted, not handicapped, merely lacking a single physical requirement for a single job. For McGlone to succeed on a theory of perceived handicap, the city would have had to consider McGlone\u2019s nearsightedness as foreclosing him from a class of jobs. There is no evidence that the city had such a perception.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ahj5\">Resnick, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b668-9\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
