First, as the court of appeals held, <em>Kellogg </em>is inapplicable here because Spann received a revocation hearing. See <em>Kellogg, </em>46 F.3d at 509. Second, there is no ten-day or sixty-day rule entitling parolees to habeas corpus relief upon expiration of such period; instead, the applicable test is whether there has been an unreasonable delay in holding a parole-revocation hearing. See <em>Seebeck v. Zent </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 109, 111, 623 N.E.2d 1195, 1197. Finally, \u201c[a]s long as an unreasonable delay has not occurred, the remedy for noncompliance with the <em>Morrissey </em>parole-revocation due process requirements is a new hearing, not outright release from prison.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. McFaul </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 652 N.E.2d 746, 749. Spann faded to adege sufficient facts establishing prejudice. He alleged neither the nature of his witnesses\u2019 testimony, the reasons why this testimony was no longer avadable to him, nor the parole violation charges they would have refuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals properly dismissed Spann\u2019s petition. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
