Mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43. <em>State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 426-427, 639 N.E.2d 83, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">As The Blade concedes, its mandamus claim is moot because the board has now given it a copy of the settlement agreement. <em>State ex rel. Thomson v. Doneghy </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 222, 685 N.E.2d 537. Therefore, we deny the writ of mandamus based on mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">Request for Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">The Blade requests attorney fees. \u201cA court may award attorney fees pursuant to R.C. 149.43 where (1) a person makes a proper request for public records pursuant to R.C. 149.43, (2) the custodian of the public records fails to comply with the person\u2019s request, (3) the requesting person files a mandamus action pursuant to R.C. 149.43 to obtain copies of the records, and (4) the person receives the requested public records only after the mandamus action is filed, thereby rendering the claim for a writ of mandamus moot.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pennington v. Gundler </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 171, 661 N.E.2d 1049, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">The Blade satisfied the third and fourth <em>Pennington </em>requirements. It received access' to the settlement agreement only after it filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">Further, the Blade has established the remaining <em>Pennington </em>requirements. Although the board presented evidence disputing the propriety of The Blade\u2019s request and the board\u2019s failure to comply with that request, even the board\u2019s clerk\u2019s affidavit states that The Blade requested \u201cpaperwork\u201d on the settled case, which is broad enough to include the settlement agreement. See <em>State ex rel. Gannett Satellite Info. Network v. Shirey </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 400, 401, 678 N.E.2d 557, 559 (\u201cR.C. 149.43 is to be construed liberally in favor of broad access, and any doubt is to be resolved in favor of disclosure of public records.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>According to The Blade, it specifically requested to inspect all records relating to the settlement terms. The board also failed to file a merit brief disputing the propriety of an award of attorney fees. See S.CtPrac.R. X(ll) (\u201cIf the respondent fails to file a merit brief within the time provided by this rule or as ordered by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court may accept the relator\u2019s statement of facts and issues as correct * * *.\u201d). The settlement agreement is a public record, notwithstanding any confidentiality provision or possession of it by the attorney for the board\u2019s insurer. <em>Findlay Publishing Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Under our unanimous holding in <em>Findlay Publishing Co., </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 139, 684 N.E.2d at 1226, The Blade is thus entitled to an award of attorney fees because it \u201chas established a sufficient public benefit [by the provision of access to the requested settlement agreement], and the board failed to comply with its records request for reasons that were unreasonable and unjustifiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Based on the foregoing, we award attorney fees to The Blade, and order its counsel to submit a bill and documentation in support of attorney fees in accordance with DR 2-106(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
