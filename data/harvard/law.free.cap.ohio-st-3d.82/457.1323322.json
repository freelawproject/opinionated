Lawrence v. Am. Lubricants Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 533 N.E.2d 344, 345, citing <em>State ex rel. Jennings v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E.2d 420. Thus, in determining whether a claimant is permanently and totally disabled, the commission must consider all pertinent factors, both medical and nonmedical, that may impact on the claimant\u2019s ability to continue to work. In <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 173, 31 OBR 369, 374, 509 N.E.2d 946, 951, we held that the commission must \u201clook at the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, and all other factors, such as physical, psychological, and sociological, that are contained within the record in making its determination of permanent total disability.\u201d The commission\u2019s consideration of the <em>Stephenson </em>factors is essential to the determination of permanent total disability, where the medical evidence indicates that the claimant is capable of some work and the nonmedical disability factors indicate that the claimant cannot realistically engage in sustained remunerative employment. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 320, 626 N.E.2d 666, 671 (\u201cA thorough consideration of the <em>Stephenson </em>factors is indispensable to the determination of permanent total disability, where a claimant\u2019s medical capacity to do work is not dispositive and the claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors indicate that the claimant cannot realistically return to the job market.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In <em>Noll, </em>syllabus, we held: \u201cIn any order of the Industrial Commission granting or denying benefits to a claimant, the commission must specifically state what evidence has been relied upon, and briefly explain the reasoning for its decision.\u201d The mandate of <em>Noll </em>that the commission must explain the basis for its decisions includes the duty of the commission to explain, in its orders, how the <em>Stephenson </em>factors, if pertinent, support the commission\u2019s determination granting or denying requested benefits. <em>Gay, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 321, 626 N.E.2d at 671. The failure to comply with <em>Noll </em>\u201cis equivalent to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ranomer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 134, 137, 642 N.E.2d 373, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In the case at bar, the commission\u2019s order does not adequately explain how appellant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors comport with the decision denying permanent total disability compensation. To be sure, the commission\u2019s findings .are inconsistent with its ultimate determination that appellant\u2019s application: be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In its order, the commission states that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s past employment has consisted of heavy work as a cement finisher only\u201d and that \u201c[t]his work did not yield any skills which could be transferable to sedentary work activities.\u201d The commission also states that \u201c[c]laimant is 48 years old and he completed the 9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>grade. He does not have a G.E.D. He cannot read, write or do basic math well.\u201d The commission also noted that appellant\u2019s file does not contain a vocational report. Based on the foregoing information, the commission then concluded that \u201cclaimant is capable of obtaining his G.E.D. and undertaking retraining so as to qualify for a more sedentary-type of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Notably, the commission cites appellant\u2019s age and the fact that the record does not contain a vocational report as evidence that appellant is capable of obtaining his G.E.D. According to the commission\u2019s order, once appellant has obtained his G.E.D., he would then be in a position to retrain for sedentary-type employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Appellant\u2019s age may be a vocationally favorable factor. See, generally, <em>State ex rel. Wilson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 250, 253, 685 N.E.2d 774, 777. However, age alone should not be the ultimate determinant as to whether a person has the needed proficiency to obtain a G.E.D. Appellant does not have a G.E.D. He only completed the ninth grade and he cannot read, write, or do basic math well. In this regard, the commission has provided no explanation how appellant, given his present limited abilities, is qualified to obtain a G.E.D. Further, there is no vocational report within the record upon which a proper determination can be made that appellant has the skills necessary to provide him with the opportunity to return to the job market. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>State ex rel. Speelman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 757, 762, 598 N.E.2d 192, 195 (\u201c[T]he relevant vocational inquiry is \u201cwhether the claimant may return to the job market by using past employment skills or those skills which may be reasonably developed.\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, the specific findings by the commission with respect to appellant\u2019s limited abilities are inconsistent with its ultimate conclusion that appellant can in fact obtain a G.E.D. and eventually return to sustained remunerative employment. Clearly, the commission\u2019s order does not satisfy the requirements of <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Having concluded that the commission\u2019s order violates <em>Noll, </em>we next consider whether appellant is entitled to the issuance of a writ directing the commission to find that he is permanently and totally disabled. In many cases involving <em>Noll </em>noncompliance, we have elected to return the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order. However, <em>Gay </em>offers a different alternative in circumstances where returning the cause to the commission would serve no useful purpose. In <em>Gay, </em>at the syllabus, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201cIn a workers\u2019 compensation case involving permanent total disability, where the facts of the case indicate that there is a substantial likelihood that a claimant is permanently and totally disabled, courts are not and will not be precluded from ordering the Industrial Commission, in a mandamus action, to award permanent total disability benefits notwithstanding the so-called \u2018some evidence\u2019 rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Thus, having the option of deciding between <em>Noll </em>and <em>Gay </em>relief, we reluctantly choose the former. We are particularly interested in any insight the commission may provide if it determines that appellant is not entitled to permanent total disability compensation. Of course, to adequately justify its decision denying appellant\u2019s application, the commission, in its order, would be required to explain how it is that a forty-eight-year-old claimant, who has worked his entire working life as a cement finisher, who has not worked since 1989, who is incapable of returning to his former job duties, who has no transferable job skills, and who has limited reading, writing, and math abilities, can realistically return to the job market to perform some type of sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and a limited writ is issued that returns the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited unit allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-7\">Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Amd\">Moyer, C.J., Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b556-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuI\">dissenting. The appropriate standard for this court\u2019s review is to determine whether there is \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the stated basis for the commission\u2019s order. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. I believe the commission\u2019s order adequately explained how nonmedical factors, in combination with Gemind\u2019s medical impairments, permit sustained remunerative employment. The order discussed nonmedical factors such as his age and his ability to read and write as evidence of his ability to be retrained. Gemind produced no vocational report or other evidence that he is incapable of being retrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Because the record below contains \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of the commission\u2019s order, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b556-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
