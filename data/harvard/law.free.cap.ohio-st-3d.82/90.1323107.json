However, unlike permanent partial disability compensation under former R.C. 4123.57(B), there is no automatic entitlement to IEC benefits once a permanent partial disability has been proven. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 384, 533 N.E.2d 775. A claimant must also prove <em>actual </em>IEC. <em>Id. </em>At issue is the claimant\u2019s ability to sustain this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The employer Dayton CPC Group initially contests claimant\u2019s IEC eligibility on procedural grounds, arguing that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and election of remedies bar IEC benefits, since claimant has already received permanent partial disability compensation. We disagree. Former R.C. 4123.57(A) expressly permits a claimant to change his or her method of payment \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Since a lack of good cause has not been alleged, we turn to the remaining issue raised \u2014 a retiree\u2019s eligibility for IEC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Former R.C. 4123.57(A) requires a comparison of a claimant\u2019s pre- and post-injury earning capacity. <em>State ex rel. CPC Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 209, 211, 559 N.E.2d 1330, 1333. The consideration of post-injury earning capacity assumes, at a minimum, a claimant\u2019s desire to earn income during the period in which IEC has been alleged. <em>Id. </em>Retirement is not necessarily inconsistent with this desire, since retirees have the right to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>supplemental post-retirement employment. Thus, retirement does not, in and of itself, bar IEC compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In the case before us, the commission\u2019s order issues contradictory assessments of claimant\u2019s post-retirement desire to earn income. At one point, it specifically finds a desire to earn income (claimant\u2019s tobacco farm), while at another it implies the opposite (lack of a job search). This ambiguity effectively forecloses further review, since the rest of the parties\u2019 arguments assumes a definitive resolution of the desire-to-earn-income issue. As such, we find it necessary to return the cause to the commission for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is returned for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause returned.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
