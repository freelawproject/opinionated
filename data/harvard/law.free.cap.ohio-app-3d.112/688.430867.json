Self, appeals his conviction for vehicular homicide. Appellant\u2019s conviction was the result of an automobile accident at the intersection of State Route 729 and State Route 72 in Clinton County (the \u201cintersection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">On June 8, 1995, appellant was traveling northeast on State Route 729 towards the intersection. Stop signs mark the intersection for those traveling on State Route 729. There is, however, no traffic control device for vehicles approaching the intersection on State Route 72; motorists traveling through the intersection on State Route 72 have the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">Although he had a stop sign, appellant did not stop at the intersection but drove straight into it at a speed of at least thirty-nine miles per hour, colliding with the left rear side of a vehicle driven by Ernest Osborne, who was traveling northwest on State Route 72. Osborne\u2019s car spun out of control and rolled over, fatally injuring him. At the time of the accident, the road was dry and the weather was sunny and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">Appellant was charged with vehicular homicide in violation of R.C. 2903.07(A). He waived his right to a jury trial, and the case was tried to the bench. Appellant was convicted and sentenced. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Appellant presents five assignments of error for review. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in entering a verdict of guilty where there was insufficient proof of the cause of Osborne\u2019s death. In support of his argument, appellant states that Clinton County Coroner, Cecil W. Hales, M.D., who testified as an expert witness, did not conduct the autopsy of Osborne himself and that the autopsy report was not admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument rests on the assumption that the only reliable evidence as to the cause of Osborne\u2019s death is the autopsy report, which was not admitted into evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Evid.R. 703 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">\u201cThe facts or data in the particular ease upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">At trial, Hales testified that when he arrived at the scene of the accident Osborne was already deceased. The car was on its side and Osborne was lying with his head pinned between the car door and the outside. Hales testified that he observed \u201cmassive injury to [Osborne\u2019s] skull so you could see it through his scalp,\u201d that \u201cyou could see part of the skull was fractured right there,\u201d and that \u201cyou could feel the mushiness of the skull itself.\u201d He also testified that, in his opinion, the cause of Osborne\u2019s death was his head injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Frances Osborne, the wife of Ernest Osborne and a front seat passenger in the car, testified that immediately prior to the impact Osborne was alive and not ill or injured. Osborne spoke seconds before the crash occurred, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s got a stop sign,\u201d and then, \u201cWhat in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">In this instance, where the record clearly supports the conclusion that Osborne died from a head injury caused by his collision with appellant\u2019s automobile, we find that the coroner\u2019s testimony concerning his observations at the scene of the accident are sufficient proof of the cause of death. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">In his second assignment of error, appellant states that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to compel discovery. The facts underlying appellant\u2019s second assignment of error are as follows: At a pretrial hearing, the trial court set November 3, 1995 as the \u201ccut-off date\u201d for discovery, stating that \u201cif there was a problem with discovery, [the court] want[s] to know about it by that date.\u201d After filing two requests for discovery, appellant filed a motion to compel discovery on November 6, 1995. The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that it was filed after the cut-off date. Appellant moved the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>to reconsider its decision. The trial court denied the motion to reconsider, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u201cThe court has reviewed the tape recording of the pre-trial and finds that there can be no doubt that any problems with discovery were to be brought to the court\u2019s attention by the cut-off date for discovery, November 3,1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\"><em>a </em># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">\u201cFurther, the court is unclear as to what information defendant seeks from the state. The court is cognizant of the state\u2019s open fil\u00e9 policy with respect to discovery and absent some proof to the contrary believes defendant has access even, at this late date, to whatever evidence the prosecution possesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Appellant now argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions necessitates a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Even if the state had withheld \u00e9videnee \u2014 an occurrence which has not been demonstrated \u2014 the mere failure to disclose evidence does not by itself warrant a new trial; the contested evidence must also be found to be material to the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Perry </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 78, 85, 608 N.E.2d 846, 850-851. Specifically, there must be a \u201creasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the results of the proceedings would have been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">In this case, several factors support the trial court\u2019s ruling. First, the state has an open-file policy, allowing appellant access to everything in its file whether or not Crim.R. 16 requires it. There is no evidence that this policy was changed in appellant\u2019s case, making it unlikely that any evidence was withheld from him. Second, appellant does not identify which items, if any, he believes the state withheld. Finally, appellant does not demonstrate, or even suggest, any prejudice that he might have suffered as a result of the state\u2019s alleged failure to comply with Crim.R. 16. In the absence of any showing of wrongdoing by the state or prejudice to appellant, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s discovery motions. See <em>id. </em>The second assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">We now turn to appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth assignments of error, in which he asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29 and that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>In sufficiency of the evidence questions, the \u201crelevant inquiry is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. The reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact, as the trier of fact is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 574 N.E.2d at 507. The same standard of review governs a motion for judgment of acquittal under Crim.R. 29. <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellant was convicted of violating R.C. 2903.07(A), which states: \u201cNo person while operating a motor vehicle * * * shall negligently cause the death of another.\u201d Negligence within the criminal context is defined in R.C. 2901.22(D) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201cA person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The standard described in R.C. 2901.22(D) is a higher degree of negligence than ordinary negligence because it requires a <em>substantial </em>lack of due care. <em>State v. Ovens </em>(1974), 44 Ohio App.2d 428, 430-431, 73 O.O.2d 540, 541-542, 339 N.E.2d 853, 855-856. The determination of whether a lapse of due care is substantial is a question for the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 432, 73 O.O.2d at 542-543, 339 N.E.2d at 856; <em>Middletown v. Campbell </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 411, 418, 590 N.E.2d 1301, 1305-1306. \u201cSubstantial\u201d is a synonym of \u201cmaterial,\u201d which is defined as \u201cbeing of real importance or great consequence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981 Ed.) 1392, 2280.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Our review of the record before us indicates that there was competent, credible evidence to support a decision by the trial court that all the elements of vehicular homicide were proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that appellant\u2019s lapse of due care was \u201cof great consequence.\u201d It should have been obvious to appellant that he was approaching an intersection at which he was supposed to stop. Testimony at trial indicated that the road was dry and the weather was sunny and clear. A stop-ahead sign consisting of a bright red octagon situated on a bright yellow diamond beneath a black arrow was visible from appellant\u2019s lane of traffic one thousand feet before the intersection. A' standard-size red stop sign was located twenty-seven feet before the intersection and a two-foot wide white stop bar was painted on the road just before the intersection. Moreover, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>were other directional road signs that indicated indirectly that, at the very least, an intersection was ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Witnesses also testified that appellant appeared to be traveling at \u201chighway speed\u201d and that he made no attempt to slow down or stop at the intersection. State Trooper Robert L. Matthews testified as an expert witness that appellant was traveling just over thirty-nine miles per hour at the time of the impact and that there was no evidence that he attempted to slow down at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In light of these facts, we find that appellant\u2019s failure to stop at the stop sign was a criminally negligent act and that the trial court did not err by convicting appellant of vehicular homicide. We also find that the trial court correctly overruled appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion because the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of guilty. Appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Finally, we turn to appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. Appellant states that the trial court erred in sustaining the state\u2019s objection to defense Exhibit No. 17, a newspaper article that contains statements by two individuals who were not called to testify at the trial and by prohibiting defense counsel from using those statements in order to cross-examine an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">At trial, appellant attempted to cross-examine expert witness Trooper Robert L. Matthews using a newspaper article from the Wilmington News-Journal. The article contains statements by Matthews\u2019s post commander and an Ohio State Department of Transportation engineer concerning the safety of the intersection and prior accidents that occurred there. Appellant argues that the newspaper article would have bolstered his argument that his failure to stop at the stop sign was not the \u201csubstantial lapse of due care\u201d needed to show criminal negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Evid.R. 801(C). The purpose of the rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay is to avoid introducing statements that are unreliable because the out-of-court declarant cannot be cross-examined and the triers of fact are unable to observe the declarant and determine whether his statement was worthy of belief. <em>Covington v. Sawyer </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 40, 43, 9 OBR 43, 45-46, 458 N.E.2d 465, 468-469. Newspaper articles are generally inadmissible as evidence of the facts stated within the article because they are hearsay not within any exception. See Annotation, Admissibility of Newspaper Article as Evidence of the Truth of the Facts Stated Therein (1974), 55 A.L.R.3d 663, Section 2a.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 284, 581 N.E.2d 1071, 1077-1078. A reviewing court will not reverse a trial court on appeal unless the trial court so abused its discretion that there was prejudice to defendant. <em>State v. Graham </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 350, 352, 12 O.O.3d 317, 318, 390 N.E.2d 805, 806-807. An abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is made which is arbitrary, unreasonable or unconscionable. <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715, 719-720. However, if a judicial error occurs, it may be deemed harmless if the reviewing court ascertains that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 282-283, 574 N.E.2d at 509-510.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In this instance, appellant sought to cross-examine Matthews on statements allegedly made by out-of-court declarants and then quoted by a newspaper reporter. Under these circumstances, there is nothing to substantiate the trustworthiness of the statements. They are hearsay not within any exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Moreover, we have already determined that there was sufficient, probative evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction. Instead of stopping as he was required by law to do, appellant drove through a clearly marked, rural intersection in broad daylight without hesitating. Any testimony concerning prior accidents involving others at the same intersection would not change the critical fact of appellant\u2019s criminal negligence in the operation of his own vehicle at the time of the accident. Therefore, even if the trial court committed error in excluding the evidence, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b727-7\">William W.
