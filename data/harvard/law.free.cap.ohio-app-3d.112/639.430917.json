As a result of the break, McCubbin fell fifteen feet and sustained various injuries. The ladder had affixed to it a label from the Dayton Safety Ladder Company. The Dayton Safety Ladder Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Michigan Ladder Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">The McCubbins filed suit against the Michigan Ladder Company and the Dayton Safety Ladder Company, appellees, claiming, pursuant to Ohio\u2019s products liability law, that the ladder at issue was defectively designed and manufactured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>and that appellees failed to warn or adequately warn of the ladder\u2019s dangers. In addition, Martha McCubbin claimed loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The appellees moved for summary judgment on both claims, alleging that they did not manufacture the ladder in question, that the product was not defective, and that the ladder had been misused.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">To overcome appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the McCubbins submitted, among other materials, the affidavit and deposition testimony of Dr. James Myers. Myers has a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering and specializes in materials analysis. He inspected the rung upon which McCubbin had been standing when he fell, and gave his opinion as to the cause of the break. Myers stated that the rungs of the ladder in question were not fastened to the sides of the ladder adequately, and that this error caused the rung upon which McCubbin was standing to fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Citing Evid.R. 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, the lower court determined (1) that Myers was not properly qualified to testify as to the reasons for the rung failure, and (2) that Myers\u2019s theory was unreliable because it was unsupported by any verifiable testing techniques and was based solely on his perceptions. Consequently, the court did not consider the testimony of Myers in ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Absent Myers\u2019s opinions, there was no evidence to demonstrate that there was a material issue of fact about whether the ladder was defective. Accordingly, the lower court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The McCubbins raise four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as reasonable minds could conclude that there were genuine issues of material fact and defendants were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\u201c2. When the product is defective due to inadequate warning or instruction as set forth in 2307.76 of the Ohio Revised Code, the court erred in granting summary judgment when genuine issues of material fact remained on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">\u201c3. The lower court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants when reasonable minds could conclude that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the defendants\u2019 liability as supplier pursuant to section 2307.78 of the Ohio Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\"><em>\u201c4. </em>As the right of trial by jury shall be inviolate in civil cases as guaranteed by Section 5 of Article I of the Ohio Constitution, a summary judgment and judgment by the court should scrupulously follow the requirements of Ohio Rule of Civil Procedure 56(C) that there are no genuine issues as to any material facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, after having all evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We interpret the first and fourth assignments of error as challenging the lower court\u2019s exclusion of Myers\u2019s opinions when it ruled on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Standard for Admissibility of Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Since the lower court determined both that Myers was not properly qualified to testify and that his testimony was unreliable, Evid.R. 104(A) and 702 are relevant to our inquiry.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Myers\u2019s Qualifications</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Pursuant to Evid.R. 104(A) and 702, it is the function of the trial court to make a preliminary determination about whether a particular witness qualifies as an expert witness. On appeal, this court may not overturn such a decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Tomlin </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 724, 590 N.E.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">In order to qualify as an expert witness, a potential witness does not have to be the most knowledgeable or the best witness regarding the topic at hand. <em>Scott v. Yates </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 219, 643 N.E.2d 105; <em>Vistein v. Keeney </em>(1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 92, 593 N.E.2d 52. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the proposed witness possesses knowledge such that his or her testimony will aid the trier of fact. Evid.R. 702; <em>Scott </em>and <em>Vistein, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The McCubbins\u2019 proposed expert witness, James Myers, has a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering from Ohio State University. From 1962 to 1979, Myers worked for the United States military teaching classes about various materials and their qualities. From 1979 to the present, Myers has worked as a professional consultant conducting failure analyses on items and advising his clients as to the types of materials that should be used in various projects in order best to avoid a materials failure. He has conducted over two thousand material-failure analyses and works with many kinds of materials including plastics, ceramics, metals and woods. Myers has studied fracture propagation extensively and claims that, in this field, the same rules and principles are applied to all materials, including wood. Although most of Myers\u2019s work seems to focus on the properties of metals, Myers has conducted at least ten analyses on wood. In these analyses, he was required to establish the reasons for wood failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">While Myers does not specialize in the causes of wood failure <em>per se, </em>he is an expert in material-failure analysis as evidenced by his formal education and years of experience in this field. Based on this information, we hold that the trial court abused it discretion in ruling that Myers was not properly qualified to testify as to the cause of the rung failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The Reliability of Myers\u2019s Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The role of the trial court in determining the reliability of expert testimony is more problematical than its determination of the expert\u2019s qualifications. Under Ohio law, the reliability of an expert\u2019s opinion has generally been considered a matter of weight, rather than admissibility. See, <em>e.g., State v. Pierce </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 490, 597 N.E.2d 107 (questions regarding the reliability of DNA evidence in a given case go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility); <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444 (rejecting the <em>\u201cFrye </em>test\u201d of general acceptance in the scientific community as a condition of admissibility and adopting a standard of relevance and assistance to the trier of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The amendment of Evid.R. 702 in 1994 infused confusion into the role of the trial court in regard to the significance of the reliability of scientific evidence and tests. Though persuasive authority only, the Staff Note to the rule insists that no substantive change from prior law is intended. However, it appears from the text of the rule, particularly Evid.R. 702(C), that the reliability of expert testimony has become a precondition to admissibility, that the rule sets the standard for reliability, and that, when the rule is combined with Evid.R. 104(B), the trial court plays a gatekeeper function to evaluate reliability. The 1994 Staff Note adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201c[T]he amended rule does not attempt to define the standard of reliability but leaves that to further development through case-law. The amendment also leaves unchanged Ohio\u2019s rejection of <em>Frye </em>as the exclusive standard of reliability. * * * [T]he United States Supreme Court\u2019s discussion [in <em>Daubert </em>] of the considerations that may be relevant to a reliability determination may also be helpful in construing the Ohio rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Given what appear to be inconsistencies among the text of the rule, the prior case law and the Staff Note, we leave it for another day to determine whether Evid.R. 702(C) now requires an evaluation by the trial court of the reliability of the scientific theory being espoused by an expert as a precondition of its admissibility and, if so, precisely how the trial court is to perform this evaluation. We need not decide this now because, in the case at hand, the trial judge went beyond an examination of reliability and ruled Myers\u2019s testimony inadmissible because the court found his opinions not to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Myers\u2019s Testimony and the Lower Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Myers offered testimony based on a visual examination of the rung in question. After viewing the rung, Myers applied allegedly well-established principles of engineering, materials analysis, and fracture propagation in order to draw a conclusion as to the cause of the fracture of the rung. Particularly relevant portions of Myers\u2019s testimony are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cStaples were used by the manufacturer of the ladder I examined to secure the rungs from movement within the rails of said ladder. By inserting staples into the tenons, the narrow end parts of the rung that fit into the rail, cracks or hairline cracks were caused in the tenons. Based upon a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, I opine that these hairline cracks or fractures most probably occurred when the ladder was constructed and continued to propagate during use until it reached the critical crack length where catastrophic fracture occurred, which fracture directly caused Frank McCubbin to fall. I examined the rung that failed and I found the macroscopic cracks are the ones that you can see with your eye run [sic] parallel to the grain of the rung. This is significant because the fracture occurred in a mode that is consistent with existing knowledge of crack propagation and fracture mechanics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\"><em>(\u00cd </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">\u201c[T]his product defect was the direct and proximate cause of the rung failure on the ladder that I examined, which failure directly caused the McCubbin fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\"><em>U </em># * ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">\u201cIn my professional opinion, and based upon reasonable engineering certainty, the design and use of metallic staples instead of nails to prevent movement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ladder in question is a defective design and use, whereby an inevitable process of immediate fracture and propagation of fracture and catastrophic failure is set into motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Citing <em>Pierce </em>and <em>Daubert, supra, </em>the Staff Note to Evid.R. 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201cUnder Ohio law it is also clear that reliability is properly determined only by reference to the principles and methods employed by the expert witness, without regard to whether the court regards the witness\u2019s conclusions themselves as persuasive or correct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court held, in part, that Myers\u2019s testimony should be excluded because it was \u201cbased solely upon [Myers\u2019s] perceptions.\u201d The court also referred to Myers\u2019s theory as \u201cjunk science.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Given the nature of Myers\u2019s testimony, we believe that a visual examination of the rung in question was a legitimate method of determining a possible cause of its failure. It is clear from the trial court\u2019s decision that the court simply did not believe Myers\u2019s conclusions. This was not the trial court\u2019s role, and it constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">In sum, we hold that the lower court abused its discretion in ruling that Myers was not qualified to testify as to the cause of the rung failure. We also hold that the trial court abused its discretion in not considering Myers\u2019s testimony on the ground that it was not credible. Consequently, we hold that the lower court erred in excluding Myers\u2019s testimony from its consideration before ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and we sustain the McCubbins\u2019 first and fourth assignments of error to the extent that they raise this issue. In so holding, we express no opinion as to the merits of appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment or the McCubbins\u2019 response to it. This case is remanded with instructions to the lower court to consider Myers\u2019s opinions in ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">The issues raised in the second and third assignments of error were never ruled on by the trial court and, therefore, are not properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-13\">Gorman, P.J., and Painter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\">.
