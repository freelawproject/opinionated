App.R. 26(B). On appellant\u2019s separate motion, the matter has been placed on the accelerated calendar pursuant to Loc.R. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Appellant claims he was denied the effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal when appellate counsel failed to raise as error the indefinite sentence appellant received on a fourth degree felony charge of domestic violence in case No. 930013 CR.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Since the state dismissed the specification accompanying the domestic violence charge, appellant was clearly entitled to a definite sentence. See <em>State v. Witwer </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 421, 596 N.E.2d 451; <em>State v. Meadows </em>(June 13, 1994), Fayette App. No. CA93-10-023, unreported, 1994 WL 250106. Thus, the imposition of an indefinite sentence constituted plain error. See <em>State v. Key </em>(Feb. 2, 1994), Hamilton App. Nos. C-930205 and C-930206, unreported, 1994 WL 25313.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We accordingly conclude that the failure to raise the indefinite sentence as error denied appellant the effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. Appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and appellant was clearly prejudiced by that deficiency. App.R. 26(B)(9). Consequently, the assignment of error presented in the reopened appeal is hereby sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">This court\u2019s October 23, 1995 entry and opinion are modified to reflect that the indefinite sentence imposed in case No. 930013 CR is reversed and the matter is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b640-9\">Walsh, P.J., Koehler and Powell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
