The plaintiff-appellant, Margaret Theresa Myers, asserts three assignments of error: (1) that the trial court erred by not ordering child support from the birth of each child; (2) that the trial court erred by refusing to order the children\u2019s father, Stephen Moschella, the defendant-appellee, to contribute to past medical expenses of the children; and (3) that the trial court erred by failing to order the defendant-appellee to pay medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff-appellant subsequent to the court\u2019s March 29, 1993 order regarding insurance coverage. For the reasons that follow, we find none of the assignments of error to be well taken and thus affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Under her first assignment of error, Myers argues that the trial court erred by not ordering support from the date of birth for both children. Both parties agree that the governing authority is this court\u2019s decision in <em>Baugh v. Carver </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 139, 3 OBR 157, 444 N.E.2d 58. In <em>Baugh, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cWhile the awarding of a monetary amount for child support is a matter generally within the discretion of the trial court, this does not permit it to ignore the fact that, under R.C. 3111.17, the child is entitled to, and the father is obligated to provide, support from the date of birth. Where damages for support payments for the period from the date of the child\u2019s birth to the date of adjudication are prayed for and proved, as here, it is an abuse of discretion for the court to make no award of child support for that period <em>in the absence of an affirmative demonstration of some circumstance which ought reasonably to relieve the father of this obligation and the child of this entitlement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 140-141, 3 OBR at 158-159, 444 N.E.2d at 61.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The question we must answer here is whether the qualifying language in <em>Baugh </em>is satisfied by the singular facts of this case. Both the plaintiff-appellant and the defendant-appellee are homosexuals. The appellant is a tenured university professor with an income substantially greater than that of the appellee, who is a credit analyst. In 1985, the appellant was in a long-term relationship with another lesbian, with whom she wanted to raise children. By agreement with her partner, the appellant asked the appellee if he would father the child. According to the appellant, the agreement was that she and her partner \u201cwould have full responsibility for the child\u201d while allowing the child to develop \u201ca social relationship with the biological father, if that was possible.\u201d In her testimony, the appellant made clear that by \u201cfull responsibility\u201d she meant that she and her partner would have \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d for the child, including medical and child-care expenses. At one point, she described as a <em>\u201cquid pro quo </em>\u201d the fact that the child was to live with her and her partner, and that the appellee was not to pay child support. She stated that the child \u201cwould have every opportunity to develop a relationship with the biological father,\u201d but that she and her partner would control that relationship. Elsewhere she described the agreement as \u201cunequivocal, absolutely unequivocal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Following the birth of the child, the appellant controlled visitation and took full financial responsibility for the child. In 1988, the parties agreed to conceive another child under \u201cthe arrangements as they then existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In October 1992, following a disagreement between the parties regarding visitation, the appellee filed an action in juvenile court for a determination that he was the father of the two children. At that point, according to the appellant, she \u201cabrogated\u201d the agreement between them. After March 1993, visitation was established by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Asked specifically if it were not true that, but for the fact that the appellee sought court-ordered visitation, she would not have sought child support, the appellant answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cIf [the defendant-appellee] had not come to court and sought from the Court a definition of his rights, I would not be in court seeking its definition of his responsibilities. You are absolutely correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The trial court found the \u201cmost compelling factor\u201d in determining the commencement date for child support to be \u201cthe point of breakdown in the amicable and cooperative parenting arrangement between the parties,\u201d and awarded support only from that date forward. Both below and on appeal, the appellant argues that, notwithstanding the terms with which she induced the appellee to father her children \u2014 what she herself described as a <em>quid pro quo </em>absolute and unequivocal in its terms \u2014 she and the appellee could not <em>inter se </em>contract away her children\u2019s right to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">As noted, this court recognized in <em>Baugh </em>that, although the general rule under R.C. 3111.17 is that the support obligation commences at birth, there may be circumstances \u201cwhich ought reasonably to relieve the father of this obligation.\u201d Provided that such circumstances are affirmatively demonstrated in the record, the trial court\u2019s decision not to order child support to commence at birth is a matter renewable under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Judicial discretion is \u201cfounded upon the reason and conscience of the judge\u201d directed toward \u201ca just result in the light of the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Krupp v. Poor </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 123, 53 O.O.2d 320, 265 N.E.2d 268, paragraph two of the syllabus. An abuse of discretion \u201cis readily defined as more than error of law or judgment, but implies an attitude on the part of the trial court that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Ruwe v. Bd. of Twp. Trustees </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 59, 61, 29 OBR 441, 443, 505 N.E.2d 957, 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Given the particular circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the support order to commence as it did. The appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">In her second assignment of error, the appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to order the appellee to contribute to past medical expenses of the children, including both the cost of medical insurance and medical expenses not covered by insurance. We find the merits of this assignment of error subsumed by our resolution of the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">In her third assignment of error, the appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to order the appellee to reimburse her for one-half of certain uninsured medical expenses for the children\u2019s psychological care. According to the appellant, reimbursement is required by the trial court\u2019s March 29, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201corder regarding health insurance coverage.\u201d This order, however, only expressly provides for \u201cmedical, optical, hospital, dental, or prescription services\u201d and is limited by its terms to deductible costs or copayments for insured expenses. There is no separate order of record for extraordinary medical expenses, including psychological expenses, as is required by R.C. 3113.215(B)(5). We find, therefore, no basis to validate the error which the appellant alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-7\">Hildebrandt, P.J., Gorman and Painter, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
