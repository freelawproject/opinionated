All three are natives and citizens of Indonesia. In 2002 Harahap applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An Immigration Judge found him eligible for removal, denied his application, and granted voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Harahap petitions our Court for review. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">Harahap does not argue that the BIA erred with respect to his asylum and CAT-protection claims. We deem issues not raised on appeal to be waived. <em>See, e.g., Emerson v. Thiel, </em>296 F.3d 184, 190 n. 5 (3d Cir.2002). This appeal, therefore, deals solely with the withholding-of-removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-19\">I. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b122-20\">We have jurisdiction to review final orders of the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). But we lack jurisdiction over claims not raised before the BIA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(l)(requiring aliens to exhaust administrative remedies before petitioning a court for review); <em>Ab-dulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]n alien is required to raise and exhaust his or her remedies as to each claim or ground for relief if he or she is to preserve the right of judicial review of that claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Because the BIA relied on some of the IJ\u2019s findings without comment but discussed others in its opinion, the scope of our review includes both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004). We review factual determinations, including evaluations of Harahap\u2019s allegations of past and future persecution, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo. Toussaint v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 409, 413 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">To obtain withholding of removal, Hara-hap must \u201cestablish that his ... life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). He must show either a \u201c[p]ast threat to life or freedom,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(b)(1), or a \u201c[fjuture threat to life or freedom,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(b)(2). He claims that he experienced (and, if removed to Indonesia, would again experience) persecution as a result of his membership in the Seventh Day Adventist Church.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">1. Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Because Harahap did not provide evidence other than his own testimony to establish that he experienced past persecution in Indonesia, he needed to convince the IJ that his testimony was credible. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(b) (\u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d). But the IJ found Harahap\u2019s testimony to be not credible. Harahap did not challenge this finding before the BIA with any specificity, making only the eon-clusory claim that he \u201cprovided coherent and consistent testimony\u201d in his notice of appeal and declining to address the issue in his brief to the BIA. Stating that Hara-hap \u201cdoes not contest the adverse credibility finding,\u201d the BIA affirmed that finding. Thus, we have no jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Lacking credible testimony and corroborating evidence, Harahap\u2019s claim of past persecution must fail. <em>Id.; see Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 241-42 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">2. Future Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Harahap also argues that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d he would be persecuted in the future if he returned to Indonesia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For this claim, he relies on evidence of the conditions and human rights practices in Indonesia. The BIA rejected this claim even though it took administrative notice of State Department country reports from 2005. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the country reports \u201cdo not directly relate to respondent\u201d and do not establish his eligibility for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ijs \u00ed\u00a1? \u00bb}'</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>For these reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\">. Harahap and Laoh also have a younger daughter who is a United States citizen by birth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-14\">. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.3(a), the information in Harahap's application also applies to the requests for relief by Laoh (as his wife) and Sabathino (as his minor child). In this opinion, we will refer solely to Harahap as the lead petitioner and treat Laoh's and Sabathi-no's claims as dependent on his.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">. One of Laoh\u2019s grandfathers was Chinese, which could give rise to a claim of persecution based on race. Perhaps because of the perceived weakness of the issue, she did not raise this claim before the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A4u\">. Harahap also states that the IJ erred by applying a \"clear and convincing\u201d standard to his claims of persecution, rather than the proper \"more likely than not\u201d standard. This argument is mistaken. The IJ used the words \"clear and convincing\u201d only in reference to the issue of Harahap\u2019s removability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b123-16\">. Harahap argues that his daughter\u2019s status as a U.S. citizen will lead to future persecution of his family. We have no jurisdiction over this claim because Harahap did not raise it before the BIA and thus failed to exhaust it administratively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
