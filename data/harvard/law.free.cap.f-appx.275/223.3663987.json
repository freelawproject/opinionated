We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Diallo\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (West 2005 &amp; Supp. 2007); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Diallo, </em>No. A97-622-486 (B.I.A. Mar. 22, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
