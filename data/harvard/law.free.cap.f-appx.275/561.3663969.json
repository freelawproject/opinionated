United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). After reconsidering Keith A. Jones\u2019s sentence as directed by the Supreme Court, we find that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not commit the procedural error identified in <em>Kimbrough </em>when it sentenced Jones. We again affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the position that the crack/powder disparity in the sentencing guidelines was mandatory and held that \u201cunder <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ], the cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. After holding that a district court \u201cmay consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses,\u201d <em>id., </em>it further elaborated that \u201c[i]t would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-19\">In our previous <em>Jones </em>opinion, we first expressed doubt that the crack/powder disparity was a relevant sentencing factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Jones, </em>493 F.3d at 941. <em>Kimbrough </em>held to the contrary. <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 564. However, in our initial <em>Jones </em>opinion, we then presumed that the crack/powder disparity was a relevant factor and determined that the district court considered and rejected Jones\u2019s argument for a variance on that basis because it was not warranted in this case. This alternative holding adheres to Kimbrough\u2019s holding that a district court may consider the crack/powder disparity when sentencing a defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-20\">As in our recent <em>United States v. Moore </em>decision, the district court \u201cdid not state it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>had no discretion under <em>Booker </em>to take the crack/powder guidelines disparity into account in deciding whether a variance was warranted by the discretionary \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d 518 F.3d 577, 580 (8th Cir.2008). Instead, the district court considered both parties\u2019 arguments regarding various \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Jones\u2019s argument about the crack/powder disparity, and concluded that a sentence of 140 months\u2019 imprisonment, ten months above the low end of the advisory guidelines range, was appropriate. Because the district court did not indicate that it lacked authority to consider the crack/powder disparity when imposing Jones\u2019s sentence, \u201cwe presume the district court was aware that <em>Booker </em>granted it discretion to vary downward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine guidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise that discretion.\u201d <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Finding no procedural error and no abuse of substantial discretion, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), for the reasons stated in this opinion and our prior opinion, we affirm Jones\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-14\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-15\">. We reinstate the vacated opinion of <em>United States v. Jones, </em>493 F.3d 938, 941 (8th Cir. 2007), <em>vacated, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 928, 169 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008), with the exception of the paragraph discussing the propriety of a variance based on the disparity created by the United States Sentencing Guidelines' use of a 100:1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">. As in <em>Moore, </em>we note that Jones's sentencing hearing occurred before this circuit issued an en banc decision rejecting a downward variance based solely on a district court\u2019s categorical rejection of the 100:1 ratio, <em>see United States v. Spears, </em>469 F.3d 1166 (8th Cir.2006) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 858, 169 L.Ed.2d 709 (2008), at a time when there was no circuit precedent that prevented a district court from considering the crack/powder disparity when determining whether a variance under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was appropriate. <em>Moore, </em>518 F.3d at 580.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
