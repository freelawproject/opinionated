Phifer\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating his conclusion that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Phifer was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government declined to file a responsive brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, a district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007); (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. Circuit, \u201c[a] sentence range is presumptively <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. In the Fourth within the proper Sentencing Guidelines reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive error with respect to Phifer\u2019s sentence. Phifer\u2019s 120-month sentence was below the applicable guidelines range and is the statutory minimum sentence applicable to his offense. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Phifer requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Phifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
