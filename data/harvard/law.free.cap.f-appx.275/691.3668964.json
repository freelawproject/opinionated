We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006), and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because, as the government concedes, it was based upon minor inconsistencies incidental to Zheng\u2019s claim that she was persecuted on account of her religion. <em>See id </em>at 1108. Because there has been no ruling on the facts with Zheng\u2019s testimony accepted as credible, we remand for the agency to redetermine her eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">We also remand for the agency to redetermine Jie Teng\u2019s eligibility for asylum as a derivative beneficiary of his wife\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
