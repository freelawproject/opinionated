He was convicted of the charge by a jury. In the federal suit, he alleged a number of violations of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as state law defamation claims. Through a series of opinions, the district court dismissed Defendants for a number of different reasons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After dismissing all of his federal claims and some state claims, the district court declined jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. During the course of the district court proceedings, an intermediate state appellate court reversed Winegarner\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial based on an erroneous eviden-tiary ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the completion of the district court proceedings, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the intermediate appellate court and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Winegar-ner now appeals the dismissal of his federal suit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">Defendants make a substantial argument that Winegarner has abandoned his appeal by failing to brief meaningfully any issues. His briefs recite for the most part only the broad strokes of his complaints regarding Defendants. He mentions in passing some of the reasons why the district court dismissed his claims, and raises little in the way of an argument as to how the court\u2019s analysis erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A) requires an appellant\u2019s brief to contain the \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d It is our practice to construe liberally <em>pro se </em>litigants\u2019 briefs and \u201capply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we still require <em>-pro se </em>litigants to \u201cbrief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is a close question, but we cannot say that Winegarner has abandoned his appeal in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">In any event, Winegarner briefs make clear that the claims he is pursuing on appeal turn on the State\u2019s prosecution of him, which implicates the rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>It is well settled that, under <em>Heclc v. Humphrey, </em>a plaintiff who has been convicted of a crime cannot recover damages for an alleged violation of his constitutional rights if the alleged violation arose from the same facts attendant to the charge for which he was convicted, unless he proves \u201cthat his conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>\u201cHeck </em>requires the district court to consider \u2018whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuQ\">The district court declined to apply <em>Heck </em>because the intermediate state appellate court had reversed Winegarner\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has now affirmed his conviction, and Winegarner does not contend that his conviction has since been reversed, expunged, or called into question on collateral review. Judgment in Winegarner\u2019s favor on his federal claims would imply the invalidity of his conviction. He alleges, <em>inter alia, </em>the State prosecuted him despite his innocence; maliciously prosecuted trial; his conviction was obtained by perjured testimony; prosecutorial misconduct, including lying, in obtaining the conviction; he was prosecuted after the statute of limitations expired; and improper exclusion of critical impeachment evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">In addition to concluding that a \u201c \u2018malicious prosecution\u2019 standing alone is no violation of the United States Constitution,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> our en banc court has explained, as pertinent here, that <em>\u201c[Heck </em>] concludes that no such claim accrues until the conviction has been set aside where, as here, the suit calls the validity of the conviction into play.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Heck </em>bars Winegarner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Winegarner has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing the state-law claims against some Defendants and declining jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
