(\u201cUPS\u201d). Krahn alleges that UPS fired him in violation of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (\u201cSTAA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105, for refusing to violate the speed limit and drive in an unsafe truck. The ARB concluded that Krahn did not engage in an activity protected under the STAA because UPS did not require him to drive at illegal speeds and there was no evidence Krahn\u2019s truck was unsafe. We have jurisdiction to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>view the decision pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Substantial evidence supported the ARB\u2019s finding that UPS did not require Krahn to violate speeding laws. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(i) (providing that an employer may not terminate an employee for refusing to violate traffic laws); <em>Calmat Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>364 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir.2004) (ruling that the court must uphold the ARB\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence). The evidence showed that UPS did not require Krahn to drive above the posted speed limit; rather, Krahn\u2019s manager identified specific stretches of the route between Phoenix and Winslow on which Krahn was driving well below the posted speed limit, and UPS\u2019s expert was able to safely complete the route within UPS\u2019s target time without driving above the posted speed limit. The expert and Krahn\u2019s supervisors all testified that the route could be driven safely at the speeds recommended by UPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Substantial evidence also supported the ARB\u2019s finding that UPS did not require Krahn to drive an unsafe truck. See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(ii) (providing that an employer may not terminate an employee who refuses to drive his truck because he has \u201ca reasonable apprehension\u201d that driving the truck is unsafe). Athough Krahn claimed that he was prevented from checking his brakes as often as he preferred, he presented no evidence that the brakes required more frequent maintenance or monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b709-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
