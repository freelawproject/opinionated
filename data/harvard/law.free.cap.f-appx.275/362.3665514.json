Hale, who is currently proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, argues that the legal issues involved in his case are complex, the defendants are preventing him from investigating his claims, his psychotic disorders prevent him from being able to present his case, and he has been unable to retain counsel to represent him on a pro bono basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">An interlocutory order denying the appointment of counsel in a \u00a7 1983 case is immediately appealable. <em>Robbins v. Mag-gio, </em>750 F.2d 405, 409-13 (5th Cir.1985). However, this court will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision regarding appointment of counsel unless the appellant shows a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Cupit v. Jones, </em>835 F.2d 82, 86 (5th Cir.1987). A district court is not required to appoint counsel for an indigent plaintiff in a civil rights action unless there are exceptional circumstances. <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">Hale has not shown that the issues in his case are complex, that he is incapable of adequately presenting his case, or that exceptional circumstances require the appointment of counsel in his case. He thus has not shown that the district court\u2019s order denying appointment of counsel was a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See Cupit, </em>835 F.2d at 86. The district court\u2019s denial of Hale\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
