Malcolm LeBlanc\u2019s complaint al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>leged that after working as a tanker truck driver for over 30 years transporting Ap-pellees\u2019 products containing high concentrations of benzene, he was diagnosed with myelofibrosis (more specifically, myelofi-brosis with myeloid metaplasia \u2014 MMM), a rare disease of the bone marrow and/or blood. He alleged that his exposure to Appellees\u2019 products caused him to develop MMM.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Appellants tendered an expert, Dr. Frank Gardner, who supported their claim that the exposure to benzene caused plaintiffs disease. Appellees challenged Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony as unreliable under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">After extensive briefing, but without a hearing, the district court concluded that Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently reliable to pass muster under <em>Daubert </em>and its progeny. Because Appellant had no other evidence on the critical causation issue, the district court dismissed the suit and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The district court filed a thorough, written opinion supporting its order granting Appellee\u2019s motion in limine and finding Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony unreliable. The district court considered most of the studies Dr. Gardner relied upon and gave its reasons for finding each study unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-1\">At the time the district court issued its order, the Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), had issued a draft report on benzene. The draft describes the toxicological properties of benzene and some of the harm to animals and humans the authors conclude is caused by exposure to benzene. Because the report was still in draft form and the time for notice and comment had not expired when the district court issued its ruling, the court declined to consider it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the pendency of this appeal, all counsel agreed that the draft has received final approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">We leave to the district court, after receiving input from the parties in a hearing, if necessary, to determine the significance of this report on the court\u2019s final decision regarding the admissibility of Dr. Gardner\u2019s opinion. We explain below, however, why we believe the report deserves careful consideration in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The ATSDR report on benzene<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was prepared in accordance with federal laws that require the ATSDR to prepare toxicological profiles for hazardous substances that pose significant potential threat to human health, as determined by the ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This report, in its final form, recites that it was authored by a number of experts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was reviewed internally by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ATSDR,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and peer reviewed by additional experts who \u201ccollectively have knowledge of benzene\u2019s physical and chemical properties, toxicokinetics, key health end points, mechanisms of action, human and animal exposure, and quantification of risk to humans.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The report was put into final form at the end of the prescribed time period during which comments were allowed to be submitted to the draft version and this final form supersedes previous versions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In addition to disregarding the report on the basis that it was a draft, the district court also noted in a footnote that the draft report\u2019s conclusion that benzene causes acute myelogenous leukemia was irrelevant. Howevei*, in the report, the ATSDR concluded that \u201c[b]enzene also causes a life-threatening disorder called aplastic anemia in humans and animals.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The report also states that myelofibrosis (the disease with which Appellant has been diagnosed) is a form of aplastic anemia.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants point out that the relevant portions of both the draft and final reports are substantively the same, and Appellees do not dispute this. Indeed, both the final and draft versions of the report include the aplastic anemia and myelofibrosis statements discussed above. In light of the apparent link the report makes between Appellant\u2019s disease and aplastic anemia, which the report states is caused by benzene exposure, as well as the number and quality of the experts who participated in the production of the final version of the ATSDR report, we conclude that this report deserves the careful consideration of the district court before reaching a final conclusion on the reliability of Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">Accordingly, it is ordered that the judgment appealed from is vacated, and this case is remanded to the district court to reconsider its ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Gardner\u2019s testimony in light of the ATSDR Benzene Toxicology Report discussed above, including its references to aplastic anemia and benzene. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>court is free to hold a <em>Daubert </em>hearing if, in its discretion, it concludes that one is necessary. It is also free to reconsider and reevaluate studies it initially found unpersuasive, in light of the above report.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b345-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
