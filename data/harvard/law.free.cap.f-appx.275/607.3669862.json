R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b633-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-22\">Jacqueline Estrada petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision denying her application for cancellation of removal and finding her ineligible for a waiver to the charge of inadmissibility for alien smuggling in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-23\">The BIA properly found petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal because she admittedly was not \u201can alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than 5 years\u201d at the time she was served with a notice to appear. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-24\">We also agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner is not eligible for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) because one of the two individuals involved in the smuggling attempt, petitioner\u2019s brother-in-law, is not a recognized family member under the waiver. <em>See Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1094 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that the waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll) applies to an alien who \u201chas encouraged induced, assisted, abetted, or aided only an individual who at the time of such action was the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, son or daughter (and no other individual) to enter the United States in violation of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-25\">Because petitioner has failed to raise a challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-26\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
