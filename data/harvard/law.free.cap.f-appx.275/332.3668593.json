Crosby appeals her jury convictions for filing fraudulent claims against the United States, making false statements to the United States, theft of public money, and mail fraud. She argues that the district court erred in denying her proposed jury instruction regarding good faith. The district court\u2019s instructions on the meaning of the terms \u201cwillfully\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d were sufficient to substantially cover the defense of good faith as to every count of Crosby\u2019s indictment. <em>See United States v. Giraldi, </em>86 F.3d 1368, 1376 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Dillman, </em>15 F.3d 384, 393 (5th Cir.1994). The jury charge as a whole properly stated the applicable law, and Crosby was able to argue her defense of good faith to the jury. <em>See Giraldi, </em>86 F.3d at 1376; <em>Dillman, </em>15 F.3d at 393. The district court\u2019s denial of Crosby\u2019s proposed instruction on good faith was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Giraldi, </em>86 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
