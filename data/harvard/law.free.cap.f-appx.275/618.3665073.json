We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184 (9th Cir.2006). We review the adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, requiring that the IJ provide specific and cogent reasons that go to the heart of Tran\u2019s claim. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">The IJ identified a number of implausibilities and inconsistencies in Tran\u2019s testimony which, \u201cparticularly when viewed cumulatively, deprive [Tran\u2019s] claim of the requisite ring of truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275 (internal quotations omitted). The IJ also noted that forensic examination showed that one of Tran\u2019s documents, his release papers, had later been doctored to add his birth date. Details that are \u201cunusual or indicative of forgery,\u201d combined with an IJ\u2019s experience, are substantial evidence of the lack of credibility of an official document. <em>See Lin v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 1158, 1164 (9th Cir.2006). We conclude that the adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Tran does not challenge the denial of his request for withholding of removal. He does, however, argue that given that he faces criminal charges of embezzlement in Vietnam, he should be granted CAT relief because he would be subject to the death penalty. We need not address that issue because the evidence before the BIA indicated that the maximum penalty for embezzlement of the amount in issue in this case is fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. We deny Tran\u2019s petition for review as to his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
