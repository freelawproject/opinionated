We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Li has shown changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a); see <em>also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Li testified that he was detained and that both he and his wife were terminated from their jobs as a consequence of his labor activities, but he did not explain adequately why he omitted this information from his asylum application. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 963 (stating that the IJ can reasonably consider the alien\u2019s failure to include a significant allegation of mistreatment in his asylum application). Accordingly, Li\u2019s withholding claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The BIA properly denied CAT relief because Li did not establish that it was more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
