We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">Rossmiller contends that the district court erred in applying United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3(a), where it should have applied \u00a7 5G1.3(c), and that the district court therefore did not recognize its discretion to impose his federal sentence to run concurrently to his state sentences. Though the district court improperly cited to \u00a7 5G1.3(a), <em>see United States v. Fifield, </em>432 F.3d 1056, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2005), remand is unnecessary because the record indicates that the district court understood its discretion, <em>see United States v. Arellano-Torres, </em>303 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2002). Additionally, the record suggests that the district court would not have sentenced Rossmiller differently under \u00a7 5G1.3(e). <em>See United States v. Dowd, </em>417 F.3d 1080, 1090 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-22\">Rossmiller also contends that the district court failed to adequately articulate its reasons for his sentence, and that his sentence is unreasonably long. The district court adequately justified Rossmiller\u2019s sentence as a whole with reference to the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see Fifield, </em>432 F.3d at 1066, and imposed a reasonable sentence, <em>see United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-92 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b727-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
