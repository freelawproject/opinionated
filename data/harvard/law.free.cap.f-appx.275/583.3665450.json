R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b609-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing petitioner Maria Estela Lule-Mo-lina and petitioner Jose Manuel Moncada-Hernandez\u2019s appeal of an Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying their applications for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">We have reviewed the response to the court\u2019s January 11, 2008 order to show cause, and we conclude that petitioner Maria Estela Lule-Molina has failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction as to petitioner Maria Estela Lule-Molina is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-25\">A review of the administrative record and petitioner\u2019s response to the court\u2019s order to show cause demonstrates that petitioner Jose Manuel Moncada-Hernan-dez has presented no evidence that he has a qualifying relative for purposes of cancellation of removal as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093-94 (9th Cir. 2002). The BIA therefore correctly concluded that, as a matter of law, petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the petition for review as to petitioner Jose Manuel Moncada-Hernan-dez is summarily denied. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
