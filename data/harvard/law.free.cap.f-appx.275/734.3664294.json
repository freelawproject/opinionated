Gibson appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing as untimely his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">As an initial matter, we construe Gibson\u2019s \u201cMotion the Court to Consider Case no. CV-F03-6639-AWI-DLB-HC on the One Year Limitation It Was Filed First on the Parole Board. Jan. 3, 2002 Decision\u201d as a motion to take judicial notice of a minute order from the Los Angeles County Superior Court, and we grant the motion. <em>See Smith v. Duncan, </em>297 F.3d 809, 815 (9th Cir.2002) (taking judicial notice of state court documents relevant to the issue of statutory tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-20\">The district court dismissed Gibson\u2019s federal habeas petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) and concluded that he was not entitled to statutory tolling because he did not file any applications for state collateral relief until well over a year after expiration of the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). However, the district court did not consider whether Gibson was entitled to statutory tolling as a result of the habeas petition filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court and denied within the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>see also Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-21\">We therefore vacate and remand for the district court to consider whether Gibson is entitled to statutory tolling, and if so, whether his federal petition is timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b760-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-24\">. On January 18, 2007, Gibson filed a motion or request to include supplemental supportive case law on appeal. No leave of court is required to advise the court of such authorities. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(j). Accordingly, the motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
