He contends that the defendants have in the past and may in the future impede his access to the courts by threatening to confiscate his law books and legal materials that exceed the storage space he has available. He has not established a denial of access to the courts because he has not shown that his position as a litigant was or will be prejudiced. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">Guajardo asserts that he is entitled to due process protection before his property is confiscated. It is \u201chighly dubious that a facially neutral prison storage space limitation ... might in any way restrict a prisoner\u2019s exercise of constitutional rights,\u201d including the right of access to the courts, in light of the limited storage space in a prison setting. <em>Long v. Collins, </em>917 F.2d 3, 4 (5th Cir.1990)(addressing prior version of the prison storage regulations). Guajardo has not established that the district court abused its discretion in rejecting his procedural due process claims. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Guajardo has not challenged the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of relief on his allegations that the seizure of his books will result in a denial of substantive due process, and any such claim is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">Guajardo also contends that the fact that he must use some of his personal locker to store legal materials constitutes a denial of equal protection. He has not established that similarly situated individuals are being treated differently or even that the defendants treat all prisoners actively engaged in litigation differently from other prisoners. <em>See Mayabb v. Johnson, </em>168 F.3d 863, 870 (5th Cir.1999); <em>cf. Johnson v. Pfeiffer, </em>821 F.2d 1120, 1122-24 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">Guajardo contends that he was entitled to a restraining order or injunction to prevent possible future harm. He has not established, however, that success on the merits is likely. <em>See Women\u2019s Med. Ctr. v. Bell, </em>248 F.3d 411, 419 n. 15 (5th Cir.2001). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested relief. <em>See White v. Carlucci, </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-20\">Guajardo\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, we dismiss Guajardo\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This dismissal of his appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous constitute two strikes for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). If Guajardo obtains three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
