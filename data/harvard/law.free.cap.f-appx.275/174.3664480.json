We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-18\">In 2001, Callender applied for Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits. On July 24, 2003, an Administrative Law Judge issued a partially favorable decision finding Callender disabled, but not before July 14, 2003. Callender was advised of his right to file a request for review with the Appeals Council within 60 days of his receipt of the decision, as required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1468. On March 3, 2004, more than five months after the 60-day time period expired, Callender filed a request for review. On July 9, 2004, the Appeals Council found that Callender had not shown good cause for missing the deadline, and dismissed his request for review because it was untimely. The Appeals Council informed Callender that, under its rules, the dismissal was not subject to further review. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1472.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-20\">Two years later, on July 11, 2006, Cal-lender filed a complaint in the District Court seeking review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. The District Court granted the Social Security Administration\u2019s motion to dismiss Callender\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction because Callender had not obtained a final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">Jurisdiction over Social Security benefits cases is provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which provides, in relevant part: \u201c[a]ny individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party[,] ... may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action.... \u201d The same rule applies to SSI cases. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3). Ordinarily, judicial review is barred absent a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by the Commissioner of Social Security. <em>Fitzgerald v. Apfel, </em>148 F.3d 232, 234 (3d Cir.1998). Under the regulations, a \u201cfinal decision\u201d is one rendered after a claimant has completed a four-step administrative review process, the last step being a review by the Appeals Council. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1400(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-23\">The \u201cfinal decision\u201d requirement consists of two elements, only one of which is purely \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in the sense that it cannot be waived by the Secretary in a particular case. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>148 F.3d at 232 (quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 328, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). The waivable element is the requirement that the administrative reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>dies prescribed by the Secretary be exhausted. <em>Id. </em>The nonwaivable element is the requirement that a claim for benefits be presented to the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>If a plaintiffs claim is collateral to her claim for benefits, exhaustion may be waived under certain circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Callender\u2019s claim is not collateral to his claim for benefits. In his complaint, he sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision that he was not entitled to disability benefits until July 14, 2003. The Social Security Administration raised Callender\u2019s failure to exhaust in its motion to dismiss. Cal-lender has not shown any basis to waive the exhaustion requirement. Because he did not obtain a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d the District Court correctly held that judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In his brief, Callender challenges the Appeals Council\u2019s dismissal of his request for review. The Appeals Council\u2019s decision not to consider his untimely request for review, however, is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d subject to judicial review under \u00a7 405(g). <em>Bacon v. Sullivan, </em>969 F.2d 1517, 1519 (3d Cir.1992). Although we recognized in <em>Bacon </em>that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision not to review a claimant\u2019s late filing may constitute a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes of judicial review where a colorable constitutional claim is raised, <em>id. </em>at 1521, Callender has not raised such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
