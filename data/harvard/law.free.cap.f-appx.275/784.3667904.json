ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">Defendant and appellant, Jeremiah Vaughn Gregory, Jr., was indicted on one count of bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2113(a), for robbery of a Wells Fargo bank in Salt Lake City, Utah, on May 6, 2005. After a jury found him guilty, he was sentenced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals his conviction, arguing that the district court erred in (1) failing to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction, and (2) effectively denying him his right to present his theory of the defense at trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">As indicated, Gregory was indicted on one count of bank robbery. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Gregory filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction. He argued that he was a \u201cmember of the radical white supremacist organization called THE ORDER,\u201d an \u201cultra-fundamentalist element of the Aryan Nation\u201d; that the group had asked the government to cede five states (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah) to create a safe haven for white people; and that, upon rejection of that plan, Gregory and others had renounced their United States citizen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ship, joined The Order\u2019s militia, and commenced activities designed to destabilize the United States government. Motion To Dismiss at 2, R. Vol. I. \u201cZionist banks and financial institutions were targeted\u201d and Gregory stated he \u201cparticipated in numerous operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gregory then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqx-dedup-2\">As a combatant, the principle of military immunity shields Gregory from being held accountable to civilian authorities for their actions. Combatants are held accountable to military laws and the generally accepted rules of war. Neither the beliefs of the individual nor the reason behind the conflict have any bearing on this grant of military immunity. The test is whether the individual was a combatant and that the alleged acts were undertaken in furtherance of this conflict.... Gregory is clearly a combatant in the struggle for a racially pure white homeland. THE ORDER has from its inception, attacked banks and corporate institutions to achieve its goal of destabilizing the government of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The district court denied the motion, finding Gregory\u2019s \u201carguments entirely lack[ed] merit.\u201d Order Denying Motion to Dismiss at 1, R. Vol. I. The district court denied Gregory\u2019s motion to reconsider, calling the motion \u201cfacially meritless.\u201d Order Denying Motion to Reconsider at 1, R. Vol. I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Gregory also filed a motion to suppress evidence, including his confession, both of which were obtained in a hotel room following his arrest. Following a hearing, the district court denied the motion. There then followed a colloquy between the court and Gregory touching upon a number of matters, including Gregory\u2019s statement that he was \u201cgoing to say there was justification, moral or otherwise, for the robbery and present that issue to the jury for them to decide whether or not they should exercise their right as a community conscience to acquit in spite of the facts and instructions of the Court.\u201d Tr. of Motion to Suppress Hr\u2019g at 73-74, R. Vol. IV. Gregory argued that \u201cthe jury has a sovereign right to acquit irregardless\u201d and that his organization had been robbing banks to fund its \u201congoing fight against the government\u201d since \u201cwe not only have a duty but we have a right to throw out an oppressive government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77-79. While the district court expressed doubt about the relevance and admissibility of that evidence, it stated that a final determination would be made at the pre-trial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">At the final pre-trial conference, Gregory offered various instructions advising the jury about their \u201csovereign right to acquit even in the face of the evidence.\u201d Tr. of Final Pre-Trial Hr\u2019g at 18, R. Vol. VI. The district court rejected each proposed instruction. When Gregory asked how much \u201cleeway\u201d he would be given to argue the issue to the jury, the court stated, \u201c[Yjou\u2019re going to be questioning witnesses about facts, and then in your opening and closing statement you\u2019re not entitled to argue that they should disregard the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. Gregory then stated that he might take the stand himself to testify as to the same theory. The court expressed doubt about the relevancy of such testimony, and told Gregory the court would preclude \u201cany evidence along the lines that Mr. Gregory has just described.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">And the record should also reflect that one of the reasons I\u2019m doing this is to protect Mr. Gregory in the sense that if the jury learns that he is a member of a white supremacist organization that has been robbing banks since the 1980\u2019s, that might tend to inflame their passions and lead to an inaccurate result on this particular charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>There is not going to be any prior bad acts coming into the trial on the theories that have been outlined to me this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">I have firmly ruled that you\u2019re not entitled to nullification instructions or nullification arguments, and you\u2019re not entitled to present evidence about some white supremacist operation or war with the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 42, 43, 49. The court subsequently denied Gregory\u2019s motion to reconsider its ruling on Gregory\u2019s theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On the second day of trial, after the government rested, Gregory indicated he might want to testify. Another colloquy ensued, and the court stated it would allow Gregory to briefly explain why he robbed the bank, as long as it did not \u201cturn into a filibuster or an extensive [argument].\u201d Tr. of Trial at 170, R. Vol. IX. Gregory then stated he would not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The jury returned a guilty verdict. At sentencing, Gregory reiterated his separatist philosophy, announcing that the district court had \u201cturned this courtroom into a cesspool, a sleazy and vile place\u201d and assuring the court \u201cthat retribution will be swift, certain, and exact a very heavy toll.... [W]hile I would like to be the one to visit revenge retribution to your doorstep, I\u2019ll have to trust that to others, but believe me, when all is said and done, you will not escape the wrath which you rightfully deserve.\u201d Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g at 6-9, R. Vol. X. The district court determined that an upward departure under United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) 5K2.9, or an upward variance under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), was warranted based upon the \u201cstrong nexus ... between Mr. Gregory\u2019s purpose in robbing Wells Fargo Bank ... and his intent to commit other crimes with the proceeds from that robbery.\u201d Order Regarding Sentencing Enhancement at 15, R. Vol. I. The court accordingly sentenced Gregory to 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Gregory appeals, arguing the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction and that it erred by preventing him from presenting his theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion that it has subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal case. <em>Huerta v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 753, 755 (10th Cir. 2006). We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Barajas-Chavez, </em>358 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Gregory argues that the district court erred in failing to transfer jurisdiction over his case to a military tribunal, given that Gregory was a self-declared \u201cenemy belligerent\u201d under Article 21 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (\u201cUCMJ\u201d). As the government points out in its brief, this argument fails for multiple reasons. First, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3231, the district court had jurisdiction over this case. Second, a military tribunal would have no jurisdiction over Gregory under the UCMJ \u2014 the UCMJ lists those who are subject to its provisions and, as the government aptly puts it, \u201c[a] self-styled enemy belligerent, performing bank robberies within the United States in furtherance of a hostile cause, is simply not included.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 14. Third, neither the UCMJ nor any other provision of law establishes any military commission with authority to hear this case. Finally, Gregory cannot divest a federal district court of criminal jurisdiction simply by claiming his crime was part of a \u201cwar\u201d against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">With respect to his argument that the district court prevented him from presenting his theory of defense, we review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>485 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007). There was no such abuse of discretion here. First, the record discloses that the district court would in fact have allowed Gregory to present his justification for robbing the bank, within appropriate limits. Second, the district court properly determined the proposed testimony was more likely to confuse or mislead the jury than to establish any element of the crime charged or otherwise properly assist the jury in its deliberations. \u201cOur deference to the trial court is based upon its firsthand ability to view the witnesses and evidence and assess credibility and probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gregory\u2019s proffered testimony was of little relevance or probative value, and had the potential to mislead or confuse. The district court did not err in its handling of Gregory\u2019s proffered testimony about his theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Gregory\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
