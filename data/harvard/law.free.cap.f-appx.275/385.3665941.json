One of the principal issues is whether the dismissal was pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim) or Rule 56 (summary judgment). It appears the dismissal was through summary judgment, with a resulting issue being whether a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether Plaintiffs reported the incident pursuant to their official job duties, resulting in their speech not being protected by the First Amendment. Also at issue are whether: the district court abused its discretion by denying Plaintiffs leave to amend them complaint to clarify their job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>duties; and Plaintiffs stated an equal-protection claim. AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Plaintiffs worked as jailers at the DeSo-to County Jail. In December 2004, while on duty, Plaintiffs-Jailers Williams and Ham-brick witnessed an inmate being beaten by a Sergeant. Jailer Williams stepped in to stop the Sergeant; Jailers Williams and Hambrick reported the incident to their supervisor, Plaintiff-Deputy Sheriff Russell, who was also a jailer. Deputy Sheriff Russell told them to report the incident to another supervisor, Defendant-Deputy Sheriff Gatlin. Unable to reach Deputy Sheriff Gatlin, Jailers Williams and Russell contacted Captain Stewart, who was off-duty. Captain Stewart: came to the jail; informed Jailers Williams and Hambrick she had contacted Defendant-Deputy Sheriff Atkinson, the Chief Jailer; and instructed them to write a report and place it under Deputy Sheriff Atkinson\u2019s door. Jailer Hambrick did so. The next day, Plaintiffs were informed of unrelated charges of misconduct against them, given a hearing, and terminated from their employment. Defendanh-Sheriff Riley was the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Proceeding under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, Plaintiffs filed this action in April 2005, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>retaliation in violation of them First Amendment right to free speech and denial of equal protection. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of the United States decided <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), holding speech pursuant to a public employee\u2019s official duties is <em>not </em>entitled to First Amendment protection. In July 2006, in the light of <em>Garcetti, </em>Defendants moved to supplement their pending Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal motion. The district court, without ruling on the motion to supplement, denied the dismissal motion and granted Plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Defendants moved for reconsideration of them dismissal motion; Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint. In replying to Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motion for reconsideration, Defendants attached, <em>inter alia, </em>a copy of a page from the DeSoto County Sheriffs Department Operations Policy and Procedures (Policy), which purported to impose an official duty on Plaintiffs to report the witnessed incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In September 2006, following a case-management conference, Defendants filed another Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. In responding, Plaintiffs attached, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration by each Plaintiff, contesting Defendants\u2019 assertion that Plaintiffs had an official duty to report the incident. Defendants replied, again attaching the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint, and Defendants responded, attaching the Policy yet again. Ruling on the above-pending motions, the district court granted the motion to dismiss, stating it did so under Rule 12(b)(6), and denied, as futile, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend. It also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">It goes without saying that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not interchangeable with a Rule 56 summary-judgment motion. <em>E.g., Jackson v. Procunier, </em>789 F.2d 307, 309-10 (5th Cir.1986). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be evaluated only on the complaint, and amendments to the complaint are generally allowed to cure deficiencies. <em>Jackson, </em>789 F.2d at 309-10. In that regard, pursuant to Rule 12(d), \u201c[i]f the district court considers information outside of the pleadings, the court must treat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>[Rule 12(b)(6)] motion as a motion for summary judgment\u201d. <em>See, e.g., Kennedy v. Chase Manhattan Bank USA, NA, </em>369 F.3d 833, 839 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Although the district court did <em>not </em>reference the Policy and stated that, \u201ceven after viewing all of the facts in favor of the plaintiffs\u201d, it was granting Defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it also stated: \u201cit is <em>undisputed </em>that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 <em>official duty description </em>[presumably the Policy relied upon by Defendants] includes reporting unlawful activity of other officers\u201d. <em>Williams v. Riley, </em>481 F.Supp.2d 582, 584 (N.D.Miss.2007) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs\u2019 operative complaint, however, does not mention their \u201cofficial duty description\u201d. And, contrary to Defendants\u2019 contention in support of their dismissal motion and on appeal, the complaint does not allege the speech was made pursuant to Plaintiffs\u2019 official duties. Moreover, the Policy was neither attached to the complaint, nor referenced by the complaint and central to the claim. <em>See, e.g., Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, </em>224 F.3d 496, 498-99 (5th Cir.2000) (citations omitted) (stating documents attached to a motion to dismiss may only be considered if referenced by the complaint and central to the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Accordingly, because it appears the Policy, a matter outside the pleadings, was considered, the dismissal was through a summary judgment and is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Jackson, </em>789 F.2d at 310. In doing so, we consider the summary-judgment record, which includes the Policy and Plaintiffs\u2019 declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). \u201cWe resolve doubts in favor of the non-moving party and make all reasonable inferences in favor of that party.\u201d <em>Dean v. City of Shreveport, </em>438 F.3d 448, 454 (5th Cir.2006). No genuine issue of material fact exists if, pursuant to the summary-judgment evidence, no reasonable juror could find in favor of the nonmovant. <em>E.g., Jenkins v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 181, 169 L.Ed.2d 35 (2007). (If matters outside the pleadings were <em>not </em>considered, resulting in the dismissal being under Rule 12(b)(6), the dismissal of the First Amendment claim would still be erroneous for the below-stated reasons.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their claims under \u00a7 1983 for violations of their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection on three bases. They maintain: a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether their speech is protected by the First Amendment; the district court erred by denying leave to file an amended complaint to clarify their job duties; and their equal-protection claim was erroneously dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Plaintiffs claim it was error to dismiss their claim for retaliation, in violation of their First Amendment rights to speak as citizens on matters of public concern. In that regard, at issue is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether their speech was made pursuant to their official job duties and, therefore, not protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">\u201c[T]he First Amendment protects a public employee\u2019s right, in certain circumstances, to speak <em>as a citizen </em>addressing matters of public concern\u201d. <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 417, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (citations omitted and emphasis added). \u201cSo long as employees are speaking <em>as citizens </em>about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>essary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (citing <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)) (emphasis added). \u201cEmployees who make public statements <em>outside the course of performing their official duties </em>retain some possibility of First Amendment protection. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">But, \u201cwhen public employees make statements <em>pursuant to their official duties, </em>the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (emphasis added); <em>see Williams v. Dallas Ind. Sch. Dist., </em>480 F.3d 689, 693 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Davis v. McKinney, </em>518 F.3d 304 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Nixon v. City of Houston, </em>511 F.3d 494 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">At issue, then, is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists on <em>Garcetti\u2019s </em>threshold inquiry \u2014 whether Plaintiffs\u2019 speech was pursuant to them official duties. The district court held the speech was unprotected, pursuant to <em>Garcetti. </em>As discussed above, it stated: \u201cit is <em>undisputed </em>that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 official duty description [as noted <em>supra, </em>presumably evidenced by the Policy] includes reporting unlawful activity of other officers\u201d. <em>Riley, </em>481 F.Supp.2d at 584 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">The Policy, however, does not conclusively establish the speech was made \u201cpursuant to them official duties\u201d. <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951. Further, Plaintiffs\u2019 declarations maintain, <em>inter alia, </em>no such duty was imposed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Along that line, even if the Policy undis-putedly imposed a duty on Plaintiffs to report the incident they witnessed, it is error to rely solely upon an employer\u2019s written policy in determining official duties. <em>Garcetti </em>had \u201cno occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee\u2019s duties\u201d (the plaintiff in <em>Garcetti </em>conceded his speech was made pursuant to his official duties), but instructs \u201c[t]he proper inquiry is a practical one\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 126 S.Ct. 1951.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-13\">Formal job descriptions often bear little resemblance to the duties an employee <em>actually is expected to perfo'rm, </em>and the listing of a given task in an employee\u2019s written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee\u2019s professional duties for First Amendment purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court erred by apparently relying solely upon Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cofficial duty description\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">Neither is it dispositive that the speech was made within the workplace; nor that it concerned a matter related to Plaintiffs\u2019 employment. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (citing <em>Givhan v. W. Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979)). Although it may be presumed that an employee\u2019s official job duties at a reasonable sheriffs department would include reporting crimes perpetrated at work by department members, it is not clearly so here. Plaintiffs\u2019 job duties as jailers are scarcely mentioned, save Plaintiffs\u2019 denials that those duties included reporting the incident at issue. Defendants produced the Policy, but it concerns \u201cimproper conduct\u201d and was not shown to be applicable. Again, Plaintiffs, as summary-judgment nonmovants, are accorded all reasonable inferences. <em>See, e.g., Dean, </em>438 F.3d at 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Therefore, a genuine issue of material fact remains on whether the speech was: \u201cpursuant to ... official duties\u201d Plaintiffs \u201cactually [were] expected to perform\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>made \u201cin the course of performing their official duties\u201d under <em>Garcetti, </em>547 U.S. at 421-25, 126 S.Ct. 1951. Accordingly, dismissal was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Along that line, Plaintiffs maintain the district court should have granted leave to file a third amended complaint, to clarify their allegations that the speech was not made pursuant to them job duties. Denial of leave to amend is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., LLC, </em>234 F.3d 863, 872 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The district court, relying on <em>Garcetti, </em>ruled the amendment would be futile. As discussed <em>supra, </em>however, a genuine issue of material fact exists on whether the speech was made pursuant to Plaintiffs\u2019 job duties. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in finding futility. <em>See id. </em>at 873. Therefore, on remand, Plaintiffs should be given leave to file the requested amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Finally, Plaintiffs maintain the district court erred in dismissing their Fourteenth Amendment equal-protection claim on the basis that Plaintiffs\u2019 speech is not protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim is based on the alleged retaliation against them for the exercise of their purported First Amendment rights \u2014 for reporting abusive activity by a member of the Sheriffs Department. In support, they rely on <em>Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (holding a \u201cclass-of-one\u201d equal-protection claim based on government\u2019s \u201cirrational and wholly arbitrary\u201d demand of an easement was cognizable), and <em>Shipp v. McMahon, </em>234 F.3d 907 (5th Cir.) (holding equal-protection claim may be available based on unequal police protection if illegitimate animus or ill-will motivated plaintiffs intentionally different treatment from others similarly-situated and no rational basis existed for such treatment), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1052, 121 S.Ct. 2193, 149 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2001), <em>overruled on other grounds, McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that a cognizable equal-protection claim may be based on a government-employer\u2019s selective enforcement of an employment policy, a \u201cclass-of-one\u201d plaintiff must, at a minimum, show he \u201chas been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated\u201d. <em>Olech, </em>528 U.S. at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073; <em>Shipp, </em>234 F.3d at 916 (stating plaintiff must also allege \u201can illegitimate animus or ill-will motivated\u201d the different treatment); <em>see Mikeska v. City of Galveston, </em>451 F.3d 376, 381 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2006) (listing different types of class-of-one claims). Plaintiffs, however, have not alleged they were treated differently than similarly-situated individuals. Rather, they alleged being treated differently than those who did not report the same type of incident (ie., did not engage in purported protected speech).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim \u201camounts to no more than a restatement of [their F]irst [Ajmendment claim\u201d. <em>Thompson v. City of Starkville, Miss., </em>901 F.2d 456, 468 (5th Cir.1990). Accordingly, it was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part. This matter is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
