We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The probation office calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 57-71 months. The district court concluded that Traylor\u2019s criminal history category was overstated by one level and, accordingly, adjusted the range to 46-57 months. Nevertheless, Traylor contends that the district court abused its discretion by neglecting to conduct a reasonable and individualized consideration of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) prior to imposing sentence. Traylor argues that the Guidelines range did not take into consideration the mitigating factors he presented at sentencing. Traylor\u2019s contention fails as the record reflects that the district court noted its obligation to impose a sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded that the factors, including Traylor\u2019s arguments in mitigation, were adequately captured by the advisory Guidelines. The district court did not procedurally err, and the sentence imposed is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Traylor\u2019s remaining contention, that the district court improperly delegated to the probation officer the decision regarding whether, and how much, he should pay for the cost of post-custodial treatment, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Soltero, </em>506 F.3d 718, 723 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Traylor\u2019s request for further briefing is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b765-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
