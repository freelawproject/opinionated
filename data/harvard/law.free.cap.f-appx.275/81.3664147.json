Elstein, which denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Coulibaly, Hamidou, </em>No. A96 266 749 (B.I.A. Mar. 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 266 749 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Ro-sales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the pretermission of Coulibaly\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Although we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Coulibaly\u2019s argument that he testified consistently and specifically regarding the date of his arrival in the United States is a challenge to the factual determination that does not present a question of law. We lack jurisdiction to review such arguments and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 328-29 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">As to Coulibaly\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal and CAT relief, we conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. As the claims are based on the same factual predicate, that determination is dispositive for both. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir. 2006). We give substantial deference to the IJ\u2019s demeanor-related finding, supported by the record, that Coulibaly was \u201cunresponsive\u201d to questioning by his attorney. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126-27 (2d Cir.2007). Moreover, the record supports the IJ\u2019s identification of multiple implausibilities and inconsistencies in Coulibaly\u2019s testimony. For instance, the IJ reasonably found inherently implausible Coulibaly\u2019s testimony that he did not know the full name of the man with whom he allegedly lived in Mali for twelve years and who helped him flee to the United States. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-67 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 169 (2d Cir.2007). Considered cumulatively, the inconsistencies and implausibilities found by the IJ formed an adequate basis for the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006). Moreover, given that the weight afforded to documentary evidence \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ,\u201d we find no error in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Coulibaly\u2019s documentary evidence did not make up for deficiencies in his testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341-42 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s alternative burden-related findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
