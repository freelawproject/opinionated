Hernandez argues that the district court erred in applying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(5) for the creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury and an enhancement under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6)(4) for the death of one of the aliens. He contends that applying both enhancements to his case \u201cconstituted impermissible double counting under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">The Government argues that Hernandez abandoned his objection to the enhancements after negotiating with the Government for a recommended 46-month sentence. The Government contends that the abandonment of the objection constituted a waiver of the issue. The Government thus asserts that the issue is unreviewable on appeal and that Hernandez\u2019s sentence should be affirmed. Hernandez has not responded to the Government\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">\u201c[WJaiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). Waiver occurs as a result of an affirmative choice by the defendant to forego any available remedy, presumably for benefits \u2014 real or perceived. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 160 (5th Cir.2002). Waived errors are unreviewable, but forfeited errors are renewable for plain error. <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931-32 (5th Cir.1995). The withdrawal of an objection constitutes the waiver of the objection by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s attorney can waive a claim by his client \u201cso long as the defendant does not dissent from attorney\u2019s decision, and so long as it can be said that the attorney\u2019s decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.\u201d <em>United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 683 n. 6 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The record does not reflect that Hernandez dissented from counsel\u2019s decision not to challenge the enhancements to his sentence. Because Hernandez has not shown that counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue a challenge to the enhancements was unreasonable, counsel\u2019s waiver is valid and Hernandez\u2019s claim on appeal is unreviewable. <em>See Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d at 931-32. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
