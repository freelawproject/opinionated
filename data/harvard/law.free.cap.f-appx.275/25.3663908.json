(\u201cTIOB\u201d), which is a non-profit organization operating on one of the Boston Harbor Islands. He brought suit in the federal district court for Massachusetts, alleging racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII and the analogous state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (2000); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B. The court granted summary judgment to TIOB on both claims, <em>Holloway v. Thompson Island Outward Bound Educ. Ctr., Inc., </em>492 F.Supp.2d 20 (D.Mass.2007); Holloway, litigating <em>pro se, </em>appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The story begins in June 2004. Holloway, who is black, was then working on the kitchen staff. He complained to TIOB about racial discrimination and harassment on the part of the kitchen supervisor and a fellow employee (both white); the latter allegedly threatened to kill Holloway. In response, TIOB placed Holloway on paid leave and thereafter negotiated a settlement with his counsel. The settlement agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that Holloway would be transferred to the maintenance department, that future employment disputes would be subject to arbitration, that Holloway would not be terminated except for just cause and that TIOB would pay Holloway\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Holloway returned to work on July 19, 2004. Less than two months later, he was terminated for insubordination, lateness, absenteeism and threatening behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The premise of Holloway\u2019s suit is that he was actually fired because of his race or as retaliation for his earlier complaints. Everything turns on motivation: there is no dispute that Holloway is black, had engaged in protected conduct and was subsequently terminated. But if the cause of the firing was insubordination or lateness or absenteeism \u2014 anything <em>besides </em>race or his previous complaint \u2014 then Holloway\u2019s claims fail. <em>Benoit v. Tech. Mfg. Corp., </em>331 F.3d 166, 173-75 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">TIOB says that Holloway was consistently late for work; that he was on various occasions absent without excuse; that he refused to perform certain assigned tasks; that he was rude to his supervisors when they attempted to confront him over these recurring issues; and that two other employees complained that Holloway had behaved in a threatening manner toward them. TIOB has submitted affidavits from Holloway\u2019s supervisors and the record includes as well a running file on Holloway kept by one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Holloway admits that he often began work after 9:00 a.m., but says that the only ferry to the island sometimes arrived late and that the 9:00 a.m. rule was (at least in practice) applied strictly only to the TIOB employees who lived on the island. He also admits that he refused some orders, but explains that his settlement with TIOB provided (implicitly) that he would not have to work with the kitchen staff who had threatened him; his refusals, he says, were only attempts to enforce that right. Likewise, he concedes that he refused to discuss with his supervisors some of the complaints they raised, <em>e.g. </em>about his lateness \u2014 -referring them instead to his lawyers \u2014 but his settlement did provide for arbitration of disputes and Holloway may have been concerned about unintentionally waiving his rights during informal discussions. He does acknowledge at least some of the absences TIOB attributes to him, but denies threatening anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">On this record, the prima facie case for discrimination is extremely weak. Those who terminated Holloway had nothing to do with the kitchen staff who had harassed him. There is certainly no direct evidence of discrimination, and the circumstantial case is weakened \u2014 if not defeated altogether \u2014 by the fact that Holloway was replaced by another black employee. <em>Shackelford v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP, </em>190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The evidence suggesting a possible retaliatory motive for the firing is somewhat stronger, primarily because of the close temporal proximity between Holloway\u2019s protected conduct and his firing. <em>Maria-ni-Colon v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>511 F.3d 216, 224 (1st Cir.2007). The termination took place within two months of his return to work following his complaints of racial harassment \u2014 an interval surely short enough at least to raise suspicions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Id; <em>see also Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>355 F.3d 6, 25-26 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">But these suspicions can be authoritatively dispelled (and <em>a fortiori </em>the weaker discrimination claims defeated) by an employer\u2019s convincing account of the legitimate reasons for the firing. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 804-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). And TIOB has provided, with solid support in the record, a list of such reasons. Holloway could only overcome this barrier by poking sufficient holes in TIOB\u2019s account to create a plausible inference that the reasons given for the discharge actually mask a forbidden retaliatory motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">He has not done so. Although he advanced the reasonable argument that if the first ferry to the island arrives after 9:00 a.m., an employee should not (indeed, would not) be penalized for lateness, the record reveals that Holloway faced discipline for <em>missing </em>the ferry entirely or for not checking in with his department <em>after </em>its arrival \u2014 different matters entirely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">And he has defended his refusal to follow orders by claiming that his settlement agreement entitled him to stay away from the kitchen staff, but the written agreement in the record contains no such provision and even if an oral side-agreement existed, the record reflects that Holloway\u2019s supervisors attempted to accommodate him but were met with noncompliance and insubordination on a series of occasions. For example, the running file indicates that on August 31, Holloway \u201creturned to Mr. Tibbetts to voice [his] aversion to working with Mr. Eppinger. At this time Mr. Tibbetts advised \u2018Fine, then just help Brendan and Kenny get the rest of the stuff on the pier when they are done.\u2019 \u201d However it was later revealed that Holloway \u201chad not assisted with any moving of materials and had gone off to work on [his] own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Holloway cannot explain away the insubordination by claiming that his settlement provides for arbitration of disputes; TIOB might still legitimately take issue with his rudeness, use of obscenities and refusal to discuss routine matters with his supervisors. Merely as one instance among several, the running file says that on August 13, Holloway\u2019s supervisor attempted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">to address [Holloway\u2019s] habit of being ready for work at 9:30. He stated that it was the way he did things and what he was accustomed to and that he would not change this practice. Made statements such as \u201cI don\u2019t need this crap\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not even talking to you, send it to my lawyer.\u201d ... Told him to please not ignore me or I will be forced to give him negative written feedback for insubordination. Said he did not care, \u201cwhatever.\u201d ... [Later that day,] Sean made veiled threats that \u201cYou do not want to get involved in this or you\u2019ll go down too.\u201d Said that \u201cmany lawyers out there would love to get a piece of this and I\u2019m just tempted to call them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Moreover, Holloway has not even attempted to respond to various other complaints about his work performance, such as his repeated practice of calling in sick after 9:00 a.m., in violation of TIOB policy. (The running file indicates that Holloway called in sick after 9:00 a.m. on August 20 and August 24.) Nor can all of his unexcused absences be justified by a family emergency that apparently took place dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing late July and early August. (The record supports TIOB\u2019s claims that Holloway was absent without excuse on September 1, 2, and 7, among other days.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In sum, TIOB has provided an extensive list of problems with Holloway\u2019s performance, backed up by record support. Holloway has no evidence that this documentary support (including the running file kept by his supervisor) was falsified in any way, and his attempts to refute the reasons one-by-one are not persuasive. On this record, no reasonable jury could find that the explanations for his discharge were pretexts and therefore that his termination reflected discrimination or retaliation on the part of TIOB.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\">. For example, the running file kept by Holloway\u2019s supervisor indicates that on August 10, \"Sean missed boat. Crew saw him drive onto EDIC dock (S' 8:36 after they had already turned to seaward.\u201d On August 13, the file indicates that Holloway was instructed to be \"ready to work ... directly from the 9:00 boat drop off.\" And on August 31, he was reprimanded because when \u201cthe ferry arrived at 9:15, [he] walked by our workshop and did not check in.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
