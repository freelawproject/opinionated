We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">I. <em>Roski III</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Anthem Electronics, Inc. v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>302 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir.2002). The district court did not err in granting Steefel\u2019s and Pascoe\u2019s motions for summary judgment on Astor\u2019s malpractice claims in connection with litigation against Edward Roski (the <em>\u201cRoski III </em>\u201d litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">To prevail on a claim of legal malpractice under California law, the plaintiff must establish the basic elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. <em>Nichols v. Keller, </em>15 Cal. App.4th 1672, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 601, 607 (1993). Astor claims both Steefel and Pascoe committed malpractice by failing to advise Astor that several of its claims in the <em>Roski III </em>action \u2014 which were based on the allegation that Astor\u2019s former business partner Marc Thorpe filed for bankruptcy in bad faith \u2014 were preempted by federal bankruptcy law and thus had to be raised in bankruptcy court. Astor, however, failed to present evidence sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the purported negligence of Pascoe and Steefel caused Astor any damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In his declaration filed in opposition to the law firms\u2019 motions for summary judgment, Plotnicki stated: \u201cThe action against Roski in New York was predicated upon asserting bad faith filing of bankruptcy against Thorpe and Roski. ASTOR would not have filed <em>[Roski III </em>] if it had known that bankruptcy related issues were required to be brought in the bankruptcy court.\u201d This conclusory assertion, however, is contradicted by the evidence in the record \u2014 particularly given Astor\u2019s continued pursuit of <em>Roski III after </em>the district court held Astor\u2019s claims based on Thorpe\u2019s alleged bad faith bankruptcy filing were preempted \u2014 and is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Newman v. County of Orange, </em>457 F.3d 991, 995 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cSuch conclusory allegations, standing alone, are insufficient to prevent summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Astor also claims that had it known of the bankruptcy preemption issue, it would have handled its litigation strategy differently, possibly pursuing its claims against Roski in the context of the Thorpe bankruptcy proceedings instead of in federal district court in <em>Roski III. </em>Astor did, however, raise the claim that Thorpe filed for bankruptcy in bad faith to the bankruptcy court \u2014 the bankruptcy court ruled against Astor on this claim. Further, Astor\u2019s generalized claim that it suffered damages based on additional, unspecified changes it might have made in its litigation strategy had it been aware of the preemption issue is speculative, and thus is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Thompson v. Halvonik, </em>36 Cal. App.4th 657, 661-62, 43 Cal.Rptr.2d 142 (1995) (\u201c[D]amages [for legal malpractice] may not be based upon sheer speculation or surmise, and the mere possibility or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>even probability that damage will result from wrongful conduct does not render it actionable.\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">II. Pascoe\u2019s Compromise at Thorpe\u2019s Confirmation Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The district court did not err in granting Pascoe\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Astor\u2019s claim that Pascoe committed malpractice by entering into an unauthorized agreement with Thorpe at the bankruptcy hearing in which Thorpe\u2019s reorganization plan was approved. The district court correctly concluded Astor failed to present any evidence it suffered damages as a result of the purported compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">At summary judgment, the only evidence of damages presented by Astor was Plotnicki\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]f Mr. Pascoe had not compromised [Astor\u2019s] position at the bankruptcy plan confirmation, Astor would have appealed any confirmation of Thorpe\u2019s Plan.\u201d As noted by the bankruptcy judge in its June 11, 2001 order denying Astor\u2019s motion to reconsider confirmation, however, Astor did appeal the confirmation. Based on this appeal, Astor successfully obtained a stay of the implementation of Thorpe\u2019s confirmation plan. Only after Plotnicki voluntarily settled with Thorpe did this appeal become moot. Moreover, Astor\u2019s claim on appeal that it somehow would have obtained a better settlement with Thorpe had Pascoe not compromised with Thorpe at the confirmation hearing is based on speculation, and thus is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Thompson, </em>43 Cal.Rptr.2d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">III. Jury Verdict Against Astor</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict that: (1) neither Pascoe nor Steefel committed malpractice in connection with litigation against Roski in New York (the \u201cNew York Action\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) Astor breached its contract with both Pascoe and Steefel by failing to pay their outstanding legal fees. Astor contends the district court\u2019s erroneous summary judgment rulings deprived it of a fair trial on these issues. As discussed <em>supra, </em>however, the district court properly granted the motions for summary judgment to which Astor objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">IV. Jury Verdict For Pascoe Against Plotnicki Individually</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">Substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict for Pascoe against Plotnicki individually. Plotnicki contends: (1) Pascoe did not present sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Plotnicki agreed personally to pay Pascoe\u2019s legal fees; and (2) even if Plotnicki agreed to pay Pascoe, he agreed only to pay for Pascoe\u2019s representation of Plotnicki individually; he did not agree to pay for Pascoe\u2019s representation of Astor as well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>William Pascoe testified not only that Plotnicki asked Pascoe to represent him individually, but also that Plotnicki personally told William Pascoe \u201che would get payment to me\u201d for Pascoe\u2019s unpaid invoices as soon as Plotnicki received sufficient money from one of his businesses in the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Moreover, nothing in William Pascoe\u2019s testimony limited the amount Plotnicki agreed to pay to include only those fees incurred while representing Plotnicki individually. To the contrary, the statement arose in a conversation in which William Pascoe was discussing his representation of Astor with Plotnicki (specifically, Astor\u2019s settlement agreement with Thorpe). According to William Pascoe\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, Plotnicki never distinguished between Pascoe\u2019s legal fees for the representation of Plotnicki individually and fees for Pascoe\u2019s representation of Astor. Thus, a reasonable juror could conclude Plotnicki personally agreed to pay all of the outstanding fees owed to Pascoe, not just the fees incurred while representing Plotnicki individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">V. Plotnicki\u2019s Individual Liability to Pascoe for Prevailing Party Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The district court abused its discretion in holding Plotnicki individually liable for Pascoe\u2019s prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees award. There is no evidence in the record that Plotnicki agreed individually to be subject to the prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees provision in Astor\u2019s written contract with Pascoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\"><em>Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson, </em>25 Cal.3d 124, 158 Cal.Rptr. 1, 599 P.2d 83, 86 (1979), cited by the district court, is inapposite. In <em>Reynolds, </em>the Supreme Court of California stated a plaintiff who sued a nonsignatory shareholder for breach of a written contract with the corporation under an \u201calter ego\u201d theory could recover an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the written contract, pursuant to California Civil Code \u00a7 1717(b)(1). Here, the jury was not instructed on alter ego liability. Nor is there substantial evidence in the record that the requirements of alter ego liability were met. Thus, we reverse the award of prevailing party attorneys\u2019 fees against Plotnicki individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. Because the facts are known to the parties, we revisit them only as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\">. Although the district court did not rely on this ground in its summary judgment order, this court may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Sicor Ltd. v. Cetus Corp., </em>51 F.3d 848, 860 n. 17 (9th Cir.1995). Astor\u2019s contention that Steefel failed to claim in the district court that Steefel's purported failure to advise Astor of the bankruptcy preemption issue did not cause Astor any damages is incorrect. <em>See </em>Steefel Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment at 24 (contending Steefel's purportedly negligent advice to Astor did not cause Astor to pursue <em>Roski III).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">. Because the jury found neither Pascoe nor Steefel committed malpractice in connection with the New York Action, we need not address Astor\u2019s claim that the district court improperly excluded evidence of certain damages <em>(i.e., </em>losses due to Plotnicki's \"capitulating\u201d settlement with Thorpe) resulting from this alleged malpractice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">. On appeal, Plotnicki does not contend his alleged oral agreement to pay Pascoe's fees is unenforceable for lack of consideration or because it violates the Statute of Frauds. Nor did Plotnicki object to the jury instructions given by the trial court, which similarly lacked any reference to consideration or a writing requirement. Thus, any potential arguments on these grounds have been waived. <em>See Image Technical Servs., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>125 F.3d 1195, 1206 (9th Cir. 1997) (waiver by failing to object to jury instructions); <em>Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994) (waiver by not raising issue in opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
