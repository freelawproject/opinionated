See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. R. 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the appeal be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">As this court recently stated in <em>Munsell v. Department of Agriculture, </em>\u201ca case on appeal normally is rendered moot when the appellant closes its business and, as a result, no longer has a cognizable interest in the outcome of the dispute.\u201d 509 F.3d 572, 582 (D.C.Cir.2007). Because appellant Cavel International, Inc. is no longer operating its slaughtering facility and has identified no concrete plans to open one elsewhere, its claims are moot. <em>See id. </em>at 583 (noting that where a party has \u201cno clear plans to reopen,\u201d mere \u201cspeculation that a business could again decide to operate\u201d does not establish a live controversy).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36(b), this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
