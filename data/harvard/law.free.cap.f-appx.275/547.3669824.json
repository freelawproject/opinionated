The Board issued a written reprimand and cut off Wilson-El\u2019s telephone privileges for a month. He responded by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition, ruling that Wilson-El is not \u201cin custody\u201d as a result of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">The district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. \u201cCustody\u201d is essential to any proceeding under \u00a7 2254. The Board\u2019s decision did not extend the duration of Wilson-El\u2019s confinement and thus did not subject him to additional custody. Indeed, the Board did not deprive Wilson-El of either liberty or property under the approach that <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), adopts for prisoners\u2019 suits, so the Board\u2019s decision cannot be challenged as a violation of due process using either \u00a7 2254 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">Wilson-El maintains that the Board\u2019s finding that he had been insolent played a role in a later proceeding in which the Board concluded that he is a habitual offender. The habitual-offender designation led to the loss of 180 days\u2019 good-time credit and so subjected Wilson-El to additional custody. Yet Wilson-El has not sought judicial review of the habitual-offender decision and cannot use the outcome of that proceeding to find \u201ccustody\u201d in this one, which involves only telephone privileges. (Whether the Board\u2019s finding of insolence could have been collaterally attacked in the habitual-offender proceeding is questionable, given <em>Lackawanna County District Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001), but we need not address that subject.)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
