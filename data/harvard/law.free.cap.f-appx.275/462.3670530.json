BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-17\">Appellant Phillip E. Weldon, a.k.a. Darryl Gant, pleaded guilty, on the eve of trial, to a two-count indictment for possessing and conspiring to distribute (powder) cocaine. There was an oral plea agreement. Eleven days after entering his plea- \u2014 but before sentencing \u2014 Weldon filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, which the district court denied after a hearing. The court subsequently sentenced Weldon to, <em>inter alia, </em>188 months\u2019 imprisonment, a significant downward variance from the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cadvisory Guidelines\u201d) range of 210-262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">Weldon now appeals his conviction and sentence, bringing three primary points of error. Weldon argues that (1) the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw guilty plea; (2) his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective; and (3) a prison term of 188 months is substantively unreasonable. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-19\">II. DENIAL OF THE WITHDRAWAL MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b489-20\">Weldon appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw guilty plea, arguing that he entered the plea with an \u201cunsure heart and confused mind.\u201d The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and then issued a thorough, well-reasoned opinion denying the motion. We agree with the analysis articulated by the district court. Accordingly, we adopt the district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order, and affirm Weldon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Weldon\u2019s second contention is that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney at that time failed to properly advise him of the consequences of entering his guilty plea. It is a well-settled general rule that \u201c \u2018a defendant may not raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims for the first time on direct appeal, since there has not been an opportunity to develop and include in the record evidence bearing on the merits of the allegations.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>404 F.3d 980, 986 (6th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Crowe, </em>291 F.3d 884, 886 (6th Cir.2002) (in turn citing <em>United States v. Wunder, </em>919 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir.1990))). Instead, the Sixth Circuit has \u201c \u2018routinely concluded that such claims are best brought by a defendant in a post-conviction proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 so that the parties can develop an adequate record on this issue.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>430 F.3d 317, 338 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 363, 369 (6th Cir.2003) (citations omitted)). Moreover, we are reluctant to rule on Weldon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim here, because to do so would impede any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion a second or successive motion, which could not be filed without receiving authorization from this Court. We see no reason to depart from the general rule in this case, and therefore we decline to address the merits of Weldon\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">IV. THE REASONABLENESS OF WELDON\u2019S PRISON SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Finally, Weldon appeals his 188-month prison sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court placed too much emphasis on some of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors while ignoring other significant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The district court\u2019s overall sentencing determination is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Tate, </em>516 F.3d 459, 464 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir.2007)). The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 598, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201cThe uniqueness of the individual case ... does not change the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review that applies to all sentencing decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d 511, 514 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). Even if the appellate court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate,\u201d that fact is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Reasonableness review \u201chas both a procedural and a substantive component.\u201d <em>United States v. Wheaton, </em>517 F.3d 350, 366 (6th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir.2007)); <em>accord Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d at 514 (\u201cOur reasonableness review is two-fold, requiring that a sentence be both procedurally and substantively reasonable.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>458 F.3d 491, 495 (6th Cir.2006)). Weldon does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. Therefore we limit our reasonableness review to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>whether the 188-month sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See Tate, </em>516 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">A sentence \u201c\u2018may be substantively unreasonable when the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 8553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d at 514 (quoting <em>United States v. Borho, </em>485 F.3d 904, 908 (6th Cir.2007) (citation and quotation marks omitted)). Ultimately, \u201cthe touchstone for our review is whether the length of the sentence is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Tate, </em>516 F.3d at 469 (citing <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>487 F.3d 366, 370 (6th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Weldon\u2019s case is unusual in that he argues that the district court\u2019s sizeable downward variance is substantively unreasonable because the variance is not large enough. Specifically, Weldon argues that the district court gave an unreasonable amount of weight to two \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 his history and characteristics, and the seriousness of the offense \u2014 while ignoring other significant factors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">As an initial matter, the district court repeatedly recognized its responsibility to impose a sentence in accord with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s so-called parsimony provision. (See Joint Appendix at 251, 255-56.) Additionally, the district court explicitly considered several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including: the applicable 210-262 month advisory Guidelines range, (J.A. at 232-33, 251), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4); the nature and circumstances of Weldon\u2019s offense, (J.A. at 251 (discussing Weldon\u2019s engagement in the instant offense in order to meet child support obligations)), and Weldon\u2019s history and characteristics, (J.A. at 251-52 (discussing Weldon\u2019s background of criminal offenses and current 21-month (and counting) period of incarceration for the instant offense)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Policy Statement on departures based on inadequacy of criminal history category, (J.A. at 254-55 (explaining that the court was not going to rule that criminal history category VI significantly overstated Weldon\u2019s criminal history, but that it was consulting the advisory Guidelines range applicable as if it had, as a guide in order to determine a sentence that satisfied the \u00a7 3553(a) parsimony provision)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(5); the seriousness of the offense, (J.A. at 253 (\u201cDrug offenses are serious business. They may not involve violence, but they certainly lead to violent behavior.\u201d)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); promotion of respect for the law, (J.A. at 253 (noting Weldon\u2019s apparent disrespect for the law, in conjunction with Weldon\u2019s new-found religious convictions)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); just punishment, (J.A. at 253-54 (\u201cIs a sentence of 210 to 262 months required for just punishment in this case? I\u2019m not so sure it is.\u201d)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); adequate deterrence, (J.A. at 253-54 (\u201cThe adequate deterrence in a career offender situation ... will be a substantial sentence.\u201d)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and protecting the public, (J.A. at 253-54 (recounting that the district court needed to protect the public and explaining that Weldon has \u201cshown a propensity to reoffend.\u201d)), <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">In sum, the district court considered the applicable, correctly calculated advisory Guidelines range, considered other pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and ultimately imposed a sentence that it found to be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing outlined in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). On this record, there is no basis to conclude that the district court\u2019s 188-month sentence \u2014 a substantial downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range \u2014 was unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>long. Accordingly, we affirm Weldon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">For the reasons stated above, Weldon\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">. Weldon does not appeal the other components of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
