Hobbs, and two of the prison\u2019s former chaplains, Wes Lamb and David Fox.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Terrero, a practicing Jew, claims that the defendants infringed his rights under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because, on different occasions, they failed to provide him with the means of celebrating the seven-day Jewish festival of Sukkot <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in October 2001, failed to ensure that he was served with challah bread instead of matzah crackers, and failed to contract with a rabbi to provide religious services. The chaplains moved the district court to dismiss Terrero\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that they are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied their motion, and they appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Terrero\u2019s three-count complaint is significant in what it does and what it does not allege. We first consider what the complaint explicitly alleges, then consider what it does not allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\n<em>What the complaint alleges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\"><em>Count One </em>On August 8, 2001 and again on September 17, 2001, Terrero wrote Lamb a letter asking that the prison furnish him with the following for the celebration of Sukkot: a sukkah; each of the four plant species; and permission to eat every meal in the sukkah. Terrero informed Lamb that if the prison was unable to furnish the items, the Aleph Institute of Miami, Florida, would do so. Terrero did not hear from Lamb in response, either verbally or in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">On October 1, Sukkot began without the items Terrero requested. On October 6, Lamb had a sukkah built and authorized Terrero to eat lunch in it. The sukkah blew down the next day and Lamb gave the Jewish inmates exclusive access to the chapel for Sukkot prayers. Lamb denied Terrero\u2019s request for the four plant species, citing budgetary constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\"><em>Count Two </em>Prior to January 2002, the prison had furnished the Jewish inmates challah bread for Sabbath prayers. In January 2002, the prison replaced challah with matzah crackers. Terrero asked Lamb and Fox to provide challah instead of matzah, and that if the prison could not provide challah, \u201cvarious Jewish organizations\u201d would provide it. The chaplains denied his request, citing \u201cbudgetary constraints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>Count Three </em>Terrero asked Lamb and Fox to contract with a rabbi to provide religious services at the prison,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that a rabbi was not provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Terrero exhausted his remedies with the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). The remedies available to Terrero are spelled out in 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10 <em>et seq. </em>After presenting each issue of concern informally to staff, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 542.13, Terrero submitted a Request for Administrative Remedy to the Warden within 20 days of the denial of his requests, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 542.14. The Warden investigated and responded to each request. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.11(a)(4). If he was dissatisfied with the Warden\u2019s response, Terrero had 20 days to appeal, first to the BOP Regional Director, and then to the BOP General Counsel, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 542.15, who each investigated his grievance and responded to his Requests for Administrative Remedy. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 542.15. These are the results of Terrero\u2019s Requests for Administrative Remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Count One alleges that the \u201cNational and Administrative Remedy Coordinators upheld [Lamb\u2019s] denials, as did the Warden.\u201d Concerning the sukkah, Count One alleges that the \u201cgovernment,\u201d in its \u201cresponses\u201d to his request for administrative remedies, stated that it would change its policy and in the future provide a sukkah.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Count Two alleges that those handling the administrative review \u201crefused to require [Lamb and Fox] to provide [challah bread].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Count Three alleges that those handling the administrative review \u201crefused to issue [a] contract\u201d for a rabbi.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">\n<em>What the complaint does not allege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">As to each count, the complaint does not allege what the chaplain(s) did after receiving Terrero\u2019s request for religious accommodation. For example, Count One does not indicate (1) whether or not Lamb attempted to obtain the funds necessary to build the sukkah and the four plant species; (2) the date(s) he sought his administrative remedies; (3) the evidence presented on administrative review by Terrero and Lamb; and (4) the reason why Lamb\u2019s decisions were upheld. For all we know, Lamb attempted to accommodate Terre-ro\u2019s requests but was presented from doing so by a superior within the BOP, by BOP regulations or policies, or the regulations or policies governing the operation of the Jesup prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Count Two likewise does not indicate what transpired during the various stages of administrative review. All we know is that challah was not provided due to \u201cbudgetary constraints.\u201d Who imposed those restraints and why is not alleged. Did the chaplains request the provision of challah? If so, to whom did they make their request, and what response did they receive?</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Count Three does not indicate when Terrero asked the chaplains to contract with a rabbi, whether or not they attempted to secure the services of a rabbi, and what transpired during the various stages of administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">Assuming for sake of argument that Terrero was denied religious accommodations at issue in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments and RFRA, the question the complaint does not answer is whether the chaplains or someone else caused the denial and whether the denial was lawful. Under the circumstances, we would be hard pressed to hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>chaplains, in the exercise of their discretion, infringed Terrero\u2019s rights. So to hold, we would have to say that merely alleging that Terrero asked the chaplains for the religious accommodations at issue and that the accommodation were not provided states a violation under the First or Fifth Amendments or RFRA. In other words, the fact that those participating in the administrative review of the chaplains\u2019 actions upheld them is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We are not prepared to go that far. The chaplains are entitled to the dismissal of Terrero\u2019s allegations against them on the basis of qualified immunity because those allegations do not state the constitutional and statutory violations claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The district court\u2019s order denying Lamb\u2019s and Fox\u2019s motions to dismiss is</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-16\">. <em>See Bivens v.
