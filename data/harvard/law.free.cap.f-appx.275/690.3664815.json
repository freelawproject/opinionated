SMITH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b716-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-26\">Steven Borg appeals from his jury-trial conviction for possessing a firearm while a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>fugitive from justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Borg contends that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated by the admission of a transcript of a bench warrant proceeding. This contention fails because this exhibit was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence, including the bench warrant itself; thus, any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Monaco, </em>735 F.2d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Borg\u2019s evidentiary challenges to the admissibility of various trial exhibits and testimony under the Federal Rules of Evidence lack merit. Much of this evidence was properly admitted, and to the extent there was error, it was harmless. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>790 F.2d 1468, 1470 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d 1093, 1100 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Borg\u2019s proposed jury instructions concerning \u201cactive concealment\u201d because those instructions were not legally supported. <em>See United States v. Wazney, </em>529 F.2d 1287, 1289 (9th Cir.1976); <em>see also United States v. Powell, </em>955 F.2d 1206, 1210 (9th Cir. 1991); Ninth Cir. Model Jury Instruction 8.44 (defining the term \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We also reject Borg\u2019s argument that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the closing arguments that violated Borg\u2019s due process rights. Nothing Borg alleges \u201cmaterially affected the fairness of the trial.\u201d <em>United. States v. Cabrera, </em>201 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Finally, we reject Borg\u2019s contention that the cumulative impact of the trial errors requires remand. <em>Cf United States v. Frederick, </em>78 F.3d 1370, 1381 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding cumulative error where \u201cthe evidence against the defendant was not overwhelming and ... the case was a close one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
