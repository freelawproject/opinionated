In the Motion, Sillah sought mandamus relief relating to the denial of his application for adjustment of status by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cCIS\u201d). More specifically, Sillah asked the district court to enter an order mandating that the CIS consider his Temporary Protected Status (\u201cTPS\u201d) prior to adjudicating his adjustment-of-status application. The district court determined that Sillah\u2019s claim represented a legal challenge to the discretionary denial of relief, over which the district court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">Our review of subject matter jurisdiction is <em>de novo. See Dale v. Moore, </em>121 F.3d 624, 626 (11th Cir.1997). After careful review we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">The relevant facts are straightforward. Sillah entered the United States illegally in August 1994 and remained here unlawfully until 1996 when he was granted TPS under \u00a7 244 of the INA based on \u201c \u2018extraordinary and temporary conditions\u2019 caused by the past armed conflict\u201d in Liberia. On September 20, 2006, the CIS issued a notice indicating that it would be terminating TPS for Liberian TPS beneficiaries, based on changed circumstances in Liberia. The notice provided that the Attorney General had determined that \u201cthe extraordinary and temporary conditions that formed the basis of the [TPS] have improved such that they no longer prevent Liberians ... from returning to their home country in safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">On July 24, 2006, Sillah filed an application for adjustment of status, seeking lawful permanent residency in the United States based on his marriage to a United States citizen three months earlier. On June 20, 2007, the CIS denied Sillah\u2019s application, stating that the denial was based on Sillah\u2019s illegal entry into the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>States and his concomitant statutory ineligibility for adjustment of status under \u00a7 245(i) of the INA. In response to Sil-lah\u2019s request for reconsideration based on his TPS, the CIS cited \u00a7 245(c) of the INA, which provides that TPS accords an alien lawful status \u201conly during the TPS period and does not relieve a bar to adjustment incurred before the grant of TPS.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(c). Sillah then filed this action in the district court, seeking mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the CIS\u2019s denial of Sillah\u2019s application for adjustment of status, because the denial was a non-disere-tionary legal decision based on Sillah\u2019s statutory ineligibility for adjustment of status. The district court concluded that pursuant to the provisions of the REAL ID Act, only <em>this </em>Court has jurisdiction to review the CIS\u2019s denial of adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act, which states explicitly that the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (aliens convicted of aggravated felonies) and (C) (denials of discretionary relief) do not preclude review by the courts of appeal of \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106(a), 119 Stat. 231, 310, codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Cha-con-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, only the courts of appeal retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional and legal challenges to decisions pertaining to the denial of discretionary relief, such as the one presented in the instant mandamus petition. Accordingly, the district court did not err by dismissing Sillah\u2019s Motion in which he sought mandamus relief relating to the CIS\u2019s denial of his application for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">. Because the CIS has already rendered a decision on Sillah\u2019s application, and it is not pending before the agency, his arguments based on unreasonable delay in an administrative decision, under the Administrative Procedure Act, are misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
