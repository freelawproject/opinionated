Turcios\u2019s complaint alleged that defendants owed her unpaid overtime compensation and minimum wages. Upon the defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed Turcios\u2019s complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Turcios filed this appeal. We conclude that the district court should have used the Rule 56 standard, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction under Rules 12(b)(1) and 56</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant properly challenges subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) the district court is free to independently weigh facts, and \u2018may proceed as it never could under Rule 12(b)(6) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morrison v. Amway Corp., </em>323 F.3d 920, 925 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Lawrence v. Dunbar, </em>919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir.1990)). That is, when a Rule 12(b)(1) motion constitutes a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cno presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiffs allegations, and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lawrence, </em>919 F.2d at 1529).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">\u201cWe have cautioned, however, that the district court should only rely on Rule 12(b)(1) \u2018[i]f the facts necessary to sustain jurisdiction <em>do not implicate the merits of plaintiffs cause of action.\u2019 </em>If a jurisdictional challenge does implicate the merits of the underlying claim then: \u2018[T]he proper course of action for the district court is to find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of the plaintiffs case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Garcia v. Copenhaver, Bell &amp; Assocs., </em>104 F.3d 1256, 1261 (11th Cir.1997)) (ellipses omitted). \u201c[Jjurisdiction becomes intertwined with the merits of a cause of action when \u2018a statute provides the basis for both the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court and the plaintiffs substantive claim for relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926 (quoting <em>Sun Valley Gasoline, Inc. v. Ernst Enters., </em>711 F.2d 138,139-40 (9th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">For example, in <em>Morrison v. Amway Corporation, </em>this Court concluded that \u201celigible employee\u201d status under the Family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) is a \u201cthreshold jurisdictional question\u201d that is also \u201ca prima facie element for recovery\u201d under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 927-28. We did so after examining the structure of the FMLA. Specifically, \u00a7 2617 of the FMLA authorizes suit by an \u201celigible employee\u201d for an FMLA violation, while \u00a7 2617, which contains general definitions applicable to the FMLA, defines the term \u201celigible employee.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2611(2)(A), 2617(a). We noted that the phrase \u201celigible employee\u201d was found in both \u00a7 2617(a)(1), which sets forth an employer\u2019s liability in a private civil suit under the FMLA, and \u00a7 2611, which sets forth the scope of the FMLA\u2019s coverage in a general definitions provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">This Court similarly has concluded that \u201cemployer\u201d status under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d) is a jurisdictional issue that is intertwined with the merits of an ADEA claim. <em>Garcia v. Copenhaver, Bell &amp; Associates, </em>104 F.3d 1256, 1263 (11th Cir.1997). Under the ADEA, \u00a7 623(a)(1) provides substantive relief for a violation and requires the plaintiff to prove the defendant is an \u201cemployer,\u201d while \u00a7 630, which contains general definitions for the ADEA, defines the term \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 630(b). We examined the ADEA statute and concluded that \u201cit seems the section of [the] ADEA that provides the substantive relief, \u00a7 623, is intertwined and dependent on the section of [the] ADEA that defines the scope of the act, \u00a7 630.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Because in <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Garcia </em>the jurisdictional question was intertwined with a substantive element of the statutory claim, we concluded that the district court \u201cwas required to find that jurisdiction exists and deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits\u201d and \u201cresolve the attack under Rule 56 and review for sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>323 F.3d at 929-30 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Garcia, </em>104 F.3d at 1261, 1267.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">B. FLSA</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Here, as in <em>Monison </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>the same operative fact determines whether the plaintiff can recover under the statute and the scope of the statute\u2019s coverage. The overtime provision of the FLSA, \u00a7 207(a), requires the plaintiff employee to prove that she was either: (1) \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\u201d or (2) \u201cemployed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Likewise, the minimum wage provision of the FLSA, \u00a7 206, requires the plaintiff employee to prove one of these two conditions. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Also as in <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>a court must look to the definitions section of the statute to determine the scope of coverage under the FLSA. Specifically, \u00a7 203 defines the phrase \u201c[e]nterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d as an enterprise that (1) has two or more employees engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce or has employees \u201chandling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce ...,\u201d and (2) has an \u201cannual gross volume of sales made or business done\u201d of \u201cnot less than $500,000....\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(l)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is commonly referred to as \u201centerprise coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">In short, the sections of the FLSA that provide the substantive relief, \u00a7 \u00a7 206 and 207, are intertwined with and dependent on the section of the FLSA that defines the scope of the FLSA, \u00a7 203. Thus, for the same reasons that \u201celigible employee\u201d status under the FMLA and \u201cemployer\u201d status under the ADEA are intertwined with the merits of those statutory claims, the question of enterprise coverage is also intertwined with the merits of an FLSA claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">C. Turcios\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The district court concluded that the plaintiff Turcios failed to establish enterprise coverage because Turcios had not proved that the defendant Delicias Hispanas had at least $500,000 in annual gross sales made or business done during 2006 when Turcios was employed. Relying on its authority under Rule 12(b)(1) to make findings of fact relating to subject matter jurisdiction, the district court found that Delicias Hispanas had gross receipts or revenue of no more than $79,168.00 in 2006. However, whether Delicias Hispanas was an \u201c[ejnterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d implicated both the merits of Turcios\u2019s FLSA claims and the jurisdictional question. Therefore, under <em>Mom-son </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>the district court erred in applying the Rule 12(b)(1) standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">This is especially so given that: (1) Turcios submitted a sworn affidavit that defendant Patricia Ortega had admitted to her that the restaurant earned over $10,000 weekly; (2) Delicias Hispanas was operated as a cash-only restaurant with no documentation of its gross revenue; (3) Delicias Hispanas\u2019s 2006 tax return indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>cated that the restaurant had gross receipts of $79,168, which would suggest an approximate weekly gross revenue of $1500; (4) the 2006 tax return also indicated that the restaurant operated at a net loss of $6,761, but failed to include cost of labor in the cost of goods sold, suggesting an even greater net loss than reported; (5) Turcios\u2019s weekly salary for 80 hours of work was $700, almost half the restaurant\u2019s estimated weekly gross receipts; (6) the restaurant employed at least two waitresses; and (7) the restaurant contained between fifteen and twenty tables, was open seven days a week from 8:00 am until at least 10:00 p.m., and served breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss and remand for the district court to resolve the motion applying the standards applicable under Rule 56. Further, since this issue has been litigated as a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no summary judgment notice has been given. On remand, the district court shall give summary judgment notice and allow the parties to submit any additional evidence on the issues raised in defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-6\">.
