The facts are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Levina argues that the California Special Education Hearing Office deprived her of the opportunity to seek reasonable attorney\u2019s fees by failing to dismiss the underlying administrative hearing with prejudice. We have held that the erroneous dismissal of an action without prejudice creates an injury-in-fact under Article III. <em>See Farmer v. McDaniel, </em>98 F.3d 1548 (9th Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). However, this case is distinguishable; here, the parties have entered into a settlement agreement that eliminates any concern that the School District will relitigate its claims regarding the 2005 Individualized Education Plan for Levina\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">The availability of an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) does not create an injury-in-fact, both because such award is discretionary and hence speculative, and because it is likely that a district court would conclude that Levina\u2019s success on the merits was \u201cpurely technical.\u201d <em>Kletzelman v. Capistrano Unified School District, </em>91 F.3d 68, 71 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
