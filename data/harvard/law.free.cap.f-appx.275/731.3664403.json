We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Davis-Rice contends that the Bureau of Prisons breached a contract by projecting her release date 30 days later than it should have been. Based on a stipulated agreement between the parties, the district court issued an order which stated, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cthe sentence will be reduced by eight months and 15 days (which is a total of 285 days).\u201d However, eight months and 15 days is actually less than 285 days. The Bureau of Prisons noted the discrepancy and brought it to the attention of the parties, who jointly filed a letter with the district court confirming that the order should be modified to replace the number 285 with the number 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">Davis-Rice\u2019s argument that the error in drafting must be construed against the party drafting the document fails because the record reveals that the parties\u2019 intent was to reduce Davis-Rice\u2019s sentence by eight months and 15 days. <em>See United States ex rel. Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Haas &amp; Haynie Corp., </em>577 F.2d 568, 574 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">Moreover, the agreement expressly allowed for modification by writing, duly executed by all of the parties or their authorized representatives. Davis-Rice\u2019s attorney, acting on her behalf, executed a facsimile copy of the joint letter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>district court confirming the modification to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b758-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
