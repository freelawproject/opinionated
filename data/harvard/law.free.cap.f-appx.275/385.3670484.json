We have reviewed the briefs and the applicable law. Perez presents no valid argument as to how a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over her claim. She does not allege diversity jurisdiction, nor does she allege her action arises under any applicable federal law as a basis for federal question jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Perez is challenging the Texas Attorney General\u2019s application of Texas state law, which, as currently alleged, is a pure state law claim. We therefore agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that we have no subject-matter jurisdiction over this case. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED for the reasons given by the district court in its opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
