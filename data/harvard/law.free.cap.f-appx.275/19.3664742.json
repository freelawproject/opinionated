Circuit Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b45-26\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-27\">While appellant was on federal supervised release, a Maryland court convicted him of assault and burglary. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia then held a hearing, revoked appellant\u2019s supervised release, and sentenced him to 18-months\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant raises several reasons why his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient under the first prong of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), but none has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-28\">First, appellant argues that counsel should have (1) sought a continuance of the revocation hearing until after appeal of his Maryland conviction, and (2) presented evidence challenging the conviction itself as erroneous. But appellant presents no remotely compelling evidence that his conviction was in error, asserting only that the conviction arose from a domestic dispute involving his \u201cvindictive ex-wife\u201d and her \u201cfrivolous charges.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-29\">Second, appellant argues that counsel failed (1) to inform the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that the sentencing guidelines did not mandate revocation in appellant\u2019s circumstance, and (2) to point out discretionary factors the district court could have considered in deciding whether to revoke supervised release. Nothing in the record, however, reveals that the district court believed revocation was required or refused to consider the appropriate discretionary factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Third, appellant argues that once the district court decided to revoke supervised release, counsel failed to invoke statutory sentencing factors or to present mitigating evidence. But the record shows that the district court did in fact consider appropriate sentencing factors and mitigating evidence, arriving at a mid-range sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that counsel\u2019s behavior did not \u201cf[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In any event, even if it did, appellant cannot satisfy <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, that the \u201cdeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Appellant has failed to show a reasonable probability that the district court\u2019s revocation decision would have been different had counsel requested a continuance of the hearing or presented evidence on the underlying conviction. Nor has appellant shown that any further mitigating factors existed that would have led to a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir.
