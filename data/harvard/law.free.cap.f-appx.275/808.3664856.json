McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b834-25\">William Satterfield pled guilty to federal charges of conspiracy and odometer tampering and signed a waiver of his rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>direct appeal and collateral attack. This is his second attempt to collaterally attack that conviction and sentence, and we conclude that it lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Mr. Satterfield bought, refurbished, and sold classic automobiles. It was important, he said, to create \u201cthe appearance of the mileage of a special interest, antique vehicle\u201d as a matter of \u201ccosmetic appearance.\u201d Petr.\u2019s Br. 2. But Mr. Satterfield apparently went beyond buffing the chrome, and the government charged him with odometer tampering, a federal crime. On the advice of counsel, Mr. Satterfield admitted that he had tampered with the odometers in 424 used vehicles, and pled guilty to a single count of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, and two counts of odometer tampering, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32703(2). He received one 50-month sentence (with three years of supervised release) and two 36-month sentences (with one year each of supervised release), to run concurrently. He also was ordered to pay over $1.3 million in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Mr. Satterfield\u2019s plea agreement waived his right to direct appeal and collateral attack. He did not directly appeal, but did collaterally attack his sentence and conviction on four grounds under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We rejected his \u00a7 2255 challenges in <em>United States v. Satterfield, </em>218 Fed.Appx. 794 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished). There, we refused to grant a certificate of appealability for two of his claims \u2014 that he had waived his rights unknowingly because his counsel was ineffective, and that the district court had been wrong to adopt his pre-sentence report as a factual finding \u2014 because he had failed to show ineffectiveness of counsel sufficient to set aside the collateral attack waiver in his plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 796. His other two claims were challenges to the million-dollar restitution order \u2014 that it violated Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, and that it miscalculated the amount of loss and was therefore excessive. We had granted a certificate of appealability, but held that a prisoner \u201ccannot challenge the amount of restitution awarded by way of a \u00a7 2255 motion ... because he is not claiming the right to be released from custody based on his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>351 F.3d 360, 361 (8th Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Mr. Satterfield now tries again, bringing the same four challenges under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 rather than \u00a7 2255. The district court rejected these claims. A petitioner is barred from bringing a claim under \u00a7 2241 if relief under \u00a7 2255 is available unless he shows that \u00a7 2255 is not an adequate vehicle for his claims, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), and the court held that Mr. Satterfield had not demonstrated \u00a7 2255\u2019s inadequacy. It is not sufficient for a petitioner to show that his earlier motion was denied; that might mean only that his claims lacked merit, not that \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate procedure for bringing them. <em>Id.; Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir.1999). Mr. Satterfield appeals, claiming that \u201cthe trial court erred in ruling that the proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is not the proper vehicle for the Appellant to pursue this matter.\u201d Petr.\u2019s Br. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">We agree completely with the district court\u2019s reasoning as to two of Mr. Satterfield\u2019s claims, the claim of ineffectiveness and the challenge to the use of the PSR: Mr. Satterfield has not made the necessary showing that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate. For his two challenges to his restitution order, however, we take a slightly different view: Mr. Satterfield <em>has </em>shown that \u00a7 2255 is an inadequate vehicle for bringing those claims. That is exactly what we held in his last appeal \u2014 a \u00a7 2255 motion cannot challenge a restitution amount, and is perforce \u201cinadequate\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>bringing such a challenge. Or, put another way, the rule requiring a petitioner to demonstrate the inadequacy of \u00a7 2255 only applies to the extent that the \u201cprisoner ... is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">That does not mean that his \u00a7 2241 motion should succeed, however, or even that we should consider the merits of his challenges to the restitution order. A \u00a7 2241 motion cannot challenge Mr. Satterfield\u2019s restitution order any more than a \u00a7 2255 motion can. We have held that \u201ca habeas petition under \u00a7 2241 may be granted only if the challenged state action \u2018affected the duration of the petitioner\u2019s custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Jones, </em>430 F.3d 1113, 1120 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997)) (alterations omitted); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). The challenge to the restitution portion of his sentence in no way challenges his custody, so it cannot be brought under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore do not need to examine the validity of his collateral attack waiver. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1324-27 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc); <em>United States v. Chavez-Salais, </em>337 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179, 1181-83 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Mr. Satterfield\u2019s challenges to his confinement and demands for release were adequately heard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and his challenges that do not address his confinement cannot be heard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, denying Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 motion, is AFFIRMED. Mr. Sat-terfield also filed motions to supplement the record and appoint an attorney, which are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b834-16\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">. Mr. Satterfield's petition also sought relief under two jurisdictional statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4) and may also have attempted to describe an \"action arising] out of the United States Constitution and laws.\u201d Dist. Ct. Dkt. Doc. 1, at 1. The jurisdictional statutes do not provide any additional cause of action, and Mr. Satterfield does not cite, nor have we found, any other constitutional or statutory cause of action under which his restitution challenge might be brought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
