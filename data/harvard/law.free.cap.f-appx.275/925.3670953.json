He asserts this error caused him harm because had the district court decided the case under the summary judgment standard, two of the defendants, Judges Menefee and Bryan, would have been required to \u201cprove absolute or qualified immunity.\u201d Austin also finds error in the district court\u2019s failure to consider his motion for summary judgment; he asserts that the court should have taken his allegations as true and that there was a disputed genuine issue of material fact at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. Additionally, on appeal, Austin appears to argue the merits of the underlying probate proceedings out of which this \u00a7 1983 action arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>an order granting motions to dismiss. <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2006). In reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, the allegations in the complaint \u201cmust be taken as true and read in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Linder v. Portocarrero, </em>963 F.2d 332, 334 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">\u201cA court is generally limited to reviewing what is within the four corners of the complaint on a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Bickley v. Caremark RX, Inc., </em>461 F.3d 1325, 1329 n. 7 (11th Cir.2006). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(d), \u201c[i]f, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(d) (2008). \u201cWhenever a judge considers matters outside the pleadings in a 12(b)(6) motion, that motion is thereby converted into a Rule 56 Summary Judgment motion.\u201d <em>Trustmark Ins. Co. v. ESLU, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1265, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">After careful review, we discern no reversible error. Although the parties\u2019 motions had affidavits, the record demonstrates that the district court did not consider matters outside the pleadings. The magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, which was adopted by the district court, only considered the \u201cface of Austin\u2019s complaint\u201d when issuing its recommendation. The district court therefore did not err when it failed to treat the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment. <em>See Bickley, </em>461 F.3d at 1329 n. 7; <em>Trustmark Ins. Co., </em>299 F.3d at 1267. Because this is the only issue raised on appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Austin has abandoned all other issues, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Austin\u2019s claims against the defendants is</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-12\">. The several motions by several appellees to adopt other appellee briefs are granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. We observe that the district court dismissed Appellant\u2019s complaint on grounds of, <em>inter alia, </em>absolute judicial immunity, state sovereign immunity, and for want of a state actor. Appellant has not challenged the substance of this ruling. Issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989). Even were we able to construe Appellant's brief to present such a challenge, we find no reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b952-12\">. Two of the defendants, Regions Bank and Wachovia Bank, move this Court for sane-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>tions pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912. The motion is denied. There is no indication in the record that Appellant's inartful complaint (and appeal) was made for purposes of harassment or delay. Nor is there any indication that Appellant has been litigious, or has filed multiple frivolous actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
