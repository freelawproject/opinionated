We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-20\">We review a dismissal for failure to prosecute under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States ex rel. Drake v. Norden Sys., Inc., </em>375 F.3d 248, 254 (2d Cir.2004). \u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s decision by examining whether: (1) the plaintiffs failure to prosecute caused a delay of significant duration; (2) plaintiff was given notice that further delay would result in dismissal; (3) defendant was likely to be prejudiced by further delay; (4) the need to alleviate court calendar congestion was carefully balanced against plaintiffs right to an opportunity for a day in court; and (5) the trial court adequately assessed the efficacy of lesser sanctions. No one factor is dispositive, and ultimately we must review the dismissal in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The record reveals that Schneider delayed for seven months, <em>cf. Chira v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>634 F.2d 664, 666-68 (2d Cir.1980) (affirming dismissal of complaint following a six-month delay), notwithstanding the district court\u2019s forceful warnings that further delay would result in dismissal of her case. And the district court\u2019s finding that the defendants had been prejudiced by the delay (in light of the defendants\u2019 need to brief and rebrief Schneider\u2019s failures to comply with court orders) was not clearly erroneous. Further, the court weighed Schneider\u2019s right to have her case heard against the effects of her conduct: she had halted resolution of the case and had diverted resources from other matters that deserved the court\u2019s attention. Finally, it was not clearly erroneous for Judge Castel to find that, since his written orders and admonishments in open court had failed to motivate Schneider, a less drastic sanction would be inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">While we acknowledge that <em>pro se </em>litigants are entitled to special leniency regarding procedural matters, <em>see Lucas v. Miles, </em>84 F.3d 532, 535 (2d Cir.1996), we conclude on this record that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We have considered all of Schneider\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
