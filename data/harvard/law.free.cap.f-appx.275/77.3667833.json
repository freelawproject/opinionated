Chew denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhang, </em>No. A 98 358 178 (B.I.A. July 17, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 358 178 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 5, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">Zhang asserts that he established both past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution because his mother and aunt were forcibly sterilized under China\u2019s family planning policy for having more than one child. This Court has squarely rejected the notion that <em>\u201cchildren </em>of those directly victimized by coercive family planning policies\u201d are <em>per se </em>eligible for relief. <em>Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 142 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that sterilization of a petitioner\u2019s mother did not constitute past persecution of the petitioner). Applicants must base their claims on \u201cpersecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007)(en banc); <em>see Tao Jiang, </em>500 F.3d at 141. Although Zhang asserts that he has a well-founded fear of persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>because he would also be sterilized if he has more than one child, the IJ properly rejected that claim as speculative where he is unmanned, has no children, and has never had an encounter with the family planning authorities. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, 421 F.3d 125, </em>128-29 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent \u201csolid support\u201d in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to forced sterilization, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d even though his wife was pregnant with their second child).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Therefore, the IJ properly denied asylum where Zhang failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Because Zhang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Because Zhang has failed to sufficiently challenge the denial of his CAT claim or any claim based on his illegal departure from China or his asserted fear of loan sharks before this Court, we deem any such challenges waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
