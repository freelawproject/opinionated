Zuckerman, Esq., Philadelphia, PA, for Commissioner of Social Security.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b193-7\">Before: AMBRO, FUENTES and FISHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b193-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">Darlene Jones appeals the District Court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of her request for benefits. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">In May 2003, Jones filed applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. Jones alleged disability because of hepatitis C, high blood pressure, depression and knee and lumbar impairments. After Jones\u2019 applications were denied, she received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ found that Jones was not disabled under the Social Security Act and the Appeals Council denied her request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The ALJ found that Jones had medically determinable lumbar, knee, hepatitis C and depression impairments. Although these constituted a \u201csevere\u201d combination of impairments under the regulations, the ALJ found at step three of the five-step sequential evaluation that they did not equal a Listed Impairment. <em>See Ramirez v. Barnhart, </em>372 F.3d 546, 550-51 (3d Cir. 2004) (describing 5-step process). Rather, the ALJ determined that Jones retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform the functional demands of a restricted range of sedentary level exertional work. According to the ALJ, while Jones was incapable of performing her past relevant work, she was capable of making an adjustment to work which exists in significant numbers in the national and regional economy. The District Court, adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation over Jones\u2019 objections, affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3), which incorporates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) by reference. We have jurisdiction over Jones\u2019 appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Allen v. Barnhart, </em>417 F.3d 396, 398 (3d Cir.2005). We review the factual findings in the ALJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Rutherford v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 546, 552 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">On appeal, Jones, proceeding pro se, does not raise any legal issues and only alleges that she is disabled because she has impairments and takes medication. We will assume that Jones is attempting to challenge the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and the ALJ\u2019s factual findings regarding her disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court and will adopt its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">There was substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Jones\u2019 reduced bilateral grip strength, possible left-sided carpal tunnel syndrome and obesity were not severe impairments. <em>See Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, 38 (3d Cir.2001). Further, there is substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the evidence in Jones\u2019 medical records discredited her subjective complaints regarding the severity of her back pain. The ALJ properly considered, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cussed and weighed the relevant evidence pertaining to Jones\u2019 disability allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The District Court also properly concluded that Jones\u2019 obesity was factored indirectly into the ALJ\u2019s decision based on her doctors\u2019 opinions. <em>See Rutherford, </em>399 F.3d at 552-53. Further, while Jones took issue with a discrepancy between the Vocational Expert\u2019s testimony and the examples of jobs the ALJ found she could perform, there is substantial evidence to support the finding that Jones is able to perform a limited range of sedentary work and that such work exists in the national economy. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A), 1382e(a)(3)(B); <em>see also Jones v. Banhart, </em>364 F.3d 501, 505-06 (3d Cir.2004) (the three enumerated occupations in ALJ\u2019s report are merely examples and not a complete list of the sedentary work claimant can perform).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding is also supported by substantial evidence and the hypothetical question posed to the Vocational Expert accurately reflected Jones\u2019 clearly established physical and mental impairments. <em>See Burns v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 123 (3d Cir.2002) <em>(quoting Podedworny v. Harris, </em>745 F.2d 210, 218 (3d Cir.1984)). The ALJ also properly considered Jones\u2019 ability to handle stress in assessing her RFC to perform work.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-13\">. Jones' argument that she is disabled because of the number of medications she takes was not raised in the District Court and is therefore waived. <em>See Krysztoforski v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 857, 860-61 (3d Cir.1995) (per cu-riam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
