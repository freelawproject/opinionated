He argues that the district court offered \u201cvery little justification\u201d for the sentence, which was the maximum allowed by statute and twice that recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements. He also argues that the court\u2019s reasoning regarding the temporal proximity between the violation and his release from prison was insufficient to justify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Gonzalez did not object to his sentence in the district court. This court requires a defendant to object in order to preserve an argument for appeal, even where the defendant does not have notice of the court\u2019s intent to impose a sentence above that recommended by the Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Milton, </em>147 F.3d 414, 420 (5th Cir.1998) (requiring objection despite lack of notice of intent to depart). Accordingly, review of the sentence is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). This court may correct the sentencing determination only if there is error that is plain and that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>The decision to correct the forfeited error is left to this court\u2019s sound discretion, and this court \u201cshould not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">The district court considered the policy statements of Chapter 7 and explained its reasons for issuing a non-guideline sentence. The court gave fact-specific reasons for the sentence, noting in particular that Gonzalez had engaged in criminal activity relatively soon after his release. The court also noted that Gonzalez\u2019s recent criminal activity involved a very serious marijuana conspiracy. Contrary to Gonzalez\u2019s argument, the district court could properly consider the temporal proximity between the violation and his release from prison in determining the sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Gonzalez has not demonstrated plain error with respect to his revocation sentence. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-08 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">Gonzalez also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) and his right to due process by failing to provide him with notice of its intention to \u201cdepart upward.\u201d \u201cThe same stringent due process and Rule 32 standards regarding notice of factors for departures under the [Guidelines do not apply to departures from non-binding, advisory policy statements.\u201d <em>United States v. Santirosa, </em>94 Fed.Appx. 231, 231-32 (5th Cir.2004). \u201c[A] sentencing court in revocation proceedings is not required to give notice of its intent to depart from the policy statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
