Wallace Tashima, Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b165-24\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b165-25\">McKEE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b165-26\">Petitioner Mattheus Andreas Laurens seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-28\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final orders of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Where the Board both affirms the findings of the IJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ\u2019s decision, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004). We review constitutional and legal claims <em>de novo. Debeato v. Attorney Gen., </em>505 F.3d 231, (3d Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Factual and discretionary findings of the agency are reviewed under the familiar substantial evidence standard. <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 247-48 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), an alien cannot apply for asylum unless he/ she can demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d This requirement is excused where the alien can demonstrate a change in circumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances that relate to the delay in filing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The IJ determined that Laurens\u2019 asylum application was untimely and that such filing was not legally excused, and the BIA affirmed. Although Laurens does not directly challenge this determination, he argues that the requirement of providing clear and convincing evidence that the application for asylum is filed within one year violates his substantive due process right and equal protection rights. The argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Suk-wanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">To the extent Laurens argues that his right to \u201cequal protection\u201d has been violated, that argument is also without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe fact that all persons, aliens and citizens alike, are protected by the Due Process Clause does not [mean] that all aliens are entitled to all of the advantages of citizenship____\u201d <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 78, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976). Nor does it establish that \u201call aliens must be placed in a single homogeneous legal classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The INA applies the same standard to all applications for asylum, and there is therefore no disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">Laurens also challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal. Although the exact nature of his challenge is not clear, Laurens appears to be challenging the agency\u2019s determination that he has not suffered past persecution. He claims that he has submitted evidence of past persecution entitling him a rebutta-ble presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-16\">Because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination this claim must also fail. Laurens testified to being robbed several times, and suffering minor physical injuries on one occasion. He also reported some disparate treatment at work, which he believes was on account of his Christian beliefs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the BIA and the IJ that these incidents do not rise to the level of persecution, nor is it clear that the incidents of street crime bore any connection to his religion or the required governmental nexus. The BIA properly explained that \u201c[t]he term \u2018persecution\u2019 means \u2018extreme behavior, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>threats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom. This definition does not include all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d App. at 3 (quoting <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 214, 217 (3d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Finally, Laurens has not demonstrated that the agency was unreasonable in rejecting his claim that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 537 (3d Cir.2005). The record simply does not substantiate Laurens\u2019 alleged fear of future persecution. It contains only his testimony, uncorroborated by State Department Country Reports. Moreover, because he has not established that the mistreatment he complains of was the result of government action or acquiescence, he has not satisfied his evidentiary burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Laurens\u2019 brief does not provide any separate analysis of the CAT claim. However, based on our review of the record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that he has not shown he is more likely than not to be tortured upon his return to Indonesia. <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182-83 (3d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Laurens\u2019 petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">. Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties, we need not set forth the facts or procedural history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\">. Petitioner asserts in conclusory fashion that the one-year filing requirement \"violated the equal protection of laws as it denied Petitioner a right which is otherwise available to persons similarly situated.\u201d He fails to identify the similarly situated group required to establish that he has received disparate treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-18\">. The immigration judge found Laurens\u2019 testimony to be credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
