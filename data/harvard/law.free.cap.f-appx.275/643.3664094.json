Kozlov was ordered removed based on this conviction. In opposing removal, Kozlov makes three arguments. We find each argument unavailing and deny Kozlov\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"At9Q\">First, Kozlov challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he is deportable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, as an alien \u201cconvicted of a crime ... for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.\u201d He argues that the BIA should have determined whether \u201ca sentence of one year or longer may be imposed\u201d for his crime by looking the maximum sentence allowed in his case under Washington\u2019s mandatory sentencing guidelines. This argument is foreclosed by clear circuit precedent. In determining the maximum penalty that may be imposed for a state crime under the categorical approach, we look to the state statutory maximum provided for that crime in general, not the applicable sentencing range in a particular case. <em>See United, States v. Parry, </em>479 F.3d 722, 724-25 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>422 F.3d 1152, 1153 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Rusz v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">Second, Kozlov argues that the BIA did not adequately review the IJ\u2019s determination that Kozlov was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A), and hence ineligible to petition for readjustment of status, as an alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude for which \u201cthe maximum penalty possible ... exceeded] imprisonment for one year.\u201d The BIA stated that it found \u201cno reversible error\u201d in the IJ\u2019s determination that Kozlov was inadmissible under \u00a7 1 182(a)(2)(A). This summary affirmance was sufficient under <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). The BIA was also correct to agree with the IJ on the merits because there is no principled basis for distinguishing between the relevant statutory maxima under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae and \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Finally, Kozlov argues that the BIA abused its discretion by refusing to remand his case to the IJ so that he could reapply for asylum. A remand was warranted, Kozlov maintains, because he withdrew his previous asylum application based on representations by the IJ and the government that he would be eligible to petition for adjustment of status. This contention is not supported by the record. Prior to Kozlov\u2019s decision to withdraw his asylum application, the IJ warned, \u201cI just have no idea whether he\u2019s eligible for adjustment\u201d and the government filed a written motion arguing that Kozlov was not eligible to adjust status.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
