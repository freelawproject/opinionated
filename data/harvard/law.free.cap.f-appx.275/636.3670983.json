Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), adopt or incorporate any of the reasons cited by the IJ in its decision. <em>Plasencia-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 738, 743 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere the BIA conducts a de novo review and issues its own decision, rather than adopting the IJ\u2019s decision as its own, we review the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d). Our review is therefore limited to the grounds on which the BIA explicitly relied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1184 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">The BIA\u2019s independent adverse credibility determination is not supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>by substantial evidence. <em>Rivera v. Muka-sey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1274 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe review adverse credibility findings under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d). The BIA noted for the first time on appeal that the return address on a letter submitted as corroborating evidence did not match the address on the author\u2019s residence card. However, the residence card was issued seven years before the letter was written, so the discrepancy does not reasonably lead to the inference that the letter was fabricated. Moreover, the IJ did not rely on this supposed inconsistency in his decision, and Lu was never given the opportunity to explain why the addresses differed. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s reliance on this ground violated Lu\u2019s due process rights. <em>Campos-Sanchez v. INS, </em>164 F.3d 448, 450 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[Due process requires] that the BIA ... provide a petitioner with a reasonable opportunity to offer an explanation of any perceived inconsistencies that form the basis of a denial of asylum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The BIA also impermissibly relied upon pure speculation when it concluded that Lu would have been unable to escape China \u201cwithout incident\u201d using his own \u201cvalidly issued passport and visa.\u201d <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cSpeculation and conjecture cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding, which must instead be based on substantial evidence.\u201d). Lu testified three times that he was put \u201cunder surveillance\u201d after being arrested and beaten for practicing Falun Gong, but the government never inquired about what form this surveillance took. Nothing in the record suggests that Lu was under such heavy surveillance that he would necessarily be apprehended when he escaped from China.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The government concedes that the BIA\u2019s third basis for its adverse credibility finding \u2014 Lu\u2019s failure to seek asylum in Japan during his twenty-four-hour stopover on the way to the United States \u2014 \u201cis really only one of opinion, and not supported by any independent evidence.\u201d Moreover, we have specifically held that a petitioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to apply for asylum in any of the countries through which he passed ... prior to his arrival in the United States does not provide a valid basis for questioning the credibility of his persecution claims.\u201d <em>Damaize-Job v. INS, </em>787 F.2d 1332, 1337 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also Ding v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 1131, 1140 (9th Cir.2004) (finding \u201cno basis\u201d to assume \u201cthat an individual who truly fears persecution in his homeland will automatically seek asylum in the first country in which he arrives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Finally, the BIA relied on the lack of corroborating evidence as to Lu\u2019s continuing Falun Gong practice in the United States. However, \u201cwhen each of the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s proffered reasons for an adverse credibility finding fails, we must accept a petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible\u201d and additional corroboration is generally not required. <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004). In rare cases, the failure to produce \u201cnon-duplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence,\u201d without any credible explanation for such failure, can support an inference that the evidence would have discredited the petitioner, <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000), but this narrow exception to the general rule does not apply here. Lu volunteered corroborating evidence, the veracity of which the BIA did not challenge, that he had practiced Falun Gong in China, so any further corroboration would have been duplicative. Moreover, when asked why he did not bring his roommates to corroborate his current practice in the United States, Lu responded, \u201cI never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>thought of that. I can ask them to come.\u201d That Lu was insufficiently prescient about the type of additional corroborating evidence the IJ would require fails to justify an inference that his roommates would have testified unfavorably or that Lu is not currently practicing Falun Gong, especially given that he offered to have them come testify as soon as the government attorney brought it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Because none of the BIA\u2019s proffered grounds supports its adverse credibility determination, we must take Lu\u2019s testimony at face value. <em>Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 890. Lu testified that, as a direct result of his Falun Gong practice, he was detained, beaten, electrically shocked, dragged into a courtyard, and tied to a tree for three hours. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 720-21 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners constitutes persecution both on the basis of spiritual and religious belief and on the basis of political opinion). Because the BIA never reached the issue, we remand this matter for a determination of whether, accepting Lu\u2019s testimony as credible, he is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1164, 1172 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. Not only does the dissent refuse to limit its review to the grounds upon which the BIA relied, it would uphold the adverse credibility determination under reasoning relied upon by neither the BIA <em>nor the IJ. </em>This is plainly contrary to well-established Ninth Circuit precedent. <em>Marcos v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir.2005) (\"Our review [of an IJ's adverse credibility determination] focuses only on the actual reasons relied upon by the IJ.\"); <em>Kaurv. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004) (\"[W]hen each of the IJ\u2019s or BIA's proffered reasons for an adverse credibility finding fails, we must accept a petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">The IJ did not rely on <em>any </em>of the alleged inconsistencies that the dissent would use to uphold the adverse credibility determination. The IJ never mentioned the different addresses, postal codes, and phone numbers in Lu's employment records, nor did the IJ note any inconsistency in Lu\u2019s asylum application regarding the date his passport was issued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The dissent's reliance on these supposed discrepancies is therefore misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b665-10\">LEIGHTON, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">This court is bound to review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence, and we should reverse only if our review of the record compels us to a conclusion contrary to that reached below. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by numerous material inconsistencies that go to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s claim for asylum. The IJ identified many of these contradictions in her oral decision, and the BIA affirmed in a brief order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> agreeing with the outcome reached by the IJ, implicitly incorporating her adverse credibility determination, and noting four specific inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s application that supported the IJ\u2019s original finding that the petitioner lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">In reaching its desired result here, the majority discards the IJ\u2019s reasoning in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>entirety, ignores the host of inconsistencies apparent in the record, acknowledges only the four discrepancies noted by the BIA in its brief order of affirmance, and deems the petitioner credible as a matter of law. Because I believe it is error to whisk away the IJ\u2019s original grounds for her adverse credibility determination, and because a review of the record reveals substantial and overwhelming evidence supporting that determination, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The petitioner claims he was persecuted because he used his position of power and his place of employment to facilitate Falun Gong practice; thus, where he worked is central to his version of why he was persecuted and fled. Yet the petitioner\u2019s proffered employment history is rife with inconsistencies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His motive for acquiring a passport and visa are similarly central, but the petitioner cannot reconcile the story he told in his application for asylum with the date of issue clearly inscribed on his passport.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These discrepancies constitute substantial evidence. Especially when taken together, they are more than sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir.2006) (a single supported ground for an adverse credibility determination is sufficient if it goes to the heart of the claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The majority disregards these incongruities because they were not cataloged by the BIA in its two-page brief order, and because the BIA\u2019s order does not \u201cexpressly adopt\u201d or \u201cexpressly incorporate\u201d the IJ\u2019s opinion. To support this proposition, the majority cites our inapposite opinions in <em>Andia v. Ashcroft </em>(reviewing denial of motion to re-open) and <em>Plasencia-Ayala v. Mukasey </em>(appeal from <em>de novo </em>review by BIA three-member panel), neither of which deals with an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">In this case, the BIA\u2019s order reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">We agree with the outcome reached by the Immigration Judge. The respondent has failed to meet his burden of credibly showing past persecution and a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution on account of a protected ground if removed to China. In this regard, we note that the respondent failed to satisfactorily establish the source of a letter from Li Bai where the addresses provided on her resident identification card and accompanying envelope are not consistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>(internal citations omitted). While this language is no model of clarity, the BIA\u2019s intent to adopt the IJ\u2019s credibility determination cannot reasonably be disputed\u2014 irrespective of whether the BIA ever uttered the magic word \u201cadopt\u201d or referenced by name its decision in <em>Burbano. </em>Indeed, the petitioner\u2019s own lawyer conceded at oral argument that the BIA had \u201cessentially adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s findings and then added their own.\u201d Where \u201cthe BIA appears to have adopted the IJ\u2019s reasons for h[er] negative credibility finding, we look to the IJ\u2019s decision for further guidance as to the basis of the BIA determination.\u201d Garrovillas <em>v. I.N.S., </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1014 (9th Cir.1998). I would do so here, and because my review of the record fails to compel me to the conclusion that the petitioner <em>is </em>credible, I would deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\">. A BIA opinion may take one of three forms: (1) a <em>de novo </em>review and full explanation by a three-member panel, (2) a summary affirmance by a single member, or (3) a \u201cbrief order\u201d by a single member. <em>Uanreroro v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 1197, 1203-04 (10th Cir. 2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003. 1(e)(4)-(6) (describing the three options). Where, as here, the BIA\u2019s order is drafted by a single member, but lacks the language of an affirmance without opinion, it is of the third, \"brief order\u201d variety. <em>See Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1279 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Thus, contrary to the majority's assumption, the BIA\u2019s order in this case does not constitute <em>de novo </em>review; in fact, the BIA cannot and does not review credibility determinations <em>de novo. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003. l(d)(3)(i); <em>Abdel-Rahman v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 444, 448 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Chen v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, </em>470 F.3d 509, 513 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201d[T]he BIA is no longer permitted to engage in de novo review of an IJ\u2019s factual findings.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">I believe that where the BIA utilizes a brief order and incorporates the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we should continue to examine the IJ's reasons for deeming the applicant not credible. This common sense approach comports with those employed by our sister circuits when reviewing brief orders. <em>See, e.g., De Quan Zheng v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>200 Fed.Appx. 66, 67 (2d Cir.2006) (\"Where, as here, the BIA affirms an IJ's decision by \"brief order\u201d pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5), we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly along with any supplemental reasoning provided by the BIA.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\">. The petitioner\u2019s supporting documents contain no less than six different names, two different street addresses, two different postal codes, and three different phone numbers\u2014 all purportedly belonging to the same company. The majority is technically correct that the IJ never mentioned these specific inconsistencies; rather, based on the \u201cdiscrepancies within the documentation itself,\u201d the IJ concluded that <em>all </em>of these documents were probably fake.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\">. In his application, the petitioner claims to have obtained his passport after he was arrested and tortured in March 2001, but the passport was issued in January 2001. Perhaps realizing his mistake, the petitioner changed his story and testified at his removal hearing that he originally acquired his passport for the purpose of visiting his son in Russia. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination contains the following summary of this amended tale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">The respondent states that he received his passport to come to the United States two months prior to any of his arrests or persecution, because he wanted to go visit his son in Russia for study purposes. When the respondent was successful in obtaining his passport in January of 2001, however, he did not go visit his son. He, instead, chose to come to the United States.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-14\">. Additionally, the IJ cited inherent implausibilities in the petitioner's testimony, a lack of readily available corroborating evidence, and the incredible contents of supporting affidavits (a conclusion which she supported by referencing the country report).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
