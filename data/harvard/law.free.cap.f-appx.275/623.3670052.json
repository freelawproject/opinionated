Harry Anthony Ward presents two certified issues and one uncertified issue in his appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">I. <em>Certified Issue: Whether the Use of Physical Restraints at Trial Violated Petitioner\u2019s Right to Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">The use of physical restraints on a criminal defendant during trial is an \u201cinherently prejudicial practice\u201d that \u201cshould be permitted only where justified by an essential state interest specific to each trial.\u201d <em>Holbrook v. Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 568-69, 106 S.Ct. 1340, 89 L.Ed.2d 525 (1986). As the California Court of Appeal found, no essential state interest justified the use of a \u201cstealth belt\u201d to restrain Ward where he had no history of violence or disruptive behavior while in custody, he had previously been tried unrestrained before the same court without incident, and he had not made any threat to disrupt court proceedings. We agree with the Court of Appeal that use of the stealth belt violated Ward\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-17\">On federal habeas review, an unjustified decision to restrain a defendant at trial is subject to the harmless error analysis of <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). <em>See Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 591-93 (9th Cir.2004). The California Court of Appeal concluded that the erroneous use of physical restraints during Ward\u2019s trial was \u201cunequivocally harmless\u201d because those restraints were not visible to the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 592-93. The state court proceeding did not \u201cresult[] in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cin a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Ward is not entitled to habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II. <em>Certified Issue: Whether Petitioner is Entitled to an Evidentiary Hearing on Issue I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In general, a habeas petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing \u201c[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). The record does not support Ward\u2019s contentions that: (1) the jury could have inferred that Ward was restrained even though the stealth belt was not visible; or (2) the use of physical restraints impaired Ward\u2019s mental faculties, his ability to communicate with counsel and his ability to participate in his defense. Ward does not assert \u201ca factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d or that \u201cwould be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ward is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">III. <em>Uncertified Issue: Whether an Alleged Relationship Between a Juror and a Prosecution Witness Deprived Petitioner of an Impartial Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">A Certificate of Appealability may issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2); <em>see also </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e). Ward\u2019s vague allegations that an unnamed juror was an acquaintance of a prosecution witness are insufficient to establish a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d We decline to address the uncerti-fied issue. Ward is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to develop insubstantial factual allegations. <em>See Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1940, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Ward\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
