MacKenzie, trustee for the bankruptcy estate of Wavo Corporation, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit against certain former directors and officers of Wavo, their spouses, and a company owned by Wavo\u2019s former chief executive (collectively, \u201cDeeds\u201d). The parties are familiar with the facts; we proceed to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Deeds fails to persuade that the trustee\u2019s appeal is untimely. The trustee\u2019s motion to the district court for reconsideration, whether or not procedurally valid, tolled the time for appeal from the original order of dismissal. <em>See, e.g., Feldman v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>322 F.3d 660, 665 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">We review the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, not its denial of the motion to reconsider. <em>See Oliva v. Sullivan, </em>958 F.2d 272, 273 (9th Cir.1992). We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Malone v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>833 F.2d 128, 130 (9th Cir. 1987). We will reverse only if we have \u201c \u2018a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir.1976) (quoting <em>In re Josephson, </em>218 F.2d 174 (1st Cir.1954)). When a district court dismisses a case as a sanction without explicitly discussing factors this court has laid out to guide such decisions, <em>see Thompson v. Hous. Auth. of City of Los Angeles, </em>782 F.2d 829, 831 (9th Cir.1986), \u201c \u2018we may review the record independently to determine if the district court has abused its discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Products Liability Litigation, </em>460 F.3d 1217, 1226 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir.1992) (as amended)).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">After independently reviewing the record, we do not have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment. It was the trustee\u2019s responsibility to move the case toward disposition. He did not do so. The untimely illness and death of the trustee\u2019s lead attorney, Anthony Lucia, does not excuse the trustee\u2019s lack of prosecution and failure to apprise the court of the status of the case. Despite being repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sented by a general counsel and four special counsel for this case, the trustee conducted minimal discovery in the nine months between entry of the scheduling order and the discovery deadline. The trustee did not move for an extension of the discovery deadline, although the deadline passed prior to Lucia\u2019s diagnosis. Following Lucia\u2019s death, the trustee did nothing to apprise the court that he could not meet the various deadlines set in the scheduling order, and did not move to vacate the trial date or to conduct a status conference until the district judge\u2019s judicial assistant had made at least two calls to the trustee\u2019s counsel in the weeks leading up to the trial date. Given these facts, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in dismissing the case for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
