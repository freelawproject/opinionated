The district court granted summary judgment in favor of each Defendant on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>claims. Church appeals the district court\u2019s order only as to the First Amendment retaliation claim. The parties are familiar with the facts, thus we proceed to the law. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We review de novo a grant of summary judgment. <em>Moreau v. Air France, </em>356 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cOur review is governed by the same standard used by the district court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).\u201d <em>Pool v. VanRheen, </em>297 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">To succeed on his First Amendment retaliation claim under \u00a7 1983, Church \u201cmust show (1) that he ... engaged in protected speech; (2) that [his] employer took adverse employment action; and (3) that his ... speech was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Coszalter v. City of Salem, </em>320 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">We agree with the district court that Church carried his burden as to elements one and two. However, we agree also with the district court that Church did not carry his burden as to element three \u2014 he did not provide a nexus between the protected speech and any adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
