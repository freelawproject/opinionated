Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Jiang\u2019s application for asylum was untimely because the underlying facts concerning Jiang\u2019s arrival date are disputed. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We lack jurisdiction over Jiang\u2019s due process translation claim because it was not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination based upon Jiang\u2019s demeanor while testifying because the IJ identified Jiang\u2019s hesitation and unresponsiveness with sufficient particularity to support the demeanor finding. <em>See Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003). Additionally, Jiang\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his application regarding the location and details of his second arrest. <em>See Li, </em>378 F.3d at 962-64. We therefore deny the petition with respect to Jiang\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the determination that Jiang failed to establish that he is eligible for CAT relief. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
