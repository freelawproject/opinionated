Flowers makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for a leadership role in the offense. Flowers argues that there was no evidence that he supervised five or more participants, directed or procured the aid of underlings, or that his status was anything more than that of a supplier or distributor. Second, Flowers argues that the district court erred because, once Flowers challenged his prior convictions at sentencing, the court should have directed the government to meet its burden of showing that Flowers\u2019s convictions were not misdemeanors, as Flowers had argued they were. Further, he argues that, but for the error, the district court would have departed for substantial assistance from a criminal history category II rather than III.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">I. Leadership Role under \u00a7 3B1.1(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-21\">\u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level due to his status as a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number><em>States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase in the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s aggravating role in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. A four-level increase is applied if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). In making the role-enhancement determination, the district court should consider several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1p\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). \u201cIn assessing whether an organization is \u2018otherwise extensive,\u2019 all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">\u201c[S]ection 3Bl.l(a)\u2019s plain language requires <em>both </em>a leadership role <em>and </em>an extensive operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1181 (11th Cir.1993). It requires \u201cthe exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, influence, or leadership,\u201d and a mere \u201cseller/buyer relationship\u201d or the defendant\u2019s status as a supplier is insufficient to justify imposition of an upward departure under \u00a7 3B1.1(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1182 (quoting <em>United States v. Brown, </em>944 F.2d 1377, 1385 (7th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">An \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d operation does not require a set number of criminally responsible participants. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir. 1994). However, to demonstrate that the defendant occupied a leadership role under the \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d standard, \u201cthere must be at least one participant in addition to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1045, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The record shows that Flowers was more than a mere supplier. He exercised decision-making authority and had a high degree of participation in the conspiracy, as well as extensive control and authority over others in what the district court properly found to be an \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d drug distribution conspiracy. The district court, therefore, did not commit clear error in imposing a four-level enhancement to Flowers\u2019s offense level based on his role in the conspiracy under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">II. Criminal History Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">We review issues raised for the first time on appeal using the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">Section 4A1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines states, in part, that to determine a criminal history category: (a) three points are added for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month; (b) two points are added for each prior sentence of at least 60 days\u2019 imprisonment; and (c) one point is added \u201cfor each prior sentence not counted in (a) or (b), up to a total of [four] points for this item.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a)-(c). \u201cPrior sentence\u201d means \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, ... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). \u201c[W]hen a defendant challenges a factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number><em>Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1300 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Section 4A1.3 (b)(1) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">If reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure <em>may </em>be warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l) (emphasis added). We do not normally review the district court\u2019s denial of a downward departure, except in cases where the district court incorrectly believed that it did not have the authority to depart. <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>358 F.3d 1278, 1279 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201c[W]e assume that the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward\u201d when the record does not indicate any ambivalence. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in failing to direct the government to meet its burden of showing that Flowers\u2019s prior convictions were not in fact misdemeanors or in its calculation of Flowers\u2019s criminal history category. Because the issue of whether Flowers\u2019s past offenses were misdemeanors was never in dispute, and because the district court properly applied \u00a7 4Al.l(c) of the guidelines to Flowers\u2019s prior convictions, there was no plain error. Further, we conclude that the district court properly exercised its discretion to deny Flowers a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm Flowers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
