He alleged that two officers verbally abused and beat him during an excessive use of force incident. He further alleged that after that incident, prison officials showed a deliberate indifference to his serious need for medical care. Johnson asserted that, as a result of his confrontation with the two officers, he was wrongfully charged with disciplinary ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tions and that he was denied the due process of law in conjunction with the hearing held on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Johnson now appeals. We review Johnson\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1231, 170 L.Ed.2d 63 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Johnson argues that the district court erred in concluding that he had not been denied due process in conjunction with his disciplinary proceeding. However, his argument fails to address the district court\u2019s determination that his due process claim was not cognizable in his \u00a7 1983 complaint and should have been brought in a habeas corpus proceeding. Johnson\u2019s disagreement with the care provided by Dr. Mai Tran on March 17, 2005, does not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 cause of action, nor does unsuccessful medical treatment, negligence, neglect, or medical malpractice. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). The district court therefore did not err in dismissing these claims under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See In re Katrina Canal, </em>495 F.3d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Johnson argues that the district court failed to consider his request that his federal claims be stayed pending the outcome of his state litigation of his claims. That request was raised for the first time in Johnson\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Given the length of time that had passed between the filing of Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint and his request for a stay, the pendency of the defendants\u2019 dismissal motion, and Johnson\u2019s failure to demonstrate why he did not seek a stay of his federal claims earlier, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the stay request. <em>See Hines v. D\u2019Artois, </em>531 F.2d 726, 733 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The district court did not err when it dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Johnson\u2019s appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), and is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim constitute two strikes for purposes of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) bar. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). Johnson has at least two other strikes. <em>Johnson v. Flores, </em>No. 04-30038 (5th Cir. July 29, 2004). Johnson has accumulated three strikes, and he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
