In her petition for review, Pierre argues that the BIA erred by affirming the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), who rejected Pierre\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as a basis for reopening her removal proceedings. Pierre also argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance while she sought adjustment of her immigration status. After careful review, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"apr-dedup-0\">The relevant facts are straightfoiward. Pierre arrived in the United States on May 22, 2006, when she attempted to enter this country by presenting a fraudulent admission stamp and a counterfeit Haitian passport. On June 9, 2006, she was charged with removability from the United States pursuant to Sections 212(a)(6)(C)(i) and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), (a)(7)(A)(i)(I). On July 21, 2006, Pierre conceded removability and was paroled into the United States for the purpose of pursuing asylum. She did not file a timely asylum application. On January 11, 2007, the IJ denied Pierre\u2019s request for a continuance. The IJ cited his earlier order, dated September 7, 2006, warning Pierre that her request for asylum would be deemed abandoned unless she filed it on or before January 11, 2007. The IJ subsequently clarified that a continuance was not warranted pending an adjudication of Pierre\u2019s husband\u2019s visa petition by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), because, as an arriving alien, Pierre was ineligible for an adjustment of status based on her husband\u2019s visa petition. The IJ also rejected Pierre\u2019s argument to reopen the proceedings, based on ineffective assistance of counsel, because she failed to comply with the requirements for such a claim, as set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen a removal order for abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>cretion. <em>Contreras-Rodnguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1316 (llth Cir. 2006). When the BIA issues its own opinion, we review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (llth Cir.2007). We review the denial of a motion for continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Haswanee v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>471 F.3d 1212, 1214 (llth Cir.2006). \u201cThe Immigration Judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In general, an alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal and the motion to reopen needs to state the new facts that will be proven at the hearing and provide all supporting affidavits or other evidence. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). An alien also can move to reopen her removal proceedings on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, but the alien must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing such that the alien was unable to reasonably present her case. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (llth Cir. 2005). The BIA has adopted the following requirements for a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-5\">... (1) that the motion [to reopen] be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard, (2) that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned be informed of the allegations leveled against him and be given an opportunity to respond, and (3) that the motion reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel\u2019s ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-7\"><em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 637 (BIA 1988). In addition to these requirements, a petition must show prejudice, which exists \u201cwhen the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">In her motion to reopen, Pierre argued that she received erroneous advice from her attorney concerning the time for filing her asylum application. To the motion to reopen, she attached an application for asylum and withholding of removal. Pierre\u2019s submission did not establish, or so much as suggest, that, but for the allegedly mistaken advice from her attorney as to the time for filing an asylum application, the <em>outcome </em>of her original asylum request would have been different. That is to say, she did not demonstrate prejudice, within the meaning of <em>Dakane. </em>Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by affirming the denial of her motion to reopen because the motion did not meet the requirements for demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Pierre\u2019s second argument, that the IJ erred by denying her request for a continuance while she sought adjustment of her immigration status through her husband\u2019s visa petition proceedings before the US-CIS. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2, which governs the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction over adjustments of status,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-10\">In the case of an arriving alien who is placed in removal proceedings, the immigration judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by the arriving alien unless: (A) [t]he alien properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>filed the application for adjustment of status with USCIS while the arriving alien was in the United States; (B) [t]he alien departed from and returned to the United States pursuant to the terms of a grant of advance parole to pursue the previously filed application for adjustment of status; (C) [t]he application for adjustment of status was denied by US-CIS; and (D) DHS placed the arriving alien in removal proceedings either upon the arriving alien\u2019s return to the United States pursuant to the grant of advance parole or after USCIS denied the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">When she filed her motion for a continuance, Pierre was an \u201carriving alien ... placed in removal proceedings,\u201d to which none of the exceptions enumerated in \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii) applied. Therefore, the IJ was without jurisdiction to address her adjustment-of-status claim. Pursuant to Section 1245.2(a)(l)(ii), the authority to adjudicate such a claim is vested exclusively in the USCIS in the case of arriving aliens in removal proceedings. <em>See Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1254 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the appropriate course of action for Pierre was to file an application for adjustment of status with the USCIS and wait for this application to be adjudicated, <em>independent </em>of her removal proceedings. The pendency of Pierre\u2019s husband\u2019s visa application before the US-CIS proceedings was not a basis for continuing her removal proceedings because, due to \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar, the immigration courts have no jurisdiction over adjustment applications filed by aliens in Pierre\u2019s position. Thus, even if her husband\u2019s visa petition was approved by the USCIS, her adjustment-of-status application could not be adjudicated in the immigration courts. <em>Id. </em>(holding that where immigration court had no jurisdiction over arriving alien\u2019s adjustment application, continuance was not warranted because there was \u201cno possibility that [petitioner\u2019s] adjustment application would be adjudicated during removal proceedings\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not err by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-11\">. We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Because Pierre presented her core issue on appeal \u2014 the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim argument-to both the IJ and the BIA, she has exhausted her administrative remedies as to the claim, and we have jurisdiction over her petition for review. <em>See Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008) (where petitioner consistently argued, before the IJ and the BIA, the <em>core </em>issue on appeal, petitioner exhausted her claims and sufficient jurisdiction existed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. Pierre\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>Bull v. I.N.S., </em>790 F.2d 869, 871 (11th Cir.1986), in which we found an abuse of discretion based on the IJ's denial of a continuance where the petition was awaiting a determination on his wife's 1-130 petition. The petitioner in <em>Bull </em>arrived in the United States on a student visa and overstayed his visa. He married a United States citizen prior to his arrest by the I.N.S. and sought a continuance while his wife\u2019s I-130 petition was pending. Notably, unlike this instant case, <em>Bull </em>did not involve an arriving alien and thus a different set of regulations controlled and, more importantly, the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1245.2(a)(l)(ii) were inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
