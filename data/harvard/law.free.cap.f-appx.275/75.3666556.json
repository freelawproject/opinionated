We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-23\">Resilard contends that his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-24\">Procedural Reasonableness. A sentencing court must: (1) determine the Sentencing Guidelines range, then (2) consider the Guidelines range, along with the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-27\">Resilard argues that the district court improperly included a two-level enhancement for numerosity of victims. Resilard forfeited this argument by waiving any factual objection to the PSR, which stated that the offense involved more than ten victims. We thus do not consider the argument on appeal. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Soliman, </em>889 F.2d 441, 445 (2d Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-28\">Resilard contends that the sentencing court neglected to consider his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), when determining his sentence because Judge Jones did not comment on Resilard\u2019s work history and reputation in the community. Because Resilard failed to object on that ground at sentencing, we review for plain error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>See United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 128 (2d Cir.2008). \u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006), and \u201cthat the sentencing judge has considered all arguments properly presented to her,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29. Resilard identifies no record evidence to overcome either of those presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Substantive Reasonableness. \u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. We see no reason to conclude that Resilard\u2019s sentence, which fell below the Guidelines range, was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
