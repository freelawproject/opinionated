After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b858-19\">Straw, a native and citizen of Jamaica, was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1979, when he was fifteen years old. In 1986, Straw was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and carrying a firearm without a license and was deported to Jamaica.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1989, Straw was convicted of illegally reentering the United States, served a 180-day sentence and was deported. In 1993, Straw was again convicted of illegal reentry and was given a 46-month sentence, after which he was deported a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-20\">In February 2007, Straw was discovered inside the United States while Boarder Patrol agents and the Drug Enforcement Administration were conducting a controlled delivery of marijuana. Straw was a passenger in a truck that arrived to pick up the crate containing the marijuana. Straw was questioned and claimed to be a lawful permanent resident named Richard Grant. Although Straw was not charged in connection with the marijuana, he was taken into custody for failing to carry a certificate of alien registration. A check of Straw\u2019s fingerprints revealed his true identity and immigration history.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-21\">Straw pled guilty to one count of having been found in the United States after having been previously removed and without the consent of the Attorney General. Straw\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended, among other things, a 16-level increase in Straw\u2019s offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because Straw previously had been convicted of a crime of violence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Straw did not object to this or any other guidelines calculations in the PSI. The PSI calculated an advisory guidelines range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. In addition, Straw was subject to a twenty-year statutory maximum sentence, rather than a two-year statutory maximum sentence, because his removal had been subsequent to a conviction that was an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s advisory guidelines calculations and, after hearing arguments from the parties, imposed a 50-month sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Straw filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Straw argues that the district court committed plain error when it enhanced his sentence based on prior convictions that were neither alleged in his indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as Straw admits, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Toms v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We repeatedly have explained that, even after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Furthermore, at sentencing the district court did not resolve any disputed facts related to Straw\u2019s prior convictions. Straw did not object to the prior convictions listed in his PSI or dispute the PSI\u2019s factual accuracy and thus admitted the existence of those convictions for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that there is no statutory <em>Booker </em>error where the defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts to which the defendant did not object in the PSI at sentencing); <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005). Therefore, the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, in using Straw\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">Straw also argues that his 50-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Straw, the district court placed too much emphasis on his criminal history and repeated illegal reentries into the United States to the exclusion of mitigating factors, such as the presence of his family in, and his cultural assimilation into, the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). In arriving at a reasonable sentence, the district court must correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range and consider that advisory guidelines range and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>1189-90; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our review for substantive reasonableness is also guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. We will remand for resentencing only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">At Straw\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government argued for a sentence above the advisory guidelines range based on Straw\u2019s criminal history. Among other things, the government argued that the prior 46-month sentence for illegal reentry had not deterred Straw from reentering the United States a third time and that a higher sentence was necessary to ensure deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Straw argued for a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range based on his family ties in the United States and his own cultural assimilation. Straw argued that he was being punished for merely trying to be with his children and provide for them and that the public did not need to be protected from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The district court acknowledged that there was \u201csome appeal\u201d to Straw\u2019s argument in mitigation, but also noted that Straw had illegally reentered the United States on three occasions and had committed several other crimes. In response, Straw pointed out that other than his illegal reentry offenses, all of his crimes occurred over twenty years ago when he was</p>\n<p id=\"aye-dedup-1\">22 years old or younger, and argued that his subsequent illegal reentry offenses were motivated by a desire to be with his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The district court considered a letter it received from Straw and Straw\u2019s statement to the court, both of which described the discrimination people face who have grown up in the United States and then are deported to Jamaica. The district court also heard a statement from Straw\u2019s wife, who described Straw\u2019s support for his family and the negative effect Straw\u2019s incarceration was having on his oldest son. The district court stated that it had considered \u201cthe statements of all parties, the presentence report ... and the statutory factors\u201d and imposed a 50-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The record indicates that the district court did not disregard mitigating factors in arriving at Straw\u2019s sentence. In fact, the district court expressly considered Straw\u2019s arguments in mitigation, including his family ties and cultural assimilation, and concluded that they were outweighed by Straw\u2019s recidivism and criminal history. This is Straw\u2019s third illegal reentry offense, and his prior 46-month sentence did not deter the instant offense. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or that it abused its discretion in imposing a 50-month sentence at the high end of the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-16\">. Straw was also convicted of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in 1981. The parties agreed that two 1982 convictions had since been vacated, and the district court stated that it would not consider the 1982 vacated convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. At sentencing, the district court denied the government\u2019s request for an upward departure from the advisory guidelines range. That ruling is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b859-11\">. Because Straw did not raise this sentencing issue in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v.
