SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b119-22\">Luis O. Guiracocha, a native and citizen of Ecuador, entered the United States via Mexico in 1991 without inspection. In February of 2006, he pleaded guilty in the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey to criminal sexual contact with a fifteen year-old minor in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:14-3b. Thereafter, he was served with a Notice to Appear charging him as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae for entering without inspection, and under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae for committing a crime of moral turpitude. Guiracocha applied for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a, and moved to terminate the removal proceeding, arguing that the offense of conviction was not a crime involving moral turpitude. An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied the motion to terminate and determined that Guiracocha was ineligible for cancellation of removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. This timely petition for review followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Guiracocha contends that his offense of conviction does not constitute a crime of moral turpitude under \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). Although \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d is not defined by statute, in <em>Partyka v. Attorney General of United States, </em>417 F.3d 408, 413 (3d Cir.2005), we acknowledged that the BIA had defined the term \u201cas conduct that is inherently base, vile, or depraved, contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed other persons, either individually or to society in general.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">A longstanding test employed by the BIA to determine the existence of moral turpitude, which we find persuasive in a removal proceeding, asks \u201cwhether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or corrupt mind.\u201d Accordingly, the Board has repeatedly \u201cheld that \u2018evil intent\u2019 is a requisite element for a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">417 F.3d at 413 (internal citations omitted). In addition, we noted that we had approved of the BIA\u2019s alternate approach that \u201cfound moral turpitude to inhere in serious crimes committed recklessly, <em>ie., </em>with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that serious injury or death would follow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. We declared that \u201c[u]nder either standard, the hallmark of moral turpitude is a reprehensible act committed with an appreciable level of consciousness or deliberation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Here, Guiracocha contends that his offense of conviction was not a crime of moral turpitude. Because the parties agree that the statute of conviction is divisible, <em>see Partyka, </em>417 F.3d at 411, we must \u201clook to the record of conviction to determine whether the alien was convicted under that part of the statute defining a crime involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the indictment charged that Guira-cocha \u201cdid commit sexual contact upon J.T., fifteen years old, by intentionally touching/masturbating his penis, for the purpose of degrading or humiliating the victim or to sexually arouse or sexually gratify the actor\u201d in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:14-3b. (AR 244). Guiracocha pleaded guilty to that offense on December 17, 2005, admitting that he touched his penis in front of the fifteen year-old to \u201cfeel good\u201d and to gratify himself sexually. This is sufficient to establish that Guiraco-cha\u2019s offense of conviction was a \u201creprehensible act committed with an appreciable level of consciousness,\u201d thereby constituting a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Guiracocha also asserts that the facts in his case fail to support a conviction under a strict reading of the statute, that the photographic lineup was constitutionally infirm, that the grand jury proceeding was flawed, and that the state court erred in denying his post-conviction relief claim. For these reasons, Guiracocha submits that he should not be found deportable for committing a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">In short, Guiracocha is attacking the validity of his state conviction. Section 1252(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes judicial review of a \u201cfinal order of <em>removal.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) (emphasis added). The grant of jurisdiction in \u00a7 1252(a) does not establish a mechanism for collateral attack upon an underlying state criminal conviction. <em>See Bagot v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 252, 266 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Drakes v. I.N.S., </em>330 F.3d 600 (3d Cir.2003)); <em>see also Vargas v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>451 F.3d 1105, 1107 (10th Cir.2006) (reiterating that a \u201c \u2018petitioner cannot collaterally attack the legitimacy of his state criminal convictions in the deportation proceedings\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Trench v. I.N.S., </em>783 F.2d 181, 183 (10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Cir.1986)); <em>Ortega de Robles v. I.N.S., </em>58 F.3d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir.1995) (instructing that \u201c[cjriminal convictions cannot be collaterally attacked in deportation proceedings\u201d); <em>Mansoori v. I.N.S., </em>32 F.3d 1020, 1023-24 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Gouveia v. I.N.S., </em>980 F.2d 814, 817 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Zinnanti v. I.N.S., </em>651 F.2d 420, 421 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam); <em>Aguilera-Enriquez v. I.N.S., </em>516 F.2d 565, 570 (6th Cir.1975). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the validity of Guiracoeha\u2019s state conviction, which is the basis for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For the above reasons, we will deny the petition for review. As previously noted, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is also denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-15\">. The IJ exercised jurisdiction over the removal proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.2(b). The BIA had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b). As the government concedes, we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). For that reason, we deny the government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, which was referred to us by the motions panel. We exercise plenary review over the legal question of whether a criminal offense constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>crime of moral turpitude for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i). <em>Partyka v. Attorney General of United States, </em>417 F.3d 408, 411 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
