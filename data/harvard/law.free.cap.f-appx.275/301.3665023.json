(the \u201cJones family\u201d) appeal the District Court order granting the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants-Appellees State of Louisiana and Nichole Dupree (together \u201cState\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The Jones family requested occupational therapy for their developmentally delayed son through the State\u2019s Early Steps Program. Early Steps is an intervention program under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d) administered by the Department of Health and Hospitals (\u201cDHH\u201d) and managed by Nichole Dupree (\u201cDupree\u201d). The State provided the occupational therapy for a time, but ceased providing the therapy on a consistent basis when BJ.\u2019s therapist resigned. The Jones family filed two formal, written complaints in compliance with the State\u2019s \u201cinitiating formal complaint\u201d process. The State responded to the Jones family\u2019s complaint, maintaining it had not violated the IDEA. The Jones family should have requested a due process hearing next,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but instead they sued the State under the IDEA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Louisiana Children with Exceptionalities Act, and the Louisiana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The District Court dismissed the Jones family\u2019s claims, finding that the Jones family had failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the IDEA. Thus, the District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the case. The District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Jones family\u2019s state law claims, and also held that no independent jurisdictional basis supported the remaining federal law claims. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that the Jones family failed to exhaust the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">We review a District Court decision dismissing a case under to Rule 12(b) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>de novo. Pacheco v. Mineta, </em>448 F.3d 783, 788 (5th Cir.2006) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>a District Court determination of whether employees had exhausted administrative remedies in an employment discrimination action). \u201cIn our <em>de novo </em>review ... we apply the same standard as [did] the [District [C]ourt: [A] claim may not be dismissed unless it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.\u201d <em>Bombardier Aerospace Employee Welfare Benefits Plan v. Ferrer, Poirot, and Wansbrough, </em>354 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we will affirm only if the Jones family cannot prove any set of facts to support their claim which would entitle them relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The Jones family first argues that they were unaware of the exhaustion requirement because the information provided by the State regarding the complaint process merely indicated that a party <em>may </em>initiate a due process hearing but did not mandate that such a hearing was <em>required </em>before filing suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Jones family\u2019s contention that they did not know of the IDEA\u2019S requirement to exhaust all its administrative remedies is not a valid excuse. <em>See Ashton v. United States, </em>404 F.2d 95, 95-96 (8th Cir.1968) (stating \u201cfailure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Selective Service Act ... cannot be lightly discarded by a simple plea of procedural ignorance\u201d); <em>Castro v. Crawfoot, </em>102 Fed.Appx. 852, 854 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished opinion) (\u201c[I]gnoranee of the law will not relieve Castro of his obligation to exhaust the available administrative remedies.\u201d). Therefore, we reject the Jones family\u2019s first argument. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Jones family also contends that even if they had known of the exhaustion requirement, it would have been futile for them to exhaust the remaining IDEA administrative remedies: requesting a due process hearing, and if dissatisfied with the results, appealing the hearing to the state educational agency. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)-(g). \u201cIt is true that judicial review is normally not available under [the IDEA] until all administrative proceedings are completed, but as [the Supreme Court] previously [has] noted, parents may bypass the administrative process where exhaustion would be futile or inadequate.\u201d <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 326-27, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). The Jones family bears the burden of proving that administrative review would be futile or inadequate. <em>See Gardner v. Sch. Bd. Caddo Parish, </em>958 F.2d 108, 111-12 (5th Cir. 1992). Even if the Jones family could prove that a portion of the required administrative review would be futile, i.e. the due process hearing, they must prove that an appeal of the hearing to the state administrative agency would be futile as well. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The Jones family has not met <em>their burden </em>to prove their futility argument. The Jones family failed to request an impartial due process hearing and hinges their futility argument on their dissatisfaction with the State\u2019s response to their two formal, written complaint letters. IDEA allows us to review the administrative proceedings, including the evidentiary due process hearing, but does not provide for us to act as the first hearing body. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C). We agree with the District Court in this case that the state education agency is best situated to hear and resolve IDEA complaints. By failing to exhaust the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies, the Jones family did not give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>State an appropriate opportunity to resolve their complaints prior to filing suit against the State. <em>See Marvin H. v. In-dep. Sch. Dist., </em>714 F.2d 1348, 1358 (5th Cir.1983) (noting the procedural frameworks set out in the IDEA\u2019S predecessor, the EAHCA, allows parents and educators an opportunity to make joint decisions regarding a disabled child\u2019s education and focuses on a non-judicial resolution of conflicts).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Second Circuit considered this same futility issue and found that exhaustion may be bypassed in situations with <em>systematic </em>violations that a hearing officer would have no power to correct. <em>J.S. ex rel. N.S. v. Attica Cent. Sch., </em>386 F.3d 107, 113 (2d Cir.2004). In <em>J.S., </em>six students alleged special education deprivations such as: failure to provide an adequate Individualized Education Programs; access to certain areas of the school such as the cafeteria, music room, computer room, nurse\u2019s office, and swimming pool; and numerous other <em>systematic </em>violations. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12. The Second Circuit concluded exhaustion would be futile in this situation because of Attica\u2019s \u201ctotal failure to prepare and implement Individualized Education Programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. Therefore, the Court found this situation could not be remedied by a hearing officer in a due process hearing, and noted that if each Plaintiff were required to exhaust IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies, it could lead to inconsistent results. <em>See id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Jones family has not proffered sufficient evidence to support their futility argument and bypass the important administrative review process We find the analysis of the Second Circuit in <em>J.S. </em>to be instructive. <em>See J.S., </em>386 F.3d at 115; <em>see also Crawford v. Pittman, </em>708 F.2d 1028, 1033 n. 17 (5th Cir.1983) (stating that although the parties failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, even the state conceded resort to such remedies would have been futile because of the state\u2019s settled policy of disallowing special education programs longer than 180 days). Unlike the Plaintiffs in <em>J.S., </em>the Jones family produced no evidence that they experienced a <em>systematic </em>violation when B.J. failed to receive his occupational therapy on a consistent basis. <em>See J.S., </em>386 F.3d at 115. The Jones family also failed to show that a hearing officer would have been powerless to correct the alleged IDEA violation had they requested a due process hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 114. Finally, the Jones family does not challenge a settled state policy that could not be addressed through the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies. <em>See Crawford, </em>708 F.2d at 1033 n. 17. Therefore, we hold the Jones family does not fall within the futility exception, and, because they failed to exhaust all the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies, the District Court properly dismissed their case without prejudice. <em>See J.S., </em>386 F.3d at 115; <em>Crawford, </em>708 F.2d at 1033 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the District Court. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-12\">. After a party files a formal, written complaint with a local or state educational agency, as did the Jones family, the next procedural step is to request an impartial due process hearing if the party is not satisfied with the response to their complaint. See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f). If the party is dissatisfied with the results of the impartial due process hearing, the next procedural step is to appeal the results of the hearing to the state educational agency for an impartial review. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(g). Only after the party exhausts these administrative remedies may the aggrieved party bring a civil action in state or federal court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1415(Z).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. The Jones family does not dispute the fact that they failed to exhaust the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
