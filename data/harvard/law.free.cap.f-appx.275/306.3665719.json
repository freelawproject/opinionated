Marshall argues that the district court abused its discretion in imposing an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G \u00a7 4A1.3(a) based on an under-representation of his criminal history and a likelihood of recidivism. He contends that the district court\u2019s reasons for upwardly departing are inadequate and do not support a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">\u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 918, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Marshall\u2019s upward departure meets those criteria. The district court considered the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) and articulated the objectives served in imposing an upward departure. Marshall\u2019s similar prior offenses, his disregard for court orders, and the use of aliases signify a likelihood of recidivism. The district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
