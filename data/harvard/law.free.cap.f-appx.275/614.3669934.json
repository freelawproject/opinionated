The Board also noted the District Attorney\u2019s opposition to parole, and it found that Delaplane \u201cneeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>continued therapy in order to face, discuss, understand and cope with stress in a nondestructive manner\u201d and that he \u201ccontinues to be unpredictable and a threat to others\u201d in the absence of further progress. These findings are supported by the record, including Delaplane\u2019s continuing denial of the murder and including psychological evaluations, during a period of more than a decade, which characterized Dela-plane as manipulative. The Board thus relied on \u201csome evidence\u201d in support of its decision. <em>Biggs v. Terhune, </em>334 F.3d 910, 915 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">For this reason, it cannot be said that the California Supreme Court, in denying Delaplane\u2019s habeas petition, acted in a way that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). <em>Hayward v. Marshall, </em>512 F.3d 536 (9th Cir.2008), does not counsel otherwise for several reasons. Here, unlike in <em>Hayward, </em>the Board did not have \u201csuccessive favorable views of his application for release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Rather, the Board never has recommended parole. In <em>Hayward, </em>unlike in this case, the initial crime resulted from \u201cunusual provocation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 544, rather than from a calculated effort to silence a witness. And unlike Delaplane, \u201cHayward has accepted responsibility for his crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
