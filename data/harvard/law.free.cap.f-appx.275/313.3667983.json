Clayton appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>sion with intent to distribute cocaine. He argues that the district court plainly erred in upwardly departing from the advisory guidelines range by failing to provide fact-specific reasons for its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The record refutes Clayton\u2019s contention that the district court impermissibly relied on his arrest history in upwardly departing. The record instead discloses that Clayton engaged in ongoing criminal conduct of a serious nature, including drug and unlawful possession of a firearm crimes that were similar to the instant offense of conviction, conduct sufficient to support the district court\u2019s decision to upwardly depart from the advisory guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, cmt. (n.2(B)) (2006); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 329 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Additionally, Clayton\u2019s commission of the instant offense while on federal supervised release and the revocation of his state probation following a drug arrest were reliable facts from which the district court could infer that Clayton was likely to reoffend, also warranting an upward departure. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>Lee, </em>358 F.3d at 328-29. Clayton therefore has not established plain error on the part of the district court. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
