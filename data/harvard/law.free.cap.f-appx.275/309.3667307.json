Beman, federal prisoner # 83124-080, has applied for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal from the dismissal of his civil rights complaint as frivolous or malicious, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and because it asserted claims against parties who are immune from suit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). Beman\u2019s IFP application is construed as a challenge of the district court\u2019s decision decertifying Beman\u2019s IFP status on the ground that the appeal has not been taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-22\">In his complaint, Beman named as defendants Phillip Smith, Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) John Klassen, the State Bar of Texas (State Bar), Chief Disciplinary Counsel Dawn Miller, and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel Stephen Moyik. The district court determined that AUSA Klassen was entitled to absolute immunity from suit for his actions as a federal prosecutor; that Beman\u2019s claims against Smith were not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because Smith was not a state actor; and that the State Bar, Moyik, and Miller are immune from suit. Beman has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue with respect to those determinations. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">Beman complains that the district court dismissed his complaint prematurely without giving him an opportunity to respond to a motion to dismiss filed by the State Bar, Moyik, and Miller. The district court dismissed the complaint after conducting judicial screening pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A and \u00a7 1915(e) and did not, in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>order, rule upon the motion to dismiss. Section 1915A contains no requirement for giving notice to the plaintiff of impending dismissal. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Beman contends that the district court was unfairly biased against him. There is no reason to believe that the district court was unfairly biased. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Beman has not shown that he wishes to raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. The request for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219. Because the appeal is without arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Beman\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of Be-man\u2019s appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Ade-pegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Beman that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while his is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
