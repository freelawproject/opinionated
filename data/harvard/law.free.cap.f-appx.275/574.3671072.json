We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s decision, see <em>Cox v. USDA, </em>925 F.2d 1102, 1104 (8th Cir.1991) (standard of review), and that the Secretary\u2019s choice of sanction is not \u201cunwarranted in law or unjustified in fact,\u201d <em>see Lesser v. Espy, </em>34 F.3d 1301, 1309 (7th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
