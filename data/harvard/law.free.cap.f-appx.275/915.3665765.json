On review, Yang argues that the BIA failed to give proper weight to the evidence she provided in support of her claim that she would be forcibly sterilized if she were to return to China after giving birth to two children in the United States. She contends that the BIA erred by denying her motion to reopen in light of this evidence of changed circumstances. Yang asserts that she will be forcibly sterilized even though her children were born in the United States because neither she nor her husband have legal status in the United States, which would potentially exempt them from family planning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">We review \u201cthe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>480 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). Review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day time limit does not apply if the motion to reopen is filed on the basis of changed circumstances in the country of the mov-ant\u2019s nationality. 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must show material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">In <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1373 (11th Cir.2007), we interpreted the \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d exception and concluded that the BIA erred by denying a motion to reopen based on new evidence that officials in Li\u2019s hometown \u201chad intensified their persecution of parents of two children.\u201d In <em>Li, </em>the petitioner submitted the following evidence in support of her motion to reopen: (1) her own affidavit, reporting recent second-hand accounts of forced sterilization and abortion in her village in the previous year; (2) her mother\u2019s affidavit, reporting that family planning enforcement had become \u201cmore severe\u201d in their village, that sterilizations \u201cwere more common than before,\u201d and that three women from their village recently had been forcibly sterilized after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>giving birth to their second child; (3) the 2003 U.S. State Department Country Report, which was available at the original removal hearing, indicating that the one-child policy was more relaxed in rural areas but that couples with two children were \u201cusually pressured to undergo sterilization\u201d; (4) the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Report, which was not available at the original removal hearing, indicating that couples with two children were \u201coften pressured to undergo sterilization\u201d; and (5) the 2005 U.S. State Department Country Report, indicating that forced sterilization and abortion were prevalent in rural provinces. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The BIA denied Li\u2019s motion, reasoning that the anecdotal evidence of sterilization in her hometown province established \u201c \u2018only that the family planning policies are enforced generally in [the movant\u2019s] hometown and that they were enforced specifically against the person identified [in the anecdotes].\u201d\u2019 488 F.3d at 1374. We rejected the BIA\u2019s reasoning, particularly in light of Li\u2019s evidence of \u201ca recent campaign of forced sterilization in her home village,\u201d and concluded that she had presented sufficient evidence of changed circumstances to excuse her untimely motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Here, Yang argues that evidence of a change to her personal circumstances since the time that she was ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>\u2014 that is, the intervening birth of her two children \u2014 when coupled with evidence that the enforcement of China\u2019s family planning regulations remains strong and has not been relaxed, established \u201cchanged country circumstances.\u201d The exception to the 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen applies where the petitioner establishes \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), and not changed personal circumstances, such as the ones relied on by Yang. Unlike the evidence presented in <em>L% </em>here, Yang relied on evidence that officials continue to enforce the one-child policy through tactics such as forced sterilization, without any argument that the manner of enforcement has worsened. Moreover, much of the evidence Yang presented discusses conditions in China prior to her initial hearing in May 2000. Further, to the extent Yang cites the 2007 U.S. State Department Country Report in her initial brief, this evidence was not before the BIA and we do not consider it. <em>At Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001). Accordingly, because Yang failed to present evidence of changed country conditions, as opposed to changed personal circumstances, since the time that she was ordered removed <em>in absentia, </em>the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">In light of the foregoing, Yang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-11\">. Yang has failed to address in her initial brief the BIA\u2019s finding that it had previously found that she failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution and, thus, a <em>prima facie </em>case of asylum eligibility. Accordingly, she has abandoned the issue and we do not address it. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, where an appellant fails to raise arguments regarding an issue on appeal, that issue is deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
