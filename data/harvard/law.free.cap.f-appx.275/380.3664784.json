White appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the denial of his habeas application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Our court granted a COA for his two related claims regarding Juror 2. <em>White v. Quarterman, </em>No. 05-51509 (5th Cir. 22 Dec. 2006) (unpublished). AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-30\">Harold A. White was indicted for attempted sexual assault. His first trial ended in a mistrial in January 2001 because the jury was deadlocked. A jury, in a second trial later in 2001, convicted White as charged. He was sentenced to 65 years\u2019 imprisonment because he was a repeat offender. The judgment was af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>firmed on direct appeal. The Supreme Court of the United States denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">White filed a state-habeas application, raising numerous claims, including, regarding Juror 2: denial of a fair trial through a biased juror; and ineffective assistance of counsel based on that juror\u2019s being seated. The state-habeas trial court recommended denying relief, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">White next pursued federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Among other claims, he presented those described above regarding Juror 2. The district court denied both the petition on the merits and a COA. Our court granted a COA on whether: Juror 2 was biased; and counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not challenging that juror\u2019s service on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">White\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, having been filed in 2002, is subject to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). <em>E.g., Pen-ry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001). Habeas relief may not be granted unless the state-court proceeding either \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\u201d, or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error; its conclusions of law, <em>de novo. E.g., Virgil v. Dretke, </em>446 F.3d 598, 604-05 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Juror bias <em>vel non </em>is a finding of fact. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 610 n. 52; <em>see also Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1036, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). Pursuant to AEDPA, \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by <em>clear and convincing evidence\u201d. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, as discussed <em>supra, </em>to succeed on his juror-bias claim, White must show \u201cthe adjudication of the claim [on the merits in State court proceeding] ... resulted in a decision that was based on an <em>unreasmiable </em>determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The state-habeas trial court, on considering White\u2019s petition, recommended: White had \u201cthe burden of proving his claim that [Juror 2 was] biased by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see Ex parte Rains, </em>555 S.W.2d 478 (Tex.Crim.App.1977), but he ma[de] no such showing\u201d. <em>Ex parte White, </em>No. 51,240-A (264th Dist. Ct., Bell County, Tex. 30 Sep. 2003) (unpublished). Without assigning reasons, the TCCA rejected White\u2019s juror-bias claim. <em>Ex parte White, </em>No. 57,296-01 (Tex.Crim.App. 10 Dec. 2003) (unpublished). Accordingly, we assume the state court applied the proper law and then determine whether its decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can objectively unreasonable application of that law\u201d. <em>Virgil, </em>446 F.3d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Along this line, by rejecting the juror-bias claim, the TCCA necessarily concluded White had <em>not </em>shown Juror 2 was biased. As noted, this implied factual finding is entitled to deference. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), (e)(1); <em>Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 948 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001). Consequently, as discussed <em>swpra, </em>for federal habeas relief, White must rebut these state-court factual findings by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Concomitantly, White must show the district court\u2019s fact-finding on this issue is clearly erroneous. \u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that, had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Myers v. Johnson, </em>76 F.3d 1330, 1333 (5th Cir.1996) (reviewing district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The district court fully considered the record; found it did not reflect bias by Juror 2; and, therefore, ruled White did <em>not </em>affirmatively prove bias. <em>White v. Dretke, </em>No. W-04-CA-041 (W.D. Tex. 20 Sep. 2005) (unpublished). Accordingly, pursuant to the above-described AEDPA standard of review, the district court held the state court\u2019s rejecting this biased-juror claim was <em>not unreasonable. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">During voir dire in White\u2019s trial, the prosecutor began mixing his questions to the venire in such a way that it is unclear which of several questions he asked any particular venire member: (1) \u201cWas there anything about [the fact that sexual assault is an issue in this case] that would make it difficult for you to serve as a juror in this case?\u201d; (2) whether a venire member could be a fair and impartial juror; or (3) whether a venire member felt \u201c[he/she] can\u2019t put [some past experience] aside .... [he/she] cannot make a decision in this case\u201d. Accordingly, it is imperative to understand the context within which Juror 2 responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">During the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the venire, Juror 25 explained how painful the topic of White\u2019s case was personally, because her sister had been raped and she (Juror 25) had been sexually abused by her father. The prosecutor responded: \u201cSome of you have had life experiences that depending on what kind of trial came up, you would say, Can\u2019t do it, not me. Pick somebody else. I could be real good in a burglary case, or I would be real good in a robbery case, but not this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The prosecutor then asked, \u201cAnybody else?\u201d Juror 2 responded: \u201cYes. My girlfriend was assaulted when she was a teenager, sexually assaulted.\u201d The prosecutor replied: \u201cOkay. Can you put that aside?\u201d Juror 2 answered: \u201cProbably not.\u201d The prosecutor then asked: \u201cSo you feel like that <em>would have some influence </em>on your ability to reach a decision?\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court reporter recorded the following response for Juror 2: \u201cindicating\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s next statement advised the venire members to whom he was speaking that \u201cthe law requires you to set that aside if you are going to serve as a juror. But the law doesn\u2019t make you give up your own personal beliefs. What you have got to be able to do is say, I\u2019m sorry. If you put me in that chair, I will violate the law. Don\u2019t make me do it, Judge. That\u2019s the standard.\u201d Juror 2 never made such a statement to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">Contrasting Juror 2\u2019s statements with those of jurors in <em>Virgil, </em>446 F.3d at 603-604, and <em>United States v. Nell, </em>526 F.2d 1223, 1230 (5th Cir.1976), the state court was <em>not unreasonable </em>in concluding Juror 2 did <em>not </em>show bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">In <em>Virgil, </em>venire-member Sims stated that memories of his mother\u2019s being mugged were weighing on him as a potential juror in a case involving an assault on an elderly person. Therefore, the prosecutor in <em>Virgil </em>asked Sims if he \u201ccould not be fair and impartial\u201d. <em>Virgil, </em>446 F.3d at 604. Sims responded he believed he could <em>not </em>be fair and impartial. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, Sims served as a juror. In concluding Sims expressly admitted bias, our coui\u2019t focused on the phrase \u201cfair and impartial\u201d, stating: \u201cSims\u2019s unchallenged statements during voir dire that [he] could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>not be \u2018fair and impartial\u2019 obligated Virgil\u2019s counsel to use a peremptory or for-cause challenge\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Similarly, in <em>Nell, </em>the challenged venire member (who later served as a juror), having twice explained his feelings about the negative influence of labor unions, said his second statement \u201cjust reiterates my <em>prejudice </em>against the thing\u201d. 526 F.2d at 1228 (emphasis added). Our court focused on the juror\u2019s use of \u201cprejudice\u201d, concluding: \u201c[The juror\u2019s] articulated responses left no doubt as to his prejudice\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Along those same lines, <em>Virgil </em>discusses a Sixth Circuit decision, <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 453, 456 (6th Cir.2001), which relied on our court\u2019s decision in <em>Nell. </em>In <em>Hughes, </em>the trial judge asked whether the venire member\u2019s relationship with a law enforcement officer \u201cwould prevent you from being fair in this case\u201d. 258 F.3d at 456. The juror replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could be fair\u201d. <em>Id. Hughes </em>focused on the word \u201cfair\u201d with regard to the juror\u2019s attitudes.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">In contrast, Juror 2 was not asked by the prosecutor whether he could be fair and impartial or whether he was prejudiced against White. Instead, Juror 2 was first asked whether he could put aside his girlfriend\u2019s having been sexually assaulted, to which Juror 2 answered \u201cprobably not\u201d. But, the record only shows \u201cindicating\u201d for Juror 2\u2019s answer to the prosecutor\u2019s follow-up question: \u201cSo you feel like that would have some influence on your ability to reach a decision?\u201d Juror 2\u2019s response was <em>not </em>like that of the biased juror in <em>Virgil; </em>instead, it was far more similar to that of the three jurors in <em>Virgil, </em>discussed below, found by our court not to have shown bias in their statements during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In response to the defense counsel\u2019s question in <em>Virgil </em>of whether \u201ca witness who has a prior criminal case, if you are on the jury, is ... worthy of belief\u2019, the three above-referenced jurors answered \u201cno\u201d. <em>Virgil, </em>446 F.3d at 608. For those three, <em>Virgil </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[T]he response of the potential jurors hardly suggests a showing of bias.... [T]he Supreme Court has never required that jurors come ready to serve with a blank slate, without preconception or understanding of the real world.... Such a limited and natural response is insufficient to raise any obligation on the part of counsel to respond with a peremptory or for-cause challenge. As such, we cannot conclude [under AEDPA] that the state court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable application of federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\"><em>Id, </em>at 609. <em>Virgil </em>held that jurors cannot be expected to set aside their life experiences. Merely expressing that a life experience shades one\u2019s Anew does <em>not </em>equate to bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">More to the point, for this appeal, it is not sufficient, under AEDPA, to make the state court\u2019s decision unreasonable. In other words, White has not made the requisite showing under AEDPA that the state court was unreasonable in <em>not </em>holding Juror 2 was biased. In this regard, he has not, by the requisite <em>clear and convincing evidence, </em>rebutted the presumption of correctness of the state court\u2019s implied finding to that effect. Similarly, he has <em>not </em>shoAvn as clearly erroneous the district court\u2019s finding White failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">White\u2019s other claim, that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not challenging Juror 2\u2019s service on the jury, depends upon a finding in White\u2019s favor on the biased-juror claim. Obviously, because that claim fails, the ineffective-assistance claim fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">For foregoing reasons, the denial of ha-beas relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b410-5\">DENNIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">I agree that White did not rebut the state court\u2019s finding of no actual bias with clear and convincing evidence and that his case is distinguishable from <em>Virgil v. Dretke, </em>446 F.3d 598 (5th Cir.2006). However, I disagree with the opinion\u2019s application of the \u201cclear error\u201d standard of review to this case, because it is in conflict with holdings from four Circuits. I do not agree that, as a prerequisite to federal habeas relief, White must establish that the district court <em>dearly erred </em>when it determined that White did not rebut the state court\u2019s finding of no actual bias with clear and convincing evidence. The district court\u2019s determination that White did not rebut the state court\u2019s finding of fact relied solely on a review of state court records; there was no evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Applying the persuasive holdings from our sister Circuits, the district court\u2019s determination in this case cannot be considered a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d that requires a deferential \u201cclear error\u201d review. While our court has not addressed this issue, four Circuits are in accord. For example, the Sixth Circuit has stated: \u201c[f]actual determinations made by the district court are reviewed for clear error, except where the factual findings are based on the district court\u2019s review of state court trial transcripts and other court records, in which case they are considered de novo.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Timmerman-Cooper, </em>512 F.3d 768, 774 (6th Cir. 2008). \u201cIn such cases, because no eredibility determination or findings of fact are required, factual conclusions are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Dando v. Yukins, </em>461 F.3d 791, 796 (6th Cir.2006). The Tenth Circuit has stated, \u201cwhen ... the district court\u2019s findings of fact are based merely on a review of the state record, we do not give them the benefit of the clearly erroneous standard but instead conduct an independent review.\u201d <em>Spears v. Mullin, </em>343 F.3d 1215, 1225 (10th Cir.2003); <em>see also Dugas v. Coplan, </em>506 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.2007); <em>Re v. Snyder, </em>293 F.3d 678, 680 (3d Cir.2002). As the First Circuit observed, \u201c[w]hen the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case, we are effectively in the same position as the district court vis-\u00e1-vis the state court record and have the ability to review that record from the same vantage point. Consequently, the district court\u2019s recension of that record will engender de novo review.\u201d <em>Pike v. Guarino, </em>492 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.2007); <em>see also Dugas, </em>506 F.3d at 7-8, <em>Dando, </em>461 F.3d at 796. Accordingly, I disagree with the opinion to the extent it conflicts with the holdings from our sister Circuits and does not review the district court\u2019s determination <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. The opinion cites to <em>Myers v. Johnson, </em>76 F.3d 1330, 1333 (5th Cir.1996) in support of the proposition that \u201cWhite must show the district court\u2019s fact-finding on this issue is clearly erroneous.\" In <em>Myers, </em>the district court granted an evidentiary hearing and we accorded \u201cclear error\u201d deference to the findings of fact that followed the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
