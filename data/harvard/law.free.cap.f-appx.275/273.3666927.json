The district court denied Gilkey leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith for the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Gil-key has failed to adequately brief the issues raised in the district court\u2019s certification decision. He therefore has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Consequently, his request for IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Gilkey\u2019s consolidated complaints and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 1996). Gilkey accumulated two other strikes in <em>Gilkey v. Graves, </em>No. 3:03-CV-497, 2003 WL 21653858 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 9, 2003), and <em>Gilkey v. Dallas County District Attorney\u2019s Office, </em>No. 3:03-CV-498, 2003 WL 21503136 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 7, 2003). As Gilkey now has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 in any civil action or appeal while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
