Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>See Krotova v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1080, 1084 (9th Cir.2005). We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1228 (9th Cir.2002). Li\u2019s failure to mention his wife\u2019s forced abortion in his second asylum application is not a material omission or evidence of falsity, because Li\u2019s asylum application focuses on a different aspect of Li\u2019s experience in China. <em>See Chanchavac v. INS, </em>207 F.3d 584, 588 (9th Cir.2000). Li produced certain corroborating documents, and his failure to produce additional hospital records does not support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1227. Li described the founder and location of his church in China, and his failure to additionally name the sect is not a material omission going to the heart of his claim. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, Li\u2019s failure to bring a witness from his church in the United States does not support the adverse credibility finding where Li explained that he would feel ashamed to have the church members take time from their jobs to help him present evidence that he felt he could present himself. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 621 (9th Cir.2004) (stating that failure of brother to testify on applicant\u2019s behalf was not determinative because she provided a plausible explanation for his absence). We therefore grant the petition for review with respect to Li\u2019s withholding claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In his opening brief, Li has failed to raise, and therefore has waived, any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that Li has not established eligibility for protection under CAT. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">We deny Li\u2019s Motion for Judicial Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Accordingly, we remand for the agency to consider whether, taking Li\u2019s testimony as true, he has shown eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See generally INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b714-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
