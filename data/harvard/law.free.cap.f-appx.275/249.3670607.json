Because we find the Board abused its discretion in denying the motion, we grant the petition for review, vacate the Board\u2019s order, and remand this case to the Board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-22\">After illegally entering the United States in October 1998, Lin filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, claiming entitlement to relief because of her opposition to China\u2019s family planning policy. Although Lin was neither married nor pregnant at the time of her application, Lin asserted she had a well-founded fear of future persecution if she were removed to China because she would be forced to undergo a gynecological examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-23\">In a decision that issued on January 14, 2000, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Lin\u2019s application. Lin appealed to the Board, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion on September 30, 2002. Lin did not petition this court for review of this decision. Instead, over three years later, Lin filed a motion to reopen proceedings based on changed circumstances, which the Board denied on June 13, 2006. Lin did not petition this court for review of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Lin filed a second motion to reopen in November 2006, arguing her immigration proceedings should be reopened because new and previously unavailable evidence established a change in country conditions; namely, increased enforcement of the family planning policy. Lin also argued that a change in her personal circumstances\u2014 giving birth to three children while living in the United States \u2014 necessitated re-evaluation of her asylum application because she was now in violation of China\u2019s family planning policy, and would be forcibly sterilized if she returned. Lin further claimed, in the alternative, that she was entitled to file a successive asylum application, despite being under a final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In support of her motion, Lin submitted the following evidence: her personal, notarized affidavit, detailing conversations with her father, who lives in the Fujian Province (Lin\u2019s home province), in which her father reported that several women were forcibly sterilized after the birth of their second children; an amended 1-589 application and supporting affidavit; Lin\u2019s birth certificate; Lin\u2019s husband\u2019s legal permanent resident card; Lin\u2019s marriage certificate; and the birth certificates of Lin\u2019s three children. In addition to this personal evidence, Lin also submitted objective documentary evidence to establish an increase in the government\u2019s enforcement measures. Among other things, this evidence included the Policy Statement from the Administrative Office of the National Population and Family Planning Committee (\u201cPolicy Statement\u201d); a 1999 question and answer sheet issued by the Changle City Family Planning Office addressing the family planning policy; demographer John Aird\u2019s September 2002 testimony before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China; the May 2003 Consular Information Sheet on China; the 2004 Department of State Country Report on China; the 2005 Department of State Country Report on China (\u201c2005 Country Report\u201d); Fujian Province\u2019s Population and Family Planning Regulation, issued in 2002; the 2005 annual report from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China; and two newspaper articles reporting human rights violations arising from enforcement of the family planning policy. Lin argued that, considered together, these documents established changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Board denied Lin\u2019s motion to reopen, concluding the birth of Lin\u2019s three children in the United States constituted a change in personal circumstances, not a change in country conditions. Relying upon the 2005 Country Report and taking administrative notice of the 2006 State Department Report on Country Conditions in China (\u201c2006 Country Report\u201d), the Board opined Lin\u2019s evidence established that country conditions were \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to those in existence when she was initially denied relief. This petition for review timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Lin\u2019s petition for review is limited to the Board\u2019s decision denying her second motion to reopen. Lin failed to timely petition for review of the Board\u2019s September 30, 2002 order, which affirmed and adopted the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her requests for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, or of the Board\u2019s denial of her first motion to reopen. Lin had thirty days from the date of those orders to timely file a petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Thus, Lin\u2019s petition for review of the Board\u2019s order denying her second motion to reopen, filed June 22, 2007, cannot be considered timely as to the Board\u2019s previous orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>An alien may file one motion to reopen within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C) (West 2005 &amp; Supp. 2007); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2006), <em>invalidated on other grounds, William v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 329, 334 (4th Cir.2007). The time and numerical limitations do not apply if the basis for the motion to reopen is to seek asylum or withholding of removal based on changed country conditions. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii) (West 2005 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (2006). To proceed under this exception, the applicant must present evidence of changed country conditions that \u201cis material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii). \u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). The denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor such motions. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). This court reverses the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The Board issued its final order of removal on September 30, 2002. Lin, however, did not file this second motion to reopen until November 21, 2006, almost four years after the expiration of the ninety-day deadline for filing such a motion. Thus, Lin\u2019s motion was untimely. Lin\u2019s motion was also numerically barred, as it was Lin\u2019s second motion to reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Thus, the central issue is whether the Board abused its discretion in concluding Lin\u2019s evidence of changed country conditions was insufficient to support the untimely and numerically barred motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">In a recently published decision, the Eleventh Circuit considered facts very similar to those at issue here, and reached a conclusion contrary to the decision reached by the Board in Lin\u2019s case. <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir. 2007); <em>but see Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270 (2d Cir.2006). In <em>Li, </em>a Chinese national from the Fujian Province sought to reopen her immigration proceedings based on the birth of her two children<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and increased family planning enforcement efforts in the Fujian Province. <em>Id. </em>at 1372-73. In support of her motion to reopen, Li submitted much of the same evidence Lin presented to the Board here. <em>Id. </em>at 1373. The only material difference in the evidence is that the applicant in <em>Li </em>presented an affidavit from her mother reporting forced abortions and sterilizations, whereas Lin detailed her father\u2019s reports of forced sterilizations in her own affidavit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>In granting Li\u2019s petition for review, the Eleventh Circuit set forth all the evidence Li presented in support of her claim, and concluded it was unavailable at the time of her initial asylum hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1373, 1375. The Eleventh Circuit further opined this was \u201cevidence of a recent campaign of forced sterilization in [Li\u2019s] home village, evidence consistent with the conclusion of recent government reports,\u201d and that it \u201cclearly satisfied the criteria for a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We grant Lin\u2019s petition for review. Save for the issue of when the petitioner in <em>Li </em>gave birth to her children, the record before us is almost identical to the record before the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Li. </em>Lin\u2019s evidence is arguably even more supportive of the motion, as the Board here also took administrative notice of the 2006 Country Report, which noted that, during 2005, \u201cofficials in ... Fujian Province reportedly forcibly sterilized women.\u201d Dep\u2019t of State, 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in China (2007), http://www.state. gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78771.htm. This represents a significant departure from previous Department of State Country Reports, which did not report any such enforcement activity in the Fujian Province.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Although the Board properly considered Lin\u2019s evidence of changed country conditions, <em>see Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006), the Board\u2019s decision finding Lin\u2019s evidence insufficient to establish a change in country conditions was contrary to law. Although reporting sources continue to reflect the Chinese government\u2019s policy prohibiting forcible sterilizations, the 2006 Country Report, coupled with Lin\u2019s affidavit recounting her father\u2019s assertions of several forced sterilizations, evidence the type of change in country conditions necessary to support reopening.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Accordingly, we grant Lin\u2019s petition for review, vacate the Board\u2019s order denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen, and remand this case to the Board for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\">. It is unclear whether Li gave birth to her children before or after her final order of removal was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Lin\u2019s evidence also differed from Li\u2019s in that Li provided the 2005 Consular Information Sheet, whereas Lin provided the 2003 version of that document. <em>Li, </em>488 F.3d at 1373. However, both documents contain the same relevant information: that except under certain circumstances, the Chinese government considers children bom to Chinese nationals abroad to be Chinese citizens. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-18\">. Notably, though Lin's original asylum application was predicated on her opposition to China's family planning policy, she did not claim a fear of forcible sterilization because she had not, at that time, violated the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b279-20\">. Because we grant Lin\u2019s petition for review on this issue, we do not address her alternative contention that the Board erred in concluding she could not file a successive asylum application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
