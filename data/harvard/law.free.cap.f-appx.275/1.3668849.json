It is</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Securities and Exchange Commission order filed November 30, 2006, 2006 WL 3455114, dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal, and its order filed March 13, 2007, denying his motion for reconsideration, be affirmed. Petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the New York Stock Exchange, and as a result, the Commission properly dismissed his appeal from the Exchange. <em>See </em>NYSE Rule 476(e) (requiring that requests for review to the Exchange Board of Directors be made with 25 days after notice of a Hearing Panel\u2019s decision). The Hearing Panel\u2019s determination was served in compliance with Exchange rules and was not constitutionally deficient, because it was reasonably calculated to apprise petitioner of his rights. <em>See Jones v. Flowers, </em>547 U.S. 220, 226, 126 S.Ct. 1708, 164 L.Ed.2d 415 (2006); NYSE Rule 476(d). Petitioner has also not shown that service of the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision by mail violated his equal protection rights, <em>see Noble v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>194 F.3d 152, 154 (D.C.Cir.1999), or that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision was properly served by mail was otherwise arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, <em>see PMD Produce Brokerage Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>234 F.3d 48, 51 (D.C.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
