The magistrate judge found that Boyd failed to file his action on the required \u00a7 2255 form or furnish the required number of copies, and purported to dismiss the recharacterized motion without prejudice to Boyd filing a properly formatted \u00a7 2255 motion. However, the magistrate judge lacked authority to dismiss the case, as neither of the parties had provided the requisite consent to proceed before a magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000). In the absence of such consent, the magistrate judge possessed authority only to provide a report to the district court containing proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition, but not to make a final determination or enter a judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B); <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>176 F.3d 805, 808 (4th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we vacate the magistrate judge\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> We are confident that upon review of this opinion, the district court will also provide Boyd with the proper notice and an opportunity to respond, as required under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 377, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), before characterizing his filing as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Blackstock, </em>513 F.3d 128, 133 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
