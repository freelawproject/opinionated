EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Plaintiff-Appellant Frederick Banks, a federal prisoner, appears <em>pro se </em>and appeals from a district court decision dismissing, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), his civil rights claim. Mr. Banks\u2019 complaint challenged the alleged conversion of two checks, amounting to $110,000, by Defendants-Appellees. He brought his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, positing that Defendants-Appellees Vio Software and Three Monkey Karaoke had acted under color of state law because they are businesses incorporated in the state of Colorado. The district court rejected this theory as legally frivolous and dismissed Mr. Banks\u2019 complaint <em>sua sponte. </em>Thereafter, the court denied Mr. Banks\u2019 motion to reconsider and amend his complaint, and, lastly, denied him the privilege of proceeding on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>\u00a7 1291, and dismiss Mr. Banks\u2019 appeal as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Mr. Banks is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He alleges that on September 30, 2003, the Defendants-Appellees sent him two checks in the sum of $110,000 by FEDEX. The checks were made payable to Hexagon Records and Hexagon LLC and were issued by Bank One.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Mr. Banks alleges, the checks were \u201cno good\u201d and \u201cDefendants never returned the merchandise or reinbursement [sic] of the $110,000.\u201d Mr. Banks does not specify what \u201cmerchandise\u201d the Defendant-Appel-lees failed to return, nor does he further illuminate the factual circumstances underlying his suit. Cognizant of the \u201ccolor of law\u201d requirement for a \u00a7 1983 suit, Mr. Banks asserts that Defendants-Appellees Vio Software and Three Monkey Karaoke \u201care corporations or LLC\u2019s incorporated in Colorado,\u201d and therefore \u201cacted under col- or of state law\u201d when they deprived him of rights protected by the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Having noted its obligation to construe Mr. Banks\u2019 <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, the district nonetheless dismissed it as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Citing <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), the district court concluded that Mr. Banks failed to allege facts supporting his assertion that the Defendants acted under color of state law. Without any such facts, Mr. Banks could not support an arguable claim, <em>see Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324-25, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), rendering it frivolous. In a motion styled a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Order and Judgment of Dismissal\u201d and \u201cMotion to Amend Complaint,\u201d Mr. Banks challenged the district court\u2019s decision. Discerning no reason to reconsider or permit amendment, the court reiterated its earlier decision that the claim was frivolous. Finally, the court also denied Mr. Banks leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">The federal IFP statute, codified as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, opens the federal courts to indigent litigants. <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827. By doing so, the statute creates the risk that filers, freed from the obligation to prepay fees or costs, will commence \u201cfrivolous, malicious, or repetitive lawsuits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, to impede such lawsuits, Congress provided for the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d suits under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See id. </em>Likewise, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) provides for the dismissal \u201cat any time if the court determines that\u201d the suit \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d A suit \u201cis frivolous where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or fact\u201d or is \u201cbased on an indisputably meritless legal theory.\u201d <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">\u201cMindful that pro se actions are held to a less stringent standard of review and that sua sponte dismissals are generally disfavored by the courts, we nonetheless allow a complaint to be dismissed under [\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) ] \u2018if the plaintiff cannot make a rational argument on the law and facts in support of [his] claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Yellen v. Cooper, </em>828 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>F.2d 1471, 1475 (10th Cir.1987)). We review a district court\u2019s determination that a suit is frivolous under \u00a7 1915 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). If the \u201cfrivolousness determination turns on an issue of law,\u201d we review the underlying legal determination <em>de novo. Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir.2006). Of course, \u00a7 1915(e)(2) commands that this court <em>dismiss </em>\u2014 rather than merely affirm \u2014 any appeal that we deem frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (\u201c[T]he court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... (B) the action or appeal\u201d meets the criteria for <em>sita sponte </em>dismissal.).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Mr. Banks\u2019 theory is simple: because Vio Software and Three Monkey Karaoke were incorporated in the state of Colorado, they necessarily are state actors. It is also simply incorrect and frivolous as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Yanaki v. Iomed, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 1204, 1207-10 (10th Cir. 2005) (concluding that company had not acted under color of law without any discussion of fact that it was incorporated under state law). <em>Cf. San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. U.S.O.C., </em>483 U.S. 522, 543-44, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 97 L.Ed.2d 427 (1987) (\u201cAll corporations act under charters granted by a government, usually by a State. They do not thereby lose their essentially private character.\u201d). Even a minimal research effort would have made this evident. As such, Mr. Banks\u2019 appeal is frivolous and we hereby dismiss it, as mandated by \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). We also note that both this dismissal and the district court\u2019s dismissal count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Jennings v. Natrona County Det. Ctr. Med. Facility, </em>175 F.3d 775, 780 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Finally, because Mr. Banks has failed to present a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal,\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted), we deny his motion to proceed IFP on appeal. In addition, we direct him to make full and immediate payment of the outstanding balance of the appellate filing fees for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">In light of the foregoing, we DENY Mr. Banks\u2019 request to proceed IFP on appeal and DISMISS his appeal. Accordingly, we assess two strikes against him, one for filing a frivolous matter in the district court and one for taking a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-17\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-8\">.
