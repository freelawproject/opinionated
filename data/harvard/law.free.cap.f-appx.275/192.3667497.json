He asserts that he is entitled to mandamus relief because of the \u201csummary dismissal below ... of his action filed in the United States District for the District of Columbia ... pursuant to RICO, the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Virginia Tort Claims Act, and Virginia Business Conspiracy Act.\u201d Petitioner also claims that he is entitled to relief because of the denial of his request to the Federal Courts of Appeal and the Tax Court to grant him a hearing to \u201cchallenge the void order of the Virginia State Bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">Petitioner\u2019s request for mandamus relief is denied. Petitioner was not entitled to the protections of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771 in his district court proceedings which were civil in nature, and in his attempts to challenge the decision of the Virginia State Disciplinary Board. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">Finding no application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771 to these proceedings, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
