We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying as untimely Oganesyan\u2019s motion to reopen because the motion was filed more than three years after the BIA\u2019s February 28, 2002 order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision). The BIA properly concluded that Oganesyan was not entitled to equitable tolling because he did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (equitable tolling available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Oganesyan\u2019s contention that he need not demonstrate diligence is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">We do not reach Oganesyan\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b724-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
