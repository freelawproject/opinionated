He contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence twelve levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because his 2004 Texas conviction does not constitute a drug trafficking offense. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On January 23, 2006, Perales-Solis, a native and citizen of Mexico, was arrested for being unlawfully present in the United States. Perales-Solis admitted that he had been voluntarily returned to Mexico by the United States Border Patrol eleven times. He had also been previously deported twice, including a June 19, 2005 deportation subsequent to pleading guilty on October 21, 2004, in Texas state court and being sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for Delivery of Marihuana in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.120. On April 20, 2006, Perales-Solis pleaded guilty, without a written plea agreement, to illegal reentry after having been removed in violation of 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Pursuant to the Guidelines, the presen-tence investigation report (the \u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a base offense level of eight for Perales-Solis. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (2005). Based on his 2004 Texas conviction, the PSR recommended a twelve-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) of the Guidelines. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense level was seventeen. The PSR set Perales-Solis\u2019s criminal history category at V and recommended a Guidelines sentencing range from forty-six to fifty-seven months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Perales-Solis objected to the PSR\u2019s sentencing recommendations, arguing that his sentence under \u00a7 1326(b) was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that the twelve-level enhancement was improper on the grounds that his Texas conviction was not within the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a drug trafficking offense. Specifically, he contended that the definition of \u201cdelivery\u201d under Texas law encompasses an \u201coffer to sell,\u201d Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.002(8), conduct which is not covered by the definition of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(a) cmt. n. l(B)(iv). Further, Pe-rales-Solis urged that the state court documents attached to the PSR, the Texas indictment and judgment, in support of the enhancement were inadequate to narrow the offense of conviction to one that is necessarily within the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a drug trafficking offense. Pe-rales-Solis also argued for a reduction in his sentence due to over representation of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The district court overruled Perales-Sol-is\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>objection and his objection to the twelve-level enhancement, but reduced his criminal history category to IV. He was sentenced on October 27, 2006, to thirty-seven months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release and assessed costs of one hundred dollars. This timely appeal followed on November 16, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">While the district court relied only on the PSR, the state court indictment and judgment, and the statements of the attorneys at sentencing, the Government supplemented the record on appeal with a certified copy of Perales-Solis\u2019s judicial confession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Under the Guidelines, the offense level for unlawfully entering the United States is increased by twelve levels if the defendant was previously deported after being convicted of a drug trafficking offense that resulted in a sentence of thirteen months or less of imprisonment. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). A \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. 1(B)(iv). Because Perales-Solis properly objected to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review the conclusion that a prior state conviction constitutes a drug trafficking offense de novo. <em>United States v. Lopez-Salas, </em>513 F.3d 174, 178 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Perales-Solis previously pleaded guilty to Delivery of Marihuana in violation of Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.120 and was sentenced to eight months in prison. To \u201cdeliver\u201d under Texas law is defined broadly to mean \u201cto transfer, actually or constructively, to another a controlled substance ... regardless of whether there is an agency relationship ... [and] includes offering to sell a controlled substance .... \u201d Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.002(8). We have held that a similar provision prohibiting the manufacture and delivery of other controlled substances, which is subject to the same statutory definition of \u201cdeliver,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 481.112, \u201cencompasses both conduct that does constitute a drug trafficking offense (transferring cocaine) and conduct that does not (offering to sell cocaine).\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 358 (5th Cir. 2007)). Texas Health and Safety Code \u00a7 481.120 is also such a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Consequently, as with prior convictions under \u00a7 481.112, we must determine whether Perales-Solis\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 481.120 constitutes a drug trafficking offense. Generally, we apply the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d as established in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), to this inquiry. <em>See Lopez-Salas, </em>513 F.3d at 178; <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 356-57 (5th Cir.2005). However, in determining whether an underlying conviction is a drug trafficking offense, we \u201cmay look beyond the statute itself to \u2018the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to <em>some other comparable judicial record of this information,\u2019\u201d </em>including a judicial confession under Texas law. <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d at 480 (quoting <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254) (emphasis added in <em>Garcia-Arella-no </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">We have held that when only the fact of conviction along with an indictment charging the defendant under \u00a7 481.112 and alleging the definition of \u201cdelivery\u201d in the conjunctive are before this court, the defendant did not necessarily plead guilty to the facts in the conjunctive as would be required for the conviction to constitute a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines. <em>Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d at 358-61. This is so because, under Texas law, proof of any one means of committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the charged offense, such as merely offering to sell a controlled substance, conduct outside the Guidelines\u2019 definition of a drug trafficking offense, could sustain a judgment of conviction for delivery as defined by \u00a7 481.002(8). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">However, in <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>the appellate record was supplemented with the indictment charging the defendant under \u00a7 481.112 with \u201cdelivery\u201d alleged in the conjunctive, the judgment, and a certified copy of the defendant\u2019s judicial confession in which the defendant stipulated \u201cthat he did \u2018knowingly and intentionally deliver, to-wit, actually transfer, constructively transfer <em>and </em>offer to sell a controlled substance,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthat he \u2018committed the offense with which [he] stand[s] charged exactly as alleged in the indictment____\u2019\u201d <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d at 481 (emphasis added in Garcia-Arellano). There, \u201cthe judicial confession clear[ed] up any ambiguity presented by the indictment and judgment,\u201d and we held that \u201c[b]ecause [the defendant\u2019s] confession established] that he possessed, transferred[,] and offered to sell a controlled substance, his prior conviction qualifie[d] as a drug trafficking offense under the [Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Perales-Solis was similarly charged in the conjunctive with violating \u00a7 481.120 by \u201cintentionally and knowingly delivering] by actual transfer\u00ed,] ... constructive transfer\u00ed,] ... [and] by offering to sell more than one-fourth and less than five pounds of marihuana to R. CORRALES.\u201d The Texas judgment simply stated that Perales-Solis was convicted of Delivery of Marihuana \u201cby actual transfer, constructive transfer, and offering to sell marihuana 1/4 oz.-5 lbs.\u201d As we have held, under Texas law, an indictment charging a defendant in the conjunctive and a judgment stating the offense of conviction are not sufficient to narrow that conviction to one that necessarily constitutes a drug trafficking offense. <em>Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d at 358-61. However, like the defendant in <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>Perales-Solis admitted to the following in a written judicial confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">[T]hat in Harris County, Texas, JOSE SOLIS PERALES, hereafter styled the Defendant ... on or about OCTOBER 19, 2004, did then and there unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly deliver by actual transfer more than one-fourth ounce and less than five pounds of marihuana to R. CORRALES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">It is further presented that ... the Defendant ... did then and there unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly deliver by constructive transfer more than one-fourth ounce and less than five pounds of marihuana to R. CORRALES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">It is further presented that ... the Defendant ... did then and there unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly deliver by offering to sell more than one-fourth ounce and less than five pounds of marihuana to R. CORRALES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">Perales-Solis further stipulated, \u201cI understand the above allegations and I confess that they are true and that the <em>acts </em>alleged above were committed on October 19, 2004.\u201d (Emphasis added). Finally, Pe-rales-Solis swore, \u201cI have read the indictment and I stipulate that if the State\u2019s witnesses were sworn in and testified, they would testify that I committed <em>each and every element alleged.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Thus, like the judicial confession in <em>Garcia-Arellano, </em>Perales-Solis\u2019s judicial confession clears up any potential ambiguity presented by the indictment and the judgment and establishes that he actually transferred, constructively transferred, and offered to sell marihuana. <em>See id. </em>Consequently, his 2004 Texas conviction under \u00a7 481.120 constitutes a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Perales-Solis also challenges the constitutionality of treating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as a sentencing factor, as opposed to an independent element of the crime that must be proven. This argument was rejected in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). He contends that the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but properly concedes that we have rejected this argument. He appeals the issue only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
