The district court sentenced Beach to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment, varying downward from a guidelines range of 210-240 months. The government appealed. Because the district court did not exceed its discretion in granting this variance, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>513 F.3d 592, 596 (6th Cir. 2008), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On January 10, 2005, FBI Special Agent Kenneth Jensen, acting in an undercover capacity, entered a chat line entitled \u201c100% preteengirlSexPies.\u201d PSR If 5. There he saw an advertisement for a file server named \u201cWOOOOHOOO.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The server operated as an automated exchange system, meaning that users could download materials from it provided they first uploaded a certain amount of materials to the server. The server included the following access \u201crules\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">This is a private server, I do not allow federal, state or local government employees, nor anyone who has or plans on sharing any information with them. Period .... I now only want movies, movies must be over 5MB, must be **8/to/14** ... I am watching so please play by the rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">PSR If 7. Jensen connected with the server and uploaded four corrupted files in order to gain the credit necessary to download files from the server. He downloaded 15 video files from the server, 14 of which depicted minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Jensen obtained an administrative subpoena for the Internet protocol address for the server and learned that the relevant subscriber was the Okolona Fire Department in Louisville, Kentucky. Federal law enforcement agents obtained a search warrant to search the fire station, where the agents discovered that Beach, a volunteer fireman who lived in a room at the firehouse, ran the server. Beach acknowledged operating the server but reported shutting it down and erasing all of his files two weeks earlier because he felt guilty about what he was doing. The agents seized two hard drives associated with Beach\u2019s computer. While the agents could not recover the data on one drive, they recovered 13 video clips from the other drive, which depicted minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">A grand jury indicted Beach, charging him with (1) knowingly transporting and shipping via interstate commerce visual depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct and (2) knowingly receiving via interstate commerce visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Beach pleaded guilty to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">The PSR gave Beach a base offense level of 22 and recommended the following enhancements: 2 levels because the material on his computer involved prepubescent minors and/or minors under the age of 12, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2); 5 levels because Beach had been involved in distribution for the receipt of a thing of value, namely more child pornography, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B); 4 levels because the images portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4); 2 levels for using a computer to receive, possess and distribute the materials, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6); and 5 levels because the offense involved more than 600 images, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D). A 3-point deduction for acceptance of responsibility reduced Beach\u2019s offense level from 40 to 37. When combined with a criminal history score of zero, Beach\u2019s offense level (after accounting for the statutory maximum) yielded a guidelines range of 210 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither party objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">At the sentencing hearing, Beach testified that he was addicted to child pornography but explained that he would experience cycles where he would not view any child pornography for months at a time before having a relapse. Beach also offered the testimony of one of his therapists, David Harmon, who described Beach\u2019s troubled family life, including time spent in foster care and difficulty in school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Beach would be \u201camenable to treatment,\u201d Harmon testified, based on his \u201cownership\u201d of the problem and his new-found ability to appreciate the child victims of his conduct. JA 186-87. Members of Beach\u2019s therapy group testified about his contributions to their own progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The court accepted the PSR\u2019s recommended guidelines calculation, then engaged in a lengthy discussion of the \u00a7 3553 factors. The court recognized that Beach\u2019s use of the server increased his culpability but noted that Beach operated it for just 30 days. Beach\u2019s frequent attempts to stop viewing child pornography prior to the creation of the server, the court found, reflected Beach\u2019s guilt, \u201cif not self-hatred.\u201d JA 169. In considering an appropriate sentence, the court gauged the continuum of possible sentences running from the 5-year statutory minimum to the 20-year statutory maximum. It stated that Beach\u2019s case was neither \u201ca [5]-year case\u201d nor a \u201c20-year case\u201d and expressed concern that the 210-month guidelines minimum sentence was \u201ctoo long.\u201d JA 173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The district court proceeded to impose concurrent sentences of 96 months (8 years) on both counts in addition to concurrent 3-year terms of supervised release. In its written judgment, the court elaborated on why it varied downward from the guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Although the defendant\u2019s use of a file server program is an aggravating factor, the defendant operated the f-serve for a limited period of time (30 days) and voluntarily closed it down prior to any contact from law enforcement. Mr. Beach testified that one reason he closed the f-serve was that he received far more images than he had anticipated or imagined. Further the Court notes the computer had only a few images when it was seized by the FBI. The statutory penalty for this offense is five to twenty years. The Court does not view this defendant as among the least culpable offender\u00bb to be prosecuted under this statute, but views him in the second tier of offenders whose offense would be covered by this statute. Thus a sentence at the lower side of the mid-range is deemed appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">JA 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">The government concedes that Beach\u2019s sentence was free of procedural error. Its appeal thus focuses on \u201cthe substantive reasonableness\u201d of his sentence, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and more specifically on whether the district court abused its discretion in granting this downward variance, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">When a district court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines, we may \u201ctake the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595. But in applying abuse-of-discretion review, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>see also United States v. Grossman, </em>513 F.3d 592, 596 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The district court did not commit reversible error in issuing this 96-month sentence. After considering the applicable guidelines range (210-240 months), <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596, the district court looked at the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see id., </em>found that \u201cthere is some bad[,][t]here is some good,\u201d JA 174, and ultimately concluded that a lower sentence was appropriate to account for Beach\u2019s limited use of the server, his decision to end his criminal conduct before the government learned about it, his remorse and his prospects for rehabilitation through sex-offender treatment and mental health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The district court acknowledged that Beach\u2019s use of the server \u201cratchet[s] ... up\u201d the culpability of the offense, JA 169, but noted several mitigating factors: The server was active only for a short period of time (30 days), and Beach voluntarily shut it down before the authorities learned that he was the one who had operated the server. The district court appropriately considered these mitigating factors, <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600 (noting that a defendant\u2019s voluntary withdrawal from a conspiracy was of \u201ccritical relevance\u201d), both of which go to the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and both of which suggest that Beach\u2019s attempts at a \u201cturnaround [were] genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 601; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The court also considered Beach\u2019s remorse, explaining that Beach \u201cwaffled back and forth and back and forth\u201d by \u201cgoing through this and then deleting images and then going through and deleting some images,\u201d all of which suggested that Beach possessed \u201csome guilt ... if not self-hatred.\u201d JA 169. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>502 F.3d 465, 469 (6th Cir.2007) (upholding a downward variance based in part on defendant\u2019s remorse); <em>United States v. Husein, </em>478 F.3d 318, 334 (6th Cir.2007) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The district court also accounted for other \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 that the sentence protect society, deter future criminal conduct and provide effective treatment. In addition to a not-inconsequential eight-year prison sentence, the court imposed other conditions on Beach, such as mental health care, sex-offender treatment, sex-offender registration, a prohibition on accessing the Internet and a three-year term of supervised release. These conditions substantially limit Beach\u2019s liberty, <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595-96; <em>Grossman, </em>513 F.3d at 597, and they offer some basis for believing that he will obtain the necessary treatment to pull himself out of this cycle of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Evidence also supports the conclusion that Beach is a better candidate for rehabilitation than the typical sex offender. At sentencing, the judge emphasized Beach\u2019s exceptional progress in therapy, stating that his treatment success \u201chas a part to play\u201d in considering Beach\u2019s \u201cneeds for rehabilitation ... [and] treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d JA 168; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D); <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>487 F.3d 366, 372 (6th Cir.2007) (upholding a downward variance where the district court relied in part on the defendant\u2019s \u201cprogress in counseling\u201d). \u201c[Y]ou should ... commend yourself,\u201d the judge told Beach, \u201c[n]ot just for going to treatment,\u201d but for being \u201copen to treatment from the very beginning,\u201d \u201cgo[ing] in with an open mind\u201d and taking it seriously, unlike many counseling patients who are not \u201copen to the possibilities\u201d and who \u201cgo in with [their] own preset notions and preconceived notions of what [they] need, which thwarts the treatment.\u201d JA 166. In support of her observation, the judge pointed to the \u201ccommendable\u201d testimony from numerous individuals who saw Beach\u2019s progress first hand. <em>Id. </em>An employee of the sex-offender program testified that, based on Beach\u2019s involvement in 25 treatment groups, \u201che is remarkable.\u201d JA 194; <em>see also </em>JA 190 (stating that in preliminary individual sessions, Beach \u201c[a]lmost immediately\u201d took responsibility for his actions and \u201cwas very open, forthcoming. He was pursuing questions within himself why this happened. And we almost immediately integrated him into the group process\u201d); JA 191 (expressing \u201cshock[ ]\u201d that, in response to being named in a newspaper article about child pornography, Beach was not fearful like most clients, but rather was \u201cglad\u201d that the article was published because it would \u201ced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ucate the public\u201d); <em>id. </em>(stating that Beach \u201cis more proactive than many of the other people in the group. He has pushed the group forward on many occasions ... And in many ways he\u2019s farther along than some of the people that are toward the end of the therapy or the treatment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Beach\u2019s fellow group members not only applauded his progress but also explained how it had influenced their own steps forward. <em>See </em>JA 109 (\u201cA lot of guys in group initially do not talk much.... [B]ut [Beach] has been talking right off the bat, wanting help.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201c[Listening to Mr. Beach and his goals, I kind of re-evaluated my life and goals and put myself back on the right track....\u201d); JA 196 (\u201cI wish I had come forward a lot faster as [Beach] has. It made me realize deeper thoughts of myself. And a lot of things I realized [were] from Mr. Beach, and he\u2019s helped out a lot.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In contending that this downward sentence exceeded the district court\u2019s discretion, the government first argues that the district court gave Beach too much credit for voluntarily shutting down the server, claiming that he did so only because he received more images than his computer could handle. While Beach acknowledged being overwhelmed by the volume of images, he also testified that the number of images prompted him to regret his actions, which in turn caused him to shut down the server. <em>See, e.g., </em>JA 202 (PSR stating that \u201cBeach reported that he had shut down the f-serve approximately two weeks prior and erased all of his files because of his feelings of guilt\u201d). The district court, it is true, had no obligation to accept this explanation, but the record hardly precluded it from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The government next points out that, after Beach shut down the server in January, he set it up again for a \u201cvery short time\u201d in February, undermining the court\u2019s statement that the server was active for just 30 days. JA 106. This alleged discrepancy does not establish clear error. All we know is that Beach operated the server \u201cfor <em>approximately </em>one month,\u201d JA 202 (emphasis added), and that he set up his server a second time \u201cfor a very short time\u201d during which people from 29 countries visited it, JA 106. Nothing tells us whether the second period amounted to one day or one week. \u201c[C]ompetent evidence in the record\u201d thus supports the district court\u2019s 30-day approximation, <em>United States v. Jeross, </em>521 F.3d 562, 570-71 (6th Cir.2008), and no evidence shows that he deployed the server for an appreciably longer period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">That Beach \u201cwas distributing <em>twice </em>as much as he was receiving,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 23, does not compel a higher sentence. The government offers no precedent for the notion that sentencing courts must account for a high distribution-to-receipt ratio or, more to the point, for the notion that a court cannot vary downward when such a ratio exists. At any rate, the record shows that the court appreciated that \u201c[t]here was trading going on\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was distribution,\u201d JA 173, appreciated that these factors increased the seriousness of Beach\u2019s offense, <em>see id., </em>but still insisted on a substantial variance in view of other circumstances \u2014 an exercise of discretion that <em>Gall </em>permits rather than prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The government adds that the sentencing court placed too much weight on the mandatory minimum sentence and not enough weight on the guidelines. But while the court considered the statutory minimum, it also considered the statutory maximum. And, through it all, the court did not lose sight of the guidelines range, but in the end made a judgment that \u201can individualized assessment based on the facts presented,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, required a substantial downward variance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The court\u2019s attention to the guidelines and its thorough discussion of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors show that it \u201cg[a]ve serious consideration to the extent of [the] departure from the Guidelines\u201d and provided \u201csufficient justifications\u201d for its sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 594. While we cannot say that this is the sentence we would have given, neither can we say that this variance exceeded the discretion <em>Gall </em>gives district court judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
