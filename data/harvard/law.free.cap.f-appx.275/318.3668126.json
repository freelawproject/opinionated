According to the Bureau of Prisons website, Cardona-Ramirez is scheduled to complete his term of imprisonment April 14, 2008. Because his release is imminent, this Court cannot usefully grant the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>relief to which Appellant would have been entitled: re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Because no effective judicial remedy exists, we must DISMISS this appeal as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
