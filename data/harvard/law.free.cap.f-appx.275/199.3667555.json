Dylan, Incorporated, unsuccessfully sought ownership of certain fishing permits assigned to a vessel owned by Atlantic Capes Fisheries, Incorporated, but used by The F/V Site Clearance I. Capt. Dylan\u2019s claim to the fishing permits stems from its September 2005 purchase of Site Clearance I from Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation, which, in turn, had obtained Site Clearance I by virtue of a July 2005 foreclosure sale ordered by the district court. During this same time period, the fishing permits were first transferred from Site Clearance I back to the Atlantic Capes vessel, and then restored to Site Clearance I. To resolve their ensuing dispute over ownership of the fishing permits, Atlantic Capes and Capt. Dylan intervened in the original foreclosure action, and Atlantic Capes also brought its own lawsuit against Capt. Dylan.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Capt. Dylan appeals from two decisions of the district court in favor of Atlantic Capes. In No. 06-2142, Capt. Dylan contests the court\u2019s September 28, 2006 order in the original foreclosure action, by which the court clarified that its prior foreclosure-related orders excluded the disputed fishing permits from the sale of Site Clearance I to Caterpillar, and thus mandated that the permits be returned from Site Clearance I to the Atlantic Capes vessel. <em>See Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp. v. The F/V Site Clearance I, </em>No. 2:05-cv-00010 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 28, 2006) (the \u201cSeptember 2006 Clarification Order\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In No. 06-2222, Capt. Dylan challenges the court\u2019s October 20, 2006 order in Atlantic Capes\u2019s lawsuit, recognizing that the central issue in that matter \u2014 the ownership of the fishing permits \u2014 was resolved by the September 2006 Clarification Order in the original foreclosure action. <em>See Atl. Capes Fisheries, Inc. v. Gutierrez, </em>No. 2:06-cv-00024 (E.D.N.C. Oct. 20, 2006) (the \u201cOctober 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As explained below, we affirm in No. 06-2142 and dismiss No. 06-2222.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The original foreclosure action, referenced in the Eastern District of North Carolina as No. 2:05-cv-00010, was initiated by Caterpillar under the Maritime Commercial Instruments and Liens Act (specifically, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 31325), to foreclose on The F/V Site Clearance I. Caterpillar had made a $1.6 million loan in February 2004 to the vessel\u2019s owner, Site Clearance I, L.L.C., with three guarantors (Massie Towing, Incorporated; Robert J. Thomassie, Jr.; and Michael P. Daniels) executing three separate guarantees. As security for its promissory note, Caterpillar was granted a \u201cPreferred Ship Mortgage,\u201d which gave Caterpillar a first-priority security interest in Site Clearance I. At that time, the only fishing permits appurtenant to Site Clearance I were open access fishing permits (the \u201cOpen Access Permits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Five months later, in July 2004, Site Clearance I, L.L.C., entered into a \u201cSeafood Marketing Agreement\u201d with Atlantic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Capes, whereby Atlantic Capes allowed The F/V Site Clearance I to make use of certain limited access fishing permits (the \u201cLimited Access Permits\u201d) that were then assigned to Atlantic Capes\u2019s fishing vessel The F/V Maelstrom. Caterpillar executed a written \u201cAcknowledgment\u201d by which it consented to the Seafood Marketing Agreement and agreed that the Limited Access Permits were not considered appurtenant to Site Clearance I, were not part of Caterpillar\u2019s security interest in the vessel, and would not be sought in any potential foreclosure action. Site Clearance I, L.L.C., subsequently defaulted on its repayment obligations to Caterpillar.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On February 22, 2005, Caterpillar initiated the foreclosure action by filing a Verified Complaint, naming as a defendant the \u201cVessel SITE CLEARANCE I, ... her engines, anchors, cables, rigging, tackle, apparel, furniture, equipment, <em>its fishing \u2022permits, including all renewals, wherever-found, </em>and all other appurtenances and necessaries therewith appertaining.\u201d J.A. 11 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Complaint requested \u201c[t]hat Process <em>in rem </em>and a Warrant of Arrest be issued ... against the Defendant Vessel SITE CLEARANCE I, her engines, anchors, cables, rigging, tackle, apparel, <em>jfishing permits, </em>furniture, and all the other necessaries therewith appertaining.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (emphasis added). Of significance, a copy of the Open Access Permits \u2014 but not the Limited Access Permits \u2014 was attached to the Complaint. <em>See id. </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The following day, February 23, 2005, the district court entered an order authorizing the Clerk of Court \u201cto issue a warrant for the arrest of the F/V SITE CLEARANCE I[,] her engines, boats, tackle, apparel, furniture, equipment, and appurtenances, etc.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp. v. The F/V Site Clearance I, </em>No. 2:05-cv-00010 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 23, 2005) (the \u201cFebruary 2005 Order to Arrest\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the warrant, Site Clearance I was seized by the United States Marshal in March 2005. Thereafter, Atlantic Capes applied to the National Marine Fisheries Service (the \u201cNMFS\u201d) to have the Limited Access Permits transferred back to The F/V Maelstrom. On May 4, 2005, the NMFS approved the requested transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">On June 22, 2005, the district court issued an order directing the Marshal to sell \u201cthe \u2018SITE CLEARANCE I\u2019, ... engines, tackle, appurtenances, equipment, cables, apparel, <em>fishing permits, </em>furniture, and necessaries appertaining thereto, etc.\u201d <em>See Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp. v. The F/V Site Clearance I, </em>No. 2:05-cv-00010 (E.D.N.C. June 22, 2005) (the \u201cJune 2005 Order to Sell\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On July 15, 2005, the vessel was sold at auction to Caterpillar for $350,000. On August 2, 2005, a \u201cMemorandum of Agreement\u201d was executed under which Caterpillar was to sell Site Clearance I to Capt. Dylan for $700,000 on an \u201cAS IS, WHERE IS\u201d basis. <em>See </em>J.A. 444-46. In subsequent communications, Caterpillar and Capt. Dylan acknowledged and discussed the issue of whether the Limited Access Permits were appurtenant to Site Clearance I and would be part of the purchase of the vessel. The Caterpillar representatives involved in these discussions were aware that Caterpillar may have previously agreed that the Limited Access Permits would not be considered appurtenant to Site Clearance I, but they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>apparently did not have knowledge or possession of Caterpillar\u2019s written Acknowledgment of the Seafood Marketing Agreement by which it promised not to seek the Limited Access Permits in any foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On August 23, 2005, the district court entered an order recognizing the sale to Caterpillar of \u201cthe vessel and all her related equipment, tackle, appurtenances, <em>fishing permits, </em>etc.,\u201d and approving and confirming \u201cthe sale of the Vessel SITE CLEARANCE I, and all her engines, tackle, appurtenances, <em>fishing permits, </em>equipment, necessaries, etc.\u201d for the sum of $350,000. <em>See Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp. v. The F/V Site Clearance I, </em>No. 2:05-cv-00010 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 23, 2005) (the \u201cAugust 2005 Order Confirming Sale\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a September I, 2005 e-mail message, Capt. Dylan assured Caterpillar that \u201c[w]e are simply requesting that Caterpillar convey to us, exactly what was granted to [it] by the Marshal through the foreclosure.\u201d J.A. 150. The following day, September 2, 2005, Caterpillar closed its private sale of Site Clearance I to Capt. Dylan for $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Around that same time, the NMFS informed Atlantic Capes that, on September 9, 2005, it would be rescinding the transfer of the Limited Access Permits from Site Clearance I to The F/V Maelstrom. The NMFS cited newly discovered information that Site Clearance I had been seized by the United States Marshal prior to the date that Atlantic Capes requested the return of the permits \u2014 a seizure that, in the view of the NMFS, had deprived it of the power to authorize the transfer. Accordingly, the NMFS deemed the transfer \u201cvoid\u201d and declared the Limited Access Permits \u201crestored\u201d to Site Clearance I. <em>See </em>J. A. 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">On September 15, 2005, however, Caterpillar alerted Capt. Dylan by facsimile message, with a copy of its written Acknowledgment of the Seafood Marketing Agreement attached, that \u201cCaterpillar was placed on notice several months after the mortgage was filed that the [Limited Access Permits were] not to be considered an appurtenance of the vessel or collateral for the mortgage,\u201d and that, \u201c[a]s such, Caterpillar would likely be estopped from claiming that they were among those permits arrested with the subject vessel.\u201d J.A. 157. Caterpillar offered to discuss alternative arrangements if that news affected Capt. Dylan\u2019s desire to own Site Clearance I, but Capt. Dylan did not attempt to relinquish the vessel. Thereafter, on October 7, 2005, the NMFS officially transferred the Limited Access Permits to Site Clearance I (now owned by Capt. Dylan).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">On October 25, 2005, Atlantic Capes filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the foreclosure action, a complaint against Site Clearance I, a cross-claim against Caterpillar, and a \u201cMotion to Clarify Confirmation of Sale\u201d \u2014 all asserting Atlantic Capes\u2019s rights to the Limited Access Permits. On December 14, 2005, Capt. Dylan filed a motion to intervene, as well as an opposition to Atlantic Capes\u2019s Motion to Clarify Confirmation of Sale. On April 14, 2006, the district court granted the motions to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, deeming both Atlantic Capes and Capt. Dylan to be proper intervenors. During a June 28, 2006 hearing on the pending issues, Caterpillar indicated that, consistent with Atlantic Capes\u2019s view, the Limited Access Permits were <em>not </em>among the rights it obtained by purchasing Site Clearance I.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Thereafter, in its September 2006 Clarification Order, the district court observed that the dispute between Atlantic Capes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and Capt. Dylan \u201cturns on an ambiguity seized upon by both parties: whether [the term] \u2018fishing permits\u2019 \u201d \u2014 as used in the Verified Complaint, the June 2005 Order to Sell, and the August 2005 Order Confirming Sale \u2014 \u201cencompassed the \u2018Limited Access Permits.\u2019 \u201d September 2006 Clarification Order 5. The court explained that any ambiguity in its orders \u201cwas inadvertent, since from the outset neither Caterpillar, nor [Site Clearance I, L.L.C.], nor the Court intended for the Limited Access Permits to be seized or sold along with Site Clearance I.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]he Verified Complaint did not specify whether the Limited Access Permits were included among\u201d those items against which Caterpillar sought foreclosure, but observed that \u201cCaterpillar acknowledged in July 2004 [in its written Acknowledgment of the Seafood Marketing Agreement] that the Limited Access Permits would not form part of its security interest in Site Clearance I, and that Caterpillar would not seek those permits as part of any foreclosure action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The district court thus determined that \u201cthe \u2018fishing permits\u2019 described in Caterpillar\u2019s Verified Complaint included the Open Access and other permits appurtenant to Site Clearance I, but excluded the Limited Access Permits at issue here.\u201d September 2006 Clarification Order 6-7. And, the court explained that its February 2005 Order to Arrest, June 2005 Order to Sell, and August 2005 Order Confirming Sale \u201cwere meant only to enable Caterpillar to obtain the relief sought by its Verified Complaint \u2014 foreclosure upon Site Clearance I and all the items Caterpillar understood as legally connected to the vessel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. According to the court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_b\">[i]n ordering the seizure and eventual sale of Site Clearance I, the Court did not intend \u201cfishing permits\u201d to reach beyond the scope of the relief requested by Caterpillar in its Verified Complaint. The broader, more literal view of \u201cfishing permits,\u201d which NMFS understandably adopted in rescinding the transfer of the permits back to F/V MAELSTROM, and which Capt. Dylan argues for here, was incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Id. </em>The court also noted that fishing permits are generally treated as appurtenant to commercial fishing vessels \u2014 a point supported by a case relied on by Capt. Dylan, <em>Gowen, Inc. v. F/V Quality One, </em>244 F.3d 64 (1st Cir.2001) \u2014 but that the Limited Access Permits at issue here (unlike the permits in Gowen) had been specifically excluded from foreclosure by the lender. <em>See id. </em>at 7 n. 5. For these reasons, the court granted Atlantic Capes\u2019s Motion to Clarify Confirmation of Sale, and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), clarified its prior February 2005 Order to Arrest, June 2005 Order to Sell, and August 2005 Order Confirming Sale \u201cto reflect the exclusion of the Limited Access Permits from the foreclosure and sale of Site Clearance I.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court further ordered the NMFS \u201cto restore the transfer of the Limited Access Permits from Site Clearance I to Atlantic Capes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On October 24, 2006, Capt. Dylan noted an appeal from the interlocutory September 2006 Clarification Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Meanwhile, on October 11, 2005, in the District of Massachusetts, Atlantic Capes initiated its own lawsuit, seeking rescission of the NMFS\u2019s actions and restoration of the Limited Access Permits. Atlantic Capes named as defendants \u2014 in addition to Capt. Dylan \u2014 the Secretary of Commerce and a Regional Administrator for the NMFS. In the operative complaint (an Amended Complaint filed on October 31, 2005), Atlantic Capes alleged violations of the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1891d, invoking the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>inter alia, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1855(f). On July 13, 2006, the Massachusetts district court ordered the case transferred to the Eastern District of North Carolina, where it was referenced as No. 2:06-ev-00024.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">By its October 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order, the district court in North Carolina disposed of three pending motions that \u201cultimately turn[ed] upon a single issue: the legal status of the Limited Access Permits.\u201d October 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order 4. In so doing, the court recognized that, by its September 2006 Clarification Order in the original foreclosure action, it had \u201cdecided this issue already, ... holding that the [Limited Access Permits] were not among the legal rights targeted by Caterpillar[ ]\u201d in the original foreclosure action and, thus, should have remained with Atlantic Capes. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court dismissed as moot the three pending motions, and reiterated its directive to the NMFS \u201cto restore the transfer of the Limited Access Permits from Site Clearance I to Atlantic Capes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On November 17, 2006, Capt. Dylan noted an appeal from the interlocutory October 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We consolidated these appeals by order of January 3, 2007. Capt. Dylan maintains that we possess jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (jurisdiction over appeals from \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts\u201d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3) (jurisdiction over appeals from \u201c[i]nterlocutory decrees ... determining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed\u201d). We recognize that we possess \u00a7 1292(a)(3) jurisdiction in No. 06-2142 (concerning the September 2006 Clarification Order in the original foreclosure action). Our jurisdiction is in doubt, however, with respect to No. 06-2222 (relating to the October 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order). That is, it does not appear that the October 2006 <em>Atlantic Capes </em>Order constitutes an appealable \u201cfinal decision! ]\u201d under \u00a7 1291 or an appealable \u201c[interlocutory decreet ]\u201d in an \u201cadmiralty case[ ]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(3). In any event, in light of our affirmance in No. 06-2142 (which we explain below), No. 06-2222 is moot and dismissed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Relevant to No. 06-2142, Capt. Dylan challenges the September 2006 Clarification Order on several grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The key issue before us is whether the district court was authorized under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a) to clarify its prior foreclosure-related orders as it did. Our review of the Rule 60(a) issue is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kocher v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>132 F.3d 1225, 1229 (8th Cir.1997). Under the version of Rule 60(a) in effect at the time of the September 2006 Clarification Order, \u201c[clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have recognized, Rule 60(a) is properly utilized \u201cto perform a completely ministerial task\u201d (such as \u201cmaking a judgment more specific in the face of an original omission\u201d), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>not to \u201crevisit the merits of the question\u201d or \u201creconsider[ ] the matter.\u201d <em>Kosnoski v. Howley, </em>33 F.3d 376, 379 (4th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">By its September 2006 Clarification Order, the district court relied on Rule 60(a) simply to specify that its prior foreclosure-related orders excluded the Limited Access Permits from the arrest and sale of The F/V Site Clearance I \u2014 a necessary clarification in view of the NMFS\u2019s misinterpretation of the prior orders and consequent decision that the Limited Access Permits belonged with Site Clearance I. The court\u2019s exclusion of the Limited Access Permits from the arrest and sale of Site Clearance I was entirely consistent with the understanding of Caterpillar and the defendants in the foreclosure action at the time the prior orders were entered. Accordingly, it was perfectly within the court\u2019s authority to perform the \u201cministerial task\u201d of clarifying its prior orders to reflect that shared understanding. <em>Cf. Kosnoski, </em>33 F.3d at 379 (affirming court\u2019s use of Rule 60(a) to specify amount of interest previously awarded, where \u201cboth parties understood that interest had been awarded\u201d and the rate and time frame for computation, leaving as \u201c[t]he court\u2019s only task ... to do the calculation and make the amount official\u201d). Indeed, it would have been impossible for the court to \u201crevisit\u201d or \u201creconsider\u201d the status of the Limited Access Permits in its September 2006 Clarification Order, because that issue first came before the court only after Capt. Dylan latched onto the use of the general term \u201cfishing permits\u201d in the court\u2019s prior orders to argue that the Limited Access Permits were seized and sold with Site Clearance I (despite having notice from Caterpillar that the Limited Access Permits were never appurtenant to or part of its security interest in the vessel). We therefore reject any notion that the court abused its discretion by relying on Rule 60(a) for its September 2006 Clarification Order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm in No. 06-2142 and dismiss No. 06-2222.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\n<em>No. 06-2142 AFFIRMED No. 06-2222 DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">.

The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">. Capt. Dylan further maintains on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction in the foreclosure action to issue the September 2006 Clarification Order, that Atlantic Capes had no standing to seek clarification of the court\u2019s prior foreclosure-related orders, and that Atlantic Capes\u2019s clarification request was time-barred. We have carefully considered these contentions, and conclude that they are without merit. We also find it unnecessary to reach any additional issues raised by Atlantic Capes in its response brief, e.g., whether Capt. Dylan is estopped from pursuing rights to the Limited Access Permits and whether Capt. Dylan\u2019s conduct risked a fraud on the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
