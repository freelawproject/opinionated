However, the section specifically states, \u201cA motion under this section will not be granted with respect to any conviction where an alien has previously been denied section 212(c) relief by an immigration judge or by the Board on discretionary grounds.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.44. Naghdi asserts that the IJ failed to weigh relevant factors in a meaningful way and therefore did not exercise discretion in denying Naghdi \u00a7 212(c) relief in 1997. Naghdi further asserts that, because the BIA did not rule on the issue, there is no final ruling that would bar relief under \u00a7 1003.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Naghdi has failed to show an abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s determination that the IJ denied Naghdi \u00a7 212(c) relief in the exercise of his discretion. <em>See Pritchett v. INS, </em>993 F.2d 80, 83 (5th Cir.1993). To exercise discretion, an IJ must balance \u201c \u2018the adverse factors evidencing an alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented [o]n his behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Molenda v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 291, 295 (5th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978)). Contrary to Nagh-di\u2019s assertions, a review of the IJ\u2019s detailed opinion reveals that the IJ conducted such a balancing test. The IJ set out a detailed explanation of the testimony of Naghdi and the other witnesses, particularly as to the factors that might support granting a waiver. In a separate section, the IJ set out the law governing \u00a7 212(c) relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ then examined in detail Naghdi\u2019s credibility, an issue central to weighing the factors because of Naghdi\u2019s reliance primarily on his testimony to establish many of the facts underlying his claim for relief. Having determined that Naghdi was not a credible witness, the IJ further determined that Naghdi withheld pertinent information on various aspects of his case, thereby failing to meet his burden of proof on his fitness for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Implicit in the IJ\u2019s findings is the weight that the IJ attributes to the facts underlying Nagh-di\u2019s claims, the mechanics of the balancing test. Because a review of the record demonstrates that the IJ did, in fact, exercise discretion by balancing relevant factors, Naghdi has failed to show that the BIA abused its discretion when it determined that an IJ previously denied Naghdi \u00a7 212(c) relief in the exercise of his discretion and that, therefore, \u00a7 1003.44 precluded reopening the matter. Accordingly, Naghdi\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AXY\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\">. Although the IJ's decision issued two days after the general effective date of the provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which included a provision eliminating 212(c) relief, the transitional rules for IIRIRA indicated that the new rules did not govern in the case of an individual, like Naghdi, who was in deportation proceedings as of April 1, 1997. <em>See </em>Pub.L. 104-208, title III, div.
