R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition be transferred to the District Court for the District of Columbia. The petitioner seeks review of regulations issued pursuant to the agency\u2019s authority under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 127, 315 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 31111, 31112, and 31114. This court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because none of these statutes falls within those listed in the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(3)(A), and the authority exercised by the Federal Highway Administration was not transferred from the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Department of Transportation. <em>See Aulenback, Inc. v. FHWA, </em>103 F.3d 156 (D.C.Cir.1997) (holding that the Hobbs Act only grants the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review actions of Department of Transportation agencies if the action is taken pursuant to authority that was transferred from the Interstate Commerce Commission); <em>Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Ass\u2019n v. Pena, </em>996 F.2d 338 (D.C.Cir.1993) (same). Therefore, the petitioner must seek review in district court pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, under federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The Clerk is directed to transmit the original file and a certified copy of this order to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Pursuant to D.C.Cir. Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
