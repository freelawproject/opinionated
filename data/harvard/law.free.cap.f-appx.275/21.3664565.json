R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b47-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that this case be remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). The district court dismissed the appellants\u2019 case <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to allege exhaustion in their complaint, relying on 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(d)(1). However, considering a provision similar to the one at issue here, the Supreme Court held in <em>Jones </em>that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense\u201d and that litigants \u201care not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 921. Moreover, while this court has held that the district court may dismiss a complaint <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to state a claim if it is \u201cpatently obvious\u201d that the plaintiff cannot prevail, <em>see Baker v. Director, United States Parole Commission, </em>916 F.2d 725, 727 (D.C.Cir.1990) (per cu-riam), this rule does not create a pleading requirement where one does not otherwise exist, and it is not patently obvious that the appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. We therefore remand the case for reconsideration of the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
