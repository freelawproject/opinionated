R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b732-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">Cesario Ruiz-Rojo appeals his jury conviction for harboring undocumented immigrants, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and (a)(l)(B)(i). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">Ruiz-Rojo first contends that the district court erred by permitting a witness to testify that she planned to pay her smuggling fee \u201cwith her body.\u201d We find that the district court abused its discretion by admitting this testimony. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>43 F.3d 1291, 1296 (9th Cir.1995) (applying abuse of discretion standard to decisions to admit testimony). Without any evidence that Ruiz-Rojo was privy to, or would benefit from, the witness\u2019s payment arrangement with a third party, the probative value of the evidence was low and its admission was highly prejudicial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403; <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d 1093, 1098 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">However, given the amount of evidence elicited at trial that supports the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, we conclude that there is a \u201cfair assurance\u201d that the admission of the testimony was harmless and that \u201cit is more probable than not that the error did not materially affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Flores, </em>418 F.3d at 1099 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because we conclude that the error was harmless, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>do not reverse the district court\u2019s decision to admit the unduly prejudicial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Ruiz-Rojo next contends that the district court violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment by admitting into evidence a border patrol agent\u2019s testimony that individuals encountered at Ruiz-Rojo\u2019s residence were later processed for return to their country of origin. We find this contention without merit. The witness\u2019s testimony about his personal observations does not establish a Confrontation Clause violation. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Further, Ruiz-Rojo was afforded the opportunity to cross examine the witness at the time of the tidal. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court erred when it admitted the agent\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
