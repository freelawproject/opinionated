We deny review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">To establish her eligibility for asylum, Rani was required to prove she suffered past persecution or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). To qualify for withholding of removal, she had to demonstrate it is more likely than not that she would be subjected to persecution if she returned to India. <em>See Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1070 (9th Cir.2007). CAT relief required her to establish it would be more likely than not that she would be tortured with the acquiescence of the Indian government upon her return. <em>See Muradin v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1208, 1210-11 (9th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Rani claims she satisfied these burdens because she was persecuted and tortured in India as a result of her husband\u2019s political activities. Specifically, she testified her husband was arrested twice by police and beaten and that she was also taken into custody, held overnight, beaten and sexually harassed. She claimed that police later came to her house and interrogated her two children regarding her husband\u2019s whereabouts. After this last incident, Rani moved her family elsewhere in India and eventually came to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The IJ determined that Rani\u2019s claims were not credible. She does not challenge that adverse credibility finding other than to argue that she \u201cestablished past persecution ... based on her detailed and consistent testimony, and supporting documentation.\u201d We cannot agree with that argument. The IJ identified discrepancies between Rani\u2019s testimony and her application, noted various inconsistencies in her testimony, and specifically cited her inability to explain when she last saw her husband, who supplied her medical reports, and the identity of the individuals who submitted affidavits in her support. These all go to the heart of her claims and justify the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the denial of asylum. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Rani\u2019s failure to establish her eligibility for asylum also means she failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal. <em>See Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 520, 525 (9th Cir.2006). That failure does not, however, preclude CAT relief. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Nonetheless, because her claim of torture is based on the same statements and evidence the IJ determined not to be credible, the CAT claim was also properly rejected. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Finally, Rani raises a due process claim, alleging she was denied \u201ca full and complete hearing on her statutory right to apply for and if eligible, receive withholding of [removal].\u201d She does not explain, however, why her hearing was not \u201cfull and complete\u201d or how she was otherwise denied her due process rights. Indeed, the record indicates she was represented by counsel and was given ample notice and opportunity to testify, present evidence, and to call witnesses. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 620-21 (9th Cir.2006) (noting scope of an alien\u2019s due process rights). We conclude there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
