The government moved for summary affir-mance, arguing that all of Lopez-Gonzalez\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent or Supreme Court precedent. We agree with the government, and grant summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Lopez-Gonzalez argues that his sentence was unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because defendants in other districts receive sentences below the Guidelines\u2019 range as a result of fast-track departures. According to Lopez-Gonzalez, the district court should have taken into consideration the fact that the jurisdiction in which he was sentenced did not provide for fast-track departures, and reduced his sentence to draw it in line with those jurisdictions that do offer fast-track options. Lopez-Gonzalez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3053, 168 L.Ed.2d 766 (2007), (holding that a district court\u2019s refusal to factor in the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs does not render a sentence unreasonable under <em>Booker)', see also United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554 (5th Cir.2008), (reaffirming <em>Aguirre-Villa </em>and holding that <em>Kimbrough v. United </em>States,\u2014U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) did not impact our decision in <em>Aguirre-Villa).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-27\">Lopez-Gonzalez argues that the district court erred by considering two of his convictions as separate offenses, when they should have been counted as a single offense in calculating his criminal history. Lopez-Gonzalez was convicted of a robbery charge in 1997 and sentenced to probation. He was convicted and sentenced for aggravated battery in 2002, which violated his probation. Lopez-Gonzalez received his 2002 sentence and had has 1997 probation revoked in a consolidated sentence. Lopez-Gonzalez contends that the robbery and battery offenses were related because they had been consolidated for sentencing. Lopez-Gonzalez does not dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pute that the sentences were imposed for factually distinct offenses, with separate arrests. When sentences for factually distinct offenses are imposed \u201con the same day and/or in the same proceeding,\u201d those offenses are not considered related under the sentencing guidelines manual \u00a7 4A1.2. <em>United States v. Huskey, </em>137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.1998). Further, it was the revocation of parole related to the 1997 offense, not the offense itself, that was consolidated with the 2002 offense for sentencing. The district court did not err in determining that Lopez-Gonzalez\u2019s convictions were unrelated for the purpose of calculating his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Lopez-Gonzalez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Given the foregoing, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as moot. The district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
