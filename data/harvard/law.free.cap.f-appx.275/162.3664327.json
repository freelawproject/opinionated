(together, \u201cRoche\u201d) on Ms. Dooley\u2019s claims of unlawful discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), and New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination (\u201cNJLAD\u201d), as well as her claims of retaliation for protected activity under Title VII and the NJLAD. Because the District Court correctly concluded that Ms. Dooley did not present evidence showing that Roche\u2019s proffered reasons for its promotion decisions were pretextual, and because Ms. Dooley did not present evidence of a causal connection between her protected activity and any other alleged retaliation, we affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The parties are familiar with the facts of this case, so we will summarize them only briefly. Ms. Dooley is a 59-year-old African-American woman who has worked as a Roche Sales Representative since 1972 (and for Roche in some capacity since 1966). Beginning in 2002, when Ms. Dooley was 54 years old, she applied to be promoted to Oncology Specialist, interviewing without success for a series of four openings at that position. Three of the four open positions went to candidates who were both younger than Ms. Dooley and of a different race. The fourth position went to an African-American Sales Representative who was younger than Ms. Dooley.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">After being passed over for the first two of these positions, and again after the third but before the fourth, Ms. Dooley complained to the Roche Human Resources department that she had been denied promotion to an Oncology Specialist position because of her race and age. Human Resources investigated Ms. Dooley\u2019s complaints and concluded that there was no evidence of race or age discrimination with respect to the challenged hiring decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">While that investigation was under way, two of Ms. Dooley\u2019s hospital accounts were reassigned to another Sales Representative and replaced by less lucrative hospital accounts. Shortly after the investigation concluded, Roche gave Ms. Dooley a written warning for the presence of a forged signature \u2014 a doctor\u2019s signature forged by a nurse \u2014 on a form used by Ms. Dooley in connection with disbursement of pharmaceutical samples to doctors. Ms. Dooley then complained to Human Resources that she had received the written warning in retaliation for her earlier complaints about discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">In 2004, Ms. Dooley filed a complaint against Roche in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and age (in Roche\u2019s four decisions not to promote her), and unlawful retaliation (in the written reprimand \u2014 Ms. Dooley later alleged that the reassignment of hospital accounts and the third and fourth promotion decisions also constituted retaliation). Roche moved for summary judgment in 2006, and the District Court granted Roche\u2019s motion in 2007. Regarding the discrimination claims, the District Court held that Ms. Dooley had not shown that she was qualified for the position of Oncology Specialist, and that even assuming she was qualified, she had not provided evidence casting doubt on the nondiscriminatory reasons offered by Roche for its promotion decisions. Regarding the retaliation claims, the District Court held that Roche\u2019s written reprimand of Ms. Dooley did not constitute an adverse employment action; that the third promotion decision was made by someone who was not aware of Ms. Dooley\u2019s earlier complaints; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>that the fourth promotion decision was too remote from those complaints to be considered retaliation without any other evidence tending to support Ms. Dooley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We have jurisdiction over Ms. Dooley\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>See Podobnik v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>409 F.3d 584, 589 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">As the District Court recognized, we apply a burden-shifting framework to discrimination claims brought under Title VII, the ADEA, and the NJLAD. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Stanziale v. Jargowsky, </em>200 F.3d 101, 105 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1114 n. 5 (3d Cir.1997) (en banc). First, a plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination \u2014 i.e., that (1) she was a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for promotion to the sought \u2014 after position and applied but was not promoted; and (3) the position remained open or went to another employee (frequently, though not necessarily, an employee who was not a member of the protected class). <em>Olson v. GE Astrospace, </em>101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir.1996); <em>Pivirotto v. Innovative Sys., </em>191 F.3d 344, 355 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Establishment of a prima facie case shifts the burden of production to the defendant to offer evidence \u201cwhich, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the unfavorable employment decision.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d Cir.1994). Finally, \u201cto defeat summary judgment when the defendant answers the plaintiffs prima facie case with legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its action, the plaintiff must point to some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a fact-finder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Here, Ms. Dooley clearly satisfied the first element of her prima facie case, but the District Court held that she failed to establish the second element: that she was qualified for the position of Oncology Specialist. Ms. Dooley argues that this was error and that Roche admitted her to be qualified for the job. Because Roche did not contest this element of Ms. Dooley\u2019s prima facie case in the District Court or in this Court, we may assume that this element is satisfied. Also, although the parties dispute whether Roche\u2019s promotion of an African-American Sales Representative to the fourth contested Oncology Specialist position defeats Ms. Dooley\u2019s claim of racial discrimination as to that position, we will assume without deciding that Ms. Dooley has established the final element of her prima facie case for all four promotion decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The District Court similarly assumed a prima facie case, shifting the burden to Roche, who pointed to evidence that Ms. Dooley was not promoted because she did not demonstrate the clinical knowledge and clinical sales ability to adequately market Xeloda\u00ae, and because she did not interview as well as the candidates chosen for promotion. With the burden thus shifted back to Ms. Dooley, the District Court held that she did not offer sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to disbelieve Roche\u2019s claim that it passed over Ms. Dooley on the basis of her inadequate clinical knowledge of Xeloda\u00ae and clinical sales ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We agree with the District Court. Ms. Dooley points to evidence that she was stronger than the promoted Sales Representatives in certain <em>other </em>respects \u2014 including seniority, total pharmaceutical sales experience, and experience with the oncology drug Kytril\u00ae \u2014 and she states that Roche\u2019s equal-opportunity policy <em>allows </em>for consideration of seniority and experience in hiring decisions. But while these facts may be quite relevant to prove that Ms. Dooley was qualified for the job of Oncology Specialist, they do not show that Roche\u2019s proffered explanation for promoting other candidates was <em>pretextual </em>\u201cThe question is not whether the employer made the best, or even a sound, business decision; it is whether the real reason is [discrimination].\u201d <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1109 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>82 F.3d 157, 159 (7th Cir.1996)). Similarly, Ms. Dooley argues that there were irregularities in Roche\u2019s interviewing process \u2014 e.g., in one instance Roche did not respond to her in a timely fashion \u2014 but she does not explain how these irregularities would cast doubt on Roche\u2019s articulated hiring rationale or would otherwise suggest that Roche was impermissibly motivated by race or age. Finally, Ms. Dooley claims that \u201craw statistics,\u201d such as the lower number of African-American employees in Roche\u2019s Oncology division in 2002 and 2003 as compared to the higher number of Caucasian employees, support an inference of discriminatory bias. But while \u201c[statistical evidence of an employer\u2019s pattern and practice with respect to minority employment may be relevant to a showing of pretext,\u201d we have explained that conclusions cannot fairly be drawn from \u201craw numerical comparisons\u201d in the absence of \u201canalysis of either the qualified applicant pool or the flow of qualified candidates over a relevant time period.\u201d <em>Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, </em>983 F.2d 509, 542-543 (3d Cir.1992). We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Roche on Ms. Dooley\u2019s discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Ms. Dooley\u2019s retaliation claims are also governed by the <em>McDonell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., </em>109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir.1997). To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, an employee must show \u201c(1) protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after or contemporaneous with the employee\u2019s protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between the employee\u2019s protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse action.\u201d <em>Marra v. Phila. Hous. Auth., </em>497 F.3d 286, 300 (3d Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Here, Ms. Dooley claims that Roche retaliated against her for her internal complaints to Human Resources by reprimanding her in connection with the forged doctor\u2019s signature; by reassigning two of her hospital accounts; and by denying her promotion to the third or fourth open Oncology Specialist position. While the reprimand and the reassignment of accounts could constitute adverse actions for purposes of a retaliation claim, <em>see Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), Ms. Dooley fails to make a prima facie case because she does not point to any evidence that the <em>decisionmakers </em>in those instances were aware of her internal complaints (and thus that there could be a causal link between the complaints and those decisions). <em>Cf. Jones v. School Dist., </em>198 F.3d 403, 415 (3d Cir.1999) (no causal link where plaintiff \u201cproduced no evidence which could in any way be construed as showing any knowledge on the part of either Principal Gutelius or Principal Torres of [plaintiffs] previous EEO filings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Ms. Dooley argues that the District Court erred by finding that the fourth promotion decision occurred almost a year after her internal complaint (and was therefore too remote to have been causally connected) when she had in fact complained about retaliation just two months before the fourth promotion decision. <em>See Fasold v. Justice, </em>409 F.3d 178, 190 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cwhen only a short period of time separates an aggrieved employee\u2019s protected conduct and an adverse employment decision, such temporal proximity may provide an evidentiary basis from which an inference of retaliation can be drawn\u201d). But the District Court correctly determined that even assuming a prima facie case was established with respect to the third and fourth promotion decisions, Roche met its burden of articulating legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for those promotion decisions \u2014 namely, the interviewers\u2019 perceptions of Ms. Dooley\u2019s clinical knowledge and interview performance relative to the other candidates \u2014 and Ms. Dooley did not offer evidence that Roche\u2019s explanation was pretextual. <em>See Marra, </em>497 F.3d at 300 (\u201cIf the employer meets its burden, the burden of production returns to the employee, who must now show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u2018the employer\u2019s proffered explanation was false, and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Thus, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Roche on Ms. Dooley\u2019s retaliation claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
