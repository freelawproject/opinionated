R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b565-16\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b565-17\">Agust\u00edn Tenorio-Tapia pleaded guilty to reentering the United States without permission, following his removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826. He contends on appeal that his sentence of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment is excessive because the district court miscalculated his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-20\">As part of a plea agreement, Tenorio-Tapia waived the right to appeal his sentence unless \u201cthe sentence imposed is in excess of the Sentencing Guidelines (as determined by the Court or any applicable statutory minimum [sic], whichever is greater)\u201d. In exchange for this concession the prosecutor asked the district judge to give Tenorio-Tapia a sentence at the low end of the range, which the judge did. (The range calculated by the presentence report, which was adopted by the district judge, is 41 to 51 months.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-21\">Tenorio-Tapia\u2019s brief on appeal ignores his waiver. The United States filed a brief invoking the waiver and asking us to dismiss the appeal. Tenorio-Tapia did not file a reply brief, and we cannot see how the appeal can be reconciled with the waiver. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed on the basis of Tenorio-Tapia\u2019s waiver.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
