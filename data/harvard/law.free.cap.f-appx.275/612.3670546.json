R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b638-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-26\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>nying petitioners Francisco Lorenzo Garcia Juarez and Fres Binda Lopez\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). The regulations state that a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed not later than ninety days after the date on which the final order of removal was entered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). A motion to reopen must also present new evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">A review of the administrative record demonstrates that there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision that petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was untimely. Petitioners\u2019 final order of removal was entered on April 5, 2007. Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed on August 17, 2007, more than ninety days after entry of the final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">A review of the administrative record also demonstrates that there is substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision to deny petitioners\u2019 motion as materially deficient. The motion did not present any new evidence in support of petitioners\u2019 applications for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
