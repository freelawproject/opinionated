The AMHC regulations at issue require transporters of manufactured homes to become \u201cCertified Installers,\u201d and comply with a 72-hour notice requirement upon delivering a manufactured home to its final destination. Appellants claim these regulations are preempted by a federal law prohibiting states from enacting regulations \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1). AMHC defends the regulations by claiming they fall within the \u201csafety regulatory authority\u201d exception of \u00a7 14501(c)(2). We do not reach the merits of this dispute today because of the unusual procedural posture of the case. Instead, we remand with instructions for additional findings of fact so the issue may be resolved with the benefit of a more complete understanding of the regulations at issue and their impact on motor carriers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">Van Allen Taylor is a truck driver and the president of Lyman Agency, Inc., an Alabama corporation. Taylor and Lyman transport manufactured houses, but do not install those houses upon delivery. AMHC regulates the manufactured housing industry on behalf of the State of Alabama. AMHC has promulgated regulations that require transporters of manufactured homes to (1) become Certified Installers, and (2) comply with a 72-hour notice requirement upon delivering a manufactured home to its final destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">The first regulation requires \u201ctransporters\u201d of manufactured homes to become \u201ccertified installers.\u201d Ala. Admin. Code r. 535-X-12-.03. A Certified Installer is defined as \u201c[a] person certified by the Commission to install a manufactured home or manufactured building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>r. 535-X-12-.02.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To obtain certification an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>must pay a certification fee, complete an \u201cinstaller\u2019s course,\u201d pass a test, pay an annual fee, and complete a \u201crefresher course on installation\u201d every two years. <em>Id. </em>r. 535-X-12-.03. Failure to timely complete any of the certification requirements can result in the loss of certification, <em>id. </em>r. 535-X12-.03, and the imposition of fines, <em>id. </em>r. 535-X-12-.08(l). The certification requirement contains a broad exception: transporters that are working under contract with a licensed manufacturer or retailer of manufactured homes need not comply with the certification requirements. <em>Id. </em>r. 535-X-12-.03(l). The regulation\u2019s purpose is to ensure manufactured homes are installed by \u201ca person duly certified by the Commission\u201d for the \u201chealth, safety, and welfare of people who utilize manufactured homes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>r. 535-X-12-.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The second regulation at issue imposes a 72-hour notification requirement on \u201cCertified installers or anyone else who pull and drop a home or building for final site delivery/installation.... \u201d Ala. Admin. Code r. 535-X-13-.ll(4). AMHC must be given notice of a manufactured home\u2019s exact location within 72 hours of delivery. <em>Id. </em>The stated purpose of the rule is to \u201c[pjrovide for the health, safety, and welfare of people who utilize manufactured homes and buildings for their personal residences and providing safety for other adjacent properties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>r. 535-X-13-.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Taylor believed both regulations, as applied to transporters of manufactured homes, were preempted by federal law governing motor carriers. According to Taylor\u2019s complaint, he \u201crenounced, tore up and destroyed his AMHC license as an installer\u201d in the office of Mr. Sloan. Without certification Taylor continued operating a truck for Lyman and continued to transport manufactured 'homes. According to the complaint, criminal charges were brought against Taylor based on allegations that he engaged in the illegal transportation and installation of manufactured homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">On February 3, 2006, believing AMHC\u2019s regulations were preempted by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501, Taylor and Lyman filed this action in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against the State of Alabama, the Alabama Attorney General, the Alabama Manufactured Housing Commission (AMHC), other individuals in their official capacities as agents of AMHC, and the director of the AMHC, Jim Sloan, in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">A little over a month later, Defendants responded by filing a motion seeking to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or in the alternative, seeking summary judgment under Rule 56. The district court issued an order indicating it would not consider arguments for summary judgment at such an early stage of the litigation. Subsequently, Plaintiffs amended their complaint and Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">On April 18, 2006, Defendants responded to the amended complaint by filing an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). The 12(c) motion relied both on the pleadings and evi-dentiary submissions. Shortly thereafter the parties sought and were granted a voluntary stay of proceedings to permit them to explore settlement and attempt to seek guidance from federal regulatory authorities. Neither effort was successful and the stay was lifted on July 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">The parties were instructed to resume briefing on the Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and to conform their submissions to \u201cAppendix II\u201d of the court\u2019s initial order. The appendix is titled \u201cSummary Judgment Requirements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent memo, in opposition, however, did not contain a statement of undisputed facts in accordance with the requirements of Appendix II. The district court heard oral argument on Defendants\u2019 motion in June 2007. At oral argument, there was no indication as to whether the motion had been converted to one for summary judgment or whether the court intended to exclude the Defendants\u2019 eviden-tiary submission. The district court issued an order granting Defendants\u2019 motion. The order characterized Defendants\u2019 motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed all claims. With respect to the preemption issue, the district court held Alabama\u2019s regulations were not preempted under \u00a7 14501 because they fell within the safety regulatory authority exception of \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">On appeal, Taylor and Lyman only challenge the dismissal of them claim seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of Alabama, AMHC, and Jim Sloan from enforcement of AMHC regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We easily affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the State of Alabama and AMHC because claims against these entities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1355-56, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974); <em>Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2309-10, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). What remains is Appellants\u2019 claim seeking prospective injunctive and declaratory relief against state officials on the basis that they are enforcing state laws in derogation of federal law. <em>See Fla. Ass\u2019n of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. Fla. Dep't of Health &amp; Rehab. Servs., </em>225 F.3d 1208, 1220 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not generally prohibit suits against state officials in federal court seeking only prospective injunctive or declaratory relief .... \u201d); <em>see also Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908); <em>Sandoval v. Hagan, </em>197 F.3d 484, 500 (11th Cir.1999), <em>ovewuled on other grounds, </em>532 U.S. 275, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We confine our discussion to the resolution of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>Moore v. Liberty Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>267 F.3d 1209, 1213 (11th Cir.2001). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) a party may move for a judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings are closed. \u201cIf ... matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>A. Background for \u00a7 11501(c) Preemption Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that \u201cinterfere with, or are contrary to the laws of congress\u201d are preempted by federal law. <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S.(9 Wheat.) 1, 211, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824). Preemption analysis begins \u201cwith the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., Inc., </em>536 U.S. 424, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 2232, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002) (quoting <em>Wis. Pub. Intervenor v. Mortier, </em>501 U.S. 597, 111 S.Ct. 2476, 2482, 115 L.Ed.2d 532 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The Interstate Commerce Act, as amended,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was enacted by Congress for the purpose of preempting state trucking regulation. <em>Rowe v. N.H. Motor Transp. Ass\u2019n, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 989, 993-94, 169 L.Ed.2d 933 (2008). The Act replaced the then-existing patchwork of intrastate trucking laws with a uniform federal standard. It expressly preempts regulations by States \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1). This statutory language was borrowed from the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and has been interpreted consistently by the Supreme Court in both settings. <em>See Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 994-95; <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 2034, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992). In <em>Morales, </em>the Court interpreted the term \u201crelating to\u201d broadly. It determined \u201c[sjtate enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to\u201d carrier \u201crates, routes, or services are preempted.\u201d 112 S.Ct. at 2037 (quotations omitted) (holding federal law preempts State enforcement of consumer-fraud statutes against airlines). The same broad interpretation applies to the \u201crelated to\u201d language of \u00a7 14501(c)(1). <em>Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 994-95.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Despite the broad reach of \u00a7 14501(c)(l)\u2019s statutory language, \u201cfedei-al law does not pre-empt state laws that affect rates, routes, or services in \u2018too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 997 (quoting <em>Morales, </em>112 S.Ct. at 2040) (\u201c[S]tate regulation that broadly prohibits certain forms of conduct and affects, say, truckdrivers, only in their capacity as membex\u2019s of the public <em>(e.g., </em>a prohibition on smoking in certain public places)\u201d would not be preempted). Instead, a state law is only preempted if it has a <em>\u201csignificant </em>impact on carrier rates, routes, or services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">While Congress generally preempted State regulation of motor carriers, it simultaneously carved out an exception to the rule by saving to the States \u201csafety regulatory authority ... with respect to motor vehicles.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A); <em>Ours Garage, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2280. A \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is defined as \u201ca vehicle, machine, tractor, trailer, or semitrailer propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used on a highway in transportation____\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102(16). To fall within the safety regulatory authority exception, a State\u2019s regulation must be <em>genuinely responsive </em>to safety concerns. Any regulation \u201cthat is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns gaxmers no exemption from \u00a7 14501(c)(l)\u2019s preemption rule.\u201d <em>Ours Garage, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2237 (holding safety regulatory exception extends to municipalities); <em>see also Galactic Towing, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, </em>341 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In <em>Ours Garage, </em>the Supreme Court noted the Act\u2019s overall purpose was to deregulate certain aspects of intrastate transportation that placed unreasonable burdens on free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers. 122 S.Ct. at 2236. At the same time, \u201cCongress\u2019 clear purpose in \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States\u2019 economic authority over motor carriers of property, \u00a7 14501(e)(1), \u2018not restrict\u2019 the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">In light of these cases, a framework exists for analyzing motor carrier preemption claims under \u00a7 14501(c). First, a court must determine whether the regulation at issue is \u201crelated to,\u201d that is, has a <em>connection with </em>a price, route, or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property. <em>See Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 994-95; <em>Morales, </em>112 S.Ct. at 2037. Second, if a regulation does have a connection with a price, route, or service, it will be preempted if the regulation has a <em>significant impact </em>on those prices, routes, or services. <em>See Rowe, </em>128 S.Ct. at 997-98. If the impact of the State\u2019s regulation is merely tenuous, remote, or peripheral the regulation is not preempted by \u00a7 14501(c)(1). <em>See id. </em>Third, if a regulation would otherwise be preempted by \u00a7 14501(c)(1), it can be saved under the safety regulatory authority exception if the regulation concerns safety \u201cwith x\u2019espect to motor vehicles,\u201d \u00a7 14501(c)(2)(A), and is <em>genuinely responsive </em>to the State\u2019s safety concerns, <em>see Ours Garage, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2237; <em>Galactic Towing, </em>341 F.3d at 1251-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">\n<em>B. District Court Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">We now turn to apply this analysis to the district coux-t\u2019s opinion. Initially, we must determine whether this case was decided on summary judgment or on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Defendants submitted evidence with their motion for judgment on the pleadings, yet it is unclear whether the court specifically converted the motion to one for summary judgment, and consequently, it is difficult to be satisfied each party received adequate notice of the procedural posture of the decision. The distinct eoui\u2019t did in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>struct the parties to conform their briefing to \u201cAppendix II\u201d of its initial order, which governed the requirements of summary judgment. At the same time, a review of the oral argument transcript and order leaves us uncertain what underlying facts were relied upon by the district court in reaching its ultimate conclusion that the regulations at issue are a valid exercise of the State\u2019s safety regulatory authority. While there may be clear cut cases where preemption questions can be resolved on the pleadings, we observe it is far more common to resolve issues like the ones here at summary judgment with the benefit of a complete understanding of the impact of the regulations. <em>See, e.g., Ours Garage, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2231; <em>Galactic Towing, </em>341 F.3d at 1250; <em>R. Mayer of Atlanta, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, </em>158 F.3d 538, 540 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated by Ours Garage, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2232; <em>N.H. Motor Transp. Ass\u2019n v. Rowe, </em>448 F.3d 66, 69 (1st Cir.2006), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 989, 169 L.Ed.2d 933. In addition to being uncertain of the procedural basis for the district court\u2019s decision, we note the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent motor carrier preemption jurisprudence, articulated in <em>Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 989, 169 L.Ed.2d 933 (2008). For these reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s preemption analysis and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On remand, the district court should permit further development of the factual record and make findings that include the following matters: (a) Are both of the state requirements at issue regulations that are \u201crelated to a price, route or service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14501(c)(1)? What facts support this determination?; (b) How do the regulations impact motor carriers?; (c) Is a manufactured home a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of the \u201csafety regulatory authority\u201d exception of \u00a7 14501(c)(2)? If so, why is it properly characterized as a \u201cmotor vehicle?\u201d; (d) Do the safety concerns expressed in the state regulations at issue relate to the safety of the manufactured home <em>after </em>it is delivered, or do they relate to highway safety while the home is being delivered? What facts support this conclusion?; (e) What are the articulated safety concerns for the regulations and to what extent do the regulations address those concerns? In particular, what kind of training does the \u201cinstaller\u2019s course\u201d entail?;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (f) is AMHC responsible for Alabama public safety initiatives with respect to motor vehicles? The above findings should be discussed as they relate to both the Certified Installer requirement and the 72-hour notification requirement; each requirement should be analyzed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">We remand for further proceedings and emphasize that nothing in this opinion should be construed as an analysis of any of the AMHC regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">We do not reach the merits of the preemption dispute today because of the unusual procedural posture of the case. We vacate the district court\u2019s order with respect to its preemption analysis under \u00a7 14501(c) and remand for further proceedings and additional findings to allow the preemption issue to be resolved with the benefit of a more complete understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>ing of the regulations at issue and their impact on motor carriers. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the State of Alabama and its agency, the Alabama Manufactured Housing Commission, and we do not disturb its other rulings with respect to claims for money damages, which were not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\">. We do not address Appellants\u2019 claims regarding the preemption of other Alabama regulations because they were not pled. Specifically, Appellants briefed arguments that Alabama\u2019s insurance and liability requirements are preempted by the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14706 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(3). Presumably Appellants refer to part 15 of the AMHC regulations. However, we cannot address these claims because they were not fairly raised in the complaint. In contrast to the other challenged regulations that were specifically identified and attached to the complaint, the liability and insurance regulations were only vaguely alluded to and the complaint makes no specific reference to the Carmack Amendment or \u00a7 14501(c)(3) so as to fairly place Defendants on notice of the claims against them. Further, Plaintiffs did not seek permission to amend their complaint to include these claims even after the pleading flaw was raised as a defense in briefing before the district court. Whether Plaintiffs will be allowed to amend their complaint on remand to include these claims will rest within the sound discretion of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-17\">.

Maine did not argue, as Appellees argue here, that the law fell within the statutorily created exception for \"safety regulatory authority.\u201d Rather, Maine argued for the recognition of a separate exception for the exercise of a State\u2019s public health authority in the context of underage smoking. <em>Id. </em>at 996-97. The Court concluded no such exception exists. <em>Id. </em>at 997. Despite the difference between <em>Rowe </em>and the present case, <em>Rowe </em>is helpful here to the extent it provides general guidance for determining, in the first instance, whether a regulation is within the preemptive scope of \u00a7 14501(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b868-9\">. Is the content of the training limited to installation, or \u2014 as was represented at oral argument \u2014 does it entail training on the safe transport of manufactured homes? If the training does involve the \"safe transport\u201d of manufactured homes, does this \u201csafe transport\u201d relate to highway safety or does it only relate to delivery of the homes in undamaged condition? If the training does involve highway safety, what percentage of the training course is dedicated to this material?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
