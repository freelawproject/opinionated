A plaintiffs failure to prosecute or to comply with the federal procedural rules or an order of the court may warrant involuntary dismissal. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). We review a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Ballard v. Carlson, </em>882 F.2d 93, 95-96 (4th Cir.1989). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Burts v. Greenville Clerk of Court, </em>No. 8:07-cv-03011-HMH-BHH (D.S.C. Dec. 19, 2007). We deny Burts\u2019 motion for a jury trial. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
