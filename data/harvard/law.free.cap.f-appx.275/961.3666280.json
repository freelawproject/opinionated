(Burton). Burton opposes. Baychar replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-24\">Baychar sued Burton for patent infringement. Burton filed separate summary judgment motions, asserting invalidity based on anticipation and obviousness. The district court granted Burton\u2019s summary judgment motion based on anticipation and denied as moot Burton\u2019s motion based on obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-26\">Baychar appealed to this court challenging, among other issues, the district court\u2019s determination regarding anticipation. Burton filed a conditional cross-appeal challenging the district court\u2019s denial, based on mootness, of its summary judgment motion concerning obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-27\">We determine that Burton\u2019s cross-appeal is improper because, if successful, it would not expand the scope of the judgment in Burton\u2019s favor. <em>See Bailey v. Dart Container Corp. of Mich., </em>292 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2002). However, Burton may as an appellee raise its arguments regarding the district court\u2019s denial of its summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-28\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b987-29\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b987-30\">(1) The motion is granted. Appeal no. 2008-1060 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-31\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs in 2008-1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-32\">(3) The revised official caption in 2008-1053 is reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
