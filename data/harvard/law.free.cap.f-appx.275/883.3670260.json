Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 790, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973), the Supreme Court stated that \u201ccounsel should be provided in cases where, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>being informed of his right to request counsel, the probationer or parolee makes such a request based on a timely and colorable claim (i) that he has not committed the alleged violation of the conditions upon which he is at liberty....\u201d The record here demonstrates that Beverly\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel was timely; however, neither the hearing officer nor the district court addressed the colorability of Beverly\u2019s claim that he did not commit the alleged violations of the conditions upon which he was at liberty. Consequently, we are unable to adequately review Beverly\u2019s claim as a result of the incomplete record. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
