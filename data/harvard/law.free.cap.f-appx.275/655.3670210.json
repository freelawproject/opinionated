The Government cross-appeals Boyer\u2019s sentence of 12 months and 1 day, which falls below the Guidelines range of 46-57 months. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-26\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b681-27\">The district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. The district court found that Victor Vilaplana, bankruptcy trustee for Basic Research Corporation, \u201cmaintained control and custody over all the documents in the office,\u201d \u2014 including attorney-client privileged documents \u2014 with the exception of Smith Technology Development, LLC\u2019s (\u201cSTD\u201d) documents and Boyer\u2019s personal documents. The district court also found that Boyer was given an opportunity to segregate STD documents. Finally, the district court found that Boyer had \u201cfail[ed] to establish that any personal records were produced,\u201d and that, in any event, \u201c[ujndisputed evidence reveals that the offices occupied by Mr. Boyer were under the custody and control of the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ruptcy trustee.\u201d These finding are not clearly erroneous. The district court correctly concluded that no documents outside the scope of the subpoena were produced. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Castillo, </em>324 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence,\u201d but \u201c[f]actual findings of the district court are reviewed for clear error.\u201d). Therefore, the Fourth Amendment was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">II. Boyer\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The district court correctly calculated the Guidelines sentence. It then exercised its discretion to sentence Boyer to 12 months and 1 day, a sentence that falls well below the Guidelines range of 46-57 months. The district court based its sentencing decision on numerous factors, including Boyer\u2019s lifetime of commitment to the underprivileged, that co-defendant Smith received a sentence of 37 months, Boyer\u2019s belief that the inventions underlying the fraud scheme ultimately would be successful, and Boyer\u2019s intent to use his profits from the scheme toward philanthropic ends. In light of the district court\u2019s consideration of these factors, as well as the Government\u2019s concession at oral argument that \u201cthe wind [has been] taken somewhat out of [its] sails\u201d by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to sentence Boyer to 12 months and 1 day was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 594-95 (\u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may therefore take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation irom the Guidelines. We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
