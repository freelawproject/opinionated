United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), did not alter this court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s construction of the Guidelines or findings of fact, <em>see United States v. Cisneros\u2014Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008), the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) <em>(post-Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Hall committed pei\u2019jury regarding the amount of methamphetamine attributable to him because the finding is supported by the testimony of Danny Paine and the information contained in the PSR. Moreover, the district court\u2019s finding that Hall intentionally provided false testimony on a material issue with the intent to persuade the court to lower his sentence provided the requisite elements of a perjury determination and warranted application of the enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 and a denial of acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94-95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
