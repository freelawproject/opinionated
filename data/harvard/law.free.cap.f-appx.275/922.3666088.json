Williams\u2019s application was denied by the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services for lack of good moral character required under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10(b)(l)(ii) because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony on June 24,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under [Fed. R.Civ.P.] 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Castro v. Sec\u2019y of Homeland Sec., </em>472 F.3d 1334, 1336 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">In order to be eligible for naturalization, an alien must establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that he, \u201c[flor all relevant time periods under this paragraph, has been and continues to be a person of good moral character....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.2(a)(7). \u201cAn applicant shall be found to lack good moral character, if the applicant has been ... [c]onvicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the [Immigration and Nationality] Act on or after November 29, 1990.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10(b)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">These rules derive from \u00a7 101(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) providing \u201c[n]o person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who ... at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in subsection (a)(43) of this section).\u201d <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f). The 1990 amendments to the INA that established this permanent, statutory bar to good moral character for aliens convicted of certain enumerated aggravated felonies also limited the application of this amendment to those convictions that occurred on or after the effective date of the Act, November 29, 1990. <em>See </em>Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 509(b), 104 Stat. 4978, 5051 (1990); <em>see also Matter of Reyes, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 789, 792 (BIA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Williams was initially convicted of trafficking in cocaine by a state court in Florida on May 3,1990. However, following his successful appeal, the final judgments of conviction and sentence were vacated on June 1, 1992. After a new trial, Williams was convicted on June 24, 1992 of trafficking in cocaine, sentenced to pay a $50,000 fine and to be imprisoned for ten years. The judgment of conviction and sentence stated: \u201cDONE AND ORDERED in Open Court at Dade County, Florida this 24th day of June, 1992. NUNC PRO TUNC: May 3,1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">On appeal, Williams does not dispute that his conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony as defined according to \u00a7 101(a)(43) of the INA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Williams argues that because the judgment of his June 24, 1992 conviction was issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to May 3, 1990, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>statutory bar to good moral character should not apply to him because the judgment\u2019s effective date of May 3, 1990 means that his conviction occurred before the November 29, 1990 effective date of the 1990 amendments to the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Williams\u2019s argument would have merit if the state court had issued the judgment on the 1992 conviction <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to correct a clerical error or to document a previously taken action. <em>See Sullivan v. State, </em>898 So.2d 105, 107 n. 2 (Fla.2d Dist.Ct.App.2005) (\u201cA court may correct clerical mistakes in its own judgments and records, nunc pro tunc ... \u201d). Here however, Williams successfully appealed his original May 3, 1990 conviction for trafficking in cocaine and as a result the final judgments of conviction and sentence ultimately were vacated on June 1, 1992. He received a new trial and was convicted for trafficking in cocaine on June 24, 1992. Although the trial court included the language \u201cNUNC PRO TUNC: May 3, 1990\u201d in Williams\u2019s June 24, 1992 judgment, it was not merely correcting a clerical mistake or documenting a previously taken action as there was nothing to which the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order could refer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Williams is statutorily barred from establishing good moral character under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10(b)(l)(ii) on the basis that he was convicted of an aggravated felony after November 29, 1990, and thereby dismissing his complaint for failure to state a legal claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Williams additionally argues that the dismissal of his complaint penalized him for exercising his constitutional right to appeal his conviction, in that had he not appealed his 1990 conviction, he would not be statutorily barred from qualifying for naturalization. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe power to make someone a citizen of the United States has not been conferred upon the federal courts ... as one of them generally applicable equitable powers,\u201d but that \u201cit has been given them as a specific function to be performed in strict compliance with the terms of an authorizing statute which says that \u2018[a] person may be naturalized ... in the manner and under the conditions prescribed in this subchapter, <em>and not otherwise.\u2019 \u201d I.N.S. v. Pangilinan, </em>486 U.S. 875, 883-84, 108 S.Ct. 2210, 100 L.Ed.2d 882 (1988) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421(d)). The Supreme Court acknowledged that an alien can become a U.S. citizen \u201conly upon the terms and conditions specified by Congress\u201d and that the duty of the courts \u201cis rigidly to enforce the legislative will in respect of a matter so vital to the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884, 108 S.Ct. 2210. \u201cNeither by application of the doctrine of estoppel, nor by invocation of equitable powers, nor by any other means does a court have the power to confer citizenship in violation of [the limitations set by Congress.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 885, 108 S.Ct. 2210.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">We agree that had Williams\u2019s original May 3, 1990 judgment of conviction for trafficking in cocaine and sentence not been disturbed, it in itself would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>been a statutory bar to Williams\u2019s establishment of the requisite good moral character for naturalization under \u00a7 101(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f). However, his subsequent conviction in 1992, following a successful appeal granting him a new trial, has rendered him statutorily ineligible for naturalization. Because we are not at liberty to disregard the statutory terms and conditions that Congress has specified for conferring citizenship, such as those pertaining to the establishment of good moral character, we cannot exercise our equitable powers to confer citizenship where the governing statutes would prohibit the same. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019s complaint for failure to state an equitable claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Because Williams is statutorily barred from establishing good moral character necessary for naturalization due to his June 24, 1992 conviction of an aggravated felony, the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Williams also has not stated an equitable claim on which a court could grant him the relief he is seeking. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\">. \"[Ijllicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime\u201d is an \"aggravated felony.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-5\">.
