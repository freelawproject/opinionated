We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-23\">The Fund is not foreclosed from making allegations or claims in the SAC that are inconsistent with or contradicted by allegations or claims made in the Fund\u2019s previous complaint. <em>See PAE Gov\u2019t Servs. v. MPRI, Inc., </em>514 F.3d 856, 858-60 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">Fraud is not an essential element of the claims raised in the SAC, and the SAC neither specifically alleges fraud, nor does it allege facts that <em>necessarily </em>constitute fraud. <em>See Vess v. CIBA-GEIGY Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1104-05 (9th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, the allegations in the SAC do not \u201csound in fraud\u201d and the SAC is not required to comply with the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>We have considered and reject the additional arguments raised by Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b626-5\">RYMER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">I concur because the majority\u2019s is a fair read of <em>Vess v. CIBA-GEIGY Corp. USA, </em>317 F.3d 1097, 1104-05 (9th Cir.2003), and <em>PAE Gov\u2019t Servs., Inc. v. MPRI, Inc., </em>514 F.3d 856, 858-60 (9th Cir.2007). That said, it is unclear to me how <em>Vess </em>\u2014 which is not a securities case \u2014 melds with <em>In re Stac Elec. Sec. Litig., </em>89 F.3d 1399 (9th Cir.1996), and <em>In re Daou Sys., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir.2005) \u2014 which are. It is also difficult to square the strict liability nature of a Section 12 and 15 Securities Act violation with a <em>Vess </em>or <em>Stac </em>analysis. And it is tough to read the amended pleading in this case as claiming anything other than a classic securities fraud. For sure the magic words are missing, and the plaintiff is the master of the complaint; still the scheme alleged in the amended pleading walks and talks like fraud, as did the scheme averred in the original pleading. It\u2019s hard to say that Merix\u2019s reputa-tional harm (which Rule 9(b) is there to protect) is any less obvious in the amended pleading than it was in the original pleading. Perhaps it is time we tried to straighten our law out.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
