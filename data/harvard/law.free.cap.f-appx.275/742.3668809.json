Petitioners further allege that their due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s failure to allow them to present their evidence of hardship, and the BIA\u2019s failure to examine the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The BIA considered the new evidence of alleged hardship submitted by petitioners, and we conclude that the BIA acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. We further reject petitioners\u2019 claim that the BIA\u2019s consideration of the new evidence constituted a due process violation where the BIA\u2019s decision was not \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>See Singh v.
