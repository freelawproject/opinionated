Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Camargo Diaz failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 785 (a motion to reopen must establish prima fa-cie eligibility for underlying relief). The record before the BIA did not establish that Camargo Diaz had a qualifying relative for purposes of his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (listing requirements for cancellation of removal for nonpermanent residents).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review Camargo Diaz\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing his direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
