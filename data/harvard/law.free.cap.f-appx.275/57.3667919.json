Videla, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhen Xiang Weng, </em>No. A77 317 115 (B.I.A. May 17, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 317 115 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">As an initial matter, although Weng is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum only\u201d proceedings \u2014 as opposed to an actual removal order \u2014 we nonetheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\u201cIt is well established that the submissions of a <em>pro se </em>litigant must be construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they <em>suggest.\u201d Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The agency permissibly based its adverse credibility determination on the following: (1) petitioner\u2019s lack of familiarity as to where his sister attended church services in China, even though he testified to having lived with her, and even though her own affidavit stated that she attended underground church services in China and that she and Weng were both \u201cgreatly influenced by [their uncle]\u201d; (2) petitioner\u2019s testimony that he \u201corganized an underground church\u201d (an allegation that was not included in his original or amended asylum application); and (3) Weng\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Because substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, its denial of Weng\u2019s asylum claim was not improper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Moreover, because the only evidence of a threat to Weng\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination necessarily precluded success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Because Weng failed to meaningfully challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before this Court, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Weng has similarly waived his illegal departure from China as a basis for relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ABM\">. Because we can \"confidently predict\u201d that the agency would reach the same conclusion</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
