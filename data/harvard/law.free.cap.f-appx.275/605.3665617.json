FLETCHER, FISHER and PAEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-19\"> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b631-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 summary affir-mance of the immigration judge\u2019s decision finding petitioner removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6) for having pled guilty to falsely representing herself to be a citizen of the United States in violation of federal law pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-26\">Petitioner presented one argument to the agency and to this court. She contends the waiver provision in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i) violated her equal protection rights because the statute does not provide the possibility of a discretionary waiver for those found removable for having fraudulently claimed United States citizenship pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(ii), as it does for those found removable for having generally committed fraud or misrepresentation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(i). We conclude that petitioner has failed to meet her burden to show that the statute\u2019s classifications with regard to the availability of a waiver are \u201cwholly irrational.\u201d <em>Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir.2004). Petitioner\u2019s equal protection argument therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-27\">Respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">To the extent petitioner requests a stay of voluntary departure, that request is denied because the agency did not grant petitioner voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
