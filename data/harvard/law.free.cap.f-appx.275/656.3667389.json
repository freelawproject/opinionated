The retainer provided that the \u201cclaims are being asserted in a class action\u201d and described the Wilbers as the class representatives. The retainer provided, \u201cAs attorneys for the class, [the attorneys] will be entitled to a portion of any settlement or judgment proceeds.\u201d The retainer did not specify what fees, if any, the attorneys would be owed if the class action were unsuccessful or if a court denied class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">During the class action proceedings, the Wilbers filed for bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Trustee, Appellee Gary Deschenes, substituted for the Wilbers in the class action. The district court denied certification to the proposed class. The district court stated that even if there were a class, the Wilbers could not have served as the class representatives because they did not qualify as members of the putative class. <em>See Lierboe v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>350 F.3d 1018, 1022 (9th Cir.2003). The Bankruptcy Trustee then settled the Wilbers\u2019 individual claims with the lending company for $75,000. The attorneys filed this action in an attempt to recover a percentage of this settlement as fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The attorneys argue that they are entitled to recover fees from the settlement of the Wilbers\u2019 individual claims because the retainer created an express trust that required any settlements be used to benefit the putative class. As an alternative, the attorneys argue that the retainer estopped the Wilbers from pursuing their individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Neither the attorneys\u2019 trust nor estoppel arguments are persuasive. The retainer fails to satisfy the elements of a trust. <em>See </em>Mont.Code. Ann. \u00a7 72-33-201 through 207; \u00a7 601 (2007). There is no evidence that the Wilbers intended to create a trust when they signed the retainer agreement, and there is no evidence that the Wilbers placed their individual claims in a trust for the benefit of the putative class. <em>See In re Zrubek, </em>149 B.R. 631, 635-36 (Bkrtcy. D.Mont.1993). The retainer agreement does not unambiguously apply to the Wilbers\u2019 individual claims, so it is unavailing for the attorneys to claim that the Wilbers promised to abandon their individual claims by signing the retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">The attorneys also cannot look to the terms of the retainer agreement to establish their right to a percentage of the settlement. The retainer repeatedly refers to the attorneys as the attorneys <em>for the class </em>and does not include any discussion of the attorneys\u2019 representation of the Wil-bers as individuals. The attorneys may recover fees only if the retainer unambiguously gave them a percentage of the Wil-bers\u2019 individual claims. There is no way to read the terms of the retainer to achieve that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">We affirm the order of the district court that the attorneys are not entitled to recover from the settlement of the Wilbers\u2019 individual claims. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order without limitation, so we also affirm the quantum meruit award to Sullivan Tabaracci <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>for work done on the Wilbers\u2019 individual claims prior to the signing of the 1999 retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
