R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-29\">The petitioner appeals the dismissal by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas of his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-30\">In his petition, the petitioner challenged a criminal judgment entered by the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>States District Court for the Eastern District of California following his conviction for arson resulting in death. He alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, that he was denied his constitutional right to self-representation, and prosecutorial misconduct. The district court dismissed the petition, concluding that the petitioner was challenging the legality of his conviction, and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides the petitioner with an adequate and effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Normally, \u201c \u2018[a] petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 attacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity and must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined. A [section 2255 motion] attacks the legality of detention, and must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haugh v. Booker, </em>210 F.3d 1147, 1149 (10th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996)). Section 2241 \u201cis not an additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Bradshaw, </em>86 F.3d at 166. Only if the petitioner shows that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge the validity of a judgment or sentence may a prisoner petition for such a remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The petitioner has not established the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The mere fact that he was denied relief under \u00a7 2255 does not render it inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id. </em>\u201cFailure to obtain relief under \u00a7 2255 does not establish that the remedy so provided is either inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is AFFIRMED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
