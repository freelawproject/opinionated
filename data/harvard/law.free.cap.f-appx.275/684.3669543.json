R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">Gary Rushwam appeals his jury conviction and sentence of 188 months for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment rights were violated. <em>United States v. Van Poyck, </em>77 F.3d 285, 290 (9th Cir.1996) (Fourth Amendment); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>476 F.3d 791, 796 (9th Cir. 2007) (Fifth Amendment); <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>208 F.3d 675, 679 (9th Cir.2000) (Sixth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">We reject Rushwam\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s admission of recorded telephone calls that Rushwam made from jail constituted a Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment violation. Rushwam had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the outbound calls he made from jail, <em>Van Poyck, </em>77 F.3d at 291, and the recorded conversations were not the result of a government-initiated interrogation. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300-01, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>Ortega, </em>203 F.3d at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-19\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s rulings on a motion to suppress and the validity of a search warrant. <em>United States v. Crews, </em>502 F.3d 1130, 1135 (9th Cir.2007). \u201cA magistrate judge\u2019s finding of probable cause is entitled to great deference and this court will not find a search warrant invalid if the magistrate judge had a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for concluding that the supporting affidavit established probable cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>We reject also Rushwam\u2019s argument that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, and that the firearms were not in plain view. The totality of the circumstances supports a determination that probable cause for the search warrant existed. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-31, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Furthermore, the firearms were lawfully seized pursuant to the plain-view doctrine because: 1) Officer Hernandez was lawfully present in the room where the firearms were located pursuant to the search warrant; 2) the incriminating nature of the firearms was immediately apparent because Officer Hernandez knew that Rushwam was a convicted felon; and 3) Officer Hernandez had a lawful right to seize the firearms as evidence of a crime because he knew that Rushwam was a convicted felon. <em>See United States v. Wong, </em>334 F.3d 831, 838 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We review de novo whether a jury instruction accurately describes the elements of the charged offense. <em>United States v. Heredia, </em>483 F.3d 913, 921 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). We review for abuse of discretion whether the required factual foundation for the requested instruction exists. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Rushwam\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s possession instruction did not provide the jury with an explanation of constructive possession fails also. The district court\u2019s instruction was taken almost verbatim from the Ninth Circuit Model Jury Instruction. <em>See </em>Ninth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions \u00a7 3.18 (2007). \u201cThis instruction is all-inclusive. There is no need to attempt to distinguish further between actual and constructive possession and sole and joint possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. This instruction sufficiently covers constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Finally, we review de novo \u201ca district court\u2019s conclusion that a prior conviction may be used as a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallaher, </em>275 F.3d 784, 789 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The plain language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) requires that the defendant have \u201cthree previous convictions.\u201d Because an <em>Alford </em>plea may properly be considered a conviction for the purposes of imposing a sentence enhancement, we reject Rushwam\u2019s argument that the district court improperly used two prior <em>Alford </em>pleas to calculate his sentence enhancement. <em>See United States v. Guerrero-Velasquez, </em>434 F.3d 1193, 1194, 1197 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
