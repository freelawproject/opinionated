Accordingly, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss in part is granted because this court lacks jurisdiction to review any orders entered by the district court before May 7, 2007. <em>See </em>Fed.

Appellant raises no error in relation to the district court\u2019s May 10, 2007 order. Furthermore, our review of the record and the opening brief reflects that the district court did not err in striking from the docket in case no.
