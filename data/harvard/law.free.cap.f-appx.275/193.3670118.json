The district court sentenced him to a total of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was above the advisory sentencing guideline range. Mora appeals, challenging the denial of his motion for judgment -of acquittal on two counts of the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense, the imposition of an obstruction of justice enhancement, the reasonableness of his sentence, and the imposition of non-mandatory conditions of supervised release. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court \u201cdo[es] not review the credibility of the witnesses and assumefs] the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). The court \u201cmust consider circumstantial as well as direct evidence, and allow the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">In order to convict Mora under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the Government had to establish that (1) Mora had been previously convicted of a felony, (2) Mora knowingly possessed the firearm, and (3) the possession was in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>430 F.3d 215, 218 (4th Cir.2005). Mora stipulated to the first and third elements at trial. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and allowing the Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences therefrom, the evidence showed that Mora traded a stolen Beretta shotgun to a friend in exchange for a Glock 17 pistol with the serial number AHM397US. On two separate subsequent occasions, witnesses saw Mora wearing a Glock 17 pistol in a holster on his hip. We conclude that jurors could reasonably convict Mora of the charged offense \u2014 possession of the Glock 17 pistol with the serial number AHM397US \u2014 on this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">Mora also challenges the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentencing guidelines offense level for obstruction of justice, pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d). Mora contends that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the facts supporting the sentence enhancement were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the jury. However, pursuant to the remedial portion of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts will continue to make decisions about sentencing factors on the preponderance of the evidence, taking into account that the resulting Guidelines range is advisory only. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 71-72 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As to the district court\u2019s obstruction of justice determination, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1, a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice may be imposed if the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATo\">willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The evidence shows that after Mora had been arrested on the charged offenses, he engaged in several telephone communications with his wife regarding the existence of an air pistol that was \u201cnearly identical\u201d to the Glock 17 the witnesses claimed Mora possessed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Mora asked his wife to look at an internet site that sold the air pistol and to ask the friend who had given him the Glock 17 if he was correct that the real Glock 17 and the air pistol were indistinguishable. Mora asked his wife to purchase the air pistol because it was \u201cperfectly legal for a convicted felon to have one\u201d and it would be \u201cexhibit one in [his] defense.\u201d Mora discussed at length his desire to put \u201cas much doubt in the jury\u2019s mind as possible\u201d as to whether he committed the charged offenses. Based on this evidence, we find the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous and they adequately supported a two-point enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Mora also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, including the district court\u2019s determination that Mora\u2019s Guidelines criminal history category did not adequately represent his criminal history or the likelihood that he would commit future offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, it must calculate the appropriate advisory Guidelines range. It must then consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">If there are no procedural errors, the appellate court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. While the court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, it may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify imposing a sentence above the Guidelines range and to its determination regarding the extent of any departure. Even if the reviewing court would have reached a different sentencing result on its own, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Here, the district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Mora, properly calculating the Guidelines range and considering that recommendation in conjunction with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In so doing, it granted the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure based on underrepresentation of Mora\u2019s lengthy and diverse criminal history and the likelihood that Mora would commit future offenses. However, instead of readjusting Mora\u2019s Guidelines range by a particular amount, the district court decided to take those facts into consideration with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining its sentence. In light of the facts of this case, and the district court\u2019s meaningful articulation of its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its bases for departing from the recommended Guideline range, we find the district court\u2019s decision to depart, and the extent of the departure, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Lastly, Mora challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of certain special conditions of supervised release. Because Mora failed to object to the conditions of supervised release in the district court, this court reviews them for plain error. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>478 F.3d 864, 866 (8th Cir.2007). To meet the plain error standard: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; and (3) the error must affect substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If the three elements of this standard are met, this court may still exercise its discretion to notice the error only \u201cif the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Under this standard, we find Mora has not met his burden of proving the district court committed plain error in imposing his special conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> Mora stipulated that the telephone conversations had been lawfully recorded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
