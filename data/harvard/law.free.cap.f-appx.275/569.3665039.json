Burdick Memorial Health Care Facility (\u201cthe Facility\u201d) which is operated by Indian Heath Services (\u201cIHS\u201d). They seek reversal of the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grant of summary judgment on them Privacy Act claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-26\">As part of an earlier Privacy Act investigation, the IHS officer in charge of Privacy Act matters prepared an investigative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>report, concluding that the appellants had violated the Privacy Act rights of certain co-workers. Those co-workers initiated a lawsuit, and the investigative report was released during discovery in that case. Subsequently, the appellants initiated this action, contending that their own Privacy Act rights had been violated when the investigative report was released in the prior lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We agree, however, with the district court that the investigative report, which was filed chronologically by the Facility and was not subject to being retrieved based on any personally identifiable information, such as name or social security number, was not retrieved from a \u201csystem of records\u201d as contemplated by the Privacy Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b) (\u201cNo agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains .... \u201d); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 552a(a)(5) (\u201c \u2018[Sjystem of records\u2019 means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. ...\u201d); <em>Doe v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>519 F.3d 456, 463 (8th Cir.2008) (\u201cCongress limited the type of disclosure that would lead to liability by proscribing only the disclosure of a record \u2018contained in a system of records,\u2019 not the disclosure of all records or information.\u201d <em>(quoting </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b))). Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">. The Honorable Karen K.
