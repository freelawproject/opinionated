Kadeh does not challenge the determination that his asylum application was untimely. He has therefore waived the issue. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">Kadeh contends that he met his burden to establish an entitlement to statutory withholding of removal and to relief under the CAT. Recounting his testimony before the IJ, Kadeh, who is a Christian, notes that he was twice chased from his college campus by Muslims on account of his religious beliefs, and that the church where he formerly worshiped was burned. Kadeh argues that he established past persecution. He asserts that the Nigerian government has willfully failed to put a stop to the persecution of Christians by the Muslim majority. Kadeh argues that he cannot safely relocate within Nigeria because there are Muslims in both the northern and southern parts of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant bears the burden of showing a \u201c \u2018clear probability\u2019 that he or she will be persecuted if deported.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). A claim under the CAT requires more than a showing of persecution; it imposes \u201cthe higher bar of torture.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">The record does not compel a finding that Kadeh has met his burden to show that he is entitled to withholding of removal or to relief under the CAT. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137-38 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>Bah v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 348, 351-52 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Kadeh\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
