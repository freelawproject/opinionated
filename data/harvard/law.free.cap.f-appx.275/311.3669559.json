Shamburger argues that the district court erred by applying the enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4 based on a finding that the victim suffered bodily injury. Shamburger contends that the evidence does not show that the injury was significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\">Section 2A2.4(b)(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level increase when an offense involves bodily injury to the victim. Bodily injury is defined by reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 and is \u201cany significant injury; e.g. an injury that is painful or obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would by sought.\u201d \u00a7 2A2.4(b)(2), comment, (n.l), citing \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(B)). Because the recent Supreme Court decisions of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Rita v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), did not alter this court\u2019s review of the district court\u2019s construction of the Guidelines or findings of fact, <em>see United States v. Cisne-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>ros-Gutierrez, 517 </em>F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008), the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo, and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Juarez Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (post-<em>Gall </em>and Kimbrough).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The district court viewed a photograph showing a bleeding laceration sustained by the victim. The victim testified that the injury was painful. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the district court to find that the victim suffered a painful or obvious injury. The district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement under \u00a7 2A2.4. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
