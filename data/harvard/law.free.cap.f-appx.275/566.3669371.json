United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After reconsidering Goldsmith\u2019s sentence as directed by the Supreme Court, we affirm the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentence of 33 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-22\">Goldsmith appealed to this court the sentence imposed by the district court after his plea of nolo contendere to twelve felony counts of failing to pay over withheld taxes and four misdemeanor counts of failing to file individual income tax returns. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7202, 7203. The district court calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months imprisonment and sentenced Goldsmith at the bottom of that range, 33 months of imprisonment. Further explanation of the underlying facts may be found at <em>United States v. Goldsmith, </em>486 F.3d 404 (8th Cir.2007), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 893, 169 L.Ed.2d 718 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-25\">On appeal, this court rejected both of Goldsmith\u2019s sentence-related contentions. First, we found that the record did not support his assertion that the district court refused to depart downward on the basis of his alleged diminished capacity, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (Nov.2002) (\u201cA sentence below the applicable guidelines range may be warranted if the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity.\u201d), based upon an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart because the district court stated, on the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that it was not granting the departure because this was \u201cnot an unusual case justifying a departure from the guideline range.\u201d Second, we determined that none of Goldsmith\u2019s arguments demonstrated that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Pursuant to Gall, in \u201creview[ing] the imposition of sentences, whether inside or outside the Guidelines range, we apply \u2018a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>518 F.3d 989, 995 (8th Cir.2008) <em>(quoting Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591). Goldsmith\u2019s 33-month sentence is within a properly calculated Guidelines range, which we presume reasonable. <em>Id. (citing Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). At sentencing, the district court articulated its reasoning for the sentence imposed, considering the seriousness of the offense as well as the requirements that the sentence promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, provide just punishment, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). This court\u2019s <em>pre-Gall </em>requirement that an extraordinary variance be justified by extraordinary circumstances was not applied by the district court in sentencing Goldsmith nor by this court in affirming his sentence. <em>See Goldsmith, </em>486 F.3d 404. So the fact that, \u201cour standard of review is more deferential than when we employed the \u2018extraordinary circumst\u00e1nces\u2019 method,\u201d <em>United States v. Braggs, </em>511 F.3d 808, 812 (8th Cir.2008), does not call into question Goldsmith\u2019s sentence. Rather, <em>Gall </em>strengthens this court\u2019s previous affirmance of the sentence in that, because Goldsmith alleges none of the \u201csignificant procedural errors\u201d outlined by <em>Gall, </em>and we find none, the sentence is \u201cproeedurally sound,\u201d <em>see </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Therefore, we apply <em>Gall\u2019s </em>\u201cmore deferential\u201d abuse-of-discretion standard, <em>see Braggs, </em>511 F.3d at 812, and affirm Goldsmith\u2019s sentence. Goldsmith\u2019s motion for remand and release is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-15\">. The Honorable Paul A.
