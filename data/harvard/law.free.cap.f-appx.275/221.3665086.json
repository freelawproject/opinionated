We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no abuse of discretion and no clear error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Bell v. United States, </em>521 F.Supp.2d 456 (D.Md. 2007). We deny the United States\u2019 motion for sanctions, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
