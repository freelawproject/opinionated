All claims were related to Plaintiffs\u2019 employment with the Parish\u2019s Department of Community Services. Both defendants moved for summary judgment and Laque asserted that he was entitled to qualified immunity. Although the district court granted that motion in part and dismissed several claims, it concluded that Laque was not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs\u2019 race discrimination, due process, and First Amendment claims. Laque appeals, arguing that he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-20\">Plaintiffs, who are African-American females, were employed by St. Charles Parish in the Department of Community Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) until June 2004. During Plaintiffs\u2019 employment, DCS employees were not part of the Louisiana civil service system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2002, Plaintiffs and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>DCS employees, with help from a Parish couneilwoman, sought to have the DCS included in the civil sendee. Proponents of this effort contended that the St. Charles Parish Home Rule Charter made DCS employees eligible for inclusion in the civil service.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Parish appears to have been ambivalent, or even opposed, to the proposal to include DCS employees in the civil service. For example, the Parish required proponents to seek the Louisiana Attorney General\u2019s opinion on whether DCS employees were eligible for civil service membership, and after the Attorney General confirmed their eligibility, the Parish commissioned an independent evaluation of the DCS. That evaluation resulted in a report recommending that three DCS staff positions be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The report was issued in May 2004, and Laque authorized Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations the next month. Shortly after Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations, the Civil Service Board held a meeting on July 6, 2004, where it classified the remaining DCS workers as members of the civil service. Thereafter, Plaintiffs brought suit against the Parish and Parish President Albert Laque, asserting claims of race, gender, age, and national origin discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; similar claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983; claims for First Amendment retaliation; claims for Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process violations; and a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Both defendants moved for summary judgment and Laque additionally asserted that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants in part, dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 age and national origin discrimination claims and their state law emotional distress claim. The district court denied the summary judgment motion on Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims and held that Laque was not entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ***In this interlocutory appeal, Laque appeals the denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">A. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The district court concluded that Laque is not entitled to qualified immunity. \u201cAn order denying qualified immunity, to the extent it turns on an issue of law, is immediately appealable.\u201d <em>Atteberry v. Nocona Gen. Hosp., </em>430 F.3d 245, 251 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing questions of law. <em>Meadours v. Ermel, </em>483 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s finding that genuine factual disputes exist is a factual determination that we may not review in this interlocutory appeal, but the district court\u2019s finding that a particular dispute is material is a legal determination that we may review. <em>Foley v. Univ. of Houston, </em>355 F.3d 333, 337 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see Meadours, </em>483 F.3d at 422 (\u201c[W]e may only review the district court\u2019s conclusion that issues of fact are material (a legal question), but we may not review the conclusion that those issues of fact are genuine (a fact question).\u201d). We review<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s refusal to grant qualified immunity de novo. <em>Atteberry, </em>430 F.3d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">As we explain in more detail below, the qualified immunity analysis requires us to consider whether an official\u2019s conduct \u201cis objectively reasonable in light of clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>established law.\u201d <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). The legal determination involved in this analysis is whether \u201ca certain course of conduct would, as a matter of law, be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The factual determination involved is whether \u201ca genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendants) did, in fact, engage in such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the district court finds that the evidence presented raises a genuine factual dispute \u201cwe accept the plaintiffs\u2019 version of the facts as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348 (summary judgment case); <em>see also Gonzales v. Dallas County, </em>249 F.3d 406, 411 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cConsequently, on interlocutory appeal the public official must be prepared to concede the best view of the facts to the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues raised by the appeal.\u201d) (summary judgment case).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">B. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The defense of qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from civil liability \u201c \u2018insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flores v. City of Palacios, </em>381 F.3d 391, 393-94 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Applying this standard, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury and determine (1) whether the defendant\u2019s conduct violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights, and (2) \u201cwhether the defendant[\u2019]s conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>202 F.3d 730, 736 (5th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). If the defendant\u2019s conduct did not violate a plaintiffs constitutional rights under the first prong, or his conduct was objectively reasonable under the second prong, he is entitled to qualified immunity. Once a defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defense is inapplicable. <em>Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The district court found that Laque was not entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims: (1) race discrimination, (2) due process violation, (3) First Amendment retaliation related to the \u201cpush for civil service\u201d and (4) First Amendment retaliation related to Plaintiffs\u2019 support for Laque\u2019s political opponent. We examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\n<em>1. Race discrimination claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Plaintiffs brought race discrimination claims pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 for alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>consider Plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII claim in this interlocutory appeal because \u201c[ijndividuals are not liable under Title VII in either their individual or official capacities.\u201d <em>Ackel v. Nat\u2019l Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>339 F.3d 376, 381 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003). However, this limitation does not extend to Plaintiffs\u2019 other causes of action, which we presently consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into intentional discrimination is essentially the same for individual actions brought under sections 1981 and 1983, and Title VTI.\u201d <em>Lauderdale v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, Institutional Div., </em>512 F.3d 157, 166 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Foley, </em>355 F.3d at 340 n. 8. Thus, Plaintiffs are required to show that they were (1) members of a protected class, (2) qualified for the position at issue, (3) subject to an adverse employment action, and (4) that similarly situated individuals outside the protected class were treated more favorably. <em>Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr., </em>245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001). If Plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to defendants to provide a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the action. <em>Id. </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The district court held that Plaintiffs established a prima facie case of race discrimination because (1) they are African-American, (2) they are qualified for the positions at issue, (3) they were subject to adverse employment actions in that they were denied civil sendee status and ultimately terminated, and (4) there is a material factual dispute about whether similarly situated white employees were treated more favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We agree that Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case of race discrimination for summary judgment purposes. There is no dispute on appeal that the first three elements are satisfied. Regarding the fourth element, the district court found that a genuine factual question exists regarding whether white employees were treated more favorably than Plaintiffs. We may not review that conclusion in this interlocutory appeal, and because that dispute is material to establishing a race discrimination claim, Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case. To the extent that Laque argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations were part of the typical process for converting the department into the civil service, and not the product of racial discrimination, the same genuine issue of fact cited by the district court \u2014 whether similarly situated white employees and Parish departments were treated more favorably \u2014 precludes qualified immunity at this stage of proceedings. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 346-47. Recognizing that we may not review the district court\u2019s finding that genuine issues of fact exist, we conclude that for purposes of this appeal Plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation under the first qualified immunity prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">We next consider the second qualified immunity prong: whether Laque\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law. <em>See Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736. It was clearly established that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination of the sort alleged. Further, the district court found that a genuine dispute exists about whether white employees were treated more favorably. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, as we must, we cannot conclude that Laque\u2019s actions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>objectively reasonable under clearly established law. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 348. Thus, Laque is not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\n<em>2. Due process claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">Plaintiffs allege that Laque violated their Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by terminating them without following the procedures required for terminating civil service employees. To establish a viable due process claim, Plaintiffs must show that they had a property interest in continued employment. <em>See Cabrol v. Town of Youngsville, </em>106 F.3d 101, 105 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cAbsent a property interest, there is nothing subject to due process protections and our inquiry ends.\u201d). There is no automatic property interest in continued government employment. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[i]n Louisiana, a permanent classified civil service employee has a protected property interest in her job.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Shreve Mem\u2019l Library, </em>97 F.3d 746, 748 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Bell v. Dep\u2019t Health and Human Res., </em>483 So.2d 945, 949 (La.1986) (\u201c[C]lassified civil service status is a property right.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Plaintiffs contend that the Parish Home Rule Charter gave them a property interest in their positions because it made them \u201cde facto\u201d civil service employees. Laque argues that Plaintiffs had no property interest in continued employment because they were not actually members of the civil service. Laque points out that the Parish Home Rule Charter and the State Attorney General opinion merely provide that Plaintiffs are <em>eligible </em>for inclusion in the civil service. To prevail on the second qualified immunity prong, Plaintiffs must show that Laque\u2019s conduct was not \u201cobjec-</p>\n<p id=\"A30\">tively reasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736 (internal quotation marks omitted). We find that Plaintiffs have failed to make the required showing. Laque authorized Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations without providing them the benefit of procedural protections, but the record makes clear that a reasonable person in Laque\u2019s position would not have considered Plaintiffs to be entitled to those protections. <em>See Freeman v. Gore, </em>483 F.3d 404, 411 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he court applies an objective standard based on the viewpoint of a reasonable official in light of the information then available.\u201d). Plaintiffs had never been recognized as part of the civil service and Plaintiffs\u2019 novel theory that they were \u201cde facto\u201d members of the civil service was not, and is not, clearly established law. Stated another way, based on the information then available, a reasonable person would not have felt it necessary to afford Plaintiffs the protections entitled to civil service members. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Laque\u2019s actions were unreasonable in light of clearly established law and he is entitled to qualified immunity on this claim. <em>See </em>id,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>3. First Amendment claim related to Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpush for civil service \u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Plaintiffs argue that they were terminated in retaliation for them involvement in the \u201cpush\u201d to include the DCS in the civil service. In order to prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim for First Amendment retaliation, Plaintiffs must show that (1) they \u201csuffered an adverse employment decision,\u201d (2) their \u201cspeech involved a matter of public concern,\u201d (3) their \u201cinterest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>commenting on matters of public concern outweighs [their] employer\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency,\u201d and (4) their \u201cspeech motivated the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Stotter v. Univ. of Tex. at San Antonio, </em>508 F.3d 812, 825 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201cWhether the speech at issue is on a matter of public concern is a question of law that must be determined by the court.\u201d <em>Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>411 F.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir.2005). In making this determination, one approach is to consider whether the \u201cpublic employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest.\u201d <em>Stotter, </em>508 F.3d at 825 (quotation marks omitted). In such a case we typically conclude that the speech does not involve a matter of public concern. <em>See id. </em>However, in cases \u201cin which the employee speaks on a matter of public concern but also has a personal interest as well,\u201d we examine the content, context, and form of the speech to determine whether it is predominantly private in nature. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The district court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csupport and participation in the cause to include DCS employees in civil service addressed a public concern.\u201d The court reasoned that because Plaintiffs claimed that they were excluded from the civil service because of racial discrimination, their \u201cpush for civil service\u201d involved a matter of public concern. Laque argues that the \u201cpush for civil service status\u201d involved only matters of personal interest and did not involve a matter of public concern. <em>See Teague v. City of Flower Mound, </em>179 F.3d 377, 381 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]e have held that speech concerning the conditions of one\u2019s employment is a private matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">While Plaintiffs\u2019 support for the \u201cpush for civil service\u201d clearly furthered their personal interests, they have presented some evidence that they were excluded from the civil service system on the basis of race. We agree that this evidence indicates that Plaintiffs\u2019 speech also involved the broader public interest of remedying alleged racial discrimination in Parish employment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, we have held that speech related to racial discrimination \u201calmost always involves matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Charles v. Grief </em>522 F.3d 508, 514 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see Victor v. McElveen, </em>150 F.3d 451, 456 (5th Cir.1998) (characterizing \u201ca protest against racial discrimination\u201d as \u201cinherently of public concern\u201d). Given the evidence suggesting that Plaintiffs\u2019 speech was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to remedy racial discrimination, we conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 speech involved a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">In addition, we reject Laque\u2019s argument that Plaintiffs\u2019 involvement in the \u201cpush for civil service\u201d could not have motivated their terminations. On this point we must defer to the district court\u2019s conclusion that genuine issues of fact exist \u201cas to [whether] Plaintiffs were terminated as a result of their involvement in the civil service inclusion process.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Laque raises no argument concerning the remaining elements and we conclude that Plaintiffs have established, for summary judgment purposes, a valid First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">Further, we cannot find at this stage that Laque\u2019s actions were objectively rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sonable under clearly established law. <em>See Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736. It has been clearly established for some time that a public employer may not retaliate against an employee because she exercised her right to engage in protected speech. Plaintiffs evidence, if believed, establishes just that. We conclude that Laque is not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\n<em>Jh First Amendment claim related to Plaintiffs\u2019 political speech</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that they were terminated for supporting Laque\u2019s political opponent, Darnell Abadie, in her campaign for Parish President. Plaintiffs supported Abadie\u2019s campaign and at least one of them displayed Abadie\u2019s political signs at her home. As mentioned, to prevail on a First Amendment claim Plaintiffs must establish that (1) they suffered an adverse employment decision, (2) their speech involved a matter of public concern, (3) their interest in commenting on matters of public concern outweighs their employer\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency, and (4) their speech motivated the adverse employment action. <em>Stotter, </em>508 F.3d at 825. If Plaintiffs establish these four elements, \u201cthe burden shifts to defendants to show by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have come to the same conclusion in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Beattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist., </em>254 F.3d 595, 601 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">We agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations constitute an adverse employment decision, and that their political speech constitutes a matter of public concern. <em>See Breaux v. City of Garland, </em>205 F.3d 150, 157 (5th Cir.2000) (termination is an adverse employment action);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Jordan v. Ector County, </em>516 F.3d 290, 297 n. 24 (5th Cir.2008) (citing, <em>inter alia, Aucoin v. Haney, </em>306 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cThere is no doubt that campaigning for a political candidate relates to a matter of public concern.\u201d)). Also, no argument has been made that Laque\u2019s interests in promoting efficiency outweigh Plaintiffs\u2019 interest in commenting on matters of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Turning to the final element, the district court found that genuine issues of fact exist regarding Laque\u2019s intent. As mentioned, we may not review the district court\u2019s conclusion that genuine issues of fact exist. <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 347. Our review is limited to determining whether this issue is material. Laque\u2019s intent is material because this First Amendment claim hinges on whether Plaintiffs\u2019 political speech motivated Laque to terminate them. If Laque fired Plaintiffs in retaliation for their support of Abadie, as Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence appears to indicate, then this element would be satisfied and he would have violated their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Regarding the second qualified immunity prong, Plaintiffs must establish that La-que\u2019s actions were not objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law. <em>See Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736. As mentioned, it was clearly established that the First Amendment generally prohibits a public employer from retaliating against an employee because she exercised her right to engage in protected speech. <em>See Stotter, </em>508 F.3d at 825. Given the genuine factual dispute about Laque\u2019s intent, we simply cannot conclude that Laque\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>actions were objectively reasonable under clearly established law. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In affirming the district court\u2019s order on this claim, we reject Laque\u2019s argument that Plaintiffs have failed to show that their campaign support for Abadie motivated terminations that took place more than seven months later. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Laque\u2019s intent is genuinely disputed, leads us to reject this argument because Laque\u2019s intent is central to determining what motivated the terminations. We also reject Laque\u2019s contention that Plaintiffs would have been terminated regardless of their political speech. Based on the evidence presented, we cannot determine whether Laque would have terminated these particular Plaintiffs absent their political speech because that determination is intertwined with Laque\u2019s subjective intent, a genuinely disputed fact issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Given the genuine issues of material fact concerning Laque\u2019s intent, we find that he is not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the part of the district court\u2019s order denying Laque\u2019s motion for qualified immunity on Plaintiffs\u2019 race discrimination claims and their First Amendment claims. We reverse the district court\u2019s order to the extent it denied Laque qualified immunity on Plaintiffs\u2019 due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Plaintiffs presented arguments relevant to Laque\u2019s qualified immunity defense in their Opposition to Laque\u2019s summary judgment motion, although those arguments did not appear in the section of Plaintiffs' Opposition responding to Laque's qualified immunity defense. However, Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition brief makes clear their contentions that race motivated the refusal to classify DCS employees as civil service and that their terminations vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>olated their due process rights. Given Plaintiffs' discussion of the claims and relevant legal arguments, it cannot be said that Plaintiffs \"ignored'' issues raised in their complaint, <em>see Grenier, </em>70 F.3d at 678, or that they failed to assert legal reasons why La-que\u2019s qualified immunity defense fails. <em>See Vaughner, </em>804 F.2d at 877 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. The district court also found that genuine issues of fact exist regarding Laque\u2019s intent and involvement in the termination process. We find this dispute immaterial to Plaintiffs' due process claim. Even if Laque intentionally deprived Plaintiffs of procedural protections and was involved in the termination process, we find that those actions were not objectively unreasonable for the reasons stated above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. We have employed several approaches to analyzing mixed speech cases. <em>See Stotter, </em>508 F.3d at 825. Because these approaches \"ultimately ask the same question,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 825 n. 4, we find it unnecessary to discuss each approach here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b395-14\">. We note that Laque has not argued that Plaintiffs have failed to provide a \"precise identification\u201d of the speech at issue. <em>See Foley, </em>355 F.3d at 342.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b395-15\">. We express no opinion on the merits of Laque's argument on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">. We need not decide whether the adverse employment action standard articulated in <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White </em>applies to First Amendment retaliation cases, <em>see Laredo Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Laredo, </em>No. L-04-134, 2008 WL 678698, at <em>*2 </em>(S.D.Tex. March 12, 2008), because there is no dispute that termination constitutes an adverse employment action under any potentially applicable standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. Laque claims that he merely relied on recommendations from his staff in deciding to terminate Plaintiffs and that his reliance on those recommendations was objectively reasonable. However, the district court's finding that genuine fact issues exist regarding La-que's intent prevent us from accepting his subjective explanation of intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
