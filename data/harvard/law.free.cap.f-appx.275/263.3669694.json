Jackson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying her claims of employment discrimination.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-20\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on January 31, 2008. Because Jackson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-18\"> This case was decided by the magistrate judge upon consent of the parties under 28 USC \u00a7 636(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
