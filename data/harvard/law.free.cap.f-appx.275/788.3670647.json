LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b814-24\">Daniel Nathan Starr, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. For substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-25\">Starr was convicted of four counts of assault and aggravated sexual abuse and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>sentenced to twenty years in prison. In 1999, this court affirmed his conviction and sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Starr, </em>No. 98-2065, 1999 WL 178549 (10th Cir. Apr. 1, 1999) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In November 2005, Starr filed a \u00a7 2255 application for habeas relief. In his amended application, he claimed actual innocence of the crimes for which he was convicted, ineffective assistance of counsel, withholding of exculpatory evidence by the government, lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction under the Indian Major Crimes Act, and that the original indictment was defective on its face. Because Starr filed his application after the expiration of \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year limitation period, the district court ordered him to show cause why his motion should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Starr responded that because he claimed actual innocence, dismissal of his motion would cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Specifically, he asserted that new evidence proved that he was innocent. Finding that the allegedly new evidence could have been discovered before trial, the court declined to toll the statute of limitations and dismissed his petition as untimely. Starr then filed this timely request for COA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AO_\">Starr argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period because he is actually innocent of his crimes of conviction, as indicated by newly discovered evidence. According to Starr, he recently discovered that the victim told Starr\u2019s mother, aunt, and defense counsel that he was not responsible for the assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Under certain circumstances a claim of actual innocence may be a ground for equitable tolling of the limitations period. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cAEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling but only in rare and exceptional circumstances ... for example, when a prisoner is actually innocent.\u201d (quotation omitted)). To establish actual innocence, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of ... new evidence.\u201d <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995) (remanding a state prisoner\u2019s federal habeas petition for consideration of an actual innocence claim notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s procedural default); <em>see also Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (applying the <em>Schlup </em>standard to a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Starr argues that no reasonable juror would have convicted him if evidence of the victim\u2019s statements had been presented at trial. He asserts that \u201c[t]his evidence was not available until after the trial, or defense counsel did not disclose the evidence at [trial].\u201d Starr admitted in his petition before the district court, however, that the victim\u2019s statements occurred before his trial. Accordingly, the district court correctly found that this evidence was available before trial, and in fact had been discovered by defense counsel. Thus Starr\u2019s claim is not based on \u201cnew\u201d evidence, but rather on evidence that could have been presented at trial. Any failure by counsel to adduce this evidence is more properly characterized as a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, and such a claim is barred by the applicable limitations period. \u00a7 2255(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We conclude that reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition as time barred, and Starr\u2019s request for a COA is therefore DENIED. Starr\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. A petitioner may not appeal the denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2255 without a COA. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). A COA may be issued \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires Starr to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\" <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Because the district court did not rule on whether to grant a COA, we assume it was denied. 10th Cir. R. 22.1(C). Accordingly, Starr may not appeal the district court's decision absent a grant of a COA by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. The limitations period runs, at the latest, from \"the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(4). Although Starr claims that he only \"recently\u201d learned of this evidence, he has not provided the exact date upon which he discovered this evidence, nor attempted to explain why he could not have obtained this information from his family members or former counsel at an earlier date through diligent efforts. Accordingly, we cannot apply this exception to the period of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
