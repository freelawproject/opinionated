We further find that the Board acted well within its discretion in finding that Opes-anmi was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status on the ground that he failed to depart the United States within the time period granted for voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229c(d)(l)(B) (West 2005 &amp; Supp.2007). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Opesanmi\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his removal proceedings. <em>See Tamenut v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 1000 (8th Cir.2008) (en banc) (collecting cases). We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
