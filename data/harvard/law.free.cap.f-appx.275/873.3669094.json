He contends that the district court erred by: (1) failing to provide him notice that the court was considering an above-guidelines sentence; and (2) imposing a proeedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-21\">Vidal first contends that the district court plainly erred by failing to provide him with notice that it was contemplating sentencing him above the advisory guidelines range. We generally review <em>de novo </em>questions of law. <em>United States v. DeVegter, </em>439 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir. 2006). However, Vidal did not object be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>fore the district court to the lack of notice, so this argument is subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Plain error exists only where: (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; and (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-78, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When these three factors are met, this Court may then exercise its discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s pre-hearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-0\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h); <em>see Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 2187, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). We have held that this notice requirement, addressed as it is to departures from the guidelines, does not apply to variances from the guidelines under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008). \u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory!, and] parties cannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment ... when a district court imposes a sentence above the guidelines range based on the section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Under the prior panel precedent rule, we cannot overturn <em>Irizarry\u2019s </em>holding that advance notice is not required before the district court imposes a sentence above the advisory guidelines range. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) (en banc). Therefore, under the law of this circuit, the district court did not eiT by failing to provide Vidal with notice that it was considering an above-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">In his reply brief, Vidal points out that the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in <em>Irizarry, </em>and argues that if the Court were to determine that prior notice is required before a sentencing court considers varying above the guidelines range, he would be entitled to relief. We have held, however, that a grant of certiorari does not change circuit law or free us from following prior panel precedent. <em>Ritter v. Thig-pen, </em>828 F.2d 662, 665-66 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cA grant of certiorari does not constitute new law.\u201d); <em>Robinson v. Crosby, </em>358 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]he grant of certiorari alone is not enough to change the law of this circuit\u201d). We remain bound by our decision in <em>Irizarry </em>unless and until the Supreme Court reverses it.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Even if the Supreme Court does reverse our decision in <em>Irizarry, </em>it will remain to be determined whether Vidal can meet the third requirement of the plain error rule by showing substantial prejudice. And if he can, we will then have to determine whether the asserted error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings so that this Court should exercise its discretion to correct the error even though there was no objection to it in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">Vidal also contends that the district court imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence on him be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>cause: (1) the court considered impermissible sentence factors; (2) his above-guidelines range sentence, which was higher than those received by many of his codefendants, resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity; (3) the court offered no extraordinary justifications for the departure; (4) the court unreasonably focused on a single sentencing factor, deterrence, while ignoring other factors; and (5) the district court failed to consult the policy statements regarding departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the court considered an improper sentence factor. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361-62 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). \u201c[T]he party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of establishing that the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1361. If a preserved error exists, we will vacate the sentence unless the error was harmless such that \u201cthe record as a whole shows the error did not substantially affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Recently, the Supreme Court clarified that this means courts of appeal are to review sentences only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To that end the district court judge \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-,-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally reasonable, our analysis then turns to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Reasonableness review is deferential and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d rather than reviewing each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363; <em>see also United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">\u201cWe will only reverse a procedurally proper sentence if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and citation omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the kinds of sentences available; (6) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (7) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; and (8) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-5\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (summarizing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Furthermore, we have noted that \u201ca district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one Section 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cLikewise, a sentence may be substantively unreasonable when the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors or fails to consider pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191-92 (quotation omitted). Nevertheless, \u201cwhile the application of these analyses may suggest an unreasonable sentence, they do not necessarily make a sentence unreasonable\u201d because reasonableness depends on an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 1192; <em>see also Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600 (holding that a district court did not commit reversible error simply because it \u201cattached great weight\u201d to one factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court rejected \u201can appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range\u201d and rejected \u201cthe use of a rigid mathematical formula ... for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594-95. The Supreme Court stated that a \u201cproportional review\u201d is \u201cinconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions-whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. When a sentencing judge determines that a non-guideline sentence is warranted, \u201che must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Nevertheless, \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one,\u201d and an appellate court reviewing the sentence may \u201ctake the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 597. The appellate court, however, \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Vidal contends that the district court erred by considering impermissible factors when imposing a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range: (1) the need to afford deterrence in the South Florida community; and (2) the risk that smuggling aliens into this country poses to law enforcement. Contrary to Vidal\u2019s contentions, both of these considerations are reflected in the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The danger to law enforcement that alien smuggling poses fits within the factors requiring the court to examine the seriousness of the offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need to promote respect for the law, <em>id. </em>Another one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors requires the court to examine the need for the sentence imposed \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), which is what the district court did. The factors the district court considered are not impermissible ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Moreover, we conclude that Vidal has not shown that his sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable. As we have mentioned, at his sentence hearing, the district court explicitly considered the danger to law enforcement officers that Vidal\u2019s offense posed, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), the need to promote respect for the law, <em>id., </em>and the need to afford adequate deterrence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The court also considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2), explaining that the conspiracy to smuggle aliens was \u201cbroad and deep in scope with a number of individuals that were involved.\u201d The court emphasized that Vidal failed to perceive the seriousness of the offense, and that a sentence within the guidelines range would not provide adequate deterrence to prevent him and others from committing this type of crime. As a result, the district court believed that an above-guidelines sentence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Although the court attached substantial weight to two factors, the seriousness of the offense and the need for deterrence, this does not mean that the resulting sentence, which is well below the statutory maximum of ten years imprisonment, is unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600. The district court justified its reliance on those two factors by explicitly stating why it found the offense to be so serious, and why it believed that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary to provide adequate deterrence against this type of crime. Because the district court adequately explained why it varied above the guidelines range, and because it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to decide how much weight to give each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, <em>see Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363, Vidal has not shown that his 36-month sentence was either procedurally or substantively unreasonable, <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The fact that some of Vidal\u2019s codefendants received shorter sentences than he did does not mandate a different result. Vidal emphasizes that one of his codefendants, Jesus Rodriguez, who was an organizer of the conspiracy, received only a 24-month sentence. That lower sentence reflected Rodriguez\u2019s substantial assistance to the government, and Vidal has not shown that he provided similar assistance. Vidal also argues that other of his codefendants received shorter sentences than he did, but we have held that \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001). If it were, we would be creating disparities between the sentences given the defendants in the case under review and those given similarly situated defendants in other cases. <em>United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1193, 1198 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
