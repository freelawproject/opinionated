R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed August 2, 2007 be affirmed. On appeal, appellant argues that his complaint raises claims of false accusation, false information, false arrest, false prosecution, and frame-up. Appellant concedes that his claim of false arrest is barred by the one-year statute of limitations in D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">The appellant contends that his remaining claims are subject to the three-year statute of limitations in D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(8) because they are actions \u201cnot otherwise specially prescribed\u201d in the statute. There are, however, no causes of action in the District of Columbia for \u201cfalse accusation, false information, false prosecution, and frame-up.\u201d Moreover, appellant cannot circumvent the applicable statute of limitations by creating new names for existing causes of action. Thus, the district court properly treated appellant\u2019s allegations as analogous to claims for libel, slander, and malicious prosecution, which are subject to a one-year statute of limitations, and dismissed them as time barred. <em>See </em>D.C. Code \u00a7 12-301(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
