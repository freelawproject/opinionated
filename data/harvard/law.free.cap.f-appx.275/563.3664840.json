He was sentenced to 100 months on the drug manufacturing charge and to 84 months on the firearms charge, to be served consecutively. On appeal Gray argues that the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in calculating the quantity of drugs involved in his offense. We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual findings including drug quantity for clear<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> error. <em>United States v. Pruneda, </em>518 F.3d 597, 607 (8th Cir.2008). We will reverse its findings of drug quantity \u201conly if the entire record definitely and firmly convinces us that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>148 F.3d 897, 901 (8th Cir.1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-14\">We have consistently upheld the district court\u2019s authority to make factual findings beyond the drug quantity alleged in an indictment. <em>See United States v. Hilliard, </em>490 F.3d 635, 641 (8th Cir.2007) (\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018judicial findings of drug quantity for sentencing purposes do not violate the Sixth Amendment when made under an advisory [Sentencing] Guidelines regime.\u2019 \u201d), <em>quoting United States v. Davis, </em>457 F.3d 817, 825 (8th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Ault, </em>446 F.3d 821, 823 (8th Cir. 2006). In his signed confession Gray estimated that he cooked between 1/8 oz. and 1/4 oz. of methamphetamine every two weeks for 18 months. The district court found that the drug quantity was approximately 126 grams, the lowest possible amount based on the defendant\u2019s confession. At the sentencing hearing the agent who took Gray\u2019s statement testified about what the defendant had told him about his drug manufacturing and about the circumstances under which the confession was obtained. Based on the evidence before the district court we conclude that its drug quantity calculation is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-12\">.
