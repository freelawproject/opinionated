Specifically, she seeks to challenge her sentence under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Avery\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on December 17, 2007. In criminal cases, the defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). Because Avery failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal. However, this decision is rendered without prejudice to Avery\u2019s ability to pursue relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2000). We also deny Avery\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
