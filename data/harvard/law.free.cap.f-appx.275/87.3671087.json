For the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>below, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In 1998, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Hart to 188 months in prison after a jury convicted him of possession of a firearm by a felon. We affirmed his conviction and sentence on appeal. Hart then filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion, and we denied Hart\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In December 2006, Hart filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2241 petition in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Hart stated that he recently learned that a nonexistent conviction for simple assault in 1995 was used in determining his prison security classification. Although he admitted that this conviction was not listed in his pre-sentence investigation report (PSI), Hart alleged that the sentencing court used the conviction to sentence him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, and Hart filed a timely notice of appeal. The government filed a motion for summary affirmance, and Hart, now represented by counsel, has filed responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Under the explicit terms of \u00a7 2255, a \u00a7 2241 petition cannot be entertained by a court unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cradle, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ap-dedup-0\">a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 pro-eeeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim. It is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative. Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeep-ing requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 538-39 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Hart argues that because he never had an opportunity to raise this claim previously, he should be entitled to pursue relief via a \u00a7 2241 petition based on our holding in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). In <em>Dorsainvil, </em>we allowed a prisoner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because he \u201chad no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law may negate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251. Hart\u2019s claims do not fall within the narrow exception we announced in <em>Dorsainvil. </em>There has been no substantive change in the law that negates Hart\u2019s conviction. <em>See also Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.2002). Because Hart seeks to challenge his sentence and has not shown that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, he may not proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Moreover, we note that Hart had an opportunity to challenge the convictions used to sentence him as an armed career criminal. On February 3, 1997, the government filed a \u201cNotice of Prior Convictions for Enhanced Sentencing Under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) ].\u201d The government alleged that Hart had four prior convictions for robbery in August 1988, December 1988, February 1989, and January 1991 as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>as a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense in November 1990.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At Hart\u2019s February 18, 1998 sentencing, the District Court rejected Hart\u2019s challenge to the use of one robbery conviction as a crime of violence. Counsel successfully moved for a downward departure on the basis that Hart\u2019s criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his criminal record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hart himself argued at sentencing that his prior convictions were invalid because he was unaware of his right to appeal them. Tr. 2/18/1998 at 28-29. He also contended that his drug conviction did not meet the criteria to be considered a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(a)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 30-31. In a letter to his appellate counsel, Hart requested that counsel raise a claim that sentencing counsel should have argued for a departure downward not only from his criminal history category but also from his enhanced offense level. In his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Hart argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the guilty pleas in three of his prior convictions were not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In his arguments at sentencing, on appeal, and in his \u00a7 2255 motion, Hart demonstrated that he was actively involved in those proceedings and paying close attention to the convictions used to sentence him under \u00a7 924(e). Hart only disputed the validity and not the existence of those prior convictions. To be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), a defendant must have at least three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. Hart had five.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">While we do not reach the merits of Hart\u2019s claims, we note that Hart cites nothing to support his claim that the 1995 conviction<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was used to enhance his sentence as an armed career criminal. Hart has submitted only two pages from his PSI; he omitted those pages which contain a discussion of his prior convictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his counseled opposition to summary action, Hart argues that he was arrested in retaliation for his efforts to exonerate his father who is on death row. He further asserts that \u201c[a]s the newly discovered evidence has shown, the retaliatory efforts went so far as to place a non-existent felony conviction on Mr. Hart\u2019s criminal record so that the court could impose a longer sentence.\u201d Opp. at 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hart implies that the courts have concealed the use of this 1995 conviction from him. Opp. at 10. We are deeply concerned by counsel\u2019s making such serious allegations without providing any proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Because Hart has not shown that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, the District Court did not err in dismissing Hart\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. Summary action is appropriate if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6. Ap-pellee\u2019s motion for summary action is granted. Hart\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motions for an appeal conference and to disqualify opposing counsel are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A9\">. Hart subsequently sought to challenge his conviction with a motion filed pursuant to Fed.RXiv.P. 60(b)(4). We denied Hart\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability to appeal the District Court's denial of that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-6\">. These convictions are included in the criminal history Hart submitted with his <em>pro se </em>opposition to summary action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. Before this departure Hart faced a sentence in the guidelines range of 235-293 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\">. At sentencing, the government mentioned that Hart was convicted of simple assault when he was fourteen years old. Thus, it appears possible that the mistake in the BOP\u2019s document could be a simple typographical error with respect to the date, i.e., \u2019\u20191995\" was typed instead of \u201c1985.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b115-14\">. In the government's sentencing memorandum, it describes three of Hart's robbery convictions and cites to paragraphs 26-29 of the PSI. Hart has only provided the pages of the PSI which encompass paragraphs 9-21 and 30-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b115-15\">. We note that under Pennsylvania law simple assault is a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
