Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam). Specifically, the regulations provide that a party may only file one motion to reopen, and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). In this case, petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed on June 29, 2007, more than seventeen months after the BIA\u2019s January 20, 2006 decision dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Furthermore, a review of the record reflects that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that petitioner did not qualify for an exception to the time and number limitations, since petitioner did not identify or substantiate any country conditions which have changed since his original asylum application was adjudicated. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
