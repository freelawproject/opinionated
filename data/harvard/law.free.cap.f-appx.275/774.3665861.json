McConnell, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">Alfonso Izmael Herdocia, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) that would allow him to appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1)(A). Because we conclude that Mr. Herdocia has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his request for a COA, and dismiss the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Mr. Herdocia was convicted in Oklahoma district court on a plea of no contest to one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance \u2014 nine pounds of methamphetamine \u2014 with intent to distribute. On January 16, 2006, he was sentenced to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment. He did not appeal. On September 28, 2006, Mr. Herdocia filed a motion for judicial review in the district court; the motion was denied on November 6. On January 17, 2007, Mr. Herdocia filed in the district court an application for leave to file an appeal out of time or in the alternative for post-conviction relief. The court denied relief on April 4, and Mr. Herdocia took an appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA), which affirmed the denial on July 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">On August 24, 2007, Mr. Herdocia brought the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court dismissed it on November 13, finding that the petition was untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), and that equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s time limit was inappropriate. Mr. Herdocia then brought this appeal and petition for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">A COA is a necessary prerequisite to appeal the denial of a petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and is available \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), (2). Where, as here, the district court has dismissed a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a COA may issue only when \u201cthe prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), enacted as a part of AEDPA, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 101, 110 Stat. 1214, 1217 (1996), imposes a one-year time limit for filing a federal habeas petition upon a state conviction. AEDPA\u2019s clock starts running when (A) the judgment of conviction becomes final, (B) any state-created impediment to filing is lifted, (C) a retroactive constitutional right is first recognized by the Supreme Court, or (D) the factual predicate for the claim was reasonably discoverable \u2014 whichever comes last. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) \u2014 (D). The one-year limit is, however, tolled while \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction, or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim, is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">Mr. Herdocia does not allege any state-created impediment to filing his petition. The claims he seeks to raise, which are based on Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure doctrine and ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>of Ms trial counsel, do not rely on any newly-recognized constitutional right and their factual predicates were all reasonably discoverable by the time of his sentencing. As a result, the AEDPA clock was triggered under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which specifies that a judgment becomes final \u201cby the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">In Oklahoma, direct review of a conviction entered on a plea of guilty or no contest may be had only by a petition for a writ of certiorari from the OCCA, filed within 90 days of the conviction. Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1051(a). To be permitted an appeal, however, \u201cthe defendant must have filed in the trial court clerk\u2019s office an application to \"withdraw the plea within ten (10) days from the date of the pronouncement of the Judgment and Sentence, setting forth in detail the grounds for the withdrawal of the plea and requesting an evidentiary hearing in the trial court.\u201d Rule 4.2(A), Rules of the Court of Criminal Appeals, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, Ch. 18, App. Mr. Herdocia filed no such motion. His sentence was entered on January 16, 2006, so the judgment became final on January 26.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">From January 26, Mr. Herdocia waited 356 days, until January 17, 2007, to file an application in state court for post-conviction relief. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), the clock was tolled from that date until July 26, when the OCCA affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. Nine days later, August 4, 2007, was the 365th and last day for filing a federal habeas petition. When Mr. Herdocia filed his petition on August 24, it was twenty days late. .</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 2254 petitions is nonjurisdictional, and is therefore subject to equitable tolling in certain \u201c \u2018rare and exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laurson v. Leyba, </em>507 F.3d 1230, 1232 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th Cir. 2000)). This is \u201ca rare remedy to be applied in unusual cMcumstances, not a cure-all for an entirely common state of affaMs.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 1100, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Relief \u201cis only available when an inmate [1] diligently pursues his claims and [2] demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary cMcumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000). We will grant a COA on \u201cthe District Court\u2019s determination that equitable tolling is inapplicable only if reasonable jurists could debate whether the court\u2019s refusal to toll the statute of limitations was an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Fleming, </em>481 F.3d at 1254-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Mr. Herdocia contends he is entitled to equitable tolling because the claims raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition show a clear violation of his rights on the part of Oklahoma police. He has not, however, alleged or shown in any way that he \u201cdiligently pursued] his claims\u201d while the year for filing was ticking away, nor that his \u201cfailure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances.\u201d We agree with the district court that equitable tolling was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We DENY Mr. Herdoeia\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal. As Mr. Herdocia has not presented a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on appeal why his petition should be considered timely, we DENY his motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b800-27\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">. The petition was received in the clerk\u2019s office on August 27, but is considered filed as of the date of mailing under the so-called prison mailbox rule. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) (rule applies to notices of appeal); <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1218 n. 1 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Iliberal application\u201d of rule extends it to \u00a7 2254 petitions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">. It might be argued that, because Mr. Herdo-cia never sought to withdraw his plea, there was never \u201ctime for seeking [direct] review\u201d at all. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The better view, and that expressed in our uniform prior practice, grants the ten days available for filing the motion. <em>See Fleming v. Evans, </em>481 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir.2007); <em>Boykins v. Booher, </em>116 Fed.Appx. 185, 185 (10th Cir. 2004). Mr. Herdocia also argued below that his conviction did not become final for 90 days because that is the time allowed for seeking review in the United States Supreme Court. He has not raised this issue in his appeal brief or petition for a COA; even the liberal construction we afford <em>pro se </em>briefs will not induce us to consider an issue so forfeited.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
