We hold that Sandoval-Hernandez\u2019 sentence of sixty months \u2014 below the advisory guidelines range \u2014 was not unreasonable, and we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">This court will only set aside a procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S.-,-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). Here, the district court followed proper procedure. The district court determined the applicable Guidelines range, then considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in seeking \u201ca sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d and provided an explanation for why the chosen sentence fell below that suggested by the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991-94 (9th Cir.2008) (describing the procedural requirements for proper sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Nor was the resulting sentence substantively unreasonable. The district court balanced the potential dangers posed by the Sandoval-Hernandez against the extraordinary childhood abuse he suffered. <em>See United States v. Roe, </em>976 F.2d 1216, 1218 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201c[T]he psychological effects of childhood abuse may ... be considered as a basis for departure in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Sandoval-Hernandez was not entitled to a further downward departure. Sandoval-Hernandez did not illegally re-enter the country out of necessity or to avoid a greater harm, because he had the option of applying for readmission to the United States. <em>See United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1125 (9th Cir.2001) (recognizing a necessity defense is available where \u201ca person commits a particular offense to prevent an imminent harm which <em>no available options </em>could similarly prevent.\u201d) (emphasis added). Sandoval-Hernandez could not obtain a departure for diminished capacity, because voluntary use of alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin contributed to any reduced mental capacity. <em>See United States v. Borrayo, </em>898 F.2d 91, 94 (9th Cir.1989) (interpreting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">We reject the argument that the reporting condition imposed as a term of Sandoval-Hernandez\u2019 supervised release violates his Fifth Amendment rights by requiring self-incrimination. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 769-73 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201c[o]n its face, the reporting condition does not violate [defendant\u2019s] right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">Sandoval-Hernandez further claims that the district court delegated excessive authority by allowing the probation officer to determine the costs Sandoval-Hernandez owed for drug treatment. That argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2005), where we affirmed a supervised release condition providing that, as in this case, the defendant shall make payments \u201c[a]s directed by the Probation Officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Finally, Sandoval-Hernandez\u2019s sentence did not violate constitutional principles by punishing the defendant for prior convictions that were not alleged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 248, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) (explaining that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), \u201cstands for the proposition that ... recidivism increasing the maximum penalty need not be so charged.\u201d). \u201cUnless and until <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is overruled by the Supreme Court, we must follow it.\u201d <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). The argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has effectively been overruled, and that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), has been \u201cforeclosed\u201d by circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Sandoval-Hernandez\u2019 sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
