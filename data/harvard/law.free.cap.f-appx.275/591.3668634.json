George, </em>184 F.3d 1119, 1122 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cThe Chapter 7 policy statements are \u2018mandatory\u2019 only to the extent that the district court must consider them in calculating a sentence upon revocation of supervised release; the district court, however, is not bound by the ranges stated in Chapter 7.\u201d). The Chapter 7 range was included in the defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum, which the court indicated it had \u201creceived\u201d and \u201cconsidered.\u201d The range was also before the court in the Probation Department\u2019s Presentence Report. Finally, the court indicated that it was upwardly departing from the guideline range and gave sufficient reasons for the upward departure: Otero had been kicked out of two rehabilitation facilities for having a bad attitude and malignancy toward others; she unlawfully possessed and used drugs during her probationary period; and \u201cher violations [were] so egregious and so continuing\u201d that \u201cnothing short of a long term in custody [would] serve[ ] to deter her from criminal conduct....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The district court\u2019s failure to explicitly recalculate the original guidelines range did not render the sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe review the sentence ultimately imposed for reasonableness.\u201d). Although the range stated at the probation revocation sentencing hearing (18 to 24 months) differed from the range stated at the original sentencing (12 to 18 months), the record makes clear that this difference was due to the two-level \u201cfast track\u201d departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. The district court\u2019s decision to reject the \u201cfast track\u201d departure based on Otero\u2019s probationary misconduct was not unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[T]he court <em>may </em>depart downward ... pursuant to an early disposition program .... \u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s imposition of a twenty-four-month sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
