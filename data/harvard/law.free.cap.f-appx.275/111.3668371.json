Proceeding pro se and in <em>forma pauperis, </em>Briggs appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In 2007, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against Briggs for conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery with a dangerous weapon, aiding and abetting in the same, using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, and aiding and abetting in the same. Briggs filed a notice of appeal the day following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Before he was scheduled to be sentenced, he filed the instant habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 arguing that it was unlawful for state police officers to participate in executing a federal search warrant; that certain physical evidence should not have been introduced at trial; that he was subjected an unlawful arrest; and that his confession was admitted into evidence in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The District Court denied Briggs\u2019s petition as inappropriately filed pursuant to \u00a7 2241, and further explained that it would not convert the motion to one under \u00a7 2255, because a collateral attack would be premature given that Briggs had not even been sentenced yet.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">We have jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 119 (3d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Only under narrow circumstances, such as when a petitioner had no \u201cearlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive law may negate,\u201d will the remedy afforded by \u00a7 2255 be deemed \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thereby permit a federal prisoner resort instead to the writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241. <em>See In re: Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">We agree with the District Court that Briggs has not shown that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective to challenge the legality of his sentence. Indeed, at the time that he filed his habeas petition, he was still awaiting his sentencing on the underlying charges, and his direct appeal of his conviction, albeit premature, was still pending in this court. We also agree with the District Court that converting his petition to a motion under \u00a7 2255 would be inappropriate and premature in light of his pending direct appeal. <em>See Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570-72 (3d Cir.1999). Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Appellant\u2019s motion to intervene, vacate, and set aside the District Court\u2019s sentencing pending outcome of the appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">. Collateral attacks against a federal sentence must be raised in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, unless doing so would be inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). \"Only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim,\u201d may a motion under 2255 be deemed \"inadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
