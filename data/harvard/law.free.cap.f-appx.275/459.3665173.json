Howard petitions this Court for review of the United States Railroad Retirement Board\u2019s denial of his application for a disability annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231 et seq. We have jurisdiction to review Howard\u2019s petition under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231g, which incorporates by reference 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(f). Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and not based on an error of law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-16\">Howard began working in the railroad industry in March 1995. He left his railroad job in February 2004 and filed an application for a disability annuity in September 2004, claiming total disability from various maladies, including back injury and associated pain. After denying Howard\u2019s initial application, the Board again denied it at three separate stages of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">When reviewing a decision of the Railroad Retirement Board, we must affirm if the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and not based on an error of law. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(f); <em>Crenshaw v. United States, </em>815 F.2d 1066, 1067 (6th Cir.1987). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Chandler v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>713 F.2d 188, 189 (6th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). If the record supports the Board\u2019s decision, we must accept it without independently evaluating the evidence, <em>Crenshaw, </em>815 F.2d at 1067, because the substantial evidence standard</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>presupposes that there is a zone of choice within which the decision makers can go either way, without interference by the courts. An administrative decision is not subject to reversal merely because the substantial evidence would have supported an opposite decision,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apd-dedup-0\"><em>Rowe v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>114 Fed.Appx. 189, 191 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Blankenship v. Bowen, </em>874 F.2d 1116, 1120 (6th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Howard argues that two aspects of the Board\u2019s decision warrant its reversal. Howard first argues that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence because in determining Howard\u2019s Residual Functioning Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), the Board relied on the assessment of a non-examining physician that contradicted the assessments of one treating and one examining physician. Second, Howard argues that in rejecting his claim of disabling pain, the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and is based on an error of law. Finding these arguments unpersuasive, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Howard challenges as unsupported by substantial evidence the Board\u2019s conclusion that he can perform certain light and sedentary work because the Board favored the RFC assessment of Dr. Uy, a physician who did not examine Howard but only reviewed his case file, over the RFC assessments of Dr. Hardin, a treating physician, and Dr. Apgar, an examining physician. Howard pursues this argument via two routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">He first contends that in evaluating the record evidence the Board was required to accord substantial deference to the medical opinion of his treating physician; however, the Board must afford a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion substantial deference only if the opinion is supported by sufficient medical data. <em>See Duffy v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>1991 WL 150792, at *3, 1991 U.S.App. LEXIS 18833, at *8 (6th Cir. 1991) (quoting <em>Harris v. Heckler, </em>756 F.2d 431, 435 (6th Cir.1985)). In rejecting the opinion of Howard\u2019s treating physician, the Board found that Dr. Hardin\u2019s medical findings of \u201clumbar spine sprain\u201d and \u201ccervical spine sprain\u201d did not support the level of impairment indicated by his RFC assessment. Moreover, even if we were to find that Dr. Hardin\u2019s opinion was entitled to substantial deference, the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s contrary finding by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">Howard further argues that regardless of whether the Board accorded Dr. Hardin\u2019s opinion sufficient deference, the Board\u2019s RFC determination is not supported by substantial evidence because the Board favored Dr. Uy\u2019s assessment over the assessments of Dr. Hardin and Dr. Apgar. Although contrary to the opinions of Dr. Hardin and Dr. Apgar, the Board\u2019s decision finds support by substantial evidence in the opinions of other examining physicians. In particular, Dr. Travis indicated that Howard\u2019s purported pain level had no identifiable origin. Dr. Tibbs reported that Howard\u2019s most recent MRI read \u201cnormal\u201d and found no medical explanation for Howard\u2019s reported residual symptoms. In favoring Dr. Uy\u2019s assessment, the Board did not rely solely on the opinion of a physician who never examined Howard; rather, it resolved a conflict of opinions among examining physicians. In cases such as this one, we will not second-guess the Board\u2019s decision when it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Rowe, </em>114 Fed.Appx. at 191; <em>Crenshaw, </em>815 F.2d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Howard next contends that in rejecting his claim of disabling pain, the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>stantial evidence and is based on an error of law. Howard argues that several factors justify reversing the Board\u2019s decision: (1) evidence of Howard\u2019s muscle spasms; (2) Dr. Boykin\u2019s opinion that Howard\u2019s back pain caused urinary retention problems; (3) Howard\u2019s chronic use of pain medication; and (4) his demeanor at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We do not agree. The record is replete with evidence that contravenes Howard\u2019s contentions of disabling pain, including doctors\u2019 opinions that objective medical findings do not support Howard\u2019s medication level and that Howard expressed more interest in medication than in treatment for his symptoms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reviewing these medical opinions in the context of the entire record, we are satisfied that the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Relying on <em>Lambert v. Railroad Retirement Board, </em>929 F.2d 1197, 1201 (7th Cir. 1991), and <em>Swenson v. Sullivan, </em>876 F.2d 683, 687 (9th Cir.1989), Howard further argues that the Board committed an error of law because \u201cif medical evidence establishes an objective basis of some degree of the symptoms and no evidence affirmatively suggests the claimant is malingering, the [Board\u2019s] failure to consider a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain must be supported by \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d Petr.\u2019s Br. 24. Howard\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. No Sixth Circuit opinion cites either of these cases or sets forth that rule, and even under such a rule, Howard\u2019s argument would still fail. First, record evidence undercuts Howard\u2019s pain claims. Dr. Briggs explicitly noted that Howard was not interested in treatment, and Dr. Granacher suggested that Howard showed signs of symptom magnification. Second, contrary to Howard\u2019s assertion, the Board clearly considered Howard\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. In weighing these complaints against the extensive record evidence and Howard\u2019s demeanor at his hearing, however, the Board determined that Howard does not suffer from disabling pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">The petition is denied, and the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">. Specifically, Dr. Travis reported that he was \u201cappalled by the amount of narcotics [Howard] is taking ... in the absence of objective findings\u201d that would support his medication level. Dr. Granacher reported that Howard exhibited signs of symptom magnification and doctor-shopping for pain medication. Dr. Freimark noted that Howard declined to proceed with treatment and testing options and that, based on a physical exam and MRI, \u201che is not a candidate to be maintained on narcotics at this time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
