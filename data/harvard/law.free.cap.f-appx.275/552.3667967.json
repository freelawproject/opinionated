The conspiracy involved at least 50 grams of crack, which triggered a mandatory term of 10 years on that count. <em>Id. </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(vi). The district court sentenced Stanley to 10 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>on each count, to run concurrently. Stanley appeals, but his appointed counsel has moved to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Stanley to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), and he has done so. Our review is limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief and in Stanley\u2019s response. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief counsel identifies only one potential issue: whether Stanley\u2019s overall prison sentence is reasonable. We agree with counsel that any argument challenging the 10-year term would be frivolous because that was the statutory minimum for the conspiracy count, and the remaining counts were to run concurrently. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>479 F.3d 924, 930 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>399 F.3d 864, 866 (7th Cir.2005). Even though the sentencing guidelines are advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), statutory penalties are not, <em>see Duncan, </em>479 F.3d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">However, none of this matters because, as part of his plea agreement, Stanley promised not to appeal his convictions or sentence. An appeal waiver must be enforced if entered into as part of a voluntary guilty plea. <em>See Nunez v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 544, 545-46 (7th Cir.2007). Counsel does not address whether Stanley wants his guilty pleas set aside, and Stanley\u2019s response is ambiguous on that issue. Therefore, the voluntariness of Stanley\u2019s pleas is not a potential issue. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Toms, </em>482 F.3d 925, 925 (7th Cir.2007). In any event, Stanley did not move to withdraw his guilty pleas in the district court, so our review would be for plain error. <em>Schuh, </em>289 F.3d at 974. And we discern no error, plain or otherwise. The plea colloquy substantially complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, <em>see United States v. Blalock, </em>321 F.3d 686, 688-89 (7th Cir. 2003), and therefore any argument challenging the voluntariness of Stanley\u2019s pleas would be frivolous and his appeal waiver must be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
