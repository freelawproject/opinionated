We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider, and review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">We reject the government\u2019s contention that the agency was precluded from considering Lellan\u2019s motion because it was submitted after his removal to Denmark. <em>See Lin v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir.2007) (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) permits motions to reopen filed by aliens who are no longer the subject of removal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">We disagree with the agency\u2019s conclusion that Lellan had constitutionally adequate counsel at his hearing before the IJ. <em>See Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1027 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe do not require that [petitioner\u2019s] representation be brilliant, but it cannot serve to make [the] immigration hearing so fundamentally unfair that [petitioner] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lellan was removed as an aggravated felon based on his convictions for four counts of vehicular manslaughter in violation of CaL.Penal Code \u00a7 192(c)(1). At the time of his removal proceeding, certiorari had been granted by the Supreme Court in <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). Less than four months after Lellan waived appeal to the BIA, <em>Leocal </em>held that criminal acts require a mens rea greater than accidental or negligent to be classified as aggravated felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 125 S.Ct. 377. Subsequent Ninth Circuit law applied <em>Leocal </em>to a petitioner convicted under a similar statute for gross vehicular manslaughter, and held that the crime was not an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. <em>See Lara-Cazares v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir.2005). Lellan\u2019s declaration indicates that he was not advised by his former counsel that he could prevail on appeal, and his former counsel\u2019s declaration notably fails to mention that she advised Lellan of <em>Leocal. See Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 786 (9th Cir.2003) (BIA is required to accept the facts in a petitioner\u2019s declaration unless they are inherently unbelievable).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Moreover, Lellan has demonstrated prejudice. <em>See Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 793 (in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate prejudice). Lellan need only demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmay have affected the outcome of his proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793-94. Given that <em>Leocal </em>was decided on November 9, 2004, three months after Lellan\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA was due, and that our subsequent decision in <em>Lara-Cazares, </em>interpreting a nearly identical statute to that which provided Lellan\u2019s only ground of removability issued on May 23, 2005, Lellan\u2019s counseled decision to waive appellate review was prejudicial. We therefore remand with directions that the BIA reopen Lellan\u2019s proceedings. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
