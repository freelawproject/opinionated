The district court sentenced Chusid to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $360,000 and a fine of $250,000. Later, Chusid defaulted on the restitution and fine orders, and was resentenced to an additional four months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3614. The district court also ordered Chusid incarcerated for civil contempt. On appeal, we affirmed the incarceration portion of the district court\u2019s sentence and upheld the contempt order. However, we remanded for resentencing solely to permit the district court to impose a fine within the applicable Guidelines range or to impose a greater fine accompanied by reasons justifying the departure. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>States v. Chusid, </em>372 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.2004). After a hearing, the district court reimposed the $250,000 fine. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Chusid argues that the above-Guidelines fine is unreasonable because the district court\u2019s finding as to ability to pay is based on impermissible speculation. We review a district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Guidelines for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"AqC\">The district court is \u201centitled to find all of the facts ... relevant to the determination of a non-Guidelines sentence\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 112 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15 (2d Cir.2005). As Chusid concedes, the district court \u201cshould not uncritically accept a defendant\u2019s representation that he has no assets,\u201d <em>United States v. Kassar, </em>47 F.3d 562, 567 (2d Cir.1995), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); it may draw inferences about a defendant\u2019s assets from circumstantial evidence, <em>United States v. Wong, </em>40 F.3d 1347, 1383 (2d Cir.1994); and it may rely on \u201cevidence of lucrative illegal activity\u201d to support a finding that a defendant is able to pay a fine, <em>United States v. Orena, </em>32 F.3d 704, 716 (2d Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The district court\u2019s determination that Chusid has the means to pay the $250,000 fine is based on its non-erroneous findings that Chusid fraudulently obtained more than $1.6 million in a single transaction, and that he wired $2.76 million offshore in an attempt to shelter the proceeds of his illegal conduct. On Chusid\u2019s original appeal, we concluded that these same findings did not constitute an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>Chusid, </em>372 F.3d at 117. Likewise, we now conclude that the above-Guidelines fine was reasonable because the district court\u2019s findings are based on evidence in the record, not mere speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\"> Chusid complains that the district court failed to provide a written statement of reasons for imposing an above-Guidelines fine in the written order of judgment. <em>See United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 138 (2d Cir.2006) (explaining that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) \u201crequires that the district court both (1) state in open court the \u2018specific\u2019 reason for the imposition of a sentence \u2018different from\u2019 the advisory Guidelines sentence and (2) state the reasons for that sentence \u2018with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2))). However, a statement of reasons was attached to the amended judgment of August 6, 2004, explaining that Chusid committed a lucrative fraud and that he now controls more than $2 million. The statement concludes that a Guidelines fine would result in a \u201ctravesty of justice.\u201d Finally, the statement explains that a $250,000 fine is \u201cnecessary for general and specific deterrence.\u201d The district court thus complied with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Finding no merit in Chusid\u2019s remaining arguments, the amended judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
