After she received a Notice to Appear charging her with remova-bility in October 2003, she filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Castellano\u2019s application claimed that on account of her political opinion she had suffered past persecution at the hands of the Bolivarian Circles, a group supporting Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, and the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">After a hearing, the IJ denied Castella-no\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims, concluding that any harm that she suffered did not rise to the level of persecution and that she had failed to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ also determined that Castellano had not established that she had been tortured in Venezuela and, therefore, denied her claim for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Castellano appealed to the BIA, arguing that she had established both that she suffered past persecution and that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her political opinion. She further contended that she had proved she was tortured by the government of Venezuela. On March 13, 2006 the BIA affirmed the Id\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">On April 10, 2006 Castellano filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA. She included with that motion an article reporting that the Chavez government in Venezuela has no tolerance for dissent and that citizens have been beaten, killed, imprisoned, and tortured for protesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">The BIA denied Castellano\u2019s motion for reconsideration, concluding that she had failed to identify any error of fact or law in its previous decision. Instead, the BIA noted, Castellano had reiterated the arguments she had made on appeal, which it had already considered and rejected. Because she submitted new evidence with her motion, however, the BIA also treated Castellano\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen. The BIA concluded that the article submitted by Castellano contained information that was merely cumulative of information that she had previously submitted, which also indicated that there were significant political tensions between the Venezuelan government and its opposition. The BIA, therefore, denied the motion to reopen as well. On August 1, 2007 Castellano petitioned this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Castellano first contends that the IJ erred in finding that she is not a refugee and that she did not establish that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her political opinion. She also contends that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>whether it has subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). An alien seeking review of an order of removal must file a petition for review within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). An order of removal becomes final upon the dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional, [and] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of an order of removal, moreover, is not affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>We cannot consider the merits of Castellano\u2019s arguments attacking the final order of removal because we lack jurisdiction to do so. The order became final on March 13, 2006 when the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). Although Castellano filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA on April 10, 2006, that filing did not change the date that the order of removal became final. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405,115 S.Ct. at 1549. She did not file her petition for review with this Court until August 1, 2007, over one year after the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Because she failed to file a petition for review within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), this Court does not have jurisdiction to address the merits of Castellano\u2019s claims about that order. Our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Castellano contends that the BIA erred by concluding that the new information she submitted with her motion to reconsider was cumulative. She also argues that the BIA erred in denying her motion for reconsideration because she presented sufficient evidence to support a finding of past persecution and future persecution on account of her political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration and a motion to reopen only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (relating to a motion for reconsideration); <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003) (relating to a motion to reopen). Because they are discretionary forms of relief, judicial review of denials of motions for reconsideration and to reopen are \u201climited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir. 1985) (citation omitted) (relating to a motion to reopen); <em>see also Assa\u2019ad, </em>332 F.3d at 1340-41 (noting that motions to reconsider are within the discretion of the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">In a motion for reconsideration, an alien must \u201cspecify the errors of law or fact in the previous order\u201d and must support the motion with \u201cpertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A) &amp; (C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). This Court has noted that \u201cmerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (omission in original). Thus, \u201c[a] motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">A motion to reopen must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentia-ry material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The motion will be granted only if \u201cit appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). An alien making a motion to reopen \u201cbears a \u2018heavy burden,\u2019 and must \u2018present\u00ed 1 evidence of such a nature that the [BIA] is satisfied that if proceedings before the [IJ] were reopened, with all attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u2019\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Castellano\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In her motion, she argued primarily that she had established that she suffered past persecution because of her involvement with the Democratic Action Political Party of Venezuela, that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her past persecution, that she cannot safely relocate to another town or city, and that she cannot obtain protection from the government of Venezuela. Those arguments, however, merely reiterated ones that she made in her initial appeal, which the BIA had already considered and rejected. The BIA did not err in denying her motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(C); <em>see also Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1330-31 (rejecting an alien\u2019s motion to reconsider because the motion \u201coffered nothing more than reiteration of her assertions in her motion to reopen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion by construing Castellano\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen and denying it. Her motion failed to state any new material facts that warranted reopening her case. The article that she submitted with her motion was not material because the information in it was cumulative of that she had already submitted. The article alleged that the Chavez government in Venezuela violates human rights on a regular basis and does not tolerate disagreement with it. Both the IJ and the BIA, however, had already considered numerous articles submitted by Castellano to the same effect. As a result, the additional article submitted in connection with the motion to reopen does not establish that if the proceedings were reopened, \u201cthe new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>See Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 813. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">In conclusion, we lack jurisdiction to review the petition insofar as it challenges the final order of removal and therefore DISMISS the petition in part. We DENY the petition for review insofar as it challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of Castellano\u2019s motion to reconsider and reopen.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
