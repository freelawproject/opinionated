He argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is a general one which is per se illegal. Because no clearly established rule of law in this circuit or any other circuit in the country holds that a general sentence cannot be imposed for a violation of supervised release,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error. Accordingly, we affirm Andreu\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-18\">. We have held that a general sentence imposed on a judgment of conviction is per se illegal. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1025 (11th Cir.2005). However, we have never extended the holding of <em>Moriarty </em>to a term of imprisonment imposed on a revocation of supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
