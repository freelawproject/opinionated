For the first time on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>peal, Rodriguez argues that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. The Government concedes that the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">While Rodriguez did not raise this argument below, we nevertheless review this issue de novo because Rodriguez asserts that his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Del Barrio, </em>427 F.3d 280, 282 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2005). Rodriguez\u2019s conviction that resulted in the term of supervised release that was revoked was for a second violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(1), which allows for a maximum sentence of two years of imprisonment and is a Class E felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1325(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3581(b)(5). Upon the revocation of supervised release that was imposed for a conviction for a Class E felony, the maximum sentence that may be imposed is one year of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Rodriguez\u2019s sentence of 18 months of imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
