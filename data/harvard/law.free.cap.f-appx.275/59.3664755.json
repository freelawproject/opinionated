Apr. 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77-347-521 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sep. 16, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g\u201e Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Here, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jiang did not demonstrate that she suffered past persecution. Jiang testified that the police arrested her once, held her for several hours, and struck her in the face several times. The BIA supplemented the IJ\u2019s decision and properly determined that Jiang\u2019s mistreatment did not rise above \u201charassment\u201d to the level of \u201cpersecution,\u201d where Jiang was released with no real injury. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. Of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Although the IJ erroneously found that Jiang had not been arrested on account of her practice of Falun Gong or an imputed connection with Falun Gong, remand is unnecessary as this Court can \u201cconfidently predict\u201d that the agency would reach the same decision absent the erroneous finding. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006). Regardless, the IJ alternatively denied asylum as a matter of discretion, a finding which Jiang has failed to challenge here. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005)(\u201cIssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived.\u201d)(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">We further find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jiang did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future prosecution. The IJ properly explained why it was reasonable, under the BIA\u2019s standards, to expect Jiang to corroborate her testimony regarding her fear of future persecution. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 290 (2d Cir. 2000). Further, the IJ properly explained why Jiang\u2019s proffered explanation for the lack of evidence was insufficient, and why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>her documents from China should receive minimal weight. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the IJ properly explained that Jiang had been in proceedings before the Immigration Court for four years, and that there had been ample opportunity for her to corroborate her claims. <em>Id.; Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>428 F.8d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, the agency did not err in determining that Jiang failed to satisfy her burden of proving a well-founded fear of future persecution for failure to corroborate her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Because Jiang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Regarding CAT relief, Jiang failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination before the BIA, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
