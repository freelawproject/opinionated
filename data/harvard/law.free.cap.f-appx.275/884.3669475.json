Alarcon, United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b911-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">This appeal involves two sentencing issues arising from Richard Tomaskovic\u2019s (Tomaskovic) conviction upon his guilty plea of violating the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act (IPKCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tomaskovic challenges the district court\u2019s application of the three-level increase, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(2), to his base level offense for substantial interference with the administration of justice resulting in \u201cthe unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also objects to the finding by the district court that his offense of international parental kidnapping was \u201cextensive in scope, planning and preparation\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(3)(C), warranting a two-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The district court sentenced Tomaskovic to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment followed by one year of supervised release. Finding no clear error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">The following facts are pertinent to the two issues on appeal. After meeting through an internet dating service, childless, fifty-six year-old Tomaskovic married his fourth wife, Ukraine citizen, Nataliya Vladislavona (Nataliya), in January 2002. In August 2003, infant son, N., was born.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The couple and their child moved from Florida to the Ukraine in July 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Although the marriage had already begun to deteriorate, in January 2005, To-maskovic bought three airline tickets back to the United States for himself, Nataliya and N. However, on February 23, 2005, Nataliya petitioned a Ukrainian district court for an order dissolving the marriage and preventing N. from leaving the country. On February 25, 2005, the court forbade the removal of N. from the Ukraine.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Nevertheless, on April 12, 2005, Tomas-kovic and N. left the Ukraine and entered the United States through JFK Airport in New York, and traveled to central Florida. He and N. stayed with a friend, Lewis Nester, for approximately two weeks. On April 28, 2005, the Ukrainian court dissolved the marriage and gave sole parental custody to Nataliya.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">According to Nester, Tomaskovic said that Interpol was looking for him and, for N.\u2019s safety, he was going to Honduras, where he believed he would not be subject to extradition. Nester said that Tomasko-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>vie used prepaid cellular telephones, presumably untraceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Although already legally divorced in the Ukraine, on May 2005, Tomaskovic initiated his own divorce proceedings in a Florida circuit court, presumably with the intention of formally obtaining custody of N. Nataliya was notified by publication. Apparently shocked when Nataliya hired Florida counsel and answered his divorce petition, Tomaskovic and N. fled, refusing to tell Nester where they were headed in case he was questioned by authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Meanwhile, in June 2005, the Florida court found it likely that Tomaskovic had violated the Ukrainian court\u2019s order and had abducted N. from Nataliya, the custodial parent. It ordered N. be placed with the Florida Department of Children and Families, and Tomaskovic to appear for an evidentiary hearing. When Tomaskovic failed to appear, the Florida court ordered that Tomaskovic be taken into custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Apparently, after leaving Nester\u2019s central Florida home, Tomaskovic and N. spent the next few months living in Idaho with another friend, Diane Arbuckle. To-maskovie indicated to Arbuckle that he had been awarded custody of N. and that the two of them wanted to make a clean start.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">From Idaho, the pair traveled to California, where Tomaskovic sold his car. Father and son then, on or about September 29, 2005, traveled to Honduras by way of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Almost a year later, in August 2006, neighbors complained to authorities about N.\u2019s welfare. Tomaskovic, using the assumed name of George Calderoni, was questioned and taken into custody by Honduran authorities. They in turn, contacted the United States Embassy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Within twenty-four hours, Calderoni was positively identified as Tomaskovic. After being questioned by the Consul General, an investigation was instituted. Two Miami-based FBI agents, already in Honduras on other business, were contacted. Special FBI Agent Nickolas Savage obtained an arrest warrant and flew to Honduras to recover N. and return Tomaskovic to the United States, where he was formally arrested on August 19, 2006.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">After the arrest, Special Agent Savage worked the Tomaskovic investigation on a full-time basis, retracing the father and son\u2019s movements from the Ukraine to New York to Florida to Idaho to California to Mexico and to Honduras. He interviewed approximately a dozen people, including Nester, Arbuckle (by telephone), and the purchaser of Tomaskovic\u2019s car in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">\u201cCongress has prescribed three standards for reviewing a district court\u2019s use of the Sentencing Guidelines: appellate courts are to review purely legal questions <em>de novo, </em>a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and, ... a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts with \u2018due deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). \u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The first issue on appeal involves the specific offense characteristic of obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(2), which states: \u201cIf the offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice, increase [the defendant\u2019s base offense level of fourteen, for violating IPKCA] by 3 levels.\u201d Application Note 1 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2 defines \u201cSubstantial interference with the administration of justice\u201d to include \u201ca premature or improper termination of a felony investigation; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence; or the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2J1.2, cmt. n. 1; <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>485 F.3d 1264, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing <em>United States v. Norris, </em>217 F.3d 262, 273 (5th Cir.2000) (where it is not necessary for the government to particularize a specific number of hours expended in order to sustain the enhancement)); <em>cf. United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221,1226 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">At sentencing, Tomaskovic objected to the three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.3(b)(2), arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no evidence that his actions substantially interfered with the administration of justice by causing the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources. He claimed that, in essence, Special Agent Savage was just doing his job when he obtained an arrest warrant and flew to Honduras to arrest Tomaskovic and retrieve N.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">While in Honduras, Tomaskovic argues that all Savage did in Honduras was to talk to three people already present at the embassy. When Savage returned to the United States, his \u201cfull-time investigation\u201d was basically to interview approximately a dozen people, mostly by telephone, and to collect record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">In response, the government argues that the district court committed no clear error in finding the three-level enhancement appropriate for the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources as Tomaskovic: (1) instituted fraudulent, unnecessary, yet substantial, Florida court proceedings in attempting to circumvent a pre-existing Ukrainian court order dissolving his marriage and awarding sole parental custody to Nataliya; (2) forced Special Agent Savage to obtain an arrest warrant and incur the expenditure of flying to Honduras to retrieve both To-maskovic and N.; (3) caused the Honduras Counsel General and two Honduran FBI agents to investigate his real identity; (4) upon their return to the United States, caused Special Agent Savage and another field agent to work full-time in an attempt to reconstruct Tomaskovic\u2019s travel and activity prior to his arrival in Honduras; (5) caused Special Agent Savage to interview a dozen witnesses and to collect other evidence of Tomaskovic\u2019s violation of IPKCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">We have thoroughly reviewed the sentencing hearing transcript, the parties\u2019 briefs, the arguments contained therein and reiterated at oral argument. We conclude that the district court committed no clear error in finding that Tomaskovic\u2019s cumulative actions over a sixteen-month period, through four countries, resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice. These actions caused the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources, and necessitated the three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Jl.2(b)(2) to Tomaskovic\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">The second issue on appeal involves the district court\u2019s finding of fact that Tomaskovic\u2019s IPKCA offense was \u201cotherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation.\u201d This finding warranted an additional two-level increase in Tomaskovie\u2019s base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(3)(C).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">At sentencing, Tomaskovic objected to the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(3)(C), arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no evidence in the record that his actions were extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. He claims that he acted only upon impulse after impulse, \u201cwanting only the best\u201d for N. He contends that his flight from the Ukraine to Florida to Idaho to California to Mexico to Honduras with N. was not premised upon an objective, premeditated plan, but was premised merely upon the subjective emotions of anxiety, fear and panic.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">In response, the government argues that the district court committed no clear error in finding the two-level enhancement appropriate for the extensive scope, planning, or preparation of Tomaskovic\u2019s flight plan because: (1) Tomaskovic and N. were \u201con the run\u201d for sixteen months, an extensive time; (2) they fled through four different countries; (3) they stayed with a number of different people in different states; (4) Tomaskovic told Nester that when authorities \u201cgot close\u201d to finding him, he planned to travel to Honduras, based upon Tomas-kovic\u2019s belief that the Honduran government maintained a lenient attitude regarding extradition; (5) that Tomaskovic filed a fraudulently misleading divorce petition in a Florida court for the dissolution of his previously dissolved marriage; (6) that To-maskovic purchased disposable prepaid cellular telephones in order to elude detection and avoided discussing his location on the telephone; and (7) that Tomaskovic purchased false identity documents in Honduras in order to hide from authorities. <em>See United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1046 (11th Cir.1994) (where \u201cthis circuit does not employ a precise definition for the \u2018otherwise extensive\u2019 standard, there are a number of factors relevant to the extensiveness determination, including the length and scope of the criminal activity as well as the number of persons involved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Again, we have thoroughly reviewed the record. We conclude that the district court committed no clear error in finding that Tomaskovic\u2019s cumulative actions warranted the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(3)(C) for \u201cextensive scope, planning, or preparation\u201d in his commission of the crime of international parental kidnapping, 18 U.S.C. 1204(a), an offense to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Finding no clear error, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. The IPKCA bars a parent from removing a child from the United States or retaining outside the United States a child who has been in the United States, with the intent to obstruct the other parent\u2019s right to physical custody. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(a). A violation of IPKCA is a Class E felony, subject to three years' imprisonment, and a $250,000 fine. <em>See United States v. Amer, </em>110 F.3d 873 (2d Cir.1997).
