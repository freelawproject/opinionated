Specifically, Mueller contends that his state conviction for third degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Michigan Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(1)(c) was not supported by sufficient evidence and that the district court erred in finding that his state conviction was based upon a reasonable application of federal law. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b478-22\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b478-23\">Petitioner, Donald Mueller (\u201cMueller\u201d), was convicted in Michigan state court of third degree criminal sexual conduct against Steven Shroek (\u201cSteven\u201d). At the time of the assault, Steven, who was 33 years old, lived at home with his parents and worked part-time at Arby\u2019s under a Michigan Rehabilitative Services program for individuals with developmental disabilities. Every day after work, Steven visited a local donut shop where he would' meet and talk with friends over coffee. Steven first encountered Mueller during one of his regular visits to the donut shop. Soon thereafter, Mueller began joining Steven and his friends for coffee and would often' stop by Arby\u2019s to buy Steven lunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-24\">On March 11, 2002, Mueller invited Steven to visit his home after he finished his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>shift at Arby\u2019s. Steven accepted the invitation, and Mueller picked him up after work. When the two arrived at Mueller\u2019s home, Mueller asked Steven if he would like to see some pictures. Mueller told Steven that before he could see the pictures he would have to follow the \u201chouse rules\u201d and remove his pants. Thereafter, Mueller displayed child pornography on his computer. Mueller instructed Steven not to tell anyone about the pictures. Sometime later, Steven called home to let his mother know where he was. Apparently upset that Steven did not return home after work as was his usual routine, Steven\u2019s mother instructed him to return home within an hour and said that she wanted to meet Mueller prior to the two of them spending any more time together. Prior to taking Steven home, Mueller gave him a bag of candy.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Mueller later dropped Steven off at home and met Steven\u2019s parents. When asked what the two of them had done while at Mueller\u2019s home by his parents, Steven replied that they had \u201cwatched Oprah and the news.\u201d (J.A. at 52) Steven\u2019s parents also questioned Mueller regarding his intentions toward them son. Mueller explained that he enjoyed spending time with Steven because Steven reminded him of his own son who was of a similar age and who also had a mental impairment. Mueller further explained that he had been married and rarely saw his son after his divorce. According to Steven\u2019s mother, Shirley, Mueller explained that \u201cI\u2019m a very lonely person ... Steve is very upbeat, he makes me happy ... I just really enjoy spending time with him.\u201d (J.A. at 52) Accepting Mueller\u2019s explanation as genuine, Steven\u2019s parents allowed the two to make arrangements to spend time together a few days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On March 13, 2002, Mueller picked Steven up from work. Prior to going to Mueller\u2019s home, Mueller stopped at a local video store and rented two pornographic videos. After the two arrived at Mueller\u2019s home, Mueller began showing a video and once again instructed Steven that he would have to remove his pants pursuant to the \u201chouse rules.\u201d (J.A. at 37) Steven replied \u201cno, because I\u2019m on \u2014 because my mom won\u2019t let me take them off.\u201d (J.A. at 38) Mueller then threatened to turn the video off. While seated on Mueller\u2019s couch, Steven unzipped his pants. Mueller, without pants or underwear, then joined Steven on the couch and pulled Steven\u2019s pants down further. Mueller then performed fellatio on Steven. Mueller again dropped Steven off at home and admonished him to keep what happened at his home a secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">A few days later Mueller called Steven to invite him back to Mueller\u2019s home. During the conversation, Steven became quite agitated, which caught the attention of Steven\u2019s mother. After overhearing Steven ask if he had to follow the house rules and remove his pants, Steven\u2019s mother instructed him to hang up the phone. Steven then told her about everything that occurred at Mueller\u2019s house, and police were contacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">As a result of the Shrocks\u2019 complaint, Mueller was charged with third degree criminal sexual conduct. In particular, Mueller was charged with sexual conduct with a person he either knew or should have known was mentally incapable. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(l)(c). During Mueller\u2019s trial, the jury heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Steven, his mother, and a therapist who treated Steven following the allegations of sexual abuse. Steven testified regarding his interactions with Mueller, including the alleged criminal sex acts. According to Steven, he had never seen pornographic materials prior to his contact with Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">In addition, Steven\u2019s mother testified regarding Steven\u2019s developmental disabilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and his limited ability to interact with others. Shirley testified that she and her husband began to notice that \u201c[Steven] just wasn\u2019t doing things the other kids were doing when he was about six months old.\u201d Shirley testified that when Steven enrolled in school, he was placed in special education classes and provided speech and hearing services. Steven remained in special education classes \u201cuntil he left school at age 26.... \u201d (J.A. at 49) Although 33 years old, Shirley testified that Steven functions at the level of a six- to eight-year old child. Shirley estimated that Steven has an IQ between 45 and 55 and that he is able to learn things through repetition. Because he is able to learn through repetition, Steven was able to obtain a job at Arby\u2019s under a Michigan Rehabilitative Services program. Shirley also testified that Steven has difficulty making \u201cjudgment calls\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s always trying to please people.\u201d (J.A. at 50)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Shirley also testified that Steven had very little knowledge of sex prior to his interactions with Mueller. In a similar vein, the jury also heard testimony from Jay McCrae of the Saginaw County Community Mental Health Authority. McCrae testified that he evaluated Steven after the allegations of sexual abuse surfaced. After some initial testing, McCrae diagnosed Steven as being \u201cmild[ly] mentally retarded\u201d with obsessive compulsive disorder. (J.A. at 60) According to McCrae, Steven\u2019s awareness of sex-related issues was at the \u201clevel of a five- to seven-year-old child.\u201d (JA. at 59) On cross-examination, McCrae\u2019s assessment of Steven\u2019s sexual awareness was challenged by Mueller\u2019s counsel. Mueller\u2019s counsel questioned McCrae regarding whether Steven had a \u201chistory of sexual preoccupation.\u201d (J.A. at 60) McCrae, however, would not confirm that Steven had a sexual preoccupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Mueller did not put forward any witnesses in his defense and was convicted of third degree criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Following his conviction, a Michigan state trial court sentenced Mueller to 162-270 months of imprisonment. On direct appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, Mueller argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. <em>People v. Mueller, </em>No. 247660, 2004 WL 1366953, at *1 (Mich.Ct.App. June 17, 2004). Based on the witness testimony described above, the Court of Appeals rejected Mueller\u2019s argument and affirmed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at *2. Mueller then filed a petition for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, which was denied. (J.A. at 28)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">After exhausting his state court remedies, Mueller filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Upon review of the record and the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the district court denied Mueller\u2019s petition and concluded that \u201cthe resolution of Petitioner\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim was neither contrary to nor [ ] an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\u201d (J.A. at 81)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Mueller now timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING MUELLER\u2019S CONVICTION FOR THIRD DEGREE CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">\u201cIn a habeas corpus proceeding, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>Miskel v. Karnes, </em>397 F.3d 446, 451 (6th Cir.2005). This Court\u2019s pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>er, however, to review a state court\u2019s determination regarding the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction is limited by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Because Mueller filed his habeas petition after 1996, AEDPA governs his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">AEDPA prohibits a federal court from granting a writ of habeas corpus to a person incarcerated pursuant to a state court judgment with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication of the claim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State Court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(l)-(2). A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if \u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decision arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme Court] on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Moreover, a state court determination is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions, but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, when evaluating the propriety of a state court\u2019s application of a legal principle to the facts of a petitioner\u2019s case, this Court must presume the factual determinations made by the state court to be correct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The presumption of correctness may be rebutted only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <em>Williams, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1523.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">A state court decision may also be unreasonable where the state court extends a legal principle to an inapposite context or refuses to extend a principle to an analogous context. <em>Id. </em>at 1520. However, a federal habeas court may not reverse a state court decision on the grounds that it was unreasonable \u201csimply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1522. Instead, a federal habeas court may reverse only where the state court\u2019s application of clearly established law is \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Mueller does not challenge any of the factual findings of the Michigan Court of Appeals. Rather, he alleges that the Michigan Court of Appeals improperly applied <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), to find that the facts adduced at his trial supported a conviction for third degree criminal sexual conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Under <em>Jackson, </em>a petitioner challenging a state court conviction \u201cis entitled to ha-beas corpus relief if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.S. at 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781. In examining the sufficiency of the evidence to support a state conviction, this Court must give deference to the fact-finder\u2019s determination based on \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">This Court \u201cwill reverse a judgment for insufficiency of evidence only if, viewing the record as a whole, the judgment is not supported by substantial and competent evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Blakeney, </em>942 F.2d 1001, 1010 (6th Cir.1991). This Court has \u201cdefined substantial evidence as being \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. It is evidence affording a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Grubbs, </em>506 F.3d 434, 438 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Martin, </em>375 F.2d 956, 957 (6th Cir.1967)). Circumstantial evidence alone may constitute substantial evidence where it \u201ccan sustain a guilty verdict and ... [such] evidence need not remove every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>505 F.3d 578, 592 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Stone, </em>748 F.2d 361, 362 (6th Cir.1984)). In evaluating the evidence adduced at trial, this Court must \u201cview all evidence and resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that the prosecution prove \u201call elements of the offense charged, and must persuade the fact finder \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (internal citations omitted). Therefore, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict, this Court must \u201cdo so \u201cwith explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Renico, </em>506 F.3d 444, 447 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 324 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 2781).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">To sustain a conviction for third degree criminal sexual conduct under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(l)(c), the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) \u201c[a] person engag[ed] in sexual penetration with another person;\u201d (2) the other person must have been mentally incapable, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; and (3) \u201c[t]he actor knows or has reason to know that the victim is mentally incapable, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(l)(c). Mueller alleges that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient with respect to the latter two prongs of third degree criminal sexual conduct. We find Mueller\u2019s argument to be wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">1. Victim\u2019s Mental Capacity</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">Under Michigan law, a person is \u201cmentally incapable\u201d where the person \u201csuffers from a mental disease or defect that renders that person temporarily or permanently incapable of appraising the nature of his or her conduct.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520a(i). In <em>People v. Breck, </em>230 Mich.App. 450, 584 N.W.2d 602 (1998), the Michigan Court of Appeals noted that \u201cthe rationale behind the statutes prohibiting sexual relations with a mentally incapable person is that such a person is presumed to be incapable of truly consenting to the sexual act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Based on the rationale of the statute, the <em>Breck </em>court rejected a defendant\u2019s assertion that the statute was intended to reach only those mental disabilities which impact a person\u2019s ability to \u201cunderstand the physical nature of the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. Instead, the court read the term \u201cmentally incapable\u201d to include \u201cnot only an understanding of the physical act but also an appreciation of the nonphysical factors, including the moral quality of the act, that accompany such an act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>this definition, the <em>Break </em>court found that the victim was \u201cmentally incapable\u201d based on the fact that the victim was unable to understand the \u201clong-term ramifications of safe sex\u201d or \u201cthe nature of a romantic relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. Moreover, the victim was deemed to be mentally incapable because of testimony from a psychologist indicating that the victim \u201cwas a trusting individual who would quickly make a person his friend and do anything that person asked him to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The psychologist also testified that the victim was \u201cunable to make personality or character judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Taken together, the court found that the evidence established that the victim was mentally incapable of \u201cappraising the nature of his conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Cox, </em>268 Mich. App. 440, 709 N.W.2d 152 (2005), the defendant appealed a conviction for third degree criminal sexual conduct, alleging that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim was mentally incapable. There, the defendant engaged in oral sex with a seventeen year-old victim who was alleged to be mentally incapable. During the defendant\u2019s trial, the victim testified regarding the sex acts between him and the defendant, stating \u201cI just wanted to try something new and so he asked me if I wanted to, and I said yeah, so we went on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156. Various caseworkers and psychologists testified that the victim was unable to live on his own, was easily manipulated and functioned at a \u201c \u2018borderline\u2019 range of intelligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the opinion of these experts, the victim was \u201cdevelopmentally around the age of eleven, twelve or thirteen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One expert further testified that, although the victim was \u201caware of his conduct,\u201d he could not appreciate the significance of a sexual relationship with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 157. Based on this evidence, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim was \u201cmentally incapable\u201d within the meaning of the third degree criminal sexual conduct statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In the instant case, which is like <em>Break </em>and <em>Cox, </em>the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in determining that there was ample evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find that Steven was mentally incapable beyond a reasonable doubt. Like the victim in <em>Cox, </em>there was evidence produced at trial regarding Steven\u2019s cognitive disabilities. For instance, Steven\u2019s mother testified that Steven was in special education classes until age 26 because of his developmental disabilities. While in school, Steven was classified as \u201ctrainable mentally impaired,\u201d which corresponds to an IQ of 45 to 55. (J.A. at 50) Steven\u2019s mother also testified that his ability to reason and make decisions is equivalent to that of a six- to eight-year-old child.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Additionally, as in <em>Break, </em>the jury heard testimony from Steven\u2019s mother regarding his dependency on others to meet his basic needs, as she testified that \u201che would never be completely on his own in society.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Indeed, although Steven maintained a job at Arby\u2019s, it was obtained through a Michigan Rehabilitation Services program that matches a job coach with individuals with a mental disability to teach basic job skills and functions. Steven\u2019s mother further testified regarding his need of supervision because he is \u201ctoo trusting of others,\u201d and \u201calways trying to please people.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Moreover, the jury heard testimony regarding Steven\u2019s limited knowledge regarding reproductive matters. During the trial, the prosecution offered evidence in the form of testimony that Steven\u2019s knowledge of sex prior to his encounter with Mueller was equivalent to what a young child would know, and that Steven had not asked his parents many sex-related ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>tions. This assessment was further bolstered by the testimony of Jay McCrae of the Saginaw County Community Mental Health Authority, who evaluated Steven after the alleged sexual abuse. According to McCrae, Steven\u2019s awareness of sex-related issues is likely \u201con the level of a five-to seven-year-old child. It\u2019s very elementary \u2014 his awareness is very elementary of some of those concepts.\u201d (J.A. at 59)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Mueller, however, argues that the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that Steven had an awareness of sex prior to the alleged abuse such that he could appreciate both the physical act and the nonphysical factors. To support this assertion, Muller points to three pieces of evidence: (1) a diagnosis by a staff member at the Community Mental Health Authority that Steven had a \u201chistory of sexual preoccupation;\u201d (2) testimony that Steven told his mother that he watched \u201cOprah and the news\u201d rather than pornographic materials while at Mueller\u2019s home; and (3) testimony that Steven wanted to see the pornographic materials obtained by Mueller.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Mueller\u2019s arguments regarding Steven\u2019s ability to appreciate the nature and consequences of his sexual activity, however, are unavailing when placed in the context of the totality of the evidence presented to the jury. First, the evidence suggesting that Steven had a \u201chistory of sexual preoccupation\u201d was disputed at trial and was not corroborated by McCrae. Second, while Steven did testify that he lied to his mother regarding his viewing of pornographic materials, Mueller neglects to note that the jury heard evidence that Steven was instructed not to tell his parents about what occurred. Additionally, as <em>Cox </em>demonstrates, the mere fact that a victim may have wanted an act to occur, does not mean that the victim could consent to or understand the significance of a particular act.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Importantly, while the jury could have inferred that Steven was aware of the moral quality of his act based on the evidence cited by Mueller, it was not compelled to do so. As noted above, the jury was presented with significant evidence regarding Steven\u2019s limited cognitive abilities as well as some evidence regarding Steven\u2019s ability to consent to the sexual activity that took place. After evaluating the evidence, it appears that the jury discounted evidence of Steven\u2019s ability to consent based on its verdict. Indeed, under <em>Jackson </em>\u201ca federal habeas corpus court faced with a record of historical facts that support conflicting inferences must presume\u2014 even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u201d 443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781. Thus, the district court properly concluded that the Michigan Courts did not unreasonably apply federal law in holding that there was adequate evidence to support a finding that Steven was \u201cmentally incapable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">2. Knowledge that Victim was Mentally Incapable</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Mueller also contends that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he knew or should have known of Steven\u2019s mental incapacity. This claim is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Under Michigan law, criminal liability attaches for third degree criminal sexual conduct where the defendant knew or had reason to know of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(l)(c). The Michigan Court of Appeals has noted that, in enacting the statute, \u201cthe Legislature only intended to eliminate liability where the mental defect is not apparent to reasonable persons.\u201d <em>People v. Baker, </em>157 Mich.App. 613, 403 N.W.2d 479, 481 (1986) (quoting <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number><em>Davis, </em>102 Mich.App. 403, 301 N.W.2d 871, 874 (1980)). Consequently, a defendant may be held liable for third degree criminal sexual conduct under Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.520d(l)(c) where a reasonable person would have known that the victim was mentally incapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In the case at bar, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that Steven\u2019s mental disability would not only have been evident to a reasonable person, but was subjectively known to Mueller based on his interactions with Steven and his comments to Steven\u2019s parents. As an initial matter, the prosecution offered evidence in the form of testimony by McCrae that a person with \u201cmild mental retardation,\u201d such as Steven, may appear to have more severe developmental disabilities to a lay person. Thus, this testimony, if credited by the trier of fact, could serve as a basis for a finding that Steven\u2019s mental incapacity was objectively ascertainable. Moreover, the trier of fact also had ample basis to support a finding that Mueller had subjective knowledge of Steven\u2019s mental impairment. Here, the jury heard testimony from Steven\u2019s mother regarding a conversation with Mueller wherein he stated he had experience with developmentally disabled individuals because his son also had a mental disability. Thus, a jury could rationally infer that Mueller recognized similar traits in Steven. Additionally, the trier of fact could rationally infer from evidence indicating that Mueller instructed Steven regarding the \u201chouse rules\u201d requiring him to disrobe, asked Steven not to tell anyone about their activities together, and gave Steven candy, that Mueller was aware of Steven\u2019s mental disability. Thus, the district court properly found that the evidence relied upon by the State court satisfied the knowledge prong of the statute, and that therefore <em>Jackson </em>was reasonably applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
