It is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s February 7, 2007 order be affirmed. Appellant seeks attorney\u2019s fees under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E), claiming to have \u201csubstantially prevailed\u201d within the meaning of the statute by virtue of the district court\u2019s order in <em>Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides v. EPA, </em>254 F.Supp.2d 125 (D.D.C.2003). We find the case controlled by <em>Campaign for Responsible Transplantation v. FDA, </em>511 F.3d 187, 196 (D.C.Cir.2007), in which we held that \u201can order compelling the production of a <em>Vaughn </em>index, without more, is not enough to make a plaintiff a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 sufficient to support a claim for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d A <em>Vaughn </em>index compels the government to explain what information it has withheld from disclosure, as well as its legal justification under the FOIA for so withholding. <em>See generally Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>484 F.2d 820 (D.C.Cir. 1973). Similarly, in this case, the district court\u2019s 2003 order required nothing more of the agency than an explanation as to whether third-party redactions to a requested document withheld information that was not subject to disclosure under the FOIA. <em>See </em>254 F.Supp.2d at 133-35. Like a <em>Vaughn </em>index, this explanation provided an accounting of what was withheld and why. Appellant did not \u201csubstantially prevail! ]\u201d by securing such an explanation, and therefore is not eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
