Dec. 30, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A75 251 725 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-22\">As a threshold matter, our review is confined only to the agency\u2019s denial of Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-23\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-24\">We conclude that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen. A movant\u2019s failure to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for the underlying substantive relief sought is a proper ground for the agency to deny a motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). As the Government argues, Kaur is ineligible for the underlying relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that she seeks, whether adjustment of status or asylum, because she is permanently barred from receiving any immigration benefits as a result of the finding of frivolousness that the IJ made against her. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Kaur did not challenge that finding before the BIA, that finding is final, and Kaur is permanently ineligible for any immigration benefits. Accordingly, the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition' is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-14\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">If the Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum and the alien has received the notice under paragraph (4)(A), the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits under this chapter, effective as of the date of a final determination on such application.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
