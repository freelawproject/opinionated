Feb. 7, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 494 536 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 27, 2005). The IJ determined that Pena had been convicted of a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d and concluded that, under the ruling in <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 586 n. 4 (B.I.A.1978), this conviction required Pena to show \u201cunusual or outstanding equities\u201d in order to be eligible for section 212(c) relief. The IJ concluded that Pena had not met this standard and denied relief accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA concluded that Pena had been convicted of \u201cvery serious criminal conduct\u201d and therefore found no error in the IJ\u2019s application of the heightened standard to his case, or in the IJ\u2019s actual balancing of the equities under this standard. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented by this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any ... decision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified ... to be in the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d Denial of section 212(c) relief \u201cconstitutes a discretionary decision ... under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\u201d <em>Avendano-Espejo v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir.2006). Pena maintains that we nonetheless have jurisdiction to hear his appeal because it presents a \u201cquestion! ] of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), to wit, whether conviction under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.16 and 110.00 constitutes conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>for a \u201cserious drug offense[ ] ... involving the trafficking or sale of drugs,\u201d <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 586 n. 4, thereby triggering the duty to show unusual and outstanding equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Whether or not we have jurisdiction to decide this petition under the foregoing statutory provisions, we deny the petition because Pena\u2019s legal arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Pena\u2019s conviction is indisputably a conviction for a drug trafficking crime. \u201c[T]he term \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 means any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.)....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). \u201c[A] state offense constitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 633, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Conduct proscribed by N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 220.16 and 110.00, the New York statutes under which Pena was convicted, would also be punishable as a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, which are provisions of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Furthermore, the BIA and IJ were within their discretion when they determined that Pena had been convicted of a crime involving the sale of drugs. <em>Matter of Marin </em>does not define what constitutes a crime involving the \u201csale of drugs,\u201d 16 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 586 n. 4, and therefore leaves the term open to capturing a broad range of criminal offenses. The determination of when a conviction involves the \u201csale of drugs\u201d is left to the discretion of the adjudicator. Thus, the IJ did not err in concluding that because \u201cthe indictment allege[d] that [Pena] possessed ... controlled substances with the intent to sell them,\u201d he was convicted of a crime involving the \u201csale of drugs.\u201d Nor did the BIA err in finding that Pena was convicted of a crime involving the \u201csale of drugs\u201d because \u201cthe language of the statute under which [he] was convicted requires an \u2018intent to sell.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Accordingly, the BIA and IJ were within their discretion when they determined that Pena had to demonstrate outstanding and unusual equities in order to be granted section 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
