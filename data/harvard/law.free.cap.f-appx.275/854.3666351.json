No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-26\">On appeal, Johnson argues that the record did not support a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range and that the district court did not adequately consider his personal history and characteristics in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-27\">Because Johnson was sentenced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number><em>States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244-46 (11th Cir.2005). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence, protection of the public, and just punishment, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)\u2014(7). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential\u201d; and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We conclude that Johnson\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Johnson\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range as 188 to 235 months based on his classification as an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A); and the district court sentenced Johnson to the high point of that range. <em>Id,, </em>(noting that \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). The Supreme Court recently has explained that \u201ca court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462,168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The district court noted that it sentenced Johnson to the high end of his advisory Guidelines range so that the sentence would reflect the seriousness of the crime, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment. The district court also stated that it had considered the statements of all the parties and the presentence investigation report, which included both the advisory Guidelines range and the section 3553(a) factors. The district court was not required to state on the record that it explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Bohannon, </em>476 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2953, 168 L.Ed.2d 277 (2007) (explaining that \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the [section] 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d). And the weight given to a section 3553(a) factor is within the sound discretion of the district court; \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated in part on different grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Based on the factors outlined in section 3553(a) and our review of the record, we conclude that Johnson has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\"> The government asserts that, because Johnson did not object to the sentence as unreasonable after it was imposed, we should review Johnson's present challenge only for plain error. We need not decide this issue because, even under a reasonableness standard, Johnson's appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
