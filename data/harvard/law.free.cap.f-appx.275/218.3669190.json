Paredes\u2019 appellate attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging that Paredes waived his right to appeal his sentence and stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but challenging the enhancement Paredes received for discharge of a firearm, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(A) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Paredes has filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, stating that he now wishes to withdraw his guilty plea to Count Three, and asserting that his sentence was unreasonable. For the reasons explained below, we affirm Paredes\u2019 conviction, but grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Pa-redes\u2019 appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Our review of the record discloses that the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Paredes\u2019 guilty plea, and that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (defendant\u2019s statements at guilty plea hearing presumed true). In addition, when the district court questions a defendant about the waiver provision in his plea agreement before accepting his plea, as happened here, the waiver is valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively demonstrates ineffectiveness, which is not the case here. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, 434 </em>F.3d <em>233, 239 </em>(4th Cir.2006). We find no merit in the other issues raised in the pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Paredes\u2019 conviction, but dismiss his appeal of his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
