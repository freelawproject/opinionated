That section contemplates such registration before that session, for it says the court shall cause the names to be copied in the other list \u201cat the sittings, for the purpose of completing and revising the registration lists.\u201d The court is not authorized to make a general revision of the list at the session held on the Tuesday next preceding the election. It can then only add the names of voters omitted from the list or coming of age since the making up thereof, who shall appear in person and make application for registration . This work is not the general revision contemplated and authorized to be made at the previous session held on the first Monday of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">No authority is conferred upon one registrar to put on names without the concurrence and assent of the other, at their sitting between the two terms of court. On the contrary, the terms of the clause of sec. 98a (6) of said chapter, providing for such sitting, clearly indicate legislative purpose to require them to concur, for they must make out two alphabetical lists and no authority is given one to list names not listed by the other, nor is either required to' copy names listed by the other. If they cannot agree as to any person, his name must be left off and he must apply to the county court for registration, at res session subsequently held. Any other interpretation would make the statute work absurd and unjust results. If names could be so put on by a single registrar, he could, if so disposed, put on any number of names of persons not entitled to vote, and they could not be struck off for lack of time to give the required five days notice and hear and consider the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As the names in question were put on without autnonty, the persons represented by them were not legally registered, and the court had power to strike them from the single lists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>in which they appeared, to the end that election officers might not be confused, misled or annoyed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Under this interpretation of the statute, the writ prayed for was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>Writ refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
