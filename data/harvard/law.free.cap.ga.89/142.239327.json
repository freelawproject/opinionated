The property was found subject, and the claimant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b157-8\">The evidence for the plaintiff was: She married defendant twelve or fifteen years ago. He told her he had \u201cshammed off\u201d his place to Sam. Griffis, and that Sam. should never have it. Sam. paid the taxes out of defendant\u2019s money. He lived on the same place during the time plaintiff stayed with him; claimed it and used it as his own. About ten years ago defendant offered to trade places with plaintiff\u2019s father, and told him he (defendant) had \u201c shammed off\u201d his place where he lived to Sam. Griffis, hut it would be all right. Defendant has lived on the land in question, up to 1889, for thirty or forty years, using and cultivating it as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b157-10\">The claim rested on a deed from the defendant dated September 16, 1870. Claimant testified: My father is about eighty years old. He made the deed to me in consideration that I should maintain and support him in his old age. This I have done by furnishing him with clothing and food for his support, and have paid his doctor\u2019s bills and assisted him-in tending the land, and am novs^ tending and in possession of it. I received the deed in good faith, and have performed the agreement between us. I did not have the deed recorded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>. because I did not think it necessary. I sold beef-cattle for him, and received the money; spent some in his support; don\u2019t remember that any consideration was paid for the land when the deed was made. He lived on the land, cultivated and used it; never made support ; <em>got </em>no rent.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AVl\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\n<em>Judyment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b158-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>J.
