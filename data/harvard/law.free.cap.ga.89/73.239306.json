H. Miller against J. A. &amp; J. B. Payne: The defendants pleaded not indebted, breach of warranty, and recoupment; and they prayed for a rescission of the contract of sale. They alleged that in 1886 they contracted with the plaintiff for an 80 saw gin, feeder and condenser, agreeing to pay the price charged by the plaintiff\", with the positive assurance and guaranty on plaintiff\u2019s part that the gin was strictly first class and warranted by him to be equal to the Pratt gin which defendants were then using, and to do as good work as any first class gin. Relying on these representations and warranties, defendants received the gin, feeder and condenser and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>proceeded to use them for the purposes for which they were bought. To their surprise and damage they found that the gin so sold was of inferior quality, the saws were poor and worthless, and the gin was not by any means first class, nor was it the equal of the Pratt gin, but was almost if not entirely worthless, and defendants could not use it in their business, but were forced to set it aside and rely altogether upon their Pratt gin. By reason of the breach of the guaranty and warranty made by the plaintiff they have been damaged $500, because they could not gin the cotton of the public during the season of 1886 (they at that time operating a public gin and receiving compensation from each person whose cotton they ginned), and they lost large sums by reason of the inferior and almost worthless quality of said gin and its failure to do first class work and to gin the cotton which was brought to them by their customers. They notified the plaintiff promptly that the gin was not such as they had contracted for and as he had guaranteed and represented to them when the sale was being negotiated and perfected; they offered to return the property to him and have ever since been willing and anxious to return it to him, and they now offer to do so; but he has refused to accept it.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AZuP\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Pending the cause one of the defendants died, and his executrix was made a party in his stead.

Miller to J. A. Payne dated August 29th, 1886. All letters from same to same dated between August 29th, 1886, and September 23d, 1886. Letter from O. H. Miller to J. A. &amp; J. B.

The original guarantee furnished by 0. IT. Miller to defendants through W. F. Wynne at the time he finished putting up gin, about September 20, 1886. The original of all telegrams sent by defendants to plaintiff, and all other letters written by plaintiff to defendants about said gin in controversy.\u201d Over objection of the defendants the court admitted in evidence a printed circular styled \u201cPrivate instructions to agents.\u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel on the trial had a similar paper, and stated that he found it among the letters and papers handed him by his client, John A. Payne, deceased, when he employed him to defend this suit. The objections were, that the particular paper objected to was not embraced in the notice, and that it-was not proper testimony and was illegal and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b89-5\">(2) Error in certain parts of the charge (see 2d headnote).</summary>\n<summary id=\"b89-6\">(8) The court permitted W.

The defendants\u2019 objection to his testimony was, that Wynne was the agent of the plaintiff, and J. A. Payne, one of the defendants, was dead.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b89-7\">(4) Verdict contrary to law and evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b89-8\">Hoyl &amp; Parks, by Harrison <em>&amp; </em>Peeples, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b89-9\">W.
