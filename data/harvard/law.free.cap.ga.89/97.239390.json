It was defended on the ground that the sale was made on agreement that the defendant might return such of the goods as did not, in quality and style, equal the samples exhibited to him by the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, and the clothing was to be shipped in one lot and without delay; but that it was shipped in two lots at different times and after considerable delay, parts of suits in the first lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>being withheld until the second shipment; that the greater portion of the clothing was inferior in style and quality to the samples ; and that the defendant paid the plaintifis for such of the goods as he retained, and shipped the rest back to them in a reasonable time. The evidence was conflicting. The jury found for the defendant. The plaintifis moved for a new trial on the general grounds, and because of numerous alleged errors in the judge\u2019s charge, especially in that it excluded from the consideration of the jury the questions mainly relied on by the plaintifis, and in that it was not justified by the evidence in the submission of certain issues. The motion was ovei\u2019ruled.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Anlp\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u2019 Spence &amp; Twitty, by brief, for plaintifis.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b112-6\">I.
