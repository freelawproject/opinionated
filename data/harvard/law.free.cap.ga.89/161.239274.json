Where in substance the declaration sets forth a tort, though the form be in part appropriate to an action on contract, the declaration may be upheld as one complaining of the tort; and an account annexed thereto and referred to in the body of the declaration may be consulted to supply a requisite date which is not otherwise fully alleged or disclosed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b175-9\">2.

The plaintiff having, as he had a right to do, built his pasture fence and located the gate for his cattle on his own land, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>maintaining and use of this fence and gate did not constitute contributory negligence on his part, and the court committed no error in failing to instruct the jury on contributory negligence. The question of unavoidable accident was not in the case, there being no evidence explaining the details and attendant circumstances of the tort.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b176-4\">6.

December term, 1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">The declaration alleged that defendant was indebted to Palmer $129, besides mterest, for that the defendant, its agents and employees, \u201c by the reckless negligence in running its trains in said county and through the lands of petitioner in the mouth of October, 1889, did by its said agents and employees, and through the instrumentality of its said trains, kill and destroy five head of cattle, the property of petitioner, of the said value of $129 as per itemized account a copy of which is hereto attached as a part hereof and which said .defendant refuses to pay, notwithstanding often asked to do so by petitioner.\u201d The defendant demurred upon the ground that the declaration did not set forth the cause of action in this: it was so ambiguous that it was impossible to determine whether it was an action <em>ex delicto </em>or <em>ex contractu; </em>as an action <em>ex contractu </em>it alleged no promise to pay; it was defective as an action of tort, because it did not allege the time when the cattle were killed, and as it was proceeding against defendant solely on the ground of presumption of law against defendant, time was essential, that defendant might produce its agents who ran over defendant\u2019s road at that time. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-8\">The evidence for plaintiff was to the following effect: Defendant\u2019s railroad track runs through plaintiff\u2019s land. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Plaintiff uses the field through which it runs for pasture for his cattle. The five cattle sued for are worth the price set out in the declaration. They were killed at various times during the last of September, 1889, beginning about the 22d, at intervals of two or three days, all being killed within a period of three weeks running into the first of October. All of them were found near the track, either crippled or killed, at various times in the morning, and they must have been killed during the night before. Plaintiff' has been using this field as a pasture for cattle for a number of years. He put a fence about thirty or forty feet north of the railroad, separating other portions of his land from this pasture. He never lost any cattle by the railroad before he erected this fence. The reason he put the fence above the track was, because the cattle kept getting into his crops in the field north of the railroad on account of the bad condition of the stock-gaps. These outside cattle do not get into the pasture now, because during 1889, and for a year, the stock-gaps have been kept up very well. The point where the cattle in question were all killed was on the railroad which here runs along an embankment between a stock-gap and a trestle, and almost opposite the gate is plaintiff\u2019s fence where the cattle came into the pasture and from which they came out on returning home. In getting into and out of the pasture the cattle have to pass over the railroad. Plaintiff has had other cattle killed by the railroad since, and did have up to the time he took them out of this field. He has two or three other pastures. The cattle would not have got hurt if the fence had been south of the track. It was probably the nearest way through the field to plaintiff \u2019s house to let the cattle in and out at the gate mentioned. It would be more inconvenient to go all the way around to let them in below. If the fence had been built south of the road it would not have cut off anything from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>pasture but the right of way of the railroad, which extends thirty feet on each side of the track. If the cattle are on the north side of the track when the train is coming, there is room enough for them to stand and let the train pass, but they are not apt to keep still; their nature leads them to try to get away, and this they could only do by crossing the track. The section-master butchered one of the cows, and plaintiff took one of the hind quarters with the agreement to set off\u2019 whatever it was worth after it was weighed. It did not appear what this quarter weighed, but plaintiff' did not think it weighed as much as ninety pounds. It was not worth ten cents a pound, probably not more than three or four cents. Defendant introduced no evidence, apparently.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A_\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The jury found for plaintiff, and defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was overruled. To this also it excepted. The motion contained the following grounds besides those alleging that the verdict was contrary to law, evidence, etc.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b178-5\">The court said to defendant\u2019s counsel in the hearing of the jury, \u201cI do not see what use there is in proving that the building of the fence has increased the dangers of the locality,\u201d\u2014defendant\u2019s attorney having just asked the plaintiff whether the building of his fence at that particular point had not increased the danger to cattle in that pasture. The court\u2019s remark was alleged to be error, \u201cbecause that was a question of negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part and for the jury, and was an expression of opinion on the evidence, and moreover was erroneous as a legal proposition.\u201d The court certified that this remark of the court was made in the course of a legal argument by defendant\u2019s counsel, with a view to draw out the counsel\u2019s ideas of the law, and not to express any opinion to the jury.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b178-6\">. Defendant\u2019s counsel in his opening argument urged the proposition, \u201cthat if the killing of these cattle was an unavoidable accident, or resulted from the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>in which, plaintiff had located his fence with reference to the tracks, thereby greatly increasing the natural dangers of this locality, and he could have avoided building his fence just here without any serious inconvenience, then we take the position that the plaintiff' cannot recover.\u201d The court interrupted counsel to say that he did not agree with those propositions, that it did not make any difference where the fence was located, and the court did not understand that the defendant had any right to object to plaintiff\u2019s placing his fence where he chose on his own land. This was alleged to be error because it entirely withdrew from the jury all question of the contributory character of plaintiff\u2019s negligence in constructing his fence, and was an expression of opinion on the facts. The court certified that this remark was made, not as a final legal proposition or charge to the jury, but only by way of giving counsel an opportunity to combat the court\u2019s idea of the law and convince him to the contrary, if he could.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b179-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to rule out certain testimony to which he had objected, and added, \u201cI want the court to understand that I reserve this point.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI understand that you wish to reserve that point for the purpose of taking the case up.\u201d It was alleged that this was error \u201cbecause it was calculated to prejudice the jury and lead them to believe that defendant had despaired of his ease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b179-6\">The court admitted testimony of the tortious killing of the cattle, defendant objecting thereto because plaintiff' declared on an open account in an action <em>ex contractu, </em>and there was no claim for damages <em>ex delicto </em>in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b179-7\">The court charged: \u201cWhen the killing of stock by a railroad is shown, the law puts the burden on the railroad of rebutting the presumption of negligence. This presumption may be rebutted in one of three ways : either by showing that they have exercised all ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and reasonable care and diligence to avoid the injury; or that the injury was done with plaintiff\u2019s consent, which of course, is not contended in this case; or that it resulted solely from the negligence of the plaintiff.\u201d This charge was alleged to be error, because defendant did contend and the evidence tended to show that the conduct of plaintiff' amounted in law to a consent to the injury, and this charge entirely withdrew that question from the jury and was an expression of opinion on the facts; also, because it confined the contributory character of plaintiff\u2019s negligence to the single hypothesis of the injury resulting solely from said negligence.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b180-3\">The court failed to charge the law applicable to contributory negligence, and unavoidable accident. This was alleged to be error, because the facts called for such a charge, and it was impossible for the jury to properly consider the case without a knowledge of this law; and because it was one of defendant\u2019s contentions to the jury that, so far as it was concerned, this was a case of unavoidable accident and the evidence tended to show it.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b180-4\">The verdict is so vague and indefinite as to be without meaning, it being as follows: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the plaintiff $129 with credit of seventy-five pounds of at three and a half cents per lb., with entrust from Oct. 15, 1889.\u201d This verdict was read in the presence of the jury as follows: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the plaintiff one hundred and twenty-nine dollars, with credit of 75 pounds of beef at three and a half cents per pound, with interest from Oct. 15, 1889.\u201d</summary>\n<summary id=\"b180-5\">The verdict is contrary to law in finding interest, the action being one <em>ex delicto, </em>and if interest was found at all it should be added into the principal sum of the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b180-6\">W.
