At the trial the following facts appeared: Laidley &amp; Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio, sold and shipped to N. L. Bagan, of Albany, Ga., a car-load of meat for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>was to pay on arrival at Albany. On the same day (April 11, 1890) they drew on Ragan for the price of the meat, attaching to the draft the bill of lading issued at Cincinnati to \u201cshippers\u2019 order\u201d with direction to \u201cnotify N. L. Ragan, Albany, G-a.\u201d indorsing the bill of lading to the Fourth National Bank of Cincinnati, and indorsing the draft, \u201c For deposit to the credit of F. A. Laidley &amp; Co.,\u201d which was their regular indorsement on checks and drafts deposited. The draft was payable on demand.' It was further indorsed by the cashier of the Fourth National Bank \u201cfor collection and returns.\u201d Three days after the date of the draft Laidley &amp; Co. deposited it with the attached bill of lading in their current account with the Fourth National Bank, and the amount of the draft was credited to them on the books of that bank. The deposit-slip contained, among other words, \u201cAll checks credited subject to payment.\u201d The First National Bank of Albany, as the agent of the Fourth National Bank, received for collection the draft with the bill of lading attached, and the draft was paid and the bill of lading taken up with it by Mayer who had, by purchase from Ragan, assumed his rights and liabilities. The Fourth\" National Bank had no knowledge of Mayer, nor of the condition of the meat, at or before the draft and bill of lading came into its possession. On April 18,1891, the meat was received and inspected by Mayer, and found to be damaged to the extent of $250 ; and he immediately sued out the attachment and garnishment. The defendants represented were the two banks; Laidley &amp; Co. did not appear and were not represented.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A8Hb\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The judge, to whom the case was submitted without a jury, rendered judgment for $250 against all the defendants.
