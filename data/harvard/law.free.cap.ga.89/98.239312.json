M., had had two <em>fi. </em>fas..of Kwilecki and Russell against Reynolds, issued from the justices\u2019 courts of the 513th and 635th districts G. M., in his hands long enough to have made the money due, and had not done so, and that the defendants in <em>fi. fa. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>resided in the 1188th district. Rule <em>nisi </em>was granted May 18, 1891. The respondent in his answer denied that he had had the <em>ji.fas. </em>a sufficient time to make the money, and stated that he levied the <em>fi. fa. </em>upon sufficient property to pay the claim, but the property was claimed by Powell Brothers and held up until the first Saturday in May, 1891, when the same was dismissed, and respondent is proceeding to advertise for same [sale] on next sale day, which will be the first Tuesday in June, 1891, at which time he will sell the same unless stopped by legal process. An amendment to the original rule alleged as follows : The constable levied the <em>fi. fas. </em>October 20, 1890, and Powell Brothers filed claims which were returned to the justice\u2019s court of the district for trial, the constable failing to require a forthcoming bond from claimants or any one. At the May term, 1891, of the justice\u2019s court the claims were withdrawn, and the constable advertised the property for sale on the first Saturday in June, 1891, notifying the plaintiffs to be present and bid on the property. On said sale day plaintiffs by their attorney were present, but the property was not forthcoming to be sold, but in lieu of it Valentine accepted a bond in the sum of $100, signed by Maston O\u2019Neal as principal, and another as security, indemnifying him, the constable, against any judgment or decree that might be rendered by this court against the constable in this rule, and instead of selling the property left it in the custody and control of O\u2019Neal, who is not a party in any respect to the <em>ji.fas. </em>or claims and who is now using the property, when it should have been sold and appropriated to the <em>fi. fas. </em>This amendment was allowed. An amended answer admitted the return of the claims to the 1188th district and notification to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney that it had been done, and stated that jhe cases were continued from term to term to effect \u201cthe settlement offered by M. O\u2019Neal until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>claim was withdrawn by Captain Gurley, and it was then for the first time I learned they were returned to the wrong court.\u201d The answer admitted the taking of the indemnifying bond and refusal to sell after advertisement, as stated in the amended rule. Upon the hearing defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike the amendment to the rule, on the ground that it set out a new and distinct cause of action, which motion was overruled, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A65\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<summary id=\"b114-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>It was admitted, pending the trial, that advertisement for the sale of the property was made the first Saturday in June, 1891, and the constable had the <em>ji. fas. </em>in his possession on that day; that the claims of Powell Brothers were on the first Saturday in May, 1891, at the justice court of the 1188th district, withdrawn by Gurley, attorney representing the claimants ; that the magistrate entered on his docket \u201cclaim withdrawn,\u201d and a judgment for costs was entei\u2019ed up by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney; that claimants\u2019 attorney took no order transferring the claim to any other court, insisting that the above named court had no jurisdiction of the claims, for the reason that the <em>fi. fas. </em>emanated from justice courts of different districts; that soon after the levies were made, in October, 1890, O\u2019Neal, attorney for claimants, promised plaintiffs\u2019 attorney repeatedly that he would pay off the <em>fi.fas., </em>as he had knowingly bought the property subject to the liens of plaintiffs\u2019 judgment\u2014thereby disposing of the claims and saving plaintiffs the necessity of attending court to try them, and in pursuance of the promise did pay constable\u2019s cost of levy, etc.; that as O\u2019Neal failed to pay off the <em>fi.fas. </em>as promised, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney put him on notice that he would attend the court on the first Saturday in May, 1891, and press the cases for trial, when Gurley, representing claimants, appeared at the court and withdrew the claims by entering on the claim affidavit and bond \u201cclaim with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>drawn,\u201d whereupon plaintiffs\u2019 attorney entered up judgment for costs.
