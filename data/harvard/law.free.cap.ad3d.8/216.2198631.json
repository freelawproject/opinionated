The judgment of divorce further provided that if the plaintiff did not purchase the defendant\u2019s interest by the specified deadline, the former marital residence would be placed on the market for sale. Since the plaintiff failed to articulate any basis for allowing her to purchase the defendant\u2019s interest in the former marital residence after the deadline, the motion court, upon reargument, correctly adhered to its prior determination granting that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion which was to direct a sale of the former marital residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">However, the motion court, upon reargument, improperly adhered to its prior determination granting that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion which was for an award of an attorney\u2019s fee, as there was no finding that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of the judgment of divorce was willful <em>(see </em>Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 237 [c]; <em>Amaris v Amaris, </em>305 AD2d 618 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.
