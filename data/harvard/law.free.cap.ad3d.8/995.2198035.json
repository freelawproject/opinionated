The determination confirmed the denial of petitioner\u2019s request for Medicaid benefits for petitioner\u2019s mother.</p><p id=\"b1046-4\">It is hereby ordered that the determination be and the same hereby is unanimously confirmed without costs and the amended petition is dismissed.</p><p id=\"b1046-5\">Memorandum: Petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the determination confirming the decision denying her request for Medicaid benefits for her mother following a fair hearing. The determination is based on the failure of petitioner to provide requested documentation concerning three bank accounts and her father\u2019s estate and, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the determination is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see Matter of Rossman v Novella, </em>300 AD2d 483 [2002]; <em>Green Manor Assoc. v Beaudoin, </em>285 AD2d 807, 809 [2001]; <em>Matter of Frohlinger v DeBuono, </em>278 AD2d 323, 324 [2000]). Even accepting as true the assertion of petitioner that she had little knowledge of her parents\u2019 finances, we nevertheless conclude that petitioner is not thereby relieved of her obligation to provide the requested documentation <em>(see Matter of Chase v New York State Dept. of Social Servs., </em>252 AD2d 612, 613-614 [1998], <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 813 [1998]). Finally, although we may properly take judicial notice of the fact that petitioner\u2019s subsequent request for Medicaid benefits was also denied <em>(see generally Matter of Board of Educ. of City School Dist. of City of Buffalo v Munoz, </em>4 AD3d 879, 880 [2004]), we conclude that the present proceeding is not rendered moot by that denial <em>(see </em>18 NYCRR 360-2.4).
