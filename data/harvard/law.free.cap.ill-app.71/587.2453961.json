Gray v. Blanchard, 1 Pick. 292.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\" pgmap=\"590\">To constitute a valid gift inter vivos it requires a full and unqualified and unconditional renunciation of title by the donor and the acquisition by the donee of an absolute and unconditional title accompanied by an actual delivery of the subject-matter of the gift. The donor must surrender all his title and interest without making any conditions by means of which he may resume possession and enjoy his former estate in the property; this as a legal proposition is well settled and if the gift is evidenced by a written instrument by means of which the donor could under any circumstance be entitled to the return of the money or its equivalent, then the gift is ineffectual. Rosenburg v. Rosenburg, 40 Hun, 91; Curry v. Powers, 70 N. Y. 212; Young v. Young, 80 N. Y. 430; Schouler on Per. Prop., Yol. 2, Sec. 81, 88, 131-134; Selleck v.

Patton, 144 Ill. 627.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\" pgmap=\"590\">The rules of law require that the alleged gift be established by clear proof and that no uncertainty exist as to what was intended. The evidence of the gift here is reduced to writing and is contained in the certificates of deposit and they do not make it clear as required under the law that the donor intended to vest the title of the $6,700 in appellee as a gift in prmsenti, whether appellee performed the conditions enjoined or not. The certificates are the only evidence of such fact and they do not make it clear as they should! Barnum v. Reed, 136 Ill. 388.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-3\" pgmap=\"591\">The three certificates of deposit evidencing the delivery of the $6,700 do not recite that the donor made a gift of the money to appellee but they do recite that the donor had deposited the money with appellee. The term deposit in its legal significance can not be construed to mean a gift. The chief meaning of the word is that the money is committed to the custody and care of' another for safe keeping for further action. Anderson\u2019s Dictionary of Law, 343; Schouler on Per.

The above instrument was filed in the County Court for probate against the estate of the testatrix, and from there removed by appeal to the Circuit Court, which gave judgment against appellants for $6,361, and from that judgment appellants prosecute their appeal to this court, and seek to reverse the same on three principal grounds : First, the instrument, as is insisted by them, upon which the claim is based, is testamentary in its character, and therefore void. Second, it is not supported by a sufficient consideration; and lastly, if the instrument is valid, the defense of set-off, interposed on the trial, should have prevailed.</p> <p id=\"b595-4\" pgmap=\"595\">If it shall be determined the instrument above quoted contains the elements of a promissory note, it can not then be justly said to be of a testamentary nature. In Dorsey v. Wolff, 142 Ill. 593, citing numerous authorities, it was said: u Various definitions have been given of a promissory note. In general terms, it may be defined to be a written promise of one person to pay to another person therein named, or order, a fixed sum of money at all events, and at a time specified therein, or at a time which must certainly arrive.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b595-5\" pgmap=\"595\">The instrument here presented is payable on the 1st day of December, 1910, with proviso that in the event of the death of the maker before the maturity of the note, it shall then become due. Both events on the happening of which the note was to become due must certainly arrive. In Shaw et al. v. Camp, 61 Ill. App. 62, the note involved was, in this respect, much like the one before us. The Appellate Court of the Third District held it a valid note. It has several times been decided by the Supreme Court, that a deed delivered, and not to take effect until after the death of the grantor, was a valid deed. (Harshbarger v. Carroll, 163 Ill. 636, and cases cited.) Ho reason can be perceived why the instrument here does not fall strictly within the principles of the decisions to which reference has been made, and it follows, therefore, it is not of a testamentary nature.</p> <p id=\"b595-6\" pgmap=\"595(74) 596(95)\">It is alleged by counsel for appellants, as a second reason against the validity of the note, that it is not supported by a sufficient consideration. From the evidence it can scarcely be doubted, after the note was delivered, and upon the faith of its promise, the ladies\u2019 boarding hall mentioned in the contract was built by appellee, and named, in honor of the donor, the Mary Beatty Hail. In Richelieu Hotel Co. v. International Mil. Encampment Co., 140 Ill. 248, citing Hudson v. Green Hill Seminary, 113 Ill. 618, it was said: \u201c The real consideration upon which the plaintiff is entitled to recover in said case, is, that it has expended money, furnished materials, or bestowed labor, upon the faith of the promise in writing, and not any special benefit derived, or expected to be derived by the promisor from the corporation.\u201d Applying this doctrine to the facts before us, it is clearly to be seen the note is well supported by a sufficient consideration.</p> <p id=\"b596-5\" pgmap=\"596\">It now remains to be determined if appellants\u2019 defense of set-off should have prevailed to a greater extent than it did. It appears from the evidence after the deceased had executed and delivered the note, she was induced by persons representing the appellee, to advance to the appellee certain sums of money, from time to time, which were evidenced by three separate certificates, one for. $3,500, dated Hovember 16, 1888; one for $700, dated April 4, 1889, and one for $2,500, dated August 6, 1889, and delivered to and accepted by the deceased, and with indorsements thereon. Said certificates with indorsements are as follows :</p> <p id=\"b596-6\" pgmap=\"596\">Certificate.</p> <p id=\"b596-7\" pgmap=\"596\">In consideration of the agreement on the part of Western College of Toledo, Iowa, that it will keep up and maintain its college and increase its facilities for a Christian education; and in further consideration of the payment to Mrs. Mary Beatty of one hundred eighty-seven and 50-100 dollars each and every year of her natural life, the first payment to be made one year from the date hereof, the said Mrs. Mary Beatty has deposited with the said Western College . the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, for the benefit of, and to become and be the property of said Western College, and to be used as the board of trustees, or executive committee thereof may direct.</p> <p id=\"b596-8\" pgmap=\"596\">Witness my hand this 6th day of August, 1889.</p> <p id=\"b596-9\" pgmap=\"596\">$187.50.

L. H. Bimmf, Treasurer.</p> <p id=\"b598-6\" pgmap=\"598\">And on the back thereof appears the following, to wit:</p> <blockquote id=\"b598-7\" pgmap=\"598\">\u201cWe hereby guarantee the payment of the annuity to Mrs. Mary Beatty according to the terms of the within certificate. L. H. Bufkin, M. S. Drury, W. M. Beardshear.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b598-8\" pgmap=\"598\">Deceived on the within $262.50, December 5,1889.

Mary Beatty.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b598-10\" pgmap=\"598\">Paid on the within $262.50, by note dated November 16, 1891.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b598-11\" pgmap=\"598\">Counsel for appellants contend the $6,700 represented by these certificates is an unexecuted gift by the deceased to the appellee, the title thereto remaining in the donor at the time of her death, and especially so, for the additional reason that default had been made in the payment of the interest or annuities accruing thereon, and therefore the executors were entitled to set off the principal as well as the unpaid interest, or annuities. We can not perceive any force to this contention. The certificates expressly provide the money represented by them respectively, is for the benefit and to be the property of the appellee, and to be used as the board of trustees or executive committee might direct. The deceased accepted the certificates and thereby bound herself by the terms thereof, and is given By them only a right of action against the appellee for the annuities, in case of nonpayment. The title to the money is effectually vested in the college, and to be used by it, thereby placing it beyond her power to reclaim. The numerous authorities cited by appellants\u2019 counsel have no application to the question as we understand it.</p> <p id=\"b598-12\" pgmap=\"598\">After the allowance of interest to the appellee on the $7,000 note from December 7, 1893, the time it fell due, it - will be found appellants have received credit for all unpaid annuities, including the note and interest that was given for arrears, and therefore the amount of the judgment is not excessive.</p> <p id=\"b599-3\" pgmap=\"599\">Complaint is further made by counsel for appellants of the instructions to the jury by the trial court, and of instructions refused. We have examined the instructions, given and refused, of which complaint is made, and find the action of the court in those respects is in harmony with our own views of the same question. Finding no error in the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court, its judgment will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b599-4\" pgmap=\"599\">Dibell, J., took no part.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
