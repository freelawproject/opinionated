An alias execution was issued thereon October 25, 1895, and placed in the hands of the sheriff of said county, who levied the same upon one piano of the Aurora Piano Co. manufacture, which is the property in controversy in this suit.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\" pgmap=\"406\">On October 30, 1895, appellee made his schedule under the exemption law, and delivered the same to F. II. Holz, deputy sheriff, .who then had the execution. Among other personal property included in the schedule was the following, viz: \u25a0 \u201c.One piano, title in Aurora Piano Go.\u201d Without paying any attention to the schedule, the sheriff on November 2, 1895, placed a custodian in charge of the piano, and the Aurora Piano Co. on the same day replevied and took the same from the possession of the sheriff. On a trial of the replevin suit in the City Court of Aurora, the piano company was defeated, and the piano was returned to the possession of the sheriff. Appellee then claimed the property in the piano, and served a notice upon the sheriff, in pursuance of the statute, to try the right of property. This notice was returned into the County Court, where a jury was waived, and a trial of the right of property had before the court, resulting in a judgment in favor of appellee, from which Barrett appeals to this court.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\" pgmap=\"406\">It appears that appellee had purchased the piano in question from the Aurora Piano Manufacturing Company some time in 1892, the purchase price being $350, upon which he paid $150 in cash, and gave his note for the balance. Long before the date of appellant\u2019s judgment the piano company had been pressing appellee for payment upon this note, and some time in 1895, it was agreed between Harry Sadler, business manager of the piano company, and appellee, that the latter should return the piano to the company and the company should surrender up the note to him. But it turned out afterward that the company was not the owner of the note at the time of this agreement, so that it could not surrender the same to appellee, and nothing further was ever done under the agreement; appellee retained the possession of the piano, and his note still remained outstanding. This was the situation at the time of the levy and the making of the schedule.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\" pgmap=\"406\">Nichols &amp; Sears, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\" pgmap=\"406\">Little &amp; Avery, attorneys for appellee. \u2022</attorneys><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-3\" pgmap=\"407\">It is essential to an estoppel by conduct that there be a fraudulent purpose and a fraudulent result, the element of fraud is indispensible.

Presiding Justice Crabtree</author> <p id=\"A4J\" pgmap=\"407\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b407-12\" pgmap=\"407(93) 408(209)\">The main contention of appellant is, that because appellee noted upon his schedule that the title to the piano was in the Aurora Piano Co. he is now estopped from claiming it as his property. It is not denied that the schedule was in exact compliance with the law, otherwise than this notation of ownership in the piano company. But even though that memorandum was made, appellee distinctly stated that he desired to avail himself of the benefit of the exemption law, and that he claimed all the property listed in the schedule as exempt under the law. He was mistaken as to the title being in the piano company, as was developed in the trial of the replevin suit, bub we think so far as he had any interest, he was entitled to have the benefit of the exemption law. It was the clear duty of the sheriff to summon three householders to \u201c appraise the property * * * \u201d and fix the \u201c fair Valuation on each article contained in the schedule,\u201d as provided by statute, and failing to do this, he had no right to the property under his levy. The doctrine of estoppel has no application so far as.appellee is concerned. There seems to have been no element of fraud. He did not seek by his schedule to deceive any one. Had he made no mention of the rights of the piano company in view of the agreement with it, he would have been doing quite right so long as he and the company mistakenly supposed that such agreement transferred the title of the property to the company. But even had that agreement been carried out, he still had an equity in the piano which was to be recognized in case he became able to redeem.</p> <p id=\"b408-5\" pgmap=\"408\">It would seem that if the doctrine of estoppel applies any- . where in the case, it would be against appellant. He caused the piano to be levied upon as the property of appellee. He resisted the replevin suit on the ground that the piano was appellee\u2019s property, and subject to levy under the execution. Having succeeded in that suit, he now claims that appellee has no right to the benefit of the exemption law under his schedule, because he mistakenly stated the title to be in the piano company. Appellant ought not to be permitted now to take that position. We think the judgment is just, and finding no error in the rulings of the court, it will be affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
