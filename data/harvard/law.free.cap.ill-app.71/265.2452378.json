Service of Process\u2014Upon Persons Attending Legal Proceedings. \u2014A plea alleging that the defendant is a resident of an adjoining county, and not of the county in which the suit is brought, and that he was served with process in the latter county, while there for the purpose of attending the taking of testimony in a certain other cause pending between him and one of the plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of said last-named county, is not a good plea in abatement.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-9\" pgmap=\"263\">2. Abatement\u2014Plea of Former Suit Pending.\u2014A plea alleging that before the commencement of the suit the plaintiffs had impleaded the defendant in the Circuit Court of another county in a suit on the same cause of action in the declaration .mentioned, that the parties in both suits were the same, and that the former suit is still pending and undetermined, is a good plea in abatement.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-10\" pgmap=\"263\">Trespass on the Case, for deceit.

Galveston, etc., R. Co. v. Hook, 40 Ill. App. 547; Delahay v. Clement, 3 Scam. 201; Weld v. Hubbard, 11 Ill. 573; Drake v. Drake, 83 Ill. 526.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-4\" pgmap=\"264\">Even where defendant asks leave, or the above order is not entered, the question on good authority is saved. Branigan v. Rose, 3 Gil. 129; Union, etc., Ass\u2019n v. Bill, 38 Ill. App. 423; Weld v. Hubbard, supra.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\" pgmap=\"264\">The first plea in abatement was that defendant resided in Peoria and not Tazewell county, and that while attending at Pekin, in Tazewell county, as complainant in his own suit, pending in Tazewell county, and against Mary Schwinn and others, and for no other business, he was served with process in the present suit.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-6\" pgmap=\"264\">This is properly presented by plea in abatement. Gregg v. Sumner, 21 Ill. App. 110; Drake v. Drake, 83 Ill. 526.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-7\" pgmap=\"264\">Under the policy of the law, the defendant was exempt from service in Tazewell county under the circumstances alleged. Greer v. Youngs, 17 Ill. App. 106; Gregg v. Sumner, 21 Ill. App. 110; Statutes, Chap. 110, Sec. 2.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\" pgmap=\"264\">\u201c The right of a party to be sued in the county where he resides, and to have his cause tried there, is statutory, and he ought not to be denied that right\u2014a right to him, in many instances, of the utmost importance\u2014by any technical and metaphysical learning in regard to pleas in abatement.\u201d Humphrey v. Phillips, 57 Ill. 132.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-9\" pgmap=\"264\">The plea yras correct in form and conclusion. Drake v. Drake, 83 Ill. 526; Union Nat. Bank v. First Nat. Bank, 90 Ill. 56.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-10\" pgmap=\"264\">If not correct in form, the objection should have been by special demurrer. Buckles v.

A party may pursue different remedies at the same time, but has no right to harass the defendant by more than one suit of the same kind. Branigan v. Rose, 3 Gil. 123; Delahay v. Clement, 3 Seam. 201; Bancroft v. Eastman, 2 Gil. 259.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\" pgmap=\"265\">If either the second plea was good, or the two pleas were good, judgment would be given on the second, that the suit . abate; if the first plea was good, and the second not, the judgment would have been that the plaintiff be without day, until, etc.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-6\" pgmap=\"265\">The first plea, as we have seen, concludes properly. It is not a plea to the jurisdiction of the court. Humphrey v. Phillips, 57 Ill. 132 (136); Kenney v. Greer, 13 Ill. 449.</p><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-8\" pgmap=\"265\">T. 1ST. Green and Jos. A.

Greer v. Young, 120 Ill. 184.</p> <p id=\"b265-14\" pgmap=\"265\">The second plea of prior action pending was good. 1 Ch. PI. 454; 3 Id. 903-4; Branigan v. Bose, 3 Gil. 123.</p> <p id=\"b265-16\" pgmap=\"265\">It was error to sustain the demurrer thereto.</p> <p id=\"b265-17\" pgmap=\"265\">It is unnecessary to consider the other errors assigned. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
