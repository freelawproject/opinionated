Notice\u2014By Facts to Put a Party on Inquiry.\u2014In a suit against a purchaser of personal property by the holder of an unrecorded lien, it is not necessary to show that the purchaser had actual knowledge of the vendor\u2019s intention to defraud. If the circumstances surrounding the transaction are such as to put a prudent and cautious man upon inquiry, and the purchaser closes his eyes against those lights which, if pursued, would disclose the fraudulent purpose of his vendor, he must suSer the consequences as though he had received actual notice.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-8\" pgmap=\"358\">Replevin.\u2014Appeal from the.Circuit Court of Moultrie County; the Hon.

It is sufficient if the channels, which would have led him to the truth,were open before him, and his attention so directed that they would have been seen by a man of ordinary prudence and caution, if he was liable to suffer the consequences of his ignorance. The law will not allow him to shut his eyes when his ignorance is to benefit himself at the expense of another, when he would have been open and inquiring had the consequence of his ignorance been detrimental to himself and advantageous to the other.

Teas et al., 4 Scam. 202.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-11\" pgmap=\"358\">This decision has been followed in subsequent decisions by our courts.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-12\" pgmap=\"358(21) 359(48)\">If the purchaser \u25a0 from a fraudulent vendor buys with notice of the fraudulent intent of his vendor, he stands in his vendor\u2019s shoes, and notice may be inferred from the existence of facts and circumstances that would place a man of ordinary prudence on inquiry with reference to the conduct of his vendor.

Avery v. Joham, 27 Wis. 246.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-6\" pgmap=\"359\">R. M. Peadeo, attorney for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b359-7\" pgmap=\"359\">Me. Presiding Justioe Harker</author> <p id=\"AB-\" pgmap=\"359\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b359-8\" pgmap=\"359\">Appellant, a corporation, brought an action of replevin against appellee to recover eight buggies and two surreys, which it had consigned to Hill and Fread, dealers in farm implements., at Bethany, Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b359-9\" pgmap=\"359\">The sheriff not being able to find the goods described in the writ, there was a trial upon a count in trover, resulting in a verdict and judgment for appellee.</p> <p id=\"b359-10\" pgmap=\"359\">The record shows that the goods were consigned to Hill and Fread in May, 1896, under an agreement to sell the goods of appellant\u2019s manufactory for that year on commission, consisting of the net surplus on sales over and above the invoice-price.</p> <p id=\"b359-11\" pgmap=\"359\">In September Hill sold his interest in the business to Fread Fread assuming the debts of the firm, and within a few days thereafter Fread traded his entire stock of goods, including the goods in controversy, to appellee for 160 acres of Nebraska land.</p> <p id=\"b360-3\" pgmap=\"360\">It is contended by appellant that such trade was made by Fread for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, and that appellee had notice of such fraudulent purpose. Appellee swore that at the time of making the trade he had no information of appellant\u2019s claim upon the goods, and in that he is not contradicted.</p> <p id=\"b360-4\" pgmap=\"360\">But it is insisted that the conduct of Fread was so strange and suspicious as to put him upon inquiry, which, when made, would have given him notice of Fread\u2019s fraudulent purpose. That, of course, ivas a question for the jury. It was the pivotal point in the case and.it was highly important for the jury to be correctly instructed upon it.</p> <p id=\"b360-5\" pgmap=\"360\">In a case of this kind to show that the purchaser had actual knowledge of the vendor\u2019s intention to defraud, is not required. If the circumstances surrounding the transaction Were such as to put a prudent and cautious man upon inquiry, that would be sufficient. If the purchaser closes his eyes against those lights which, if pursued, would disclose the fraudulent purpose of his vendor, he must suffer the consequences as though he had received actual notice. Doyle et al. v. Teas et al., 4 Scam. 202; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Ford, 89 Ill. 252; Bent v. Coleman et al., 89 Ill. 864.</p> <p id=\"b360-6\" pgmap=\"360\">The trial court .not only refused to give to the jury that principal of law when asked by appellant, but gave the following erroneous instruction in behalf of appellee.</p> <p id=\"b360-7\" pgmap=\"360(133) 361(21)\">2. Fraud can never be presumed, but like any other fact, must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and in this case before the jury would have a right to find that the conveyance from Fread to the defendant, Lane, was not a Iona fide transaction, the plaintiff must prove that fraud entered into such transaction, and this must be shown from the evidence, and it must also appear from the evidence, that Lane as well as Fread participated in such fraud to the extent of having knowledge of Fread\u2019s. intent, and unless the plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Fread fraudulently conveyed the property in controversy to Lane for the purpose of hindering and delaying his creditors, and that Lane knew of such fraudulent. intent, and thereby assisted the said Fread in such fraudulent transaction, the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b361-4\" pgmap=\"361\">Appellant\u2019s refused instructions, numbers five and seven, should have been given.</p> <p id=\"b361-5\" pgmap=\"361\">For the error of the court in giving the above quoted instructions for appellee and in refusing the two mentioned for appellant, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
