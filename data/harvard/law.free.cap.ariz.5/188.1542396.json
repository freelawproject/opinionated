J. Edwards, and John McGowan, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">The complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and for the purpose of this demurrer these facts are admitted. A complaint always shows a cause of action when its averments of fact show (1) a primary or legal right belonging to plaintiff, (2) an infringement of such right by defendant, and (3) damage in consequence to plaintiff. Pomeroy on Code Remedies, sec. 549.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">In injuries to character\u2014i. e. malicious prosecution, libel, and slander\u2014the first element, the legal right, is presumed (Cooley on Torts, pp. 31, 225), and hence need not be alleged. Bliss on Code Pleading, sec. 175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The complaint sets up a cause of action for malicious prosecution, the only essentials of which are, (1) the institution of such prosecution by defendant against plaintiff, (2) its termination before bringing the civil action therefor, (3) that the prosecution was without probable cause, (4) that it was malicious, (5) unless the words are objectionable <em>per se, </em>resulting damage to the present plaintiff. This complaint contains all these elements, although an averment of damages was unnecessary, the words being actionable <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">By demurring on the merits for the insufficiency of facts, defendants waived their formal objection of misjoinder set up in special demurrer. Rev. Stats. Ariz. 1887, par. 734.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-9\">This complaint is not double; it sets up only one cause of action; it shows only one primary or legal right of plaintiff, \u2014viz., the right of character (reputation or good name),\u2014 and but one violation of this right,\u2014to wit, said malicious prosecution. Bliss on Code Pleading, secs. 453, 455, 456, 457.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-10\">And even if the complaint did set up a cause of action for malicious prosecution and one for libel, still it would not be demurrable on account of such joinder; since these torts are exactly of the same nature, admitting of the same kind of proof and relief. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Mattison, </em>8 Abb.

But it is always sufficient in pleading the acts of a corporation simply to allege that the <em>corporation </em>entered into the contract, or committed the tort, as the case may be, on the principle that \u201cEvidence should not be pleaded.\u201d Bliss on Code Pleading, secs. 206, 207, 208, 209; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>City, </em>13 Wis. 613; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>11 How.

Sullivan, one of appellants, and the wife of appellant Patrick Sullivan. The amended complaint states: \u201cThat at Solomonville, in said county, on or about the 30th day of January, 1895, defendants made, presented, subscribed, and swore to [said corporation did so by its agents] before W. J. Parks, justice of the peace of said county, a criminal complaint in writing against plaintiff Nellie A. Sullivan, in which complaint defendants falsely, maliciously, and without any reason or cause accused her of having committed a felony.\u201d That a warrant for the arrest of said Nellie A. Sullivan was issued by said justice, upon which she was arrested by the sheriff of said county, and carried before said justice, by whom she was arraigned and examined upon said charges, and was promptly and fully discharged of and from said charge and accusations by said justice. \u201cThat said accusation, complaint, and each and every allegation thereof were and are false, malicious, and without probable cause.\u201d The complaint was demurred to on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>cause of action, and for duplicity and multifariousness in that it attempts to join a cause of action for malicious prosecution and an action for slander, and libel. The demurrer was sustained by the court below, and judgment given for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We think the complaint contains all of the essential elements of a complaint in an action for malicious prosecution, and. does not join any other cause of action therewith, and that the lower court erred in sustaining the demurrer. The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Baker, C.
