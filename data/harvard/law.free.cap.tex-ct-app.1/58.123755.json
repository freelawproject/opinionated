Threats to Commit Offenses.\u2014A correct definition of the offense of threatening to take the life of a human being, or to inflict serious bodily injury, requires that the 1st and 2d sections of the act of October 18, 1871, amendatory of the Penal Code, be considered in connection with each other. Pase. Dig., Arts. 6585, 6586. Indictments based on that act, therefore, must not only charge the making of the threat, but also that it was <em>seriously </em>made.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-7\">2. Same\u2014Indictment.\u2014In this case the indictment charged that the accused \u201c did willfully, unlawfully, intentionally, and feloniously seriously threaten to kill and murder one S., which said threat was then and there seriously made.\u201d He <em>Id, </em>that the indictment sufficiently charges the offense.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-9\">8. Same\u2014Recobnizance.\u2014But in the recognizance for an appeal, framed under the act of April 27, 1871 (Pase. Dig., Art. 6599), the offense is denominated to be \u201c threats to kill and murder.\u201d <em>Held, </em>defective, because of the omission of one of the elements of the offense, to wit, that the threats were seriously made.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">Appeal from Tannin.

The only point we will make in the case is as to the sufficiency of the indictment, which came up directly, in the court below, on the motion for the arrest of judgment, and which was overruled by the court, and an exception taken by the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-13\">This is a statutory offense. We are not aware that it was ever an offense at common law, and certainly never a felony. In fact this indictment is drawn under, and must be supported by, the statute, or fall. We submit that there is such variance in the language of the statute and that of the indictment that it cannot stand. The words of the statute are r \u201c If any person shall threaten <em>to take the life of </em>any human being.\u201d The words laid in the indictment are that Henry Buie did unlawfully, intentionally, feloniously, and seriously threaten to <em>kill </em>and <em>murder </em>one Leon Stevens. This is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>strictly, and not even substantially, following the statute. \"What notice is given the defendant as to the statute under-which he is indicted? There is, in fact, no statute on our books making it felony to threaten to kill and murder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">It is a well-settled rule that it is sufficient to describe a statutory offense in the words of the statute. Whart.. Am. Cr. Law, 132. It is true that the same author says-that, when a word not in the statute is substituted for one that is, and the word substituted is <em>equivalent </em>to the word in the statute, or is of more <em>extensive </em>signification, and includes it, the indictment will be sufficient. But the words \u201ckill and murder\u201d are not equivalent to the words \u201cto take life.\u201d And they are not of more extensive signification ; they are of much more restricted meaning than the statutory words. Taking life, in many cases, is excusable.. The sheriff can take life in carrying out the judgment of a-court, and do it lawfully; and, also, a private individual, in. defense of his person or family, and, if not completely justified, the homicide may be manslaughter, not murder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-9\">We submit that the then existing serious intention should have been averred. 41 Texas, 385. It is the intent that constitutes the crime. It is necessary to prove this in order to convict; and if it is necessary to prove it, then it should, be averred. Simply averring that the threat was \u201c seriously\u201d made is not averring \u201c a then existing serious intention to execute it.\u201d The party may make it seriously, and. have no intention to execute it. The threat may have been a serious, but, nevertheless, an idle one. It is frequently necessary, not only to use the statutory words, but to make independent averments. But we think this then existing serious intention is contemplated by the act itself, for the 6587th Article enacts that it is for the jury to determine as-to the intention of the accused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">It is well established that defects in the description of a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>-statutory offense in an indictment are not aided by verdict, nor will the conclusion <em>contra formam statuti </em>cure it. \"Whart. Am. Cr. Law, 135 ; 2 East, 333; 2 Hale, 170.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-4\">\n<em>II. H. Boone,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATG\">Attorney General, for the State, moved the \u25a0court to dismiss the appeal for want of a sufficient recognizance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-5\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqF\">The indictment in this case was found under the law relative to threats to take the life of, or to inflict serious bodily injury upon, any human being. Pase. Dig., Arts. 6585, 6586. These two Articles are to be taken together in arriving at a correct definition of the offense. \u2022\u201cThe statute in this case presents two distinct facts, which, \u25a0concurring, constitute the offense, one of which is the act of threatening to take life, and the other is the then existing serious intention entertained to execute it.\u201d <em>McFain </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 385. Failing to allege affirmatively these two constituent elements of the crime, an indictment would be fatally defective in not stating an offense known \u00a1to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The indictment in this case, though not following the lan:guage of the statute, charges the offense substantially, and with sufficient certainty, in charging that \u2018 \u2018 one Henry Buie \u25a0did willfully, unlawfully, intentionally, and feloniously seriously threaten to kill and murder one Leon Stevens, which said threat was then and there seriously made,\u201d and is consequently a good indictment. For to threaten \u201cto kill .and murder,\u201d or to threaten \u201cto kill\u201d or \u201cmurder,\u201d is tantamount to threatening, and is, in fact, the same thing \u25a0as threatening, to take life, and when it is added, as in this case, that the threat was \u201c seriously made,\u201d the offense is completely charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The recognizance, however, is fatally defective in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>stating the offense charged in the indictment, either <em>in heseverba </em>or substantially, and, in fact, by failing to state any offense known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">One of the. requisites to a recognizance, entered into-before indictment, is \u201c that it appear by the recognizance that the defendant is accused of an offense against the laws-of this state.\u201d Pase. Dig., Art. 2731.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Article 2733 made the rules respecting recognizances and' bail bonds, as set out in that chapter, applicable to all such-undertakings, when entered into in the course of a criminal action, whether before or after indictment; and our supreme court held that this latter Article controls appeals to the supreme court, taken under provisions of Article 3186. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>28 Texas, 327; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>The State, </em>30 Texas, 191; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>The State, </em>30 Texas, 397 ; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>The State, </em>30 Texas, 446; <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>The State, </em>31 Texas, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">By act of 27th April, 1871, a special form is laid down; for recognizances on appeal after conviction. 2 Pase. Dig., Art. 6599. And in the 2d section of this act it is provided' \u201c that the supreme court shall not entertain jurisdiction of any case requiring a recognizance that does not substantially comply with the above form.\u201d Art. 6600. That form provides for the insertion, in the recognizance, of the offense of\" which the cognizor is charged. See <em>Coney </em>v. <em>The </em>State, decided at this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">Now, in the case we are considering, the recognizance-folio ws the form prescribed in Article 6599, above cited, but states the offense with which the cognizor is charged to-be \u201cthreats to kill and murder.\u201d This, it will be seen, does not set out the offense as charged in the indictment,, either literally or substantially. \u201cThreat to kill and murder \u201d is no offense known to our law. 4</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">For want of a sufficient recognizance the appeal in this-case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
