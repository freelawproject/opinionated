'They nowhere give the county court jurisdiction of a simple \u25a0assault. Tested, then, by the above authorities, jurisdiction is wanting in the court for the plain reason that it is not given in the law which creates the court, and confers upon it all the power it has above that of an individual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-5\">No one can contend that the county court has jurisdiction \u2022of an information or indictment for simple assault. The want of jurisdiction in that case is too obvious to admit of \u25a0question. How can the court, then, indirectly take jurisdiction when it cannot do so directly?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">When the Constitution and laws have denied to the court jurisdiction of simple assaults, how can the county attorney, by falsely charging an aggravated assault, give to the court jurisdiction forbidden by the law of its creation ? If it is necessary to allege an aggravated assault in order to give jurisdiction, it is equally necessary to prove an aggravated assault in order to maintain it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-7\">The former practice of the district court affords no guide upon this question. The district court had jurisdiction of \u25a0all crimes and misdemeanors. When it was held that under an indictment for an aggravated assault a conviction could be had for a simple assault, no question of jurisdiction was raised, but simply a question of pleading and practice. I admit that, if the county court had jurisdiction of a simple \u25a0assault under an information for an aggravated assault, a conviction for a simple assault could be had. That is a question of pleading and practice that has long been settled. But, as the county court is created by written law, and as its powers cannot be enlarged by construction or intendment, no former rule of practice can prevail against \u2022the plain letter of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-8\">It is respectfully submitted that the judgment should be reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>George McQormicTc, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the \u25a0\u25a0State .</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b459-6\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIz\">The appellant was indicted in the district \u25a0court for an aggravated assault and battery. The case was transferred to the county court, and he was tried in this latter court on the 11th day of October, 1876, and found -guilty of a simple assault, and his punishment assessed at a fine of $60.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">There was a motion in arrest of judgment upon the ground that the county court had no jurisdiction to try and determine a case where the fine imposed did not exceed $200 (Const. 1876, Art. 5, sec. 16), and consequently could not render a judgment upon the verdict in this case, the verdict being for an offense and punishment exclusively within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. Const. 1876, Art. 5, sec. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">This question of jurisdiction is the only one insisted upon by defendant\u2019s counsel in his brief, and, therefore, we do not feel called upon, this being a misdemeanor, to notice any of the other errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">By section 22, of Article 5, of the Constitution it is provided that \u201c the legislature shall have power, by local or general law, to increase, diminish, or change the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the county courts,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In the County Court Act, passed the 16th of June, 1876 (Acts of Fifteenth Legislature, 18, sec. 3), the original, exclusive jurisdiction was defined, and in misdemeanors was limited to cases where the highest penalty or fine imposed was more than $200. But this act was subsequently amended, the amendment to section 3 being as follows, viz.: \u201c The county court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all misdemeanors except misdemeanors involving official misconduct, and except such misdemeanors as are punishable \u25a0by fine only, and in the punishment of which the highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>fine to be imposed may not exceed $200; that, in cases where the offense charged is within the jurisdiction of the county court, the court shall hear and determine the case, notwithstanding the proof may show an offense not within, but below, the jurisdiction as herein conferred,\u201d etc. Acts of Fifteenth Legislature, 172. This latter act was approved August 18, 1876, and took effect from its passage. It was the law which governed when this case was tried, on the 11th October, 1876. Consequently the county court had jurisdiction, and, therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
