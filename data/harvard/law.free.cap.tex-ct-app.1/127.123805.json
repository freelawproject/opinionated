Grand Jury.\u2014In abatement of the indictment appellant pleaded that twelve of the grand jurors who found the indictment were unable to speak or understand the English language. On motion of the district attorney the plea was stricken out. <em>Held, </em>that the ruling was not error. Article 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Pase. Dig., Art. 2868) provides that \u201cno objection shall be had by motion, plea, exception, or in any other manner, to an indictment on the ground that the grand jury finding the same was not legally constituted.\u201d</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b139-11\">\u20222.

Oaldwell, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4b\">It is submitted that the-court erred in striking out defendant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">1st. The 8th section of the Bill of Rights provides that no citizen shall be held to answer any criminal charge otherwise than upon indictment. * * * The 21st section of the Bill of Rights further provides that the guaranties, therein contained shall ever \u201cremain inviolate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">It will be observed that the inhibition is upon the state-The state is prohibited from arraigning a defendant unless upon an indictment. The citizen cannot waive his immunity,, because he cannot be called upon to plead until indictment found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">Thus the question is presented: Is it within the constitutional power of the state\u2014the legislature\u2014to abridge,, modify, or impair this immunity so solemnly guaranteed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">It is not, nor will it be, pretended that the plea would not have been held good prior to the adoption of the Code. <em>Vanhook </em>v. <em>The State, </em>12 Texas, 268. It is now, however,, insisted upon that Article 2868, Paschal\u2019s Digest, precludes the defendant from urging any objection to the qualifications of the grand jury <em>after indictment found. </em>Upon this ground alone\u2014upon this Article\u2014the court below held the plea bad..</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\">It has been said that Article 2868 was inserted in the-Code for the express purpose of obviating the ruling in <em>Vanhook </em>v. <em>The State, </em>12 Texas, 268. Whether this be fact- or no, such certainly is the effect. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-11\">It is, therefore, submitted in all confidence that any statute-which attempts to preclude a defendant from pleading a. constitutional privilege and immunity is void. It is his-right to have his guilt pronounced upon by \u201c two lawful\" and. qualified juriesotherwise, he might be held to answer a. pretended indictment by aliens and felons. Indeed, however notorious and susceptible of proof the disqualifications-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>might be, such as non-age, insanity, conviction for felony, and the like, the defendant is inexorably held to plead to that which all the world knows not to be an indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">2d. That a person who can neither speak nor understand the English language (however well qualified in other respects) is not a competent juror is no longer an open question in the court. <em>Lyles </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 172.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\"><em>H.

On motion of the district attorney the plea was-stricken out. The defendant was found guilty of an aggravated assault and battery, and his punishment assessed at a. fine of $500. The motion for a new trial was upon the ground that the court erred in striking out defendant\u2019s plea in abatement. There is no statement of facts and no-assignment of errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">As to the plea in abatement, the statute provides that-\u201cno objection shall be heard by pl\u00e9a, exception, or in any other manner, to the indictment on the ground that the grand jury finding the same was not legally constituted.\u201d' Pasc. Dig., Art. 2868 ; and see the whole subject discussed, and authorities cited, in <em>Poley Reed </em>v. <em>The State, </em>and <em>Dan Green </em>v. <em>The State, </em>decided by this court at the present term, <em>ante </em>pp. 1 and 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Without a statement of facts in a criminal case of the character of which the defendant was found guilty, the appellate court will only consider whether the indictment will sustain the charge and finding of the jury ; nor will the instructions given or refused by the court be revised. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 Texas, 514; <em>Henrie </em>v. <em>The State, </em>41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Texas, 573; <em>Giles Branch v.
