The statements constituting the perjury are disclosed in the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>McAdoo &amp; Russell, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-6\"><em>George McGormick, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARJ3\">Counsel, in their brief, declare that the evidence upon which the prisoner was convicted was sufficient to sustain the conviction, and that they appear in this court simply to-test the sufficiency of the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-7\">This course upon their part is the usual one in cases of - this kind, and, in following it, they but travel the well-beaten track, and one that in cases of perjury has generally reached the desired haven, as is too well exemplified by the num- - ber of cases in our own Reports where prisoners have been convicted of this disgraceful crime, and released by our own courts of last resort on the \u201c insufficiency \u201d of the indict- \u25a0 ments. Indeed, such has been the frequency and certainty of reversals in this class of cases that the profession have - nearly despaired of being able to so frame a bill that it will. .stand the test of judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-8\">In support of the proposition that the indictment in this - case is sufficient, the following cases are referred to : <em>Allen </em>v. <em>The State, </em>42 Texas, 12; <em>Juaraqui </em>v. <em>The State, </em>28 Texas, 625 ; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>28 Texas, 627 ; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Oppenheimer, </em>41 Texas, 82; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Peters, 42 \u2022 </em>Texas, 7 ; and <em>The State </em>v. <em>Umdenstock, </em>43 Texas, 554. I especially invite the attention of the court to the case of <em>Peters, </em>cited (42 Texas, 7). Justice Moore, in rendering-the opinion, seems to have appreciated all the difficulties. heretofore encountered in drawing indictments for perjury - and false swearing, and has given us the essential constituents of the crime. He says :</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-9\">\u201c The essential constituents of the crime of perjury are : \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-10\">\u201c 1st. The making of a false statement, either written or-verbal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b633-11\">\u201c 2d. The statement must be deliberately and willfully ' made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\u201c3d. It must relate to something past or present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-4\">\u201c4th. It must be under the sanction of an oath.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-5\">\u2022 \u201c 5th. The oath must be legally administered, under cir-cumstances in which it is required by law; and if these constituents are charged in plain and intelligible words, it is all that is required.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b634-6\">The indictment under consideration will, I think, stand the test of these requirements.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b634-7\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArPZ\">There were two grounds urged in the lower \u2022court upon the motion in arrest of judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">1st. That the indictment charges no offense against the laws of the state of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">2d. Because said indictment does not charge the defendant with having \u201cdeliberately and willfully sworn falsely \u201d 4o the assignment of perjury alleged in said indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">It is all-important in an indictment for perjury under our law (Pasc. Dig., Art. 1909) that the two statutory words -\u201c <em>deliberately and willfully </em>\u201d shall be used in characterizing \u2022the false statement alleged to have been made. To omit -either would be fatal to the sufficiency and validity of the indictment. <em>Juaraqui </em>v. <em>The State, </em>28 Texas, 625; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>28 Texas, 627; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>41 Texas, 67 ; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>42 Texas, 7 ; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>The State, </em>42 Texas, 12; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>42 Texas, 238. Tested as to these requisites, upon this point, we think the \u2022indictment is good, and that the 2d objection above set out was not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">It is alleged and argued, however, among the other reasons in arrest of judgment, that there is no sufficient \u2022averment of the materiality of the alleged false testimony, -or matter falsely sworn to by the defendant, to the question or matter which was the subject of inquiry at the trial in which the perjury was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">As a general rule, deducible from the leading authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>we think that it may be stated that an indictment for perjury must not only show conclusively, but should charge affirmatively, that the testimony given by the defendant and alleged to be false was material to the issue on the trial of which he was sworn. <em>Weathers </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Blackf. (Ind.) 278 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>25 Ind. 243; <em>People v. Collier, </em>1 Mich. 137; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>40 N. H. 229 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>1 Dutch. (25 N. J.) 384; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>1 Nott &amp; M. (S. C.) 546; <em>Pickering\u2019s Case, </em>8 Gratt. (Va.) 628 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Aikens, </em>32 Iowa, 433 ; <em>Humber </em>v. <em>State, </em>52 Ga. 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>69 N.

The exceptions to the rule will be given below.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Mr. Wharton, in his work on Criminal Law, says: <em>\u201c </em>It must appear upon the face of the indictment that the matter alleged to be false was material, but such materiality need not be expressly averred when it appears on record. It is sufficient to charge generally that the false oath was material, but such materiality need not be expressly averred when it appears on record. It is sufficient to charge generally that the false oath was material on the trial of the issue on which it was taken ; it is not necessary to show how it was material.\u201d 3 Whart. Am. Cr. Law, sec. 2263. See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs, </em>1 Park (N. Y.) 223; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Souter, 2 </em>Starkie, 473 ; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>People, </em>8 Wend. 636 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>47 Mo. 378 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mumford, </em>1 Dev. (N. C.) 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">And where the materiality of the evidence alleged to be false is shown by the nature of the case, no express averment of its materiality is necessary. <em>Hendricks </em>v. <em>The State, </em>26 Ind. 493; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, 1 </em>Blackf. (Ind.) 25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, 7 </em>Blackf. (Ind.) 49; <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>The State, </em>29 Ind. 442 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Biebush, </em>32 Mo. 276 ; <em>Lamden </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Humph. 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Again, it has been laid down as a rule by our own supreme court that \u201c the facts constituting the offense must be averred directly, forcibly, and with certainty, and not by .way of inference and argument.\u201d 1 Texas, 455 ; 1 Dutch. (N. J.) 384; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>28 Texas, 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In <em>Pickering\u2019s Case, </em>above cited (8 Gratt. [Va.] 628), the-court say: \u201cIf the indictment shows on its face only that-the evidence might have been material, it is not sufficient it must show that it was material. For this reason we are-of opinion that the materiality of the evidence given by the-defendant does not sufficiently appear in the indictment.\u201d In <em>Weathers </em>v. <em>The State </em>(2 Blackf. [Ind.] 278) it is said: \u201cAman may knowingly and corruptly swear falsely, and yet not be guilty of perjury. And the indictment, in order to-allege the crime of perjury, must unequivocally aver that-the facts sworn to were material.\u201d Again: \u201cIf the allegation of materiality in the indictment is not sufficiently broad to cover the facts sworn to by the defendant, it is just the same as if the indictment contained no allegation of the-facts sworn to at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Now, in the case we are considering the pleader sets, forth the case as follows : \u201c And it then and there became a material inquiry to know whether the said Simon Bolding; made the assault upon the said Bright Cole, as charged against him ; and the said Bryan Smith, being asked the question where the said Simon Bolding was standing and what he was doing at the time the said Bright Cole was assaulted, and the said Bryan Smith, being so sworn, wickedly contriving to have the said Simon Bolding unjustly acquitted of said charge, did deliberately and willfully depose and swear and give in evidence that, at the time the said Bright. Cole was assaulted, the said Simon Bolding was standing at. a stove, with Wesley Bennett, washing up dishes, and that he, the said Bolding, was not near the said Bright Cole when said Bright Cole was <em>assaulted; </em>whereas, in truth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>in fact, said Simon Bolding was not standing by said stove with Wesley Bennett, washing up dishes, but was standing immediately behind the said Bright Cole, and within arm\u2019s reach of said Bright Cole, and while so standing did assault the said Bright Cole,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">It appears, then, that the material inquiry, as is averred, was whether Bolding made the assault upon Cole. If the question asked was material to that issue\u2014that is, \u201c where Bolding was standing and what he was doing at the time Cole was assaulted\u201d\u2014it appears, from the authorities cited, that it was the duty of the pleader to expressly aver its materiality. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>1 Mich. 138, it is said : \u201c If it be material, it must be averred to be so, or it must clearly appear to be so from the statements alleged to be false. In stating the question which is averred to be material, it is proper to mention the circumstances which must afterwards be connected with the terms of the defendant\u2019s oath, in order to assign perjury upon that meaning. The usual form, when an express allegation of materiality is made, is that it became a material question whether such a thing happened or existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Now, it is not alleged expressly that the question asked\u2014 viz,, where the said Simon Bolding was standing and what he was doing at the time the said Bright Cole was assaulted\u2014was material to what is alleged expressly to be the only material inquiry, viz., whether the said Simon Bolding made the assault upon said Bright Cole, as charged against him. For aught that appears, it made no difference, so far as the principal inquiry was concerned, where Bolding and Cole were standing when the assault was committed, nor does it appear material thereto what Bolding was doing about the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The same objection holds good, we think, as to the answer of the defendant to this question\u2014which is assigned as the false statement\u2014that is, \u201cthat, at the time the said Bright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Cole was assaulted, the said Simon Bolding was standing at a stove with Wesley Bennett, washing up dishes, and that he, the said Bolding, was not near the said Bright Cole when said Bright Cole was assaulted.\u201d The materiality of this statement does not of itself, or when taken in connection with the question asked, appear expressly to he material to the material inquiry set out, because it might be true that Bolding was standing at the stove with Wesley Bennett, washing up dishes, and not near Cole, and yet it might be equally true that he was the party who assaulted Cole. The circumstances of the assault are not stated with such particularity and detail as to show the impossibility that this could be so. How was Cole assaulted? We are not told. If with a pistol, then the offense could have been committed from any point within carrying distance, and the party shooting might have been at the stove with Wesley Bennett, engaged in washing dishes, when he fired the pistol. It will not do to say that we must, in connection with the false statement assigned, take, also, as part thereof, the negative allegations or declarations of its falsity, as set out by the pleader, to supply any defects, or omissions, or intendments necessary to show its materiality. These negative averments or declarations are not parts of the testimony of the defendant. That testimony must of itself, and without extraneous aid, be so clearly material as that it Avould be supererogation to aver its materiality, else its materiality must be expressly averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In the <em>State </em>v. <em>Aikens, </em>33 Iowa, 403, it was said : \u201c The materiality of such matter must be established by the evidence, the same as any other ingredient of the crime, and cannot be left to presumption or inference, to be exercised by the court or jury. But in this case the relation of the facts sworn to by defendant, to the issues and subject-matter of the suit, must be presumed before it can be considered material in that proceeding. As we have seen, this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>admissible.\u201d So, in this case, as we have seen, we are \u2022compelled to infer or presume the materiality of the question and answer to the material inquiry or investigation, in \u2022order to make the indictment sufficient in the matter assigned as perjury. Everything necessary to constitute the crime must be averred, and it must be averred in plain, intelligible, unambiguous language; \u201cotherwise,\u201d as was remarked by the supreme court of Tennessee in <em>Steinston </em>v. <em>The State, </em>6 Yerg. 531, \u201cstate prosecutions may be supported by intendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">There is no statement of facts in this case, and it is admitted, in the brief of counsel for appellant, that the testimony \u201csufficiently establishes the falsity of the statement alleged to have been made.\u201d The only question is the one we have discussed; and, for the reasons stated, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aha\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
