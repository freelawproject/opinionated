West seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. Petitioners asked the court to declare that West, Mayor of the City of Richmond, a member of City Council, and principal of Albert H. Hill Middle School, was prohibited by the Virginia Conflict of Interests Act of 1970, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-347, <em>et seq. </em>(Repl. Vol. 1979), from voting on appointments to the School Board. At that time, four appointments were in prospect, and the trial court entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>temporary injunction to expire July 1, 1983. When the old Act was repealed and replaced, effective July 1, 1983, by the Comprehensive Conflict of Interests Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-599, <em>et seq. </em>(Cum. Supp. 1984), petitioners amended their petition to conform to the terms of the new Act, and the parties submitted the case for decision on the pleadings, stipulation of facts, exhibits, and memoranda of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The dispute centers principally upon construction of \u00a7 2.1-610(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the new Act which provides, in part, that an officer or employee of government, including a member of the governing body of a local government, is required to \u201cdisqualify himself from participating in any transaction on behalf of his agency when (i) he has a personal interest in the transaction and (ii) the transaction has specific application to his personal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">From the stipulation of facts it appears that the Richmond school system, funded by an annual budget of 79 million dollars, has 53 principals, more than 100 assistant principals and supervisors, and nearly 2,000 teachers. The School Board, an independent entity which derives its powers from Va. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>1, 7, and statutory grants, has adopted policies under which it fixes salaries, based upon seniority and graduate degree status, according to a general schedule uniformly applicable to all employees; no salary is negotiated individually. Under this schedule, the annual salary West earns for his services as principal is approximately $39,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Principals and teachers are hired, reassigned, or terminated pursuant to the policies established by the School Board. The Board can \u201cterminate\u201d the employment of a principal \u201cif there is a lack of funds, a lack of jobs or a reduction in force\u201d, and a principal may be \u201cdismissed\u201d for \u201cgross misconduct; commission of a felony or misdemeanor; and violation of School Board policies.\u201d A principal may be transferred to another position upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of Schools, subject to ratification by the School Board, and the Superintendent can \u201cdiscipline\u201d a principal \u201cwith pay\u201d, subject to appeal to the School Board. The parties stipulate that \u201c[t]he School Board has the power to set policies for the school system, can change the policies and, if it saw fit, could give individual raises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">In a letter opinion, the trial court found that \u201cbecause of the nature of the relationship between Mayor West as a middle school principal and the School Board, Mayor West has a personal interest in his salary and professional status that will benefit or suffer from the action of City Council in its consideration of the nomination and appointment of School Board members\u201d; that although \u201cthe selection of School Board members is a transaction which affects the public generally\u201d, the interests of the general public are not affected \u201cin the same way and to the same degree as the personal interests of Mayor West\u201d; and, therefore, that the transaction had \u201cspecific application to his personal interest\u201d within the intendment of that phrase as used in \u00a7 2.1-610(A). By final decree incorporating the letter opinion, the trial court granted the prayer of the petition, and we awarded Mayor West an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">West argues on brief (1) that he \u201cdoes not have a \u2018personal interest\u2019 in the appointment of School Board members\u201d and (2) that he is not disqualified from voting because, under the language of the new Act, \u201chis vote on School Board appointments is not a vote with \u2018specific application\u2019 to him\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In support of his first argument, West points to Code \u00a7 2.1-600, the definitional section of the new Act. A \u201cpersonal interest\u201d is \u201ca personal and financial benefit or liability accruing to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>officer or employee\u201d. A \u201ctransaction\u201d is \u201cany matter considered by any governmental or advisory agency on which official action is taken or contemplated.\u201d A \u201cpersonal interest in a transaction\u201d is \u201ca personal interest of an officer or employee in any matter considered by his agency\u201d. Explicating that definition, the statute provides that \u201cpersonal interest will be deemed to exist where an officer or employee . . . has (a) a personal interest in property . . . that . . . will benefit or suffer from the action of the agency considering the transaction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The parties agree that City Council\u2019s vote on School Board appointments is the transaction in issue. The threshold question, then, is whether West has a personal interest in that transaction which will benefit or suffer from his participation therein. Accenting the word \u201cwill\u201d, West contends that \u201cthe new Act . . . addresses only actual, present conflicts of interests\u201d. If the trial court\u2019s construction is allowed to stand, he continues, the Act \u201cdisqualifies elected officials from voting on matters of widespread public significance whenever a creative litigant can conceive of some distant, hypothetical personal interest which may or may not be affected at some unknown future time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The declared purpose of the new Act is to assure citizens of this Commonwealth \u201cthat the judgment of public officers and employees will not be compromised or affected by inappropriate conflicts\u201d and, in the application of the Act, it must be \u201cliberally construed to accomplish its purpose\u201d. Code \u00a7 2.1-599.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">We believe West\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cwill\u201d defeats the purpose of the Act. Conflicts of interest are proscribed precisely because they <em>may </em>compromise or affect the judgment of public servants at the expense of private citizens. If, at the time the transaction is pending, it is reasonably foreseeable that the public servant\u2019s personal interest could benefit or suffer from his participation in that transaction, the conflict and the danger it poses to the public interest arise at the moment the transaction occurs. Hence, according the Act a liberal construction in aid of its stated purpose, we conclude that the General Assembly intended the word \u201cwill\u201d to carry the same import as the word \u201cmay\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In support of the petitioners\u2019 position that West\u2019s salary as an employee of the School Board is a \u201cpersonal interest in property\u201d, Code \u00a7 2.1-600, they cite <em>Ambrogi </em>v. <em>Koontz, </em>224 Va. 381, 389, 297 S.E.2d 660, 664 (1982), where we said that a principal of a public school and a school supervisor, \u201cas employees of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the School Board . . . have a \u2018material financial interest\u2019 in the appointment of School Board members.\u201d As West points out, the standard for disqualification under former Code \u00a7 2.1-352 reviewed in <em>Ambrogi </em>was a \u201cmaterial financial interest\u201d, and under the policies followed by the School Board in that case, the contracts of employment were negotiated on an individual basis. West concludes, therefore, that since the policies prescribed by the Richmond School Board require that his salary be fixed according to a general personnel schedule rather than by individual negotiation, <em>Ambrogi </em>is inapposite. The parties have stipulated, however, that the \u201cBoard has the power to . . . change the policies and, if it saw fit, could give individual raises.\u201d Moreover, one of the policies a school board is free to adopt is the power, granted by statute, to reassign a principal to a teacher\u2019s position at a <em>reduced </em>salary and to do so without cause and irrespective of the principal\u2019s rights of tenure. Code \u00a7 22.1-294.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Since the transaction in issue involves the appointment of four of the seven members of the School Board, a change in policies is a reasonably foreseeable possibility. Indeed, the same is true, though perhaps to a lesser degree, if only one vacancy existed. We hold, therefore, that West has a personal interest in appointments to the Board which could benefit or suffer from his participation in the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Participation in a transaction is proscribed only when it \u201caffects the personal interest of the officer or employee specifically, as opposed to a transaction which affects the public generally\u201d. Code \u00a7 2.1-610(A). West argues that, since City Council\u2019s vote on appointments to the Board obviously affects the public generally, the only question to be decided is whether that transaction, as distinguished from \u201ca <em>later </em>decision by the School Board might be of \u2018specific application\u2019 to [him]\u201d. Pursuing his interpretation of the word \u201cwill\u201d, West reasons that \u201c[n]othing about his salary, his responsibility or any aspect of his job will change at the time he votes\u201d. It is true, of course, that his personal interest will not change contemporaneously with the vote. But, as we have said, the transaction, when consummated, immediately creates the possibility that his personal interest will benefit or suffer from future actions of the Board, and those actions may be decided by the vote of a single new member. Such a possibility poses the very danger the Act seeks to prevent, <em>viz., </em>that West\u2019s'judgment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>vote he casts may be \u201ccompromised or affected by inappropriate conflicts\u201d. Code \u00a7 2.1-599.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the appointment of members of the School Board is a matter which has specific application to West\u2019s personal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Next, West contends that \u201c[e]ven if it is found that [he] has a personal interest and his vote on appointments is of \u2018specific application,\u2019 the new Act still permits him to vote.\u201d He relies upon the following language in \u00a7 2.1-610(A) of the new Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">If the transaction is one which affects the public generally, although the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s interest may also be involved, it will not be necessary for such officer or employee to disqualify himself from participating in the transaction on behalf of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">West maintains that this new provision prescribes a balancing of public and private interests and that the balance weighs in favor of his right to participate in the transaction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">We agree with West that the public in general and his constituents in particular have an interest in the orderly administration of the school system, and we recognize that his salary as principal constitutes only .05% of a budget of more than 79 million dollars. But the overriding public interest the Act is designed to promote is the right of the citizens \u201cto be assured that the judgment of public officers and employees will not be compromised or affected by inappropriate conflicts.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.1-599. To endorse the interpretation West places upon the new provision would be to ignore the statutory command that \u201cany exception or exemption to . . . applicability [of the Act] shall be narrowly construed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">As we construe the language of the new provision, a public servant whose interest is \u201cinvolved\u201d in a transaction may participate in that transaction only when his interest is one limited to that which he shares in common with other members of the public at large. West is a member of City Council, and as one of a group of employees of the School Board, he has a personal interest in Council\u2019s selection and appointment of members of the School Board apart from and in addition to that of the general public. We believe such an interest raises a conflict within the purview of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Finally, West claims that the exception written into Code \u00a7 2.1-606 exempts him from coverage under the Act. That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">No person elected or appointed as a member of the governing body of a county, city or town shall have a personal interest in . . . any contract <em>other than in a contract of regular employment </em>with any . . . governmental agency if such person\u2019s governing body appoints a majority of members of the governing body of the second governmental agency. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">West seems to construe the italicized language to mean that his contract of employment with the School Board does not constitute a conflict of interest. In our view, Code \u00a7 2.1-606 has two effects. It forbids a member of a local governing body to have a personal interest in certain contracts with a governmental agency if the majority of the officers of that agency are appointed by the local governing body. And, by way of exception, it permits a member of a local governing body to hold a job with such an agency. Nothing in the section authorizes such a person who works for such an agency to participate in the appointment of the officers of that agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The record is utterly devoid of any suggestion that Mayor West would allow his judgment on any issue pending before City Council to be compromised or affected by any consideration of personal interest. Such proof is not required, however, and we hold that the Comprehensive Conflict of Interests Act of 1984 prohibits him from participating in the nomination and appointment of members of the School Board so long as he is employed by the Board, and we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-13\"> Dwight C.

Each officer of all state governmental agencies, including members of the General Assembly, and state advisory agencies and each employee of state governmental agencies and state advisory agencies and each officer of local governmental agencies, including members of the governing bodies of counties, cities and towns, and local advisory agencies, and each employee of local governmental agencies and local advisory agencies shall disqualify himself from participating in any transaction on behalf of his agency when (i) he has a personal interest in the transaction and (ii) the transaction has specific application to his personal interest. He shall not vote or in any manner act on behalf of his agency in such a transaction of specific application and his disqualification shall be noted in the records of the agency. As used in this section, \u201cspecific application\u201d means a transaction which affects the personal interest of the officer or employee specifically, as opposed to a transaction which affects the public generally, although in the latter situation the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s interest, as a member of the public, may also be affected by that general transaction. For example, an amendment to a zoning map affecting fewer than ten parcels of land is a transaction having specific application to a person who has a personal interest in one of the parcels and is not a general transaction. If the transaction is one which affects the public generally, although the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s interest may also be involved, it will not be necessary for such officer or employee to disqualify himself from participating in the transaction on behalf of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Disqualification under the provisions of this section shall not prevent any employee having a personal interest in a transaction in which his agency is involved from representing himself, his spouse or any relative in such transaction provided he does not receive compensation for such representation and provided he complies with the disqualification and disclosure requirements of this chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
