Previously, upon similar review, we affirmed an earlier death sentence imposed on the defendant for the same crime. Subsequent to the affirmance, the defendant instituted a state habeas corpus proceeding. As the result of information developed in the habeas case, the Commonwealth confessed error and the first death sentence was set aside. Following a resentencing proceeding, the present death sentence was imposed. The principal issue in this appeal is whether defendant\u2019s sentence should be vacated because of the alleged violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The chronology sets the stage. On January 27, 1981, Wilbert Lee Evans, a prisoner, fatally shot a deputy sheriff who was escorting him to jail in Alexandria. About four months later, a jury convicted defendant of capital murder in the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of a law-enforcement officer for the purpose of interfering with the performance of the officer\u2019s official duties. Code \u00a7 18.2-31(f). In the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial, the same jury recommended the death penalty, based solely upon a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness.\u201d The Commonwealth relied mainly on records of seven purported out-of-state convictions of defendant. The jury determined that after consideration of Evans\u2019 prior history, there was a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). On June 1, 1981, the trial court sentenced defendant to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">On October 16, 1981, in the case of <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 653, 283 S.E.2d 212 (1981), we commuted a defendant\u2019s death sentence to imprisonment for life. There, we held that the lower court had failed, in the penalty phase of that bifurcated trial, to preserve fully the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury. There was no error in the guilt phase of the trial but the sentence to death was invalidated. We further decided that the statutory framework existing at the time inhibited a remand of the case for a new trial limited to the penalty issue only. This was because Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) provided at the time that if a defendant was found guilty by a jury of a capital offense, the <em>same </em>jury must fix the punishment. We said: \u201cManifestly, the same jury that convicted Patterson should not now be reconvened upon a remand.\u201d 222 Va. at 660, 283 S.E.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>On December 4, 1981, we affirmed Evans\u2019 conviction and sentence to death. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 766, 284 S.E.2d 816 (1981). About four months later, the Supreme court of the United States denied defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. 455 U.S. 1038 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Within a month, in April of 1982, defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the trial court. In May and December of 1982, defendant filed amendments to the habeas corpus petition to reflect new claims. In the May amendment, the defendant alleged that at least two of the seven purported North Carolina convictions relied on by the prosecutor during the penalty phase of defendant\u2019s trial actually were not convictions at all. The defendant alleged that one charge, assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon, had been dismissed after an appeal. He asserted that another charge, engaging in an affray with a knife, also had been appealed. In a trial <em>de novo </em>on that charge, defendant was again convicted, but the record used in his capital murder trial listed both convictions for use of the knife and no attempt was made to explain this duplication to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Effective March 28, 1983, emergency legislation adopted by the General Assembly was approved amending the relevant death penalty statutes because of the <em>Patterson </em>decision. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3 was amended to provide that \u201c[i]f the sentence of death is subsequently set aside or found invalid, and the defendant or the Commonwealth requests a jury for purposes of resentencing, the court shall impanel a different jury on the issue of penalty.\u201d Acts 1983, ch. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">About two weeks later, an Assistant Attorney General of Virginia wrote a letter to the trial judge confessing error in the defendant\u2019s sentencing proceeding and acknowledging that Evans\u2019 death sentence should be vacated. The April 12, 1983 letter indicated that \u201cunbeknownst to the prosecution or defense counsel at the trial\u201d many of the records of convictions were \u201cseriously misleading\u201d or \u201cotherwise defective.\u201d It had been discovered that not only were three purported convictions actually one but several of the other convictions were obtained when Evans apparently had appeared without counsel. On May 2, 1983, the trial court entered an order setting aside defendant\u2019s death sentence and granting a hearing to determine whether defendant should be resentenced or his sentence reduced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>On September 21, 1983, an evidentiary hearing was held and, by order entered October 12, 1983, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to bar the Commonwealth from again seeking the death penalty. On January 30, 1984, the trial court impanelled a new jury for a resentencing hearing, in accordance with amended Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3. At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury fixed punishment at death. On March 7, 1984, the trial court entered the order appealed from imposing the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We shall address the issues in the order presented by the defendant. They involve the <em>ex post facto </em>violation, two claims of prosecutorial misconduct, double jeopardy, misdirection of the sentencing jury, and denial of equal protection. The relief sought by the defendant is either a reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision which allowed resentencing and replacement of the sentence of death with a sentence of life imprisonment, or, commutation of his sentence to life imprisonment, or, remand of the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Defendant contends that application of the revised sentencing law to him violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. According to Evans, the <em>Patterson </em>decision made clear, until Virginia\u2019s death penalty statutes were amended by emergency legislation on March 28, 1983, that this Court had but two options in reviewing a sentence of death. The Court could affirm the sentence to death or commute the sentence to life imprisonment. A remand for resentencing in the case where the original jury was \u201ctainted\u201d was not possible, the defendant argues. Accordingly, Evans says, under the law as it existed at the time he committed his offense, at the time he was tried, at the time his first conviction was affirmed, and at all times before approval of the emergency legislation, he was entitled to a sentence of life imprisonment upon the setting aside of his death sentence. He argues that as the result of Patterson: \u201cAutomatic commutation in such situations thus became a part of Virginia\u2019s law just as surely as if it had been drafted by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Evans contends that had the errors which led to the Commonwealth\u2019s confession of error been brought to our attention at the time of his first appeal, we would have done precisely in <em>Evans </em>what we had done seven weeks previously in <em>Patterson, </em>and Evans would have received a life sentence. He contends the considerations which led the Court to commute Patterson\u2019s sentence, that is, the impropriety of recalling Patterson\u2019s improperly selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>jury, applied with full force to Evans\u2019 case. His jury had been irreparably \u201ctainted\u201d by exposure to at least five invalid convictions, he says. Defendant concludes that it was error of constitutional dimension to try him under a revised sentencing scheme which was not in effect until more than a year after his conviction was final, \u201cand which replaced his statutory right to a life sentence with the renewed prospect of death.\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s contentions and conclude that there has been no <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Whether a defendant has a \u201cright,\u201d or is \u201centitled,\u201d to a life sentence if his death sentence is set aside is irrelevant in an <em>ex post facto </em>analysis. \u201cCritical to relief under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.\u201d <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 30 (1981). Pertinent to the <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry is whether the defendant had \u201cfair warning as Jo the degree of culpability which the State ascribed to the act of murder.\u201d <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 297 (1977); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 475, 248 S.E.2d 135, 147 (1978), <em>cert, denied, </em>441 U.S. 967 (1979). Manifestly, Evans had \u201cfair notice\u201d and \u201cfair warning\u201d at the time of his 1981 offense that the capital murder of a law-enforcement officer was a crime for which the death penalty could be imposed. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31(f) and 18.2-10(a). Virginia\u2019s view of the severity of capital murder and of the degree of punishment which the General Assembly wished to impose upon capital murderers had been clearly announced before Evans\u2019 criminal conduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Defendant argues in rebuttal, however, a full \u201cfair warning\u201d inquiry must take into account that Evans was also deemed to understand that if he were to receive a death sentence and if his death sentence were to be set aside, his punishment would be life imprisonment. Defendant notes the following statement in <em>Weaver. </em>\u201cThus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions ... it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.\u201d 450 U.S. 30-31 (footnote omitted). He contends it was improper to impose a more onerous sentencing procedure upon him than was in place at the time of his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">There are at least two answers to this contention. First, according to <em>Dobbert, </em>the <em>ex post facto </em>inquiry focuses on \u201cthe quantum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of punishment attached to the crime,\u201d 432 U.S. at 294, of which the defendant had notice at the time of the offense, and not on adjustments in the method of administering that punishment that are collateral to the penalty itself. Second, the statutory amendment was not \u201cmore onerous\u201d than the prior law; it was \u201cameliorative\u201d and hence not <em>ex post facto. </em>432 U.S. at 294; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. at 475, 248 S.E.2d at 147. As the Attorney General points out, \u201c[t]he change insures that an accused, who has been fairly tried and convicted of capital murder, also receives a fair and impartial trial on the issue of punishment.\u201d Where, as here, there has been a judicial determination that a sentence to death is invalid because of error during the penalty stage, the new law provides for impanelling a new jury, free of any taint arising from errors during the first trial, to redetermine the defendant\u2019s punishment. A defendant convicted of capital murder is entitled to a fair and impartial determination of his punishment; he will not be heard to complain that a change in the law which protects that right is not wholly beneficial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>Kring </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>107 U.S. 221 (1882), heavily relied on by defendant, is not controlling. There, at the time of the offense, an accused convicted in Missouri of second-degree murder was thereby acquitted of first-degree murder. Prior to Kring\u2019s trial, the Missouri Constitution was amended to provide that an accused could be retried for first-degree murder, notwithstanding his earlier conviction and sentence for murder in the second degree. Kring pled guilty to second-degree murder. On appeal, the conviction was reversed because of a breached plea agreement. Upon retrial, Kring was convicted of first-degree murder. The second conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court because the change in law operated <em>ex post facto. </em>The Court held that the new constitutional provisions eliminated what was, by the law of the state when the crime was committed, an absolute defense to the charge of first-degree murder. 107 U.S. at 229. Unlike the present case, the new law in <em>Kring </em>abrogated a substantial right which existed at the time of the offense. In contrast, Evans has been deprived of no substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Next, defendant contends the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney knowlingly used false evidence to obtain the original sentence to death and that such conduct so violated fundamental fairness and due process as to bar a subsequent sentencing proceeding. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>claim focuses on the flawed record of defendant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The trial judge conducted a full investigation into this charge at the hearing on September 21, 1983. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found from the evidence \u201cthat the defendant has failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the prosecution engaged in such misconduct or tactics as to warrant the Court in concluding that the Commonwealth is precluded from again seeking the death penalty in this case.\u201d Although our review of the record convinces us that credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding of fact, we will agree with defendant and assume, without deciding, that the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s handling of this particular phase of the original trial involved serious prosecutorial misconduct. Nevertheless, the defendant is not entitled to the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361 (1981), the Supreme Court unanimously held that governmental action which involved \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cegregious\u201d conduct did not warrant dismissal of an indictment, absent a showing of \u201cdemonstrable prejudice, or substantial threat thereof . . . .\u201d 449 U.S. at 365, 367. The Court indicated that a \u201cdrastic remedy\u201d would be imposed only where the conduct could not be corrected by \u201ctraditional remedies.\u201d 449 U.S. at 365-66, n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In the present case, the defendant has received, by a different jury, a new, full sentencing trial, free of flawed conviction records. This traditional remedy has been wholly adequate to remove any prejudice to the defendant caused by any prosecutorial misconduct during the penalty phase of his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In arriving at this conclusion, we do not condone the indifferent, careless manner in which introduction of the documentary records of defendant\u2019s prior convictions was handled by the prosecutor. During the hearing, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney admitted he knew, at the time the conviction records were proffered during the trial, that three of the purported convictions actually were only one. He testified, however, that he advised defense counsel of the discrepancy during the trial, and that he assumed the error would be explained to the jury by defense counsel during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The records in dispute covered convictions in Wake County, North Carolina, during the period 1964-1972, as noted in our opinion in <em>Evans, </em>222 Va. at 774-75, 284 S.E.2d at 820. Appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>ently, most of the pre-1972 conviction records in that county had been destroyed. And, admittedly, the package of North Carolina documents available at trial was a \u201cmost incredible mess,\u201d according to the hearing testimony of defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Also, the evidence shows that the prosecutor had furnished defense counsel with some conviction information prior to trial and that defense counsel had travelled to North Carolina prior to trial to examine records of defendant\u2019s convictions. And, we recognize there was the factual dispute concerning whether the prosecutor notified defense counsel, during the trial, about the inaccurate records. Nevertheless, the flawed documents were proffered by the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, who had the duty to assure, as far as reasonably possible, that the records were accurate. If their correctness was in doubt, or if the prosecutor knew they were inaccurate in any particular, the documents should not have been offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Next, the defendant asserts that the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cpurposeful delay\u201d in conceding error in the defendant\u2019s original sentencing proceeding until the new statutory scheme was enacted, violated defendant\u2019s due process right. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The trial court stated at the conclusion of the September 1983 hearing: \u201cI think the record is absent any showing that there was any maneuvering by the Attorney General or otherwise to put this case in position where, by some design, it would be cured by pending legislation.\u201d In the order entered after the hearing, the trial court stated that \u201cthe evidence fails to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the Commonwealth purposefully and wrongfully delayed resolution of the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus in order to achieve a tactical advantage as alleged by the defendant . . . .\u201d The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no \u201cpurposeful delay\u201d connected with the timing of the confession of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Assistant Attorney General charged with handling defendant\u2019s first appeal and the habeas corpus proceeding testified in detail at the September 1983 hearing. In essence, he testified no effort was made within the office of the Attorney General to delay a confession of error in Evans\u2019 case until the amendatory legislation was approved. That evidence is credible, uncontradicted, and persuasive. The trial court examined <em>in camera </em>original files of the Governor\u2019s office and the Attorney General\u2019s office relating to drafting, introduction, consideration, and approval of the corree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tive legislation. No evidence to support defendant\u2019s claim was found by the trial court as the result of that examination. We have conducted a similar examination of those records and have confirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Accordingly, there is no merit to defendant\u2019s claim of wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Next, defendant contends that resentencing violated the prohibition against double jeopardy, under the facts of this case. Relying on <em>Bullington </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430 (1981), defendant argues that principles of double jeopardy bar resentencing him to death, after his original death sentence was set aside by the habeas corpus court. <em>Bullington </em>is inapposite. There, a defendant was convicted of capital murder, but the jury sentenced him to life imprisonment rather than death, under Missouri\u2019s bifurcated trial procedure. Defendant obtained reversal of the conviction and a new trial. The Supreme Court barred a second attempt to impose the death penalty and ruled: \u201cBecause the sentencing proceeding at petitioner\u2019s first trial was like the trial on the question of guilt or innocence, the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause to one acquitted by a jury also is available to him, with respect to the death penalty at his retrial.\u201d 451 U.S. at 446. But the obvious difference between that case and this is, in the present case, defendant has not been acquitted by a jury with respect to the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In addition, the sentence to death in this case was set aside upon the ground of trial error and not evidentiary insufficiency. The defendant\u2019s sentence was annulled merely because the judicial process was defective, that is, evidence was received that should not have been offered. Accordingly, double jeopardy principles have not been offended. Under these circumstances, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his punishment free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished and properly sentenced. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Next, the defendant contends the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury in the resentencing proceeding, that a sentence to life imprisonment required a unanimous vote of the jury, was contrary to the Virginia statutes and violated defendant\u2019s due process rights. Defendant dwells on the wording of the verdict forms contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D). There, the death-penalty form requires the jury to \u201cunanimously fix [defendant\u2019s] punishment at death,\u201d subsection (D)(1), while the life-imprisonment form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>merely concludes that the jury may \u201cfix his punishment at imprisonment for life,\u201d subsection (D)(2). Defendant argues omission of the word \u201cunanimously\u201d from the life-sentence form demonstrates a legislative intent that a verdict of life imprisonment need not be unanimous. Accordingly, the defendant urges, the trial court erred in responding to a question from the jury and in specifying a requirement of unanimity for a life sentence. There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Under established Virginia law, the verdict in all criminal prosecutions must be unanimous. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:17(a). And we perceive no legislative intention to change that rule by virtue of the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(D). Any possible ambiguity created by the omission of the word \u201cunanimously\u201d from subsection (D)(2) of \u00a7 19.2-264.4 is resolved by subsection (E) of the statute, which specifies: \u201cIn the event the jury cannot agree as to the penalty, the court shall dismiss the jury, and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.\u201d Implicit in subsection (E), given our established law on unanimous criminal verdicts, is the conclusion that the jury must unanimously agree on both \u201cthe penalty\u201d of death and \u201cthe penalty\u201d of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, defendant asserts that sentencing him to death, when \u201call others\u201d similarly situated with respect to the amended death penalty statutes received life sentences, deprived him of due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and was fundamentally unfair. He contends that had the \u201cgrave errors which eventually caused the Commonwealth to concede the invalidity of Evans\u2019 death sentence been brought to this Court\u2019s attention at the time of his original appeal, his sentence of death would have been set aside.\u201d He says \u201cthere was simply no reason\u201d to treat Evans differently from Patterson, whose case was decided only weeks prior to Evans\u2019 appeal. He contends that if he is now to receive the death penalty, while Patterson, \u201cand perhaps others,\u201d did not, he will be denied the equal protection of the laws to which he is entitled. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">As the defendant points out, equal protection requires that similarly situated individuals be treated alike and that, because a non-suspect classification is involved here, the classification \u201crationally advances a reasonable and identifiable governmental objective.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 235 (1981). We hold that Evans is not similarly situated with the defendant in <em>Patterson </em>with respect to the amendment to the death penalty statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Virginia\u2019s current capital murder statutory framework became effective July 1, 1977. The amendment in question was approved and became effective March 28, 1983. Admittedly, both Evans and Patterson committed their crimes and were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death prior to the effective date of the amendment. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference between Patterson\u2019s case and Evans\u2019 case. Patterson\u2019s sentence to death was commuted to life imprisonment before the effective date of the statutory amendment; Evans\u2019 penalty was not set aside, and his resentencing trial did not commence, until after the effective date of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">As the Attorney General contends, Evans, in effect, asks us to decide that any defendant who originally was convicted and sentenced to death before the effective date of the amendment, must have the death sentence commuted to a life sentence <em>at any time </em>the death sentence is set aside. This would be the rule whether the death sentence was voided one day or twenty years after the effective date of the amendment. A state properly may draw the line at some point between those persons whose cases had progressed sufficiently far in the legal process to be governed by the old law and those individuals whose cases could properly subject them to the amended law. <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. at 301. Because the subject statutory change affects only the procedure to be followed if a death sentence is set aside, we deem it more rational to classify individuals potentially affected by the change according to the time when the individual\u2019s death sentence was set aside, and the resentencing proceeding commenced, rather than at the time when the person was originally tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In conclusion, Code \u00a7 17-110.1 requires this Court, in addition to any errors enumerated by appeal, to consider and determine whether the death sentence \u201cwas imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d and whether the sentence \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Upon the issue of arbitrariness, the jury based its finding on the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d factor, which was supported fully by the evidence. Defendant\u2019s prior history revealed criminal convictions in the District of Columbia and North Carolina. In 1964, he threatened a police officer with a knife. In 1974, he threatened prison officials with a knife while demanding transfer to another prison facility. In 1978, he killed a person during an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>argument. In 1981, he assaulted and threatened credit union employees during an armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The evidence regarding the present offense showed that Evans pretended to be a willing witness for the Commonwealth but that his sole purpose in cooperating was to engineer an escape after being brought to Virginia in custody from North Carolina. He planned to kill anyone who attempted to prevent his escape and he was acting on this intent when he killed the victim.
