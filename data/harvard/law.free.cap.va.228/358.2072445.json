(Wall), trading as the \u201cBook Boutique,\u201d was charged with violating Section 27-3(a)(4) of the Newport News City Code which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly: . . . [h]ave in such person\u2019s possession, with intent to sell, rent, lend, transport or distribute any obscene item.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">On September 13, 1982, a grand jury returned a true bill on 25 indictments against Wall. Each indictment charged that Wall \u201cunlawfully had in its possession with intent to sell, lend, transport or distribute, an obscene magazine,\u201d the name of which was stated in the indictment, in violation of Section 27-3 (a) (4) of the Newport News City Code. At trial, Wall moved to dismiss the indictments for failure to allege knowledge or scienter, an essential element of the crimes charged. The court overruled Wall\u2019s motion and the trial proceeded on the indictments. The jury was instructed that to find Wall guilty it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Wall knew or should have known the contents of each magazine were obscene. The jury found Wall guilty and fixed its punishment at a fine of $400 for each offense; the trial court entered a judgment on the verdicts. On appeal, Wall contends that the court erred in overruling its motion to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">It has long been established that no statute regulating the distribution of obscene materials can withstand constitutional scrutiny absent a scienter requirement. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 152-54 (1959). This requirement is not satisfied unless the accused acted with knowledge of the content and character of the materials distributed. <em>Hamlingv. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 123 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Both the Virginia statute and the Newport News ordinance comply with the constitutional mandate. Code \u00a7 18.2-374(4) makes it unlawful for any person \u201cknowingly\u201d to \u201c[h]ave in his possession with intent to sell. . . any obscene item.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-389 authorizes local governing bodies to adopt ordinances \u201cparalleling\u201d the state obscenity statutes. Section 27-3(a)(4) of the Newport News City Code, which tracks the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-374(4), specifically applies only to persons who knowingly violate its terms. Thus, the ordinance expressly includes a scienter element in a Section 27-3(a)(4) violation. <em>See Price </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 113, 189 S.E.2d 324 (1972) (knowledge is an essential element of the crime defined by former Code \u00a7 18.1-230, now \u00a7 18.2-375), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>413 U.S. 912, <em>reh\u2019g de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>nied, </em>414 U.S. 881 (1973), <em>ajfjTd on rehearing, </em>214 Va. 490, 201 S.E.2d 798 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">We have held in the past that all essential elements of an offense must be precisely stated in the indictment; inference may not supply an essential element that is lacking. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 775, 33 S.E.2d 636 (1945); <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Debrow, </em>346 U.S. 374, 376 (1953). In <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561 (1946), we held that in charging a statutory offense it is unnecessary to charge guilty knowledge unless scienter is part of the statutory definition of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 840, 36 S.E.2d at 566. We also held that the statement charging a statutory offense need not follow the identical words of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 839, 36 S.E.2d at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The contents of an indictment are now prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-220 which requires that an indictment be a \u201cplain, concise and definite written statement . . . describing the offense charged.\u201d This statute further provides that the indictment may describe the offense by using its common-law name or by stating so much of the common-law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to \u201cadvise what offense is charged.\u201d Rule 3A:7(a) (renumbered and amended as Rule 3A:6(a), effective July 1, 1984) requires the indictment to cite \u201cthe statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for the offense.\u201d Significantly, the rule further provides that error in the citation of the statute or ordinance or omission of the citation shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment unless the court finds that the accused was thereby prejudiced in preparing his defense. The inference to be drawn from this provision is clear \u2014 incorporation by reference of a statute or ordinance is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Relying upon <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411 (1976), Wall contends that the 25 indictments charged no offense and were void. In <em>Wilder, </em>the indictment charged the defendant with \u201cpossession\u201d of stolen credit cards and cited three statutes defining credit card theft. We held that the indictment failed to state an offense, was invalid, and, being void, could not be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Wilder, </em>however, is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Wilder, </em>it was apparent that the Commonwealth intended to charge the defendant under a specific subsection of one of the statutes cited in the indictment. Examining that subsection, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ascertained that \u201cpossession\u201d of stolen credit cards was not an offense within the meaning of the statutory language. \u201cPossession,\u201d which was a word not found in the statute, was not synonymous with \u201ctaking,\u201d \u201cobtaining,\u201d \u201cwithholding,\u201d or \u201creceiving,\u201d as those words were used in the subsection. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 225 S.E.2d at 413. We also held that the references to the statutes failed to save the invalid indictment, as such references \u201csupport, but do not replace\u201d the definite written statement required by Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and Rule 3A:7(a) in the body of the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 225 S.E.2d at 413. Examination of the statutes cited in the <em>Wilder </em>indictment revealed that the statutes proscribed criminal conduct different in kind from that charged in the indictment. Examination of the ordinance cited in the 25 indictments now before us reveals that the ordinance proscribes criminal conduct of the kind charged in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In the present case, the indictments charged Wall with possession with intent to sell obscene magazines in violation of the local ordinance. Following the procedure used in <em>Wilder, </em>we examine the ordinance and find that \u201cknowingly\u201d possessing with intent to sell an obscene item is the specified offense. There can be no misunderstanding as to what the indictments charged. Supported by the reference to the ordinance, the indictments satisfied the requirement of a definite written statement. The words of the indictments \u201chad in its possession ... In violation of\u2019 the ordinance necessarily meant \u201cknowingly [had] in [its] possession . . . ,\u201d as the ordinance provided. Rule 3A:7(a) required that the indictments cite the ordinance that defines the offense. The citation required by Rule 3A:7(a) is not mere surplusage but is inextricably included as a definitive part of the indictments. One of the express purposes of Part Three A of the Rules is to promote \u201cuniformity and simplicity in procedure\u201d in criminal cases. Rule 3A:2. Rule 3A:7(a) is consistent with that purpose. The indictments in the present case complied with the rule. The written statements gave information as to what offense was being charged and incorporated by reference the complete definition contained in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 185, 217 S.E.2d 815 (1975), the defendant was tried under an indictment charging him with felonious killing in violation of Code \u00a7 53-291 and subsection 53-291(1) (now \u00a7 18.2-31(c)). Defendant was a prison inmate; his victim was a guard. Appealing his conviction, defendant argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>that the indictment was void because it failed to allege that he was an inmate, that the victim was a guard, and that the killing was malicious or intentional. Although we held that defendant had waived his right to challenge the indictment, we nevertheless held that the indictment was valid under Rule 3A:7(a). We held that defendant \u201cknew, from the invocation of the statute and its subsection, that the essential elements of the case against him were his status as a prison inmate and [the victim\u2019s] status as a prison employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 217 S.E.2d at 822. Thus, in that case, incorporation by reference of the essential elements of the crime was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a definite written statement describing the offense. <em>See Howard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 904, 906, 275 S.E.2d 602, 603 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Wall knew from the invocation of the Newport News ordinance that one of the essential elements of the case against it was knowledge. Although it would have been better practice, of course, to have used the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in the body of the indictments, we conclude that the failure to do so did not invalidate the indictments. Wall was sufficiently informed of the offense with which it was charged so that it could fairly prepare its defense. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
