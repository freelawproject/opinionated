We will also consider other issues raised by the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The evidence is without substantial conflict. Jeff Chalkley and Audi Chaplin were hosts at a \u201cdrug party\u201d held in their home during the early morning hours of August 16, 1981. Forrest Perry Heacock supplied a quantity of what was described as \u201c[vjery high quality cocaine\u201d. Heacock took the cocaine from a \u201cbaggie,\u201d laid it in separate lines on a table, and invited those present to help themselves. For a time, the group sat around the room listening to music, \u201csnorting\u201d cocaine, and drinking beer. Chaplin and Sharon Dryden left the party to buy more beer and, on their way to the store, stopped at the home of Karla Wilson in search of marijuana. Wilson said that she had some \u201creefers,\u201d and they invited her to join the party on her way to work to \u201csmoke some\u201d and to \u201cdo some\u201d cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">After Chaplin and Dryden left Wilson\u2019s home, they paid a visit to Steve Fuller \u201clooking for some needles\u201d in order to \u201crun cocaine.\u201d Fuller produced the needles and rode with them back to the party. Wilson arrived a short time later with her marijuana. The \u201cpot\u201d was placed in a \u201cbong,\u201d and the group began \u201chitting bong\u201d and \u201crunning\u201d cocaine with Fuller\u2019s needles.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">Sometime later Heacock, Dryden, Chaplin, and Wilson went upstairs together. According to Dryden, she and Wilson \u201cwere sitting on the end of the bed\u201d while Heacock and Chaplin \u201cwere putting [cocaine] in the spoon so that we could run some.\u201d Heacock watched as Wilson held Dryden\u2019s arm and Chaplin injected the mixture into a vein in Dryden\u2019s hand. Dryden suffered a sud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>den paralyzing seizure and fell back on the bed. When she revived, she went downstairs and \u201cwas sitting there for a while\u201d when she heard \u201csomething thumping\u201d upstairs. Fuller, who had remained downstairs, heard the same noise which he described as \u201clike somebody kicking.\u201d Fuller testified that \u201cmaybe five minutes after that, [Heacock] came flying down the stairs and asked if I knew about what to do if somebody had gotten an overdose\u201d. Fuller and Dryden went upstairs where they found Wilson lying face-down under a blanket on the floor. Although Wilson \u201conly had fifty cc\u2019s\u201d, she was experiencing periodic convulsions with \u201cher head . . . hitting the floor.\u201d She \u201cwasn\u2019t breathing too well\u201d, and when she failed to respond to \u201cmouth to mouth recitation [sic]\u201d, Chaplin went to the telephone and called the rescue squad. Wilson died three days later of \u201cacute intravenous cocainism\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Fuller testified that when Heacock learned about the telephone call he exclaimed, \u201c[I]f I\u2019m here when the rescue squad comes, the police are going to try and get me.\u201d The next day, Heacock gave Fuller some cocaine and told him to sell it. Sometime prior to the trial, Heacock talked with Fuller about his testimony. Fuller testified that \u201che was trying to get me to go along with a story\u201d to the effect that \u201cit was just the two girls upstairs, and that he was never up there, and that the cocaine had come from somebody else other than him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Bruce Collie, another guest at the party, testified that he and Heacock decided to leave before the rescue squad arrived. They \u201cgrabbed a couple bongs\u201d and \u201cgathered up some stuff, and we left.\u201d They went first to Heacock\u2019s home where Heacock \u201cgathered up some stuff\u2019, including \u201csome scales\u201d, and \u201cput it in a bag\u201d, and then the two \u201c[j]umped on the dirt bike, and rode back in the woods\u201d where Heacock \u201cburied\u201d the bag. Heacock told Collie: \u201cJust play it cool. Don\u2019t tell anybody what happened. Said if it come down to anything, we could probably blame it on Sharon [Dryden].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Heacock and Chaplin did not testify at trial, and the record does not show who administered the fatal injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The trial court, sitting without a jury, convicted Heacock of conspiring to distribute cocaine, possession and distribution of cocaine, and murder of the second degree. Heacock appeals from three judgments imposing sentences aggregating 80 years in the penitentiary, with 40 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>We consider first the appeal from the murder conviction. The General Assembly has created two classes of felony-murder. \u201cMurder ... in the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, rape, forcible sodomy, inanimate object sexual penetration, robbery, burglary or abduction ... is murder of the first degree . . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-32. \u201cThe killing of one accidentally, contrary to the intention of the parties, while in the prosecution of some felonious act other than those specified in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-31 [capital murder] and 18.2-32, is murder of the second degree . . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">While \u00a7 18.2-32 contemplates a \u201ckilling with malice\u201d, the malice intrinsic in the commission of one of the predicate felonies \u201cprovides the malice prerequisite to a finding that the homicide was murder.\u201d <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 758, 762, 284 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1981). The same imputation of malice is implicit in \u00a7 18.2-33 which contemplates an accidental killing; the commission of <em>any </em>felonious act (other than those expressly excepted) during the prosecution of which a death occurs supplies the malice which raises the incidental homicide to the level of second-degree murder. This statute codifies ancient common law. <em>See Whiteford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>27 Va. (6 Rand.) 721 (1828).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The indictment charged Heacock with a violation of \u00a7 18.2-33 and defined the underlying \u201cfelonious act\u201d as \u201cDistribution of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance\u201d. The evidence shows that the cocaine was supplied by Heacock and that Wilson received an intravenous injection of that substance. The defendant does not challenge these facts. Instead, he argues that the evidence fails to show that he administered the fatal injection. This argument overlooks Dryden\u2019s testimony that Heacock and Chaplin jointly prepared the narcotic mixture in a spoon, the essential first step in the process of administration by syringe. Hence, it is immaterial that Chaplin may have inserted the needle or that Wilson may have injected herself. The defendant was a principal in the second degree and, as such, criminally responsible for the consequences of his conduct \u201cas if a principal in the first degree\u201d. Code \u00a7 18.2-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Yet, Heacock maintains that he is not criminally responsible for Wilson\u2019s death because, he says, that was not a foreseeable consequence of the criminal conduct charged in the indictment. \u201c[Application of the [felony-murder] rule to felonies not foreseeably dangerous,\u201d he reasons, \u201cwould be unsound analyti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>cally, because there is no logical basis for imputing malice from the intent to commit a felony not dangerous to human life.\u201d But nothing in \u00a7 18.2-33 limits its scope to such felonies; rather, that statute encompasses all felonious acts except capital murder and the several crimes particularly named in \u00a7 18.2-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Even if we were disposed to interpret the statutory language to conform to the defendant\u2019s view, which we are not, the evidence defeats the premise of his analysis. Heacock knew, or should have known, that injection of the narcotic he supplied and helped to administer to Wilson was inherently dangerous to human life. Only minutes before, he had seen Dryden suffer a violent reaction to an injection of the same substance. At trial, defense counsel asked Dr. William Masselo, a forensic pathologist experienced in the diagnosis of cases of drug overdose, \u201chow much cocaine would it take to throw somebody into cardiac arrest intravenously\u201d. Dr. Masselo replied, \u201cAny amount could, in fact, do this to anyone.\u201d In determining how to classify a controlled substance, the State Board of Pharmacy is required to consider the \u201crisk to the public health.\u201d Code \u00a7 54-524.84:1(a)(6). Cocaine is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, \u00a7 54-524.84:6 (b)(4), because the Board has found that it \u201chas high potential for abuse\u201d which \u201cmay lead to severe psychic or physical dependence\u201d, \u00a7 54-524.84:5. And the General Assembly has recognized the human dangers associated with the unlawful distribution of cocaine. Conviction of the first offense carries a penalty of \u201cnot less than five nor more than forty years\u201d and a fine of \u201cnot more than $25,000\u201d and, upon a subsequent conviction, the accused may be \u201csentenced to imprisonment for life\u201d. Code \u00a7 18.2-248(a). Accordingly, we hold, as a matter of law, that the unlawful distribution of cocaine is conduct potentially dangerous to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The defendant urges us to hold that the felony-murder rule does not apply unless the underlying felony is shown to be the proximate cause of the death. It is not sufficient, he believes, that the death occurred as an incident to the commission of the felonious act. In <em>Doane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 500, 502-03, 237 S.E.2d 797, 798-99 (1977), we reserved the question whether the application of the rule requires a \u201cshowing ... of causal relationship, or whether a showing of mere nexus will suffice\u201d. We do not decide that question here, because it is foreclosed by evidence which we consider conclusive. The underlying felony was distribution of cocaine, a drug the defendant should have known was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>herently dangerous to human life; Wilson ingested that drug and, as we have said, it is immaterial who made the injection; Wilson died of \u201cacute intravenous cocainism\u201d; thus, cause and effect were proximately interrelated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">[W]hen the homicide is within the <em>res gestae </em>of the initial felony and is an emanation thereof, it is committed in the perpetration of that felony. Thus, the felony-murder statute applies where the initial felony and the homicide were parts of one continuous transaction, and were closely related in point of time, place and causal connection ....</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Haskell et al. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 1033, 1041, 243 S.E.2d 477, 482 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Next, the defendant contends that the felony-murder rule does not apply in this case because the decedent \u201cwas a co-felon in the sense that she was present at a \u2018drug party\u2019 \u201d. Apparently, Heacock relies upon our decision in <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>where we held that \u201ca criminal participant in a felony may not be convicted of the felony-murder of a co-felon killed by the victim of the initial felony.\u201d 222 Va. at 765, 284 S.E.2d at 816. We adhere to that holding, but it is inapposite here. Wilson was not a co-felon killed by the victim of the drug-distribution felony; she was the victim of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"AjB\">Finding no merit in the first assignment of error, we hold that where, as here, death results from ingestion of a controlled substance, classified in law as dangerous to human life, the homicide constitutes murder of the second degree within the intendment of \u00a7 18.2-33 if that substance had been distributed to the decedent in violation of the felony statutes of this Commonwealth. <em>See generally, </em>Annot., 32 A.L.R.3d 589 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Heacock also assigns error to the court\u2019s failure to find that the distribution involved in this case was merely an \u201caccommodation\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>alty imposed for his distribution conviction was imprisonment for 40 years, with 20 years suspended. He contends that the penalty should be no greater than imprisonment for 10 years, the maximum prescribed for a Class 5 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Construing Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248(a) and -263<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> together, we have held that a defendant who invokes an accommodation defense has the burden of proving the elements of that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Stillwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 214, 247 S.E.2d 360 (1978). And in construing \u00a7 18.2-248(a) as a whole, we have observed that the General Assembly intended the reduced penalty to apply when the unlawful distribution was made \u201cnot by a dealer in drugs, a pusher or one who was normally engaged in the drug traffic, but by an individual citizen who was motivated by a desire to accommodate a friend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 247 S.E.2d at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Heacock argues that he supplied the cocaine free of charge and that his only purpose was to accommodate a group of people assembled at a party. While there is some evidence to this effect, other evidence tends to show that Heacock was a \u201cdealer in drugs\u201d whose motivation in supplying the cocaine was more than simply a \u201cdesire to accommodate a friend.\u201d The drug Heacock supplied was \u201c[v]ery high quality cocaine\u201d, and the quantity was sufficient to distribute among a number of users, some of whom ingested the substance several times. The paraphernalia Heacock took as he fled from the police and the scales and \u201cstuff\u201d he retrieved from his home and buried in the woods , were indicia of commercial traffic in drugs. And the day following the party, Heacock delivered a quantity of cocaine he had acquired from some source to Fuller with instructions to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Drug dealers must cultivate and maintain a familiar clientele of habitual drug users, and the users can satisfy their habit only when they know a dealer they can trust to supply a quality product promptly upon demand. A drug party, catered gratis by a dealer, is a typical public-relations tool designed to promote good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>will, strengthen mutual confidence and interdependence, and enhance the dealer\u2019s business prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">A person convicted of distributing a controlled substance is not entitled to the reduced penalty afforded by \u00a7 18.2-248(a) if the distribution was made \u201cwith intent to profit thereby\u201d. The \u201cprofit\u201d contemplated by the statute is \u201cany consideration received or expected\u201d. We believe the evidence and the reasonable inferences it raises support a finding that Heacock was a dealer in drugs and that he distributed samples of his high-quality merchandise to the several guests at the party with the expectation of promoting profits from future sales. Consequently, we will affirm the conviction for felonious distribution and uphold the sentence imposed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Finally, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction of conspiracy for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years with 10 years suspended. The Attorney General believes that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201cConspiracy is defined as \u2018an agreement between two or more persons by some concerted action to commit an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982) (quoting <em>Falden </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 542, 544, 189 S.E. 326, 327 (1937)). \u201cThere can be no conspiracy without an agreement . . . and the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement existed.\u201d <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 575, 580, 249 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1978) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The indictment charged Heacock with conspiring with guests at the party to commit the offense of distribution of cocaine. The distribution offense was committed, but there is nothing to show that it was the product of \u201can agreement between two or more persons\u201d to act in concert. Heacock was the only source of the cocaine and the sole distributor. The distributees possessed and used the controlled substance, but, so far as the record discloses, none was a party to an agreement to commit the offense Heacock committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Upholding this assignment of error, we will reverse the judgment convicting him of conspiracy and enter final judgment in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>favor. The judgments convicting him of felonious distribution and murder of the second degree will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-248(a) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">If [the accused] proves that he <em>gave, </em>distributed or possessed with intent to <em>give </em>or distribute a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II only as an accommodation to another individual who is not an inmate in a penal institution ... or in the custody of an employee thereof, and <em>not with intent to profit thereby from any consideration received or expected </em>nor to induce the recipient or intended recipient ... to use or become addicted to or dependent upon such controlled substance, he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.
