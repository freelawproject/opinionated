Yancey worked as an inspector for Holly Farms. It was her job to insure that packages of chicken parts were properly sealed. In performing her work, Yancey was required to pick up the packages, turn them over to inspect the seals, and, if the seals were adequate, place the packages on a rack. She did this work while standing on a concrete floor. The packages weighed, on average, five pounds apiece. In the course of a shift, Yancey would usually load 500 to 600 racks, each of which held eight packages. She testified that \u201csometimes\u201d she would load as many as 900 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>racks in one shift. In order to load the racks, Yancey had to make certain unspecified twisting movements of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Yancey had worked as an inspector for four to five months before she experienced any back pain. She testified that on July 23, 1982, the day before she was scheduled to go on vacation, she had been working five to six hours when \u201cit felt like in the middle of my back there was something pulling real hard.\u201d She finished her shift and went on vacation for a week. Yancey testified that when she returned from vacation her back \u201cfelt pretty good.\u201d According to her, \u201c[t]he rest really helped it and then I went ahead and worked a couple of weeks and then it got worse again.\u201d She said that the soreness recurred \u201cthree weeks after\u201d her return from vacation. She explained that after working a \u201ccouple of hours\u201d her back \u201cwould get sore and by the end of the night it would feel like it was pulling down in there again so I\u2019d go home.\u201d She stopped working on September 8, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">On September 28, 1982, Yancey filed her first report of injury. In that report she said the date of her injury was \u201cunknown.\u201d She described the nature of her injury as, \u201cLower Back Pain-Muscle Strain.\u201d On September 30, 1982, she filed an Application for Hearing in which she described the nature of her complaint as \u201cLow Back pain, secondary to muscle strain.\u201d After an investigation, Holly Farms\u2019 carrier denied liability on the grounds that Yancey\u2019s condition did not result from an accidental injury or occupational disease which arose out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Commission scheduled a hearing to consider Yancey\u2019s claim of \u201caccidental injury.\u201d The matter was heard before a deputy commissioner who, after hearing some of the testimony, advised the parties that he was going to consider the case \u201cunder an occupational disease theory as well as accidental injury theory.\u201d The deputy commissioner ruled that Yancey had suffered an accidental injury. He also made an alternative ruling: he stated that even if an accidental injury had not been proved, Yancey was entitled to compensation \u201con the basis of an occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The full Commission, with one member dissenting, reversed the finding of accidental injury but upheld the finding of occupational disease. Holly Farms contends the full Commission erred. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Holly Farms advances two main arguments in support of its view that the Commission erred. First, it contends that a back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>strain is not a disease and should not have been treated as such by the Commission. Second, it contends that even if we assume Yancey\u2019s back strain constituted a disease, she was not entitled to compensation because she failed to meet the conditions imposed by Code \u00a7 65.1-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides coverage in only two circumstances: \u201cinjury by accident, or occupational disease.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-7. Heretofore, we have not considered whether a back strain falls under the heading \u201coccupational disease.\u201d In the past, our cases concerning back pain have consistently analyzed the facts to ascertain the existence of an \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d <em>See, e.g. VEPCO </em>v. <em>Cogbill, </em>223 Va. 354, 288 S.E.2d 485 (1982); <em>Badische Corp. </em>v. <em>Starks, </em>221 Va. 910, 275 S.E.2d 605 (1981); <em>Tomko </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Plastering, </em>210 Va. 697, 173 S.E.2d 833 (1970); <em>Virginia Electric, Etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Quann, </em>197 Va. 9, 87 S.E.2d 624 (1955); <em>Big Jack Overall Co. </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>161 Va. 446, 171 S.E. 686 (1933). Under these cases, Yancey could not recover for an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d because her evidence failed to establish a \u201csudden, obvious mechanical or structural change\u201d in her back. <em>Cogbill, </em>223 Va. at 357, 288 S.E.2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Thus, implicit in our decisions is the rule that back injuries are injuries, not diseases. Consistent with this rule, the Commission stated in <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Morton Frozen Foods Division, </em>46 O.I.C. 107, 109 (1964), that: \u201cBack strain is not a disease. Strain of the muscles or tendons in the back is due to a single or repeated physical trauma which injures the muscle or tendons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Despite this Court\u2019s opinions regarding back injuries, Yancey urges us to adopt a broad definition of disease which would encompass virtually anything that goes wrong with the body. Yancey makes this argument even though the record is devoid of any evidence, expert or otherwise, that a back strain is a disease. Yancey merely asserts that her back strain is a disease. We do not find it necessary to pick our way through dictionary definitions of \u201cdisease\u201d in order to reject Yancey\u2019s argument. The Virginia statute provides protection where there has either been an accidental injury or an occupational disease. A definition of either \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d that is so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin is too broad because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act. For more than 50 years, back pains such as those complained of by Yancey have been treated in our cases as injuries, not as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>diseases. If this distinction is to be done away with, the legislature must do so. We hold then, that on the facts of this appeal, Yancey\u2019s back pain was not a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Commission\u2019s ruling was in error for yet another reason. The Commission\u2019s finding that her disease was an \u201cordinary disease of life,\u201d together with other facts in the case, points unmistakably to the conclusion that Yancey was not entitled to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Upon review of Yancey\u2019s occupational disease argument, the Commission stated the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">Lumbar strain is generally known to be a disease process to which individual members of the general public may be exposed outside of the employment of poultry worker. We find that <em>lumbar strain is an ordinary disease of life.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Upon consideration of all the circumstances established by this record, the Commission finds that the employee\u2019s lumbar strain arose out of her employment as a poultry inspector and we conclude that her injury qualifies as an <em>excepted ordinary disease of life </em>under the definition of occupational disease in accord with the provisions of \u00a7 65.1-7 and \u00a7 65.1-46.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">(Emphasis added.) Once the Commission concluded that Yancey suffered from an ordinary disease of life, she was not entitled to compensation unless her condition met either one of two exceptions contained in Code \u00a7 65.1-46; that provision reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">No ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment shall be compensable, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">(1) When it follows as an incident of occupational disease as defined in this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">(2) When it is an infectious or contagious disease contracted in the course of employment in a hospital or sanitarium or public health laboratory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">The second exception has no application to this case. Unless the first exception applies, Yancey cannot recover even if a back strain is a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In our opinion, the first exception does not apply because Yancey\u2019s back pain did not \u201cfollow as an incident of occupational disease.\u201d Yancey contends that this language is ambiguous and that it could be read in such a way that the back pain need not follow some other occupational disease but merely follow from the demands of the occupation. We think Yancey\u2019s reading of the statute is contrived and unreasonable. In our view, the plain meaning of the language set forth above is that before an ordinary disease of life can be excepted, and thus made compensable, the claimant must first establish the existence of an \u201coccupational disease\u201d and then establish that the ordinary disease of life of which she complains followed \u201cas an incident of\u2019 that occupational disease. The six remaining factors referred to in the last part of Code \u00a7 65.1-46 have nothing whatever to do with proving an excepted ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The Commission erred in awarding compensation to Yancey. Therefore, we will reverse its award and enter final judgment for the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
