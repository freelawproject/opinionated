In this appeal, the sole question presented is whether the North Carolina statute is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the Virginia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that an out-of-state conviction was obtained under laws substantially similar to those of the Commonwealth. <em>Rufty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 836, 837-38, 275 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1981). Although the two state statutes are similar in many respects, one difference is readily apparent. The North Carolina statute creates a <em>conclusive </em>presumption of intoxication when a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration is 0.10 percent or more. N. C. Gen. Stat. 20-138(b) (now repealed and reenacted in substance as \u00a7 20-138.1 (a)(2)). The Virginia statute, on the other hand, provides that a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent or more merely gives rise to a <em>rebut-table </em>presumption that a person is under the influence of alcohol. Code \u00a7 18.2-269(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The Attorney General argues that when the statutes of the two states are considered in their entirety, each has a general likeness to the other, and, therefore, the North Carolina statute passes the \u201csubstantially similar\u201d test. We conclude, however, that the differing effect of the two presumptions on one accused of driving while intoxicated is substantial. In Virginia, an accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>may present evidence to rebut the presumption, and if such evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to his guilt, the fact finder must acquit. In North Carolina, however, mere proof that an accused\u2019s blood alcohol is 0.10 percent is conclusive as to guilt. With such a fundamental difference, we cannot say that the North Carolina statute is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court erred when it considered the North Carolina conviction as a prior offense. Accordingly, we will vacate the sentence imposed by the trial court and remand the case for the imposition of a sentence consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-16\"> \u00a7 18.2-270.
