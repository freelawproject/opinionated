Travis appeals from a decree awarding Judith\u2019s custody to Ruth.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Travis and Ruth were married March 20, 1976. Judith was born August 29, 1978. Travis and Ruth separated March 16, 1980, and were divorced by final decree entered September 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The decree confirmed a property settlement agreement dated December 5, 1980, and an amended agreement dated August 31, 1981. At the time the agreements were executed and on the date the decree was entered, the parties resided in Williamsburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Under the December 5, 1980 agreement, Ruth was given custody of Judith, with reasonable rights of visitation reserved to Travis. Under the amended agreement, Ruth would \u201cretain custody\u201d until she removed her domicile from Williamsburg, but, upon such removal, Travis would have custody for one month and then the parties would make a good faith effort to settle the custody question. If the settlement effort failed, the matter of custody would be decided by the trial court. Pending such decision, Judith would not be removed from the jurisdiction of the court and Travis would \u201cretain custody . . . until changed by mutual agreement or Court Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">About October 1, 1981, Ruth moved to Henrico County. Judith remained in Williamsburg with Travis, according to the terms of the August 31, 1981 amended agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">On December 23, 1981, Ruth married Charles Moore. She then wrote to Travis requesting that he return Judith to her by January 16, 1982, \u201cat the very latest.\u201d When Travis refused, Ruth asked the trial court for a hearing, and the matter was set for June 10, 1982. Following a hearing on that date, the chancellor awarded Ruth temporary custody of Judith, with reasonable rights of visitation reserved to Travis. The chancellor directed the Henrico County Department of Social Services to monitor Ruth\u2019s \u201chome situation\u201d and ordered the parties to return to court the following October \u201cfor review of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">Travis filed a motion for rehearing, which the trial court granted. The matter was reheard on October 13, 14, and 15, 1982. While the hearing was in progress, the chancellor declared a recess, following which the parties advised the court that they had reached an agreement concerning custody. The agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>presented to the court in the form of a consent decree, which was entered October 26, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The decree provided that Travis and Ruth would have joint custody of Judith and that the child\u2019s primary residence would be with Ruth from October 14 through October 29, 1982, with Travis from October 30 through December 31, with Ruth from January 1 through April 1, 1983, with Travis from April 2 through July 1, and with Ruth from July 2 through August 27. The decree provided further that the parties would make a good faith effort in June, 1983, \u201cto settle the matter of the continuing custody arrangement for the period following August 27, 1983.\u201d The cause was continued \u201cfor further hearing\u201d in the event the parties were unable to agree on Judith\u2019s future custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On August 23, 1983, the parties returned to court and advised the chancellor they had been unable to agree on Judith\u2019s custody. Counsel for Travis told the chancellor he had received information that Ruth planned to move to Louisiana, where her husband had accepted a teaching position, and that she wanted to take Judith with her for the school year, an arrangement which was unsatisfactory to Travis.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">After the witnesses were sworn, Ruth\u2019s counsel moved to \u201climit the testimony to circumstances surrounding the child and the family environment at this time.\u201d Following argument, the chancellor granted Ruth\u2019s motion and ruled that the hearing would be limited to \u201c[w]hat the present situation is and anything that has transpired since October 15, 1982,\u201d the date of the last hearing in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Counsel for Travis then was permitted to make a proffer of what he would have submitted had the hearing not been limited. Several times during the proffer, Ruth\u2019s counsel interrupted and represented to the court that the matter proffered had been introduced in prior hearings. At one point, the chancellor observed that counsel for the parties were \u201cin a better position than the Court to recall what is in the evidence\u201d and appeared to agree with Ruth\u2019s counsel that Travis\u2019s proffer consisted of evidence already introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Following the proffer, the chancellor proceeded to hear evidence limited to the period subsequent to the hearing of October, 1982. At the conclusion of the evidence and argument of counsel, the chancellor awarded Judith\u2019s custody to Ruth, with reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>rights of visitation reserved to Travis. The award was embodied in the decree appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">While Travis has assigned several errors, the determinative question, in our opinion, is whether the chancellor erred in limiting the evidence at the hearing on August 23, 1983. Travis argues that the limitation deprived him of relevant evidence on the crucial question of what custodial disposition would be in Judith\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Ruth argues, on the other hand, that a trial court may properly limit the evidence to \u201cthat which [is] relevant to the issues to be decided.\u201d Here, Ruth says, the chancellor concluded that no useful purpose would be served by \u201cgoing over again events which had occurred prior to [the] ruling of October 15, 1982.\u201d In any event, Ruth maintains, the chancellor based his final decision on \u201cthe multitude of evidence\u201d introduced in the earlier hearings as well as in the August, 1983 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In limiting the evidence at the August, 1983 hearing, the chancellor apparently accepted the argument Ruth then made that the October, 1982 agreement and decree \u201claid to rest once and for all\u201d any question of her fitness as a parent. The October, 1982 agreement and decree, however, constituted only a temporary, and not a permanent, disposition of custody. Indeed, the arrangement was apparently regarded by the parties as a mere experiment, with which neither party was satisfied in the end. Hence, the October, 1982 agreement and decree were not entitled to conclusive effect on the paramount question before the court at the August, 1983 hearing, <em>viz., </em>in whose custody Judith\u2019s welfare would best be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Furthermore, we do not agree with the representation made to the chancellor by Ruth\u2019s counsel that Travis\u2019s proffer consisted solely of evidence already in the record. Counsel may have misspoken in this regard because part of what Travis proffered was contained in discovery depositions given by Ruth in June and August, 1982. These depositions had not been introduced into evidence previously; hence, Travis\u2019s proffer was not merely cumulative. Yet, because the depositions were given prior to the October, 1982 hearing, the chancellor refused Travis permission to introduce them into evidence in whole or in part or to use them to impeach Ruth\u2019s testimony at the August, 1983 hearing. This refusal clearly was erroneous. Rule 4:7(a)(2), (3); <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Milgrim, </em>226 Va. 133, 138, 306 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Neither are we at all satisfied that Ruth is correct when she says the chancellor considered the evidence previously introduced in reaching his final decision in this case. Significantly, in an oral opinion delivered from the bench, the chancellor began his discussion with the hearing held October 13-15, 1982, and the agreement and decree which resulted from that hearing. He then developed the thesis that in the October, 1982 agreement and the other agreements involved in the case, Travis had recognized Ruth as \u201ca proper parent\u201d and had \u201cpersisted\u201d in \u201cthis attitude.\u201d This, in our opinion, clearly indicates that the chancellor deemed the October, 1982 agreement and decree to have some sort of conclusive effect sufficient to estop Travis from questioning whether Ruth was \u201ca proper parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As we have demonstrated previously, however, the October, 1982 disposition of custody was only temporary, at best. In such a situation, the doctrine of estoppel obviously is out of place.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We conclude, therefore, that in limiting the scope of the August, 1983 hearing, the chancellor excluded evidence which may have been relevant to the determination of Judith\u2019s best interests. Remaining is the question of appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In <em>Keel </em>v. <em>Keel, </em>225 Va. 606, 613, 303 S.E.2d 917, 922 (1983), involving similar circumstances, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">It would serve no useful purpose for us to examine the evidence bit by bit to determine what was relevant and what was not. Suffice it to say that we are convinced from the record that the most appropriate action is for the trial court to reexamine all the evidence in light of this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Adapting <em>Keel </em>to fit the situation at hand, we hold that, upon remand, the chancellor should consider all the evidence already in the record as well as any new evidence the parties may submit relevant to the determination of Judith\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we will reverse the decree appealed from and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
