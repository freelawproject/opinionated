An employer appeals from an award of compensation for a three-month period of temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Charles C. Stiltner, the claimant, sustained injury by accident on June 24, 1981 while employed by Perd\u00f3n Coal Company/ United Coal Company, a self-insured employer. The employee ruptured a biceps tendon in his right arm while shoveling coal underground. According to the medical evidence, the employee was not immediately disabled as a result of the incident, although he lost several weeks from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Subsequently, the claimant obtained similar employment with Middle Creek Coal Company in October of 1981. While shoveling coal for Middle Creek in June of 1982, the employee experienced a gradual onset of right arm pain and weakness over a period of four days before he was discharged on June 11, 1982. Later, in October of 1982, the employee obtained work with a third coal company.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">During October of 1982, the claimant filed an application for compensation against Middle Creek and its insurer, alleging injury by accident on June 11, 1982. That claim was defended on the ground that the employee did not sustain injury by accident in June of 1982. Middle Creek asserted that the employee\u2019s condition was wholly attributable to the accident of June 24, 1981, which occurred while the claimant was working for Perd\u00f3n Coal Company. Subsequently, the Industrial Commission dismissed the claim by opinion dated January 7, 1983. The Commission held that the claimant failed to establish that an injury by industrial accident occurred during employment with Middle Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">On January 5, 1983, the employee instituted the present proceeding. He filed an application for compensation against Perd\u00f3n alleging an injury by accident on June 24, 1981. The employer defended on the ground that the claimant was not disabled as the result of the accident in June 1981 and, further, that the employee\u2019s disability during the period alleged was caused by the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cident of June 1982 while the claimant was employed by Middle Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">During the hearing on the present claim, the hearing commissioner ordered that the Commission\u2019s file in the Middle Creek matter be incorporated by reference in the present proceeding. Following the hearing, the deputy commissioner ruled in favor of the employee. Upon review, the full Commission unanimously affirmed the hearing commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Commission decided the claimant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that he sustained any compensable disability during the period of employment with Perd\u00f3n, although Perd\u00f3n did not dispute that an injury by accident occurred on June 24, 1981. The Commission also found that, even though the claimant missed time from work because of right arm pain during his employ with Middle Creek prior to June of 1982, the claimant had not proved any work-related disability during that period. The Commission further found, however, that the medical evidence established the employee was disabled during the period June 12, 1982 to September 13, 1982 as the result of the June 1981 accident. The Commission approved the hearing commissioner\u2019s opinion which declared that \u201cclaimant sustained a simple progression, deterioration, or aggravation of his condition on June 11, 1982 while in the employ of Middle Creek Coal Company.\u201d Thus, Perd\u00f3n Coal Company was found solely responsible for payment of benefits and related medical expenses without contribution from Middle Creek or its insurer. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Initially, the employer contends that the Commission erroneously failed to consolidate for one combined hearing the claims filed against Middle Creek Coal Company and Perd\u00f3n Coal Company. Perd\u00f3n argues that, because the claimant elected to proceed against Middle Creek first, \u201csubstantial procedural problems developed.\u201d It asserts that both claims involved reimbursement for identical items of medical expense and covered identical periods of disability. It notes that because the decision in favor of Middle Creek was not appealed, no transcript of that hearing was prepared. As a result, Perd\u00f3n claims, it had no access to the claimant\u2019s testimony given at the first hearing. Indeed, Perd\u00f3n says, it had no notice of the first claim or the medical evidence filed in that proceeding. Perd\u00f3n says it was prejudiced by the claimant\u2019s method of litigating alternative theories. It alleges that the first hearing commissioner learned, during the hearing, of the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>claim against Perd\u00f3n and, thus, should have recessed the proceeding to allow Perd\u00f3n to be added as a second defendant. Perd\u00f3n contends it was the victim of Middle Creek\u2019s effort to \u201cslant the medical evidence\u201d to focus on Perdon\u2019s liability in a manner that would be favorable to Middle Creek. Perd\u00f3n asserts that when it appeared as a party defendant, its primary defense (that any disability was caused by the June 1982 incident) had already been adjudicated by the Commission adversely to Perd\u00f3n without any opportunity for it to be heard. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Perd\u00f3n has not referred us to any authority, and we have found none, which requires the Commission, under these circumstances, to proceed as Perd\u00f3n suggests. Code \u00a7 65.1-96 merely provides that the Commission \u201cshall hear the parties at issue . . . and shall decide the issues in a summary manner . . . .\u201d The Commission\u2019s rules only provide that the hearing \u201cshall be conducted as a judicial proceeding,\u201d that the Commission will not be bound \u201cby any technical rules of practice in conducting hearings,\u201d and that the Commission will \u201cmake such investigations in reference to the questions at issue in such manner as in its judgment are held adapted to ascertain and determine expeditiously and accurately the substantial rights of the parties . . . .\u201d Rule 1, Rules of the Industrial Commission of Virginia, <em>reprinted in </em>Virginia Rules Annotated at 319 (Michie 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The question whether to proceed separately or to consolidate a potential compensation claim with a pending claim is a matter within the sound discretion of the Commission. Manifestly, the Commission gave objective consideration to the claim against Perd\u00f3n notwithstanding a prior decision involving the same facts as related to Middle Creek. In the course of the opinion deciding the claim in favor of Middle Creek, the Commission expressly stated that it did not \u201cmake any finding with respect to the incident which allegedly occurred on June 24, 1981, since Perd\u00f3n Coal Company was not named as a defendant in [that] action.\u201d In addition, the Commission, in the opinion ruling against Perd\u00f3n, stated that the decision of the other claim \u201caffects only the parties to that claim. . . .\u201d Consequently, we hold there was no abuse of discretion by the Commission in deciding to process the claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We agree, however, with Perdon\u2019s second contention on appeal. The employer asserts, as it did below, that the Commission erred in refusing to permit Perd\u00f3n to take a post-hearing deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tion of one of the claimant\u2019s attending physicians who had expressed conflicting opinions in medical reports pertaining to the cause of the claimant\u2019s disability. During the March 1983 hearing on the claim against Perd\u00f3n, and as the result of incorporation of the medical information from the other claim, the employer became aware for the first time of a report from Dr. Roy R. Raub dated December 13, 1982. In that report, Raub stated: \u201c[I]t becomes obvious that [the claimant] had a rupture of his long head of the biceps tendon prior to 6-1-82, and with the history that was given throughout all of these reports, the rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon undoubtedly occurred on 6-24-81.\u201d Previously, in a report dated July 22, 1982, Raub had reported that he had seen the claimant \u201crelative to injury that he sustained to his right arm 6-11-82\u201d while \u201cshoveling . . . and something popped in his shoulder.\u201d Raub wrote that he had diagnosed the injury as \u201cruptured long head of biceps tendon.\u201d Because the employer was confronted for the first time with this inconsistent medical opinion from one of the claimant\u2019s treating physicians as to the event causing the disability, counsel moved during the hearing that he be allowed to take Raub\u2019s deposition. The motion was denied. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">This case presents the unusual situation of an employer which, during the evidentiary hearing of a contested claim, learns for the first time about a conflicting medical opinion rendered months previously by one of the claimant\u2019s treating physicians. Ordinarily, of course, a party should not be allowed to depose a physician, post hearing, merely because there is inconsistent medical evidence contained in reports filed with the Commission. But in this case, the claimant apparently had violated a Commission rule which provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cAll medical reports received by any party in any proceeding in the Industrial Commission shall, as soon as received, be forthwith filed with the Commission. In any contested pending claim, copies of such medical reports shall be simultaneously forwarded to the opposing party.\u201d Rule 17, Rules of the Industrial Commission of Virginia, <em>reprinted in </em>Virginia Rules Annotated at 323-24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Counsel for the employer charged during the hearing that he had not previously been furnished with a copy of Raub\u2019s December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>1982 report. Claimant\u2019s counsel did not expressly deny the charge at the hearing. The charge has been repeated on appeal and it remains unanswered. The Commission did not address this issue in its opinions. Thus, on the record before us, we conclude that the Commission abused its discretion in failing to give the employer, under these circumstances, an opportunity to supplement the record by deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Because of the foregoing procedural ruling, which requires a remand of the case, we do not reach the employer\u2019s contention that the proof was insufficient to support the award of compensation for the period in question. The evidence on the merits of the claim must be reviewed again by the Commission after the deposition has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Additionally, we do not consider the remaining error assigned by the employer. Perd\u00f3n makes the rather unusual contention that the Commission erred in failing to order it to pay compensation to the claimant for a period of disability in 1981. Even assuming the employer is somehow aggrieved by such an alleged error so as to entitle it to raise the question on appeal, it has waived the point by failing to discuss or expressly reserve the issue during oral argument. <em>See Stevens </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Company, </em>226 Va. 415, 417, n., 309 S.E.2d 319, 320-21, n. (1983); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>202 Va. 941, 942, 121 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1961); <em>Nat\u2019l Maritime Union of America </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>202 Va. 672, 674, 119 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Accordingly, the award appealed from will be reversed and the claim remanded. Upon remand, the employer shall be permitted to supplement the record with the deposition of Dr. Raub, taken pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-95. The Commission will then reconsider the claim on the present record, as supplemented by the deposition, without the introduction of additional evidence by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
