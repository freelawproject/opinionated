Charged with involuntary manslaughter, Williams was convicted by a jury and sentenced to serve three years in the penitentiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The evidence showed that Reeves was walking with his back to traffic along the right-hand westbound lane of Route 460, a four-lane divided highway, that he was struck on the paved portion of the roadway, and that Williams\u2019 car proceeded in a straight line both before and after it struck Reeves. There was evidence indicating that Reeves was intoxicated,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he was weaving on and off the pavement, and that other cars had to move to the left lane to avoid him. There was also evidence that a companion told Reeves to \u201cget out of the road\u201d and that Reeves said \u201che didn\u2019t have a damn thing to live for and jumped right out ... in front of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in refusing Williams\u2019 proffered Instruction E. The instruction reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The Court instructs the Jury if they find that the intoxication and actions of the decedent, Mark Forest Reeves, were the proximate cause of his death, they shall find Charles Thomas Williams not guilty of the charge of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Williams argues that proximate cause was the \u201csalient issue\u201d in his manslaughter trial. He maintains that, given the evidence of Reeves\u2019 condition and conduct and guided by Instruction E, the jury could have found that the actions of Reeves constituted an intervening cause, superseding the antecedent acts of Williams and becoming the sole proximate cause of the accident. Hence, Williams concludes, Instruction E was of \u201ccritical importance\u201d to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We do not believe that the trial court erred in refusing Instruction E. In the first place, the instruction was defective in form. As worded, the instruction assumed that Reeves was intoxicated, and, therefore, it would have usurped the jury\u2019s prerogative to decide whether he was intoxicated or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Furthermore, two instructions granted for the Commonwealth and three granted for the defense encompassed the theory of proximate cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these instructions, Williams could have argued and the jury could have found that Reeves\u2019 conduct was the proximate cause of the accident. A \u201crefusal to grant instructions covering principles of law upon which the jury has already been properly instructed is not error.\u201d <em>Asbury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 101, 107, 175 S.E.2d 239, 243 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm Williams\u2019 manslaughter conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\"> Williams was convicted by the same jury of failing to stop at the scene of an accident, for which he received a one-year sentence. He was charged also with driving under the influence; he entered a plea of guilty to this charge and was convicted and fined $300.00. These convictions have become final and are not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-14\"> A blood test performed during an autopsy showed that Reeves\u2019 blood contained 0.22% alcohol by weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-13\"> One of the defense instructions defined \u201cthe \u2018proximate cause of an event [as] a cause which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient, intervening cause, produces the event, and without which the event would not have occurred.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b407-10\">STEPHENSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">An accused is entitled to an appropriate instruction telling the jury the law applicable to his theory of the case, provided evidence is adduced supporting the instruction. <em>Banner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 640, 645-46, 133 S.E.2d 305, 309 (1963); <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 123-24, 116 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1960); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 133, 144-45, 45 S.E.2d 908, 913 (1948). Furthermore, \u201cit is well settled that each party has the right to have presented to the jury its contention upon vital points in language to be chosen by it, provided such language is in keeping with the law.\u201d <em>Jeffress </em>v. <em>Virginia Ry. &amp; P. Co., </em>127 Va. 694, 714, 104 S.E. 393, 399 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In the present case, Williams contends that the victim\u2019s own actions were the proximate cause of his death. There was testimony that the victim said \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have a damn thing to live for\u201d and immediately thereafter he \u201cjumped right out in the road in front of the car, and the car hit him.\u201d Additionally, the evidence indicates that the victim was highly intoxicated. Clearly, therefore, the defendant presented evidence supporting his theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Nevertheless, the majority says that the trial court did not err in refusing Instruction E because \u201cthe instruction was defective in form.\u201d The instruction \u201cassumed that Reeves was intoxicated, and, therefore, it would have usurped the jury\u2019s prerogative to decide whether he was intoxicated or not.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates that the Commonwealth voiced any objection to the form of the instruction or that this was the basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling. To the contrary, the court refused the instruction \u201con the grounds that the contributory negligence, if any, of the decedent has no bearing on the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d Obviously, the instruction relates to proximate cause and not to contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The majority, therefore, finds other grounds for affirming the trial court. The undisputed evidence established that the victim was intoxicated; therefore, the defect the majority finds in the form of the instruction is patently innocuous. The majority also holds that the court properly refused the instruction because five granted instructions \u201cencompassed the theory of proximate cause.\u201d Consequently, the majority reasons, \u201cWilliams could have argued and the jury could have found that Reeves\u2019 conduct, and not Williams\u2019 negligence, was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d However, none of the instructions focused upon proximate cause according to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, i.e., that the victim\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The present case is analogous to <em>Wade. </em>Wade also was tried on a charge of involuntary manslaughter for alleged criminal negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>gence in the operation of a motor vehicle. The court refused an instruction which accurately defined criminal negligence from the defendant\u2019s perspective. It refused another instruction which would have told the jury that if it had a reasonable doubt as to who was driving the motor vehicle, it must find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Because three granted instructions also defined criminal negligence and told the jury of the elements of the offense, the Commonwealth contended on appeal that the court did not err in refusing the two instructions offered by the defendant. We rejected this contention, saying that the refused instructions \u201cset forth defendant\u2019s theory of the case in a positive way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 116 S.E.2d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Likewise, the refused instruction in the present case was the only one which set forth Williams\u2019 theory of the case in a \u201cpositive way,\u201d and I believe its refusal constituted reversible error. Therefore, I would reverse the case and remand it for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
