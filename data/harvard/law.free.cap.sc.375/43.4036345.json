We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The victim, a woman seventy-six-years-old at the time of trial, allowed Whitten, her thirty-year-old nephew, to live with her in her trailer home. The victim testified that on November 25, 2004, while she was watching television late that night, Whitten came home drunk and dragged or carried her into his bedroom. Whitten allegedly placed her on his bed, pulled off her blue jeans, removed all of his clothes but his shirt, crawled on top of the victim, and attempted to penetrate the victim as she crossed her legs and held them tight. The victim continued to resist and told Whitten repeatedly, \u201clet me go.\u201d The victim\u2019s grandnephew, who had arrived at the trailer to watch television with Whitten, overheard the remark when he came to Whitten\u2019s bedroom window after receiving no response when he knocked on the front door of the trailer. Whitten did not release the victim until her grandnephew walked into the home. When he entered the trailer, the grandnephew saw the victim in \u201cthe hallway with no pants on\u201d and Whitten behind her \u201ctrying to put his on.\u201d Whitten denied anything \u201cwas going on\u201d; however, his aunt, \u201ckept saying,\u201d while crying, that Whitten had tried to rape her.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">For his part, Whitten testified he bought five cans of malt liquor on his way home from work but, before going home, joined a friend to \u201cdrink some Bud Lights ... for a while\u201d; Whitten\u2019s aunt joined him in drinking that evening upon his return home; Whitten and his aunt had had sex on two prior occasions; and she was willing to have sex again with him that night; Whitten and his aunt were about to have sex when they were surprised by her grandnephew\u2019s knock on the door; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Whitten became scared at the thought of others finding out about his sexual relationship with his aunt and briefly held her down; he \u201clet go of\u2019 his aunt when \u201cshe started hollering\u201d; and he denied to the police the accusation that he had raped his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Whitten asked for an instruction on ABHAN as a lesser-included' offense of ACSC. Whitten\u2019s counsel explained her request this way: \u201cI think if the jury ... believe[s] that Mr. Whitten did not assault [his aunt] with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct ... that it would be appropriate for a lesser-included charge of a high and aggravated nature.\u201d The trial judge denied the request, noting the evidence only supported a verdict of \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty.\u201d On appeal, Whitten argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge ABHAN.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u201cABHAN is a lesser[-]included offense of ACSC.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cCircumstances of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA trial judge must charge the jury on a lesser-included offense if there is any evidence from which it could be inferred that the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Our review of the record does not reveal any evidence that would support a conviction for the lesser offense of ABHAN, at least during the time relevant to the allegations contained \u25a0 in the indictment. The only evidence that could possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>support an ABHAN instruction allegedly occurred <em>after </em>the sexual assault took place, that is, when Whitten heard the grandnephew come into the mobile home and Whitten held the victim to the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The charge of third degree ACSC relates only to those acts committed by Whitten that <em>preceded </em>the grandnephew\u2019s coming into the mobile home, acts that Whitten claims were consensual in nature and the aunt claims were not. Significantly, the State did not charge Whitten with having committed ABHAN against his aunt <em>after </em>sexually assaulting her. Rather, the State focused entirely on the sexual assault that occurred <em>before </em>the other alleged assault took place. As such, the two events had no bearing upon one another and would thereby not entitle Whitten to an instruction on ABHAN as a lesser-included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">We do not overlook <em>State v. </em>White,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a case that neither the appellant nor the State cited in their respective briefs and a case this court later asked the parties to address. While the cases, admittedly, contain similar fact patterns, we are limited in this instance by appellate rules that allow us to consider only the precise question that was before the trial judge and that was ruled on by him or her. Here, Whitten\u2019s counsel never gave as a reason for the requested charge that Whit-ten\u2019s action in restraining his aunt after her grandnephew came upon the scene could serve as the basis for the requested charge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>We therefore hold Whitten\u2019s claim that the victim consented to his attempt to have sexual relations with her did not reduce the offense to a lesser charge because, if the jury had found the victim consented, then in that event Whitten would have been entitled to an acquittal rather than to a conviction of another but lesser crime. To have allowed the jury, under the facts of this case, to consider the offense of ABHAN would have permitted the jury to have convicted him of an offense for which he had not been indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-6\">HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J. concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">.
