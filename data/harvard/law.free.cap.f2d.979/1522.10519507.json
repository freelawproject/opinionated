On December 17,1990, the district court sentenced Neely to 118 months imprisonment followed by four years of supervised release, imposed a special assessment of $50, and declared him ineligible for federal benefits for five years. Neely appeals his sentence arguing that (1) he should have been sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.11 (Nov. 1, 1991), rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov. 1, 1990), and (2) four years of supervised release exceeds the maximum allowed by section 841(d)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Neely under section 2D1.1, reverse the court\u2019s sentence of four years of supervised release, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>all questions of law that arise out of the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1386 (11th Cir.1992). After pronouncing Neely\u2019s sentence, the district court followed our instructions in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1102-03 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 275, 112 L.Ed.2d 230 (1990), and asked the parties whether they had \u201cany objection to the sentence or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced.\u201d Neither Neely nor the government objected to the sentence. By failing to object, Neely waived the objections that he now makes. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>943 F.2d 43, 44 (11th Cir.1991). We will only consider objections raised for the first time on appeal under the plain error doctrine to avoid \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <em>See Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-22\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-23\">Neely argues that the district court should have sentenced him under guideline section 2D1.11, not section 2D1.1. Section 2D1.11 establishes a \u201cChemical Quantity Table\u201d for determining base offense levels that apply to violations of \u00a7 841(d)(2). We reject Neely\u2019s argument for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1633-24\">First, Neely waived the argument by failing to object below and the court\u2019s sentence (exclusive of the four year term of supervised release) was not manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>unjust. <em>See Webb, </em>943 F.2d at 44; <em>Jones, </em>899 F.2d at 1103. Second, the district court sentenced Neely almost a year before section 2Dl.ll\u2019s effective date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, section 2D1.11 does not apply to Neely\u2019s conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) (requiring the application of the guideline in effect at time of sentencing); <em>United States v. Marin, </em>916 F.2d 1536, 1538 (11th Cir.1990) (same). Third, in the related case of <em>United States v. Hyde, </em>977 F.2d 1436 (11th Cir.1992), we, affirmed a district court\u2019s decision to sentence a violator of section 841(d)(2) under section 2Dl.l\u2019s \u201cDrug Quantity Table\u201d by calculating the amount of methamphetamine that could have been produced from the phenylacetic acid that he possessed. As in <em>Hyde, </em>the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Neely under section 2Dl.l's table was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-5\">Neely also contends, and the government concurs, that the district court exceeded its authority by sentencing him to four years of supervised release following his imprisonment. We agree. Although Neely did not voice his objection below, we consider the argument to avoid manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-6\">Section 841(d)(2) does not itself provide for the imposition of a period of supervised release. Because a violation of section 841(d)(2) carries a statutory maximum of ten years imprisonment, it is a Class C felony. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (1988). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b)(2), courts may impose a term of supervised release of between two and three years upon a defendant convicted of a Class C felony. The district court exceeded its authority by imposing a four year term of supervised release. We reverse and remand so that the district court may impose a lawful term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to sentence Neely under section 2Dl.l\u2019s \u201cDrug Quantity Table.\u201d We reverse the court\u2019s decision to impose four years of supervised release, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1634-12\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1633-14\">. Neely also challenges the district court's decision to sentence him for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988), which declares that one who aids or abets an offense against the United States is punishable as a principal. Neely claims that he had no notice of the charge because it was not included in the indictment. Count II of the indictment, however, clearly specifies violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 as well as 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1634-9\">. Neely apparently tries to finesse \u00a7 2Dl.ll\u2019s post-sentencing effective date by simply omitting the date from his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
