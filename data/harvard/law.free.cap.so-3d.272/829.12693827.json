The Florida Supreme Court has now quashed our more recent decision, remanding for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Lee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682736\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/1297/\">\n    258 So. 3d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2018).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sherman v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. SC18-949 (Fla. Apr. 16, 2019). In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the court held that \"to determine whether multiple convictions of solicitation of a minor, unlawful use of a two-way communications device, and traveling after solicitation of a minor are based upon the same conduct for purposes of double jeopardy, the reviewing court should consider only the charging document.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682736\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/1297/\">\n    258 So. 3d at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying that rule here, we must reverse the lesser conviction. On remand, the trial court should resentence for the remaining conviction. We otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   REVERSED in part; AFFIRMED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wolf and Winsor, JJ., concur; Makar, J., concurs in result only.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
