The State argued that this court overlooked or misapprehended the Florida Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dean v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369880\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/420/\">\n    230 So.3d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2017), which held that failure to give a requested jury instruction on a necessarily lesser included offense one step removed from the charged offense is subject to a harmless error analysis and is no longer per se reversible error. I agree with the foregoing characterization of the holding of\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   , and if\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   were the supreme court's latest pronouncement on the subject, I would vote to grant rehearing and deny Franklin's petition alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   , a plurality opinion joined by four justices of the supreme court answered a question certified by the Fourth District to be of great public importance\n   by holding that manslaughter is a category one lesser included offense of second-degree felony murder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369880\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369880\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/420/\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth District had reached the opposite conclusion, rejecting Dean's argument that the trial court had \"erred in denying his request for the manslaughter instruction because it is a necessarily lesser included offense of second-degree felony murder and, therefore, the trial court was required to give the instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12369880\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/230/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 422 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dean v.

Reconciliation of these ostensibly incongruous determinations-that the trial court erred but the convictions should be upheld-can only be found in Justice Polston's concurring opinion: \"In cases such as this one, where the evidence supports the charged offense as well as the requested instruction on a necessarily lesser included offense, any error in failing to give the requested instruction is harmless because the defendant is not entitled to an opportunity for a jury pardon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426 (Polston, J., concurring). This is confirmed by the rationale expressed in the plurality opinion itself, which affirms the convictions in part \"[f]or the reasons expressed in Justice Polston's concurring opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Justice Polston's concurring opinion itself only received three votes, leading the Fourth District to the conclusion that it was not a \"binding precedential opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caruthers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12422337,12422341\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/232/441/\">\n    232 So.3d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Santos v.

However, the abrogation of the pardon power-and the conclusion that failure to give a requested instruction on a necessarily included offense one step removed from the charged offense is not per se reversible-\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   binding precedent because it was incorporated by the four-vote plurality opinion, the result of which was dependent on the harmless error rationale in Justice Polston's concurring opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight v.

Justice Polston, now in the minority, disagreed that such error was fundamental, concluding that, \"because the evidence supports the jury's verdict of attempted second-degree murder\" on which it was properly instructed, \"the defendant is not entitled to a new trial based upon the failure to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 300 (Polston, J., dissenting) (\"No defendant has the right to a trial in which the judge facilitates the jury's acting in disregard of the law[.]\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Haygood v.
