Code 1975, and two counts of distribution of obscene material to a minor, a violation of \u00a7 13A-12-200.5, Ala. Code 1975. The circuit court sentenced Pruitt to 15 years' imprisonment for each conviction for engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student under the age of 19 years; those sentences were split, and Pruitt was ordered to serve 1 year in jail and 2 years on house arrest followed by 3 years' supervised probation. For her convictions for distributing obscene material to a minor, the circuit court sentenced Pruitt to one year in jail; those sentences were split and Pruitt was ordered to serve six months in jail followed by three years' supervised probation. The court ordered that all four sentences were to run concurrently. The court further ordered Pruitt to pay $2,500 in fines, $250 to the crime victims compensation fund, and court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During the guilty plea, the parties submitted an exhibit to the plea agreement in which they stipulated to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Ashley Pruitt (hereinafter 'AP') was employed with the Blount County Board of Education at various times as a teacher and coach from 2008 to 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"At all times relevant to this case, AP resided in the Locust Fork community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"AP was hired as a teacher and coach at Locust Fork High School, where she taught during the school years of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014.

At the time she entered her guilty plea, Pruitt filed a renewed motion to dismiss all five counts against her in which she reasserted her constitutional challenge and during her guilty-plea colloquy reserved her challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pruitt contends that \u00a7 13A-6-81, Ala. Code 1975, is unconstitutional as applied to her. Specifically, Pruitt argues that her felony convictions should be overturned because, she says, the legislature never intended \u00a7 13A-6-81, Ala. Code 1975, to apply to teachers and students, 16 and older, who are not at the same school. Pruitt cites the United States Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

As a teacher, Pruitt was a school employee. See \u00a7 13A-6-80, Ala. Code 1975 (\"For purposes of this article, school employee includes a teacher....\"). Further, it is undisputed that the victims in this case were students. However, Pruitt argues that regardless of her status as a teacher, the facts of this case, namely, that the student victims were 16 years and older and attended a different school than the school in which Pruitt taught, resulted in the unconstitutional application of \u00a7 13A-6-81 in this case. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   , Pruitt argues that she engaged in sexual conduct with consenting parties under Alabama law who were \"mature enough to consent to sexual relations.\" (Pruitt's brief, p. 13.) Pruitt's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , however, is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a Texas statute that provided: \"A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.\" Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.06(a) (2003). The defendants in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   were adult males who were engaged in private, consensual conduct at the time of their arrest. In framing the issue, the Supreme Court noted that it had to determine \"whether the petitioners were free as\n   <em>\n    adults\n   </em>\n   to engage in private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    539 U.S. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution....

The sexual conduct, here, occurred between an adult teacher and three students who were under the age of 19. Specifically, Pruitt engaged in deviant sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old student, engaged in sexual intercourse with a 18-year-old student, and sent a 16-year-old student nude photographs of her breasts and vagina. All the students were minors under Alabama law. See \u00a7 26-1-1, Ala. Code 1975 (stating that \"[a]ny person in this state, at the arrival at the age of 19 years, shall be relieved of his or her disabilities of minority\"). Therefore, contrary to Pruitt's\n   contention otherwise, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   does not support the prohibition of the prosecution of the sexual crimes in this case on constitutional grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Moreover, there exists a legitimate state interest in prohibiting intimate contact between a teacher and a student.

We agree with the reasoning of these courts and reiterate the importance of maintaining the integrity of the teacher-student relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Likewise, Pruitt's contention that the victims were old enough to consent also fails because \u00a7 13A-6-81 expressly states that \"consent is not a defense.\" Pruitt cites \u00a7 30-1-4, Ala. Code 1975-the law establishing the minimum age of 16 for contracting for marriage-for the proposition that the State of Alabama \"mandated that those sixteen and older are mature enough to choose sexual partners, and establish boundaries to their sexual activities.\" (Pruitt's brief, p. 9.) We are not persuaded, however, that by enacting \u00a7 30-1-4 the legislature intended to make such a sweeping \"mandate\" as Pruitt suggests. Pruitt's contention that \u00a7 30-1-4 permits 16- and 18-year-olds to make decisions about their sexual partners and activities is not supported by the enactment of \u00a7 13A-6-81 that went into effect on July 1, 2010, and expressly prohibited consensual sexual contact between a school employee and a student under the age of 19 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, the fact that Pruitt engaged in sexual conduct with the student victims after she transferred to teach at a different school does not render \u00a7 13A-6-81 unconstitutional under the particular facts and circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \" ' \" 'In determining the meaning of a statute, this Court looks to the plain meaning of the words as written by the legislature.'\n   <em>\n    DeKalb County LP Gas Co. v.

Code 1975, states, in pertinent part, that \"[a] person commits the crime of a school employee engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student under the age of 19 years if he or she is a school employee and engages in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student.\" The language in the statute is unambiguous and, therefore, requires no judicial interpretation on our part. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ankrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904305\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/397/#p404\">\n    152 So.3d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404 (Ala. 2013) (recognizing that principles of statutory construction permit an appellate court to engage in judicial construction only if the language in a statute is ambiguous). Section 13A-6-81 prohibits a teacher from engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse with a minor student. As noted above, it is undisputed that Pruitt was a school employee and that the victims in this case were students under the age of 19 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The particular facts of this case exemplify the importance of reading \u00a7 13A-6-81 to prohibit sexual contact between teachers and students, regardless of whether the teacher and student are at the same school or different schools. In this case, the stipulated facts indicate that Pruitt taught the victims at Locust Fork High School for at least one year and possibly two years. In August 2014, Pruitt was hired to teach at Appalachian High School-another high school in Blount County. Approximately one month after her transfer to a new high school in the same school system, Pruitt engaged in sexual intercourse with one of the student victims. The very next month, Pruitt engaged in deviant sexual intercourse with another student victim and sent yet another student victim nude photographs of her breasts and vagina. Pruitt waited only a couple of months after she was transferred to a different school before she engaged in sexual conduct with each student victim. At the very least, the timing of her conduct evidences an attempt to circumvent a legitimate state interest that Pruitt concedes on appeal, namely, that the State has \"a legitimate interest in criminalizing sexual contact between teachers and students of the same school.\" (Pruitt's brief, p. 13.) The State's interest in protecting students, however, does not end when the student or teacher transfers to another school, particularly one in the same school system, as in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, Pruitt has failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 13A-6-81 was unconstitutional as applied to her. Therefore, we affirm as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Pruitt also contends that her misdemeanor convictions for distribution of obscene material to a minor should be reversed because, she argues, \u00a7 13A-12-200.5, Ala. Code 1975, as applied, infringes on her \"Equal Protection Rights under the\n   U.S. Constitution.\" (Pruitt's brief, p. 14.) Pruitt contends that the State does not have a \"legitimate interest in meddling in her private relationship with another consenting person.\" (Pruitt's brief, p. 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Section 13A-12-200.5, Ala.
