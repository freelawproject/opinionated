Thomas, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We have before us Appellant's motion for written opinion. We grant Appellant's motion and, accordingly, withdraw our former opinion of March 1, 2019, and substitute this opinion in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant, a registered nurse, challenges the Board of Nursing's (the \"Board\") final order suspending his nursing license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 17, 2017, the Department of Health (the \"Department\") filed an administrative complaint alleging that Appellant tested positive for marijuana on a confirmed preemployment drug screen, that Appellant did not provide a lawful prescription for marijuana, and that Appellant did not have a legitimate medical reason for using marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant opted for an informal hearing on the administrative complaint conducted pursuant to section 120.57(2), Florida Statutes, stating that he did not dispute the allegations of material fact in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing before the Board, Appellant stated that \"I got a marijuana card coming,\" and counsel for the Department noted that in October 2015, the time of Appellant's drug screen, medical marijuana was not available in Florida, and did not become available until August 2016. At the hearing, Appellant stated, \"It's my fault. I did something illegal and I'm sorry for it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 21, 2017, the Board issued a final order adopting the findings of fact set forth in the administrative complaint and suspending Appellant's nursing license until he undergoes evaluation coordinated by the Intervention Project for Nurses (\"IPN\") and complies with any terms and conditions imposed by IPN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[A] reviewing court may set aside agency action only when it finds that the action is dependent on findings of fact that are not supported by substantial competent evidence in the record, material errors in procedure, incorrect interpretations of law, or an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson v. Dep't of Health, Bd. of Nursing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323837\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/954/77/#p81\">\n    954 So.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Malave v.

Section 456.072(2) allows the suspension imposed on Appellant if a board finds that Appellant violated section 456.072(1)(aa), Florida Statutes. The Board correctly interpreted section 456.072 and did not abuse its discretion in suspending Appellant's license until he is evaluated by IPN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   AFFIRMED .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Kelsey and Winokur, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
