The DDD answers the appeal herein, seeking reversal of the district court's denial of the DDD's request for writ of mandamus. The City also raises peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action, as well as a motion for this Court to take judicial notice of certain DDD budget hearing testimony. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the district court is affirmed, and the exceptions and motion are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The DDD is a special taxing district, located within the City,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was created effective January 1, 1975, pursuant to La. R.S. 33:2740.3 (its \"enabling statute\"). The enabling statute authorizes the city council to levy and collect a special ad valorem tax (the \"DDD tax\") on all taxable real property located in the DDD boundaries to be used for public improvements, facilities, and services within the DDD geographical area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, owners of property\n   within the DDD boundaries are assessed the DDD tax in addition to the regular ad valorem taxes levied on their property. In 2001, pursuant to the enabling statute, a ballot proposition for the continuation of the DDD tax was presented to the voters as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    CITY OF NEW ORLEANS (DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROPOSITION (TAX CONTINUATION)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SUMMARY: CONTINUED AUTHORITY TO LEVY A NOT EXCEEDING 22.97 MILLS PROPERTY TAX IN THE DOWNTOWN DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT FOR AN ADDITIONAL 25 YEARS, BEGINNING WITH THE YEAR 2005 AND ENDING WITH THE YEAR 2029, FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS, FACILITIES AND SERVICES, AND DEBT SERVICE ON BONDS OF THE CITY ISSUED FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND FACILITIES WITHIN THE DISTRICT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   Shall the City of New Orleans, State of Louisiana (the \"City\"), acting through its Council as the governing authority thereof, continue to be authorized to levy a special tax of not exceeding Twenty-Two and Ninety-Seven Hundredths (22.97) mills upon all taxable real property situated within the boundaries of the Downtown Development District of the City of New Orleans (the \"District\") as defined by La. R.S. 33:2740.3, as amended (the \"Act\"), for an additional twenty-five (25) years, beginning with the year 2005 and ending with the year 2029, said tax to be for the use and benefit of the District with the proceeds of said tax to be dedicated and used solely for public improvements, facilities and services within the District, and shall the City be further authorized to issue such bonds in a principal amount not exceeding $ 10,000,000, which bonds shall be payable solely from the proceeds of special tax?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 20, 2018, the DDD filed a Petition for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction, Writ of Mandamus, and/or Alternatively, Declaratory Judgment, and Damages, alleging that in or about 2007, the City began withholding money from the net tax receipts due to the DDD, which totaled $ 393,207.00 as of December 31, 2016. The DDD alleges that the City illegally withheld these tax proceeds from the DDD in an effort to finance the City's indebtedness to certain state pension funds. According to the DDD, the City is required to pay its obligations to the pension funds from ad valorem taxes due to the City, not from the DDD tax. Rather, the DDD alleges, the enabling statute requires that DDD tax proceeds be used solely and exclusively for the purposes and benefit of the DDD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its petition, the DDD sought preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the City from withholding and/or diverting the proceeds of the DDD tax, for a purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the DDD. The DDD also sought a writ of mandamus ordering the City to immediately direct payment to the DDD of all illegally withheld tax proceeds. Alternatively, the DDD sought a declaratory judgment that the City's actions are unlawful and monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 20, 2018, the district court held a hearing, and on August 1, 2018, it rendered judgment granting the DDD's request for preliminary injunction, which ordered as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   ...the City of New Orleans and Norman White in his Capacity as Director of\n   Finance, are prohibited from withholding and/or diverting the proceeds of the special ad valorem tax, specifically approved by a vote of the citizens of New Orleans for the exclusive benefit of the DDD, for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the DDD, except for a 2% collection fee, in compliance with La. R.S. 33:2740.3(I).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The DDD's request for writ of mandamus, however, was denied. This appeal followed. Before reaching the merits of the City's appeal and the DDD's answer to appeal, we address the exceptions filed by the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the first time on appeal, the City filed in this Court a combined exception of no right of action and no cause of action, disputing the DDD's power to sue and contending that the City is entitled to dismissal of all claims against it by the DDD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City argues that: (1) the DDD's enabling statute does not grant it the power to sue; (2) the DDD is not a separate juridical entity from the City; (3) the doctrine of confusion would extinguish any award against the City because the DDD is not a separate entity from the City; and (4) the city council has not authorized the DDD to sue the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The exception of no right of action and the exception of no cause of action are peremptory exceptions. La. C.C.P. art. 927. \"The appellate court may consider the peremptory exception filed for the first time in that court, if pleaded prior to a submission of the case for a decision, and if proof of the ground of the exception appears of record.\" La.

R.S. 11:82(A) states that \"[a]d valorem tax contributions to state and statewide public retirement systems shall be as follows\" and lists the eight specific retirement funds subject to the statute along with the percentage of \"aggregate taxes shown to be collectible by the tax rolls of each parish\" relative to each fund.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The DDD, however, contends that the DDD tax is a \"dedicated tax\" or \"special tax,\" which the City is illegally diverting in violation of the Louisiana Constitution, state statutes, and the New Orleans Home Rule Charter. Specifically, the DDD relies on the following.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     City of New Orleans v.

Pursuant to these principles, no conflict exists between La. R.S. 11:82 and the enabling statute, which would authorize the City to use dedicated taxes for purposes other than those for which the taxes were levied. The enabling statute prohibits the DDD tax from being used for purposes other than their dedicated purpose. Accordingly, La. R.S. 11:82 does not permit the City to withhold DDD tax proceeds to fund state retirement systems. The DDD has thus shown that it seeks to enjoin unlawful conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Addressing the second element of the exception, the district court's judgment is not a mandatory injunction. \"A mandatory injunction 'commands the doing of some action' and 'cannot be issued without a hearing on the merits.' \"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <em>\n     Yokum\n    </em>\n    , 2012-0217, p. 9,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7006502\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/99/74/\">\n     99 So.3d at 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Concerned Citizens for Proper Planning, LLC v.

The preliminary injunction herein orders the City to restrain conduct; specifically, the district court ordered the City to stop withholding the disputed tax proceeds from the DDD. The record and the law provide no support for the City's argument that the injunction mandates the City to undertake the affirmative act of changing its collection practices. The district court's judgment granted a prohibitory injunction, not a mandatory injunction. Because the injunction orders the City to refrain from violating prohibitory law and the Louisiana Constitution, the DDD satisfied the unlawful conduct exception and was not required to prove irreparable injury to prevail on a petition for preliminary injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The City also relies on\n    <em>\n     Kruger v.

Thus, this Court found that the petitioners were required to prove irreparable injury and failed to meet their burden of proof. Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Harvey\n    </em>\n    , 2014-0156, p. 28,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828198\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/684/#p700\">\n     183 So.3d at 704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , this Court found no violation of a prohibitory law, such that the unlawful conduct exception did not apply; under those facts, the petitioner could not prove irreparable injury because his damages, lost sales, were compensable in money. Consequently, the City's first, second, and third assignments of error lack merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In its fourth assignment of error, the City contends that the preliminary injunction is vague and overly broad. La. C.C.P. art. 3605 provides that an \"order granting either a preliminary or a final injunction or a temporary restraining order shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by mere reference to the petition or other documents, the act or acts sought to be restrained.\" The City cites to several cases for the proposition that an injunction that merely orders compliance with the law, but fails to name the parties or describe the specific acts enjoined, is vague and insufficient.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wells One Investments, LLC v.

App. 4th Cir. 1980). All of these cases, however, are factually dissimilar, and none of the defects ascribed to these cases are present here.

Defendants, the City of New Orleans and Norman White in his Capacity as Director of Finance, are prohibited from withholding and/or diverting the proceeds of the special ad valorem tax, specifically approved by a vote of the citizens of New Orleans for the exclusive benefit of the DDD, for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the DDD, except for a 2% collection fee, in compliance with La. R.S. 33:2740.3(I).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    It is readily apparent that the parties subject to the preliminary injunction are identified. The acts enjoined are also sufficiently described: the City is restrained from withholding more than a 2% collection fee from the DDD tax. The City's argument, that the judgment lacks sufficient detail by not describing the City's obligations under La. R.S. 11:82, is likewise without merit. As the injunction explicitly prohibits the City from withholding more than the 2% collection fee from the DDD tax proceeds, it is evident that the district court rejected the City's argument that that it is entitled to withhold additional sums, under the auspices of La. R.S. 11:82, to fund its State retirement system obligations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Louisiana law also provides no basis for the City's complaint that the district court's oral ruling was vague.

The DDD acknowledges in its petition, by combining its request for mandamus with alternative claims for declaratory judgment and damages, that another remedy is available through which the DDD can seek the disputed amounts through ordinary procedure. The DDD contends, however, that its claim is \"time-sensitive\" because the DDD's taxing authority expires in 2029, and the DDD requests that the district court take judicial notice of unpaid judgments and settlements owed by the City, which have been outstanding for 20 years. The DDD alleges that the City began withholding the disputed portion of the tax proceeds in approximately 2007. The DDD argues that, while it did not file its petition until 2018, it has been trying to reach a resolution with the City since that time. The district court's oral reasons reflect that it rejected the DDD's arguments that its claims were time-sensitive. Considering the facts of record, the district court properly found that the DDD failed to meet its burden to show that a delay in obtaining ordinary relief would cause injustice sufficient to warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the writ of mandamus. The DDD's answer to the appeal is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Lastly, we address the City's motion for this Court to take judicial notice of the DDD's budget hearing testimony on November 20, 2018. The City submits that DDD representative Anthony Carter testified that the DDD has a budget surplus, which is being reserved for capital investments. The City contends that this testimony is relevant to: (1) the City's exceptions, particularly, whether the DDD is a separate juridical entity from the City; (2) whether the DDD proved it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction is denied; and (3) whether the DDD is entitled to mandamus due to delay in obtaining ordinary relief. The City argues that the meeting was open to the public and video footage of the hearing was broadcast on television and streamed on the city council's website.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    This hearing did not take place until after the judgment on appeal was rendered, and the testimony could not have been before the district court in determining the DDD's entitlement to a preliminary injunction or mandamus. Likewise, the testimony could not be part of the record sent to this Court. This Court can only consider an exception filed for the first time in this Court if proof of the exception appears\n    <strong>\n     in the record\n    </strong>\n    . La. C.C.P. art. 2163. La. C.C.P. art. 2164 provides that \"[t]he appellate court shall render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper\n    <strong>\n     upon the record on appeal\n    </strong>\n    .\" (Emphasis added). \"An appellate court cannot review evidence that is not in the record on appeal and cannot receive new evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     City of Hammond v. Parish of Tangipahoa\n    </em>\n    , 2007-0574, p. 5 (La. App. 1 Cir. 3/26/08),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8184202\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/985/171/#p176\">\n     985 So.2d 171\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 176 (declining\n    to take judicial notice of minutes of parish council meeting held after district court rendered judgment). Additionally, as described above, the DDD was not required to prove irreparable injury because it sought an injunction to prohibit unlawful conduct. The testimony therefore is not relevant to the DDD's burden of proving its entitlement to a preliminary injunction under the facts of this case. The motion is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action and the motion to take judicial notice are denied, and the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED; EXCEPTIONS DENIED; MOTION DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    BELSOME, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    CHASE, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    BELSOME, J., CONCURS IN THE RESULT\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    I respectfully concur in the result of the majority opinion. However, I write separately to discuss the trial court's denial of the Downtown Development District's request for writ of mandamus. While I agree with the trial court's denial of the request, it is important to note that there are unresolved prescription issues that additionally warranted the denial of the request. For these reasons, I do not find that the trial court abused in denying the request for a writ of mandamus. Accordingly, I concur in the result of the majority to affirm this appeal.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-115\">\n     The judgment on appeal permits the City to withhold a 2% collection fee from the DDD tax.
