The matter proceeded to trial by jury, during which the following evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.P. was a first grader at Bell City High School (Bell City) at the beginning of the 2013 school year, when he and two other boys, K.M. and G.L., engaged in sexual activity on a school bus driven by Mr. John Keller. Before these incidents, all three boys had been repeatedly disciplined by Mr. Keller for disruptive behavior on the bus. Initially, Mr. Keller sat the three boys at the front seat to his right, where he could best observe them. However, because of some poor conduct on the part of some girls on the bus, Mr. Keller moved the three boys into the seat immediately behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   None of the three boys testified at trial, but other evidence showed that, at least, the boys displayed their genitals to each other and \"put their mouths on\" each other's\n   genitals. One of the boys, G.L., told the Child Advocacy Center forensic interviewer that K.M. and B.P. inserted their penises in each other's \"butts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around this time, B.P.'s mother claimed that she began to notice changes in his behavior. His teacher reported to Mrs. Pike that B.P. was disruptive and violent. B.P. begged his parents to take him to school instead of making him ride the bus. He began to have afternoon \"accidents\" at school so that his parents had to pick him up. The Pikes took B.P. to counseling with Ms. Rachel Hinton in September 2013. They also asked B.P.'s primary care physician to determine whether there was some physiological cause of his \"accidents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In October 2013, B.P.'s plight came into focus when he told his mother that K.M. had put his mouth on B.P.'s penis. Mrs. Pike went to Bell City and spoke to Mr. Russell Abshire, the assistant principal in charge of elementary school discipline. Mr. Abshire interviewed all three boys. All agreed that the incidents were initiated by K.M., who was ten years old at the time; B.P. and G.L. were six. Mr. Abshire did not notify law enforcement authorities of the incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mrs. Pike did notify the authorities. The boys were interviewed by a forensic interviewer with the Child Advocacy Center as part of the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's investigation of the matter. Again, there was no dispute that the incidents were initiated by K.M. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Pike really know what took place on the bus and had been admonished by the forensic interviewer that it would be best for them to not discuss the incident or incidents with B.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   K.M. had a history of behavioral challenges during his tenure at Bell City. Some of these challenges involved incidents that might be described as bathroom humor; others, though, were more overtly sexual in nature, including an occasion on which K.M. was found to have unfastened his pants on the playground and was attempting to engage another student to emulate his behavior so that they could \"have sex.\" The other boy declined and informed a teacher. K.M. was also known to occasionally crawl beneath bathroom stalls while other children occupied them. As a result of the incident at issue, K.M. was expelled from Bell City to continue his education at an alternative school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before Mrs. Pike discovered what had occurred on the bus, she and her husband arranged for B.P. to receive counseling for his behavior issues at school. B.P.'s initial counselor was Ms. Rachel Hinton. Ms. Hinton first saw the Pikes on September 6, 2013. His mother confided in Ms. Hinton that B.P. was becoming angrier and overreactive to unpleasant circumstances, and that this behavior had arisen about six months before. On October 8, Mrs. Pike told Ms. Hinton that another student had asked B.P. to show him his genitals. Ms. Hinton taught B.P. about declining uncomfortable invitations and \"safe touching.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 17, 2013, Mrs. Pike told Ms. Hinton about what she had learned about K.M. putting his mouth on B.P.'s privates. Ms. Hinton attempted to engage B.P. in a discussion about the incident, but he did not want to talk about it. B.P. asked Ms. Hinton to leave the room and informed his mother that a similar incident had also occurred with a friend or cousin at home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By November 5, 2013, B.P. was much improved, but continued to have some issues. However, in December 2013, Ms. Hinton noted in her records that there was no need for continued appointments because the Pikes had not seen her in some time. Ms. Hinton observed that for the rest of their lives, victims of sexual abuse\n   will encounter situations that dredge up their experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After they learned of the issues on the bus, the Pikes took B.P. to counseling with Ms. Jodi Underwood. Ms. Underwood first saw B.P. on February 25, 2014, and treated him for three sessions, the last on April 8, 2014. Ms. Underwood did not testify at trial, but her records were introduced into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, B.P. was treated by Mr. Ray Melerine, a licensed professional counselor who contracted with the school board to provide counseling services primarily for elementary school children. Mr. Melerine opined that the power differential between the older child, K.M., and the younger children, B.P. and G.L., vitiated B.P.'s consent, even if B.P. actively participated in the activity. B.P. had only confided in Mr. Melerine that an older child had \"hurt\" him and that he was angry about it. However, his records indicate that B.P. had never been raped. Mr. Melerine acknowledged that B.P. engaged in disruptive behavior at school before these occurrences, but that afterward, those disruptive behaviors escalated. He also opined that B.P. is at increased risk of engaging in activities similar to those that took place on the bus. Mr. Melerine treated B.P. at least monthly through December 6, 2015, and has seen him occasionally since, totaling four counseling sessions. He opined that B.P. will need two to three sessions of counseling until he turns eighteen and probably once a month thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.P. was seen on March 29, 2017, by his primary care doctor, Dr. Keane O'Neal. Mrs. Pike told Dr. O'Neal that B.P. was experiencing anger management issues, for which Dr. O'Neal prescribed Paxil. On May 11, 2017, Mrs. Pike brought B.P. in with continued anger issues that she feared were not being adequately addressed by the Paxil. Dr. O'Neal switched B.P. to Zoloft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Pikes both testified about how this situation has altered B.P.'s personality. B.P. has lost a certain amount of confidence he had before. He goes periods in which he seems to do fine until something happens to remind him, after which he will experience a setback that can last for a while, usually assisted by counseling with Mr. Melerine. Mr. Pike admitted, though, that in his deposition taken in June 2016, he stated that he no longer saw any lingering effects from the bus incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of their demands for damages for loss of consortium with their son, the Pikes both testified that they have lost faith in the school system. They felt their son was entitled to protection that he did not receive. They testified that what happened on the bus wrought changes in B.P.'s personality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Pikes also introduced the testimony of Ms. Stephanie Chalfin, a vocational rehabilitation counselor and life care planner. Ms. Chalfin was asked to prepare a life care plan for B.P. that assumed that he would require three counseling sessions a month until he reached age 18 and periodically thereafter. She was also asked to assume that B.P. was not able to return to school in the Calcasieu Parish School System, but would instead attend St. Margaret's, a private Catholic elementary and middle school B.P. had been moved to, and St. Louis, a Catholic high school. Ms. Chalfin opined that B.P. would require $ 98,744.00 to facilitate his lifelong counseling and schooling through high school graduation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Kristi Thibodeaux, B.P.'s first grade teacher at Bell City, testified for the school board. B.P.'s behavior from the beginning of first grade was challenging to the point that conferences with Mr. Abshire and\n   Mrs. Pike were held twice. Mrs. Pike expressed her opinion that B.P. was very gifted academically and was probably just bored with school. Ms. Thibodeaux, however, testified that she engages her first graders with almost constant work, so opportunities for boredom never present themselves. Further, B.P.'s challenging behaviors were consistent whether in the classroom, at recess, or in the bathroom. These conferences with Mr. Abshire and Mrs. Pike did not improve B.P.'s behavior. Mrs. Thibodeaux confirmed Mrs. Pike's testimony about B.P. wetting his pants in September and October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Pikes and awarding damages as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\">B.P.'s general damages $62,500.00 Mr. and Mrs. Pike's loss of consortium $ 0.00 B.P.'s tuition at St. Margaret $10,000.00 B.P.'s future treatment $19,000.00 B.P.'s future tuition expenses $20,000.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The jury assessed 50% fault to the school board and 50% to K.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Pikes filed a motion for JNOV, which the trial court granted on January 31, 2018. In its ruling, the trial court held the school board vicariously liable for K.M.'s acts, citing as authority La.Civ.Code art. 2320, which states in pertinent part, \"Teachers and artisans are answerable for the damage caused by their scholars or apprentices, while under their supervision.\" The article further provides that this liability attaches when the \"teachers...might have prevented the act which caused the damage, and have not done it.\" Indeed, the trial court further stated that the school board \"failed in its obligation to properly supervise KM and to protect BP.\" The trial court found that the jury's award was abusively low, and, conducting a de novo review of the evidence, increased the award to B.P. to $ 500,000.00. The failure to award the Pikes any sum for the loss of consortium claim was also found by the trial court to be an abuse of discretion, and the trial court awarded them $ 20,000.00; however, by operation of La.R.S. 13:5106, the total in general damages that could be assessed against the school board was $ 500,000.00. The other sums awarded by the jury were allowed to stand. The school board urged that the sums for future treatment be placed in a reversionary trust and that the general damage sum awarded to B.P. also be placed in trust. The judgment did not order that any sums be placed in trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The school board urges the following as errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The trial court erred in granting the plaintiffs' motion for JNOV and vacating the jury verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Regardless of whether the trial court erred in granting the plaintiffs' motion for JNOV, it erred in the judgment which it then entered by failing to place the award to the minor child in trust and in failing to place the award of future medical expenses in a reversionary trust without judicial interest on that sum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In the alternative, if the trial court did not err in granting the plaintiffs' motion for JNOV, it erred in the judgment\n   which it then entered by increasing the award to the minor child for \"past and future general damages\" from the jury's award of $ 62,500 to $ 500,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In the alternative, if the trial court did not err in granting the plaintiffs' motion for JNOV, it erred in the judgment which it then entered by concluding that the school board is vicariously liable for the intentional conduct of a ten-year-old fellow student of the minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   In the alternative, if the trial court did not err in granting the plaintiffs' motion for JNOV, it erred in the judgment which it then entered by concluding that the school board had breached its duty with respect to the plaintiffs' minor child and thus erred in assigning any fault to the school board with respect to its own conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The granting of a JNOV is governed by La.Code Civ.P. art. 1811, which gives a trial court latitude to allow a verdict to stand or to reopen the judgment and grant a new trial or render a JNOV. The article does not establish a standard for granting a JNOV or in reviewing a JNOV on appeal; those have been supplied by the courts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [I]n\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Furthermore, since the accident, while at a different school operated by the school board, B.P. was ridiculed after a child who attended the school learned about the bus incidents through a parent. B.P.'s treatment with Ms. Hinton, Ms. Underwood, and Mr. Melerine proceeded in regular intervals until December 16, 2015, and he has been counseled on at least four occasions since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, the jury clearly considered the need for continued counseling, as it awarded him damages for future treatment. It awarded him damages for past and future tuition expenses at St. Margaret's and St. Louis' schools, further underscoring the jury's considered deliberation of the trust issues B.P. experiences about the school board's school environments. In these respects, the jury's verdict reflects careful consideration of the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   And it is not as though there existed no inferences and factual questions regarding the extent of the psychological damage B.P. suffered; the issue is whether those inferences are reasonable. As mentioned above, B.P. first saw Ms. Hinton beginning\n   in September 2013, and she testified that Mrs. Pike had told her that B.P.'s behavior had been deteriorating for about the previous six months. Six months would have considerably predated the incidents on the bus. Ms. Thibodeaux, B.P.'s first grade teacher at Bell City, testified extensively about B.P.'s behavioral challenges that also predated the incidents, including a propensity to violence. Ms. Hinton noted in her December 3, 2013, note that B.P. was much improved and there was no need for continued appointments. Mr. Melerine opined that B.P. would require three counseling sessions a month during the school year and twice during the summer months until he reaches eighteen, but B.P. had last seen Mr. Melerine or any other provider more than once a month in November 2015. On the basis of these facts, we cannot infer hyperbole regarding B.P.'s condition. As established above, B.P. underwent regular counseling for two-and-a-half years and was taking Paxil, then Zoloft, as late as 2017. We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting the JNOV as to B.P.'s damage award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Was the trial court's award on JNOV abusively high?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [B]efore a Court of Appeal can disturb an award made by a trial court that the record must clearly reveal that the trier of fact abused its discretion in making its award.

School board policy established that a coach was to occupy a seat separating the boys' team from the girls', but the coach was not sitting there; rather, the coach was seated in the front of the bus. The school board complained that the trial court refused to assess the fault of the five boys and the girl, whose participation was allegedly consensual.

The award of $ 500,000.00 to B.P. for general damages is abusively high, and we amend the trial court's award to $ 200,000.00, the highest amount within the trial court's discretion. The trial court did not err in granting the Pikes' JNOV on the failure of the jury to award them damages for loss of consortium. That grant of JNOV and the damage award to the Pikes individually is affirmed. The award to B.P. for future treatment must be placed into a reversionary trust, and we remand the matter to the trial court for the creation of a reversionary trust, and modify the trial court's judgment to exempt those funds from accruing judicial interest. The trial court did not err in mandating that B.P.'s general damage award be placed into an investment vehicle described in La.Code Civ.P. art. 4521. The trial court also correctly granted JNOV on the allocation of fault. Costs of this appeal in the amount of $ 12,839.00 are taxed equally between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, AS AMENDED, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   CONERY, Judge, concurs in part and dissents in part and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Conery, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I join in the majority's determination that this matter must be remanded with instructions to place the award for future medical treatment in a reversionary trust pursuant to La.R.S. 13:5106.

While the majority suggests that Article 1811 provides a trial court with latitude to render a JNOV, reference to the Article merely indicates that \"[i]f a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or render a [JNOV].\" It does not provide the standard by which the trial court may do so. Rather, jurisprudence supplies that standard as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [A] JNOV is warranted when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the trial court believes that reasonable persons could not arrive at a contrary verdict. The motion should be granted only when the evidence points so strongly in favor of the moving party that reasonable persons could not reach different conclusions, not merely when there is a preponderance of evidence for the mover. The motion should be denied if there is evidence opposed to the motion which is of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions. In making this determination, the trial court should not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, and all reasonable inferences or factual questions should be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.

The jury did not award damages for mental pain and anguish, permanent disability, future medical expenses, or future loss of earning capacity. The assessment of \"quantum,\" or the appropriate amount of damages, by a jury is a determination of fact that is entitled to great deference on review.\n   <em>\n    Wainwright v.

A thorough review of the record in this case indicates the jury's awards were reasonable in light of the evidence presented. The jury obviously believed plaintiff sustained some damages as a result of the fall as it awarded her a significant amount of damages for physical pain and suffering and for her past medical expenses. The jury's failure to assess damages for mental pain and anguish, permanent disability, future medical expenses, and future loss of earning capacity indicates they might not have believed plaintiff's injury was as severe or as persistent as she contended. It is probable the jury did not believe that her injury was the reason she was not chosen for a gastroenterology fellowship. Additionally, the fact that the jury did not award damages for future medical expenses leads us to believe that the jury determined plaintiff was not in need of future medical care for symptoms related to the injuries she sustained in the fall. The record contained conflicting evidence related to the extent of plaintiff's injury, pain, and physical limitations. Plaintiff's credibility was challenged by defense witnesses. In light of the conflicting nature of the evidence presented at trial, we cannot say that the jury's verdict was unreasonable. Stated differently, we find that based on the evidence presented in this case, reasonable minds could differ on the assessment of damages. The amounts awarded by the jury were well within its vast discretion. Therefore, we find the district court erred in granting a JNOV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   It further remarked that \"[t]he rigorous standard of JNOV is based upon the principle that 'when there is a jury, the jury is the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 537 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170451\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/772/94/\">\n    772 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The supreme court held similarly in\n   <em>\n    VaSalle v.

The supreme court reversed the trial and appellate court rulings, explaining that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   At the close of trial, the jury awarded plaintiffs a total of $ 70,000 in damages. This award included $ 15,00[0] in past medical expenses, $ 20,000 in future medical expenses, $ 25,000 in past, present, and future mental and physical pain and suffering, and $ 10,000 in future loss of earning capacity. The jury made no award for permanent disability or\n   loss of consortium for Mr. VaSalle. After considering the record in its entirety, we find these awards were reasonable based on the evidence presented. It is apparent the jury believed Ms. VaSalle sustained some damages as a result of the Wal-Mart accident. However, the jury's awards indicate it is possible the jury found Wal-Mart was not the sole cause of Ms. VaSalle's back problems and resultant medical bills. Such a conclusion is reasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial. After weighing the totality of the evidence, we conclude that reasonable, fair-minded jurors could have arrived at differing damage awards. Plaintiff did not seek immediate treatment for her injuries and had been involved in two previous accidents in which her back was injured. Plaintiff continued to work as a house cleaner after the accident and, in fact, admitted she worked even more following the accident than before it. Plaintiff's credibility was seriously challenged and called into question by defendants. The experts disagreed on the extent of plaintiff's injuries and her need for surgery. Dr. Bernauer did not find any objective evidence of plaintiff's complaints at her first visit and diagnosed only muscle strain. Thus, based upon the evidence presented at trial, we cannot say the jury's verdict was unreasonable. Therefore, the district court erred in granting a JNOV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455708\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/801/331/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9455708\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/801/331/\">\n    at 341-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The plaintiffs contend that the child's difficulties were either different in nature or did not arise until after the bus incidents. The parents further related the bus incidents to the child's disruptive behavior both at home and in the school room, necessitating a change in school and in counseling. They claimed that the bus incidents led to the child's emotional issues such as anger, feelings of isolation, and thoughts of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   However, the jury heard testimony regarding the plaintiffs' child's behavioral problems that long predated the subject bus conduct. For instance, during the child's preceding kindergarten year, school records indicated that he was reported for having pulled down his pants, exposing himself on the school bus. Other displays of sexual behavior during that time frame were attributed to learned behaviors from either a cousin or television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   And, in the weeks before the school bus incidents, the child's teacher reported classroom difficulties leading to repeated conversations between the school and the plaintiffs about that behavior. The teacher's notes, introduced into evidence, indicate that the teacher reported \"negative behavior\" both in the classroom and during \"unstructured times like walking to and from places, lunch, etc.\" A telephone conference with the child's mother was held on August 21, 2013 in that regard. An additional note by the teacher indicated that the child's \"most frequent display of negative behavior is his attitude - shrugging shoulders, slamming himself down in his desk when disciplined ..., smacking his lips - - being disrespectful to the teacher.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The note indicates that due to \"bathroom trouble every time he goes to the bathroom,\" the plaintiffs' child was required to \"[go] to the restroom by himself.\" The note did not explain what the \"bathroom trouble\" was, nor could the teacher recall the details of that incident in her testimony at court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   When the teacher's notes were forwarded to the school's assistant principal, he commemorated on a copy of the corresponding email, which was introduced in evidence, that he had informed the \"parent\" by telephone that the child had been in his office due to \"classroom disruption.\" He described the mother as \"very supportive\" and that the child was being taken to a counselor the following week \"because he has been exhibiting the same behaviors at home.\" Finally, during a September 24, 2013 conference, a date immediately preceding the events at issue, the teacher reported that the \"negative behavior\" continued and that the child's mother explained that an \"outside counselor\" had \"suggested having him tested for AD(H)D[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The jury was further informed by the bus driver that the child had displayed disruptive behavior on the bus before the incidents in question, along with the other two boys involved in this incident. The disruptive behavior resulted in the driver's placement of the boys in the designated seating where the sexual conduct at issue subsequently occurred. The previous school year, the bus driver completed a \"Behavior Report,\" describing that the child was \"throwing things on bus and giving the bird to several others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Similarly, Rachel Hinton, a licensed professional counselor, testified that the child began treatment with her prior to the bus incident. She told the jury that, on September 6, 2013, a date almost three weeks prior to the subject conduct, the plaintiffs related concerns that the child \"seems very angry, yelling at mom, mad, blames, if he messes up, he thinks it ruins his whole day or his whole day is shot, kind of shuts down. If at first it doesn't go well, he's shutting down, concerns with when he gets upset, kind of melts down.\" According to Ms. Hinton, the mother reported that she had noticed this behavior for approximately six months. That testimony, coupled with school records, testimony by school officials, and the evidence in the record undermined the plaintiffs' claim of a sudden change in the child's emotional wellbeing due to the sexual conduct on the bus, and their claim that the resulting damages were fully attributable to the sexual conduct on the bus during the two-week period in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Given that factual overlay of the child's varied behavioral problems, the jury acted well within its discretion in concluding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the conduct at issue caused the totality of the claimed damages. Rather, the counselor who began seeing the child after the incident in question, Ray Melerin, acknowledged that isolation of the school bus event as a causative factor to subsequent problems was \"just difficult.\" Mr. Melerin explained that he was not provided with full information regarding the child's preexisting problems and that he was treating the child's symptoms, regardless of the causation. When asked whether some of that background information would \"have been nice to have had\" in addressing the causation questioned posed, he responded: \"Possibly. I would definitely have wanted to learn more information about what took place back then.\" Mr. Melerin further explained to the jury that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   [P]lease - - please understand, my job is not necessarily about determining that, you know. So when I have a child in my office and we're dealing with - - we're\n   not thinking - - I'm not trying to put a percentage to things. It's just not how, you know, we naturally operate, but ... being asked to do that right now, I'm trying, and there - - there are just too many variables involved. And all - - you know, all I can say about it is that I think it's quite possible that there is a level of degree that has affected him that no one will ever know for sure. There's no measuring tool for that, but - - but there's a real possibility that it has.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In the least, the jury was informed of preexisting, documented behaviors supportive of a finding that the child suffered from a continuum of emotional difficulties that long predated the sexual conduct at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   It is within that context of complex causative background that the jury received the case, undermining the plaintiffs' contention in its motion for JNOV that greater damages were required. To the extent the jury's assessment of damages was based on credibility determinations of the witnesses' testimony, plaintiffs' testimony, that of their experts, or the jury's review of all the evidence, those determinations are inappropriately re-evaluated within the JNOV context.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170451\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/772/94/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They instead must remain within the jury's province.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The record similarly supports the jury's rejection of the plaintiffs' claim for loss of consortium, whether due to issues related to evidence of causation or those related to credibility of their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The remaining issue, the JNOV as it related to liability upon application of La.Civ.Code art. 2320, is a legal one, although the trial court addressed it within its consideration of the motion for JNOV. Whether by operation of La.Civ.Code art. 2320 or by La.R.S. 9:3921, the School Board is liable for the conduct of its own employee. And, in fact, the jury found it was liable in that regard, assessing it with 50% of the fault. Neither the School Board's own negligence nor that apportionment is contested in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As for the jury's apportionment of the remainder of fault, the record is clear that the ten (10) year old did, in fact, molest the plaintiffs' child during that approximate two week period while the children were on the bus. Plaintiffs' counsel made a calculated decision not to name the parents of that child as a joint tortfeasor, hoping that the jury would ascribe 100% fault to the School Board. The judge appropriately charged the jury and submitted a jury interrogatory allowing the jury to apportion fault between the School Board and the intentional ten year old tortfeasor who, admittedly, sexually molested the plaintiffs' son. That charge and resulting jury interrogatory were in keeping with the dictates of La.Civ.Code art. 2323(B), which provides that the principle of comparative fault \"shall apply to any claim for recovery of damages for injury, death, or loss asserted under any law or legal doctrine or theory of liability, regardless of the basis of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dumas v.

In my opinion, this was error and a departure from the plain language of Article 2320.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As pointed out by counsel for the School Board, the supreme court has explained that Article 2320 \"is not a true 'vicarious liability' statute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Wallmuth v.

Although the bus driver may have been an employee, he was not a\n   <em>\n    teacher\n   </em>\n   so as to implicate the wording of La.Civ.Code art. 2320 and shift the fault of the intentional tortfeasor student to the \"teacher\" and School Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   It is on this latter basis that the case cited by the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Significantly, in that second circuit case, a school board was found liable under La.Civ.Code art. 2320 for the intentional tort of a student on a fellow student when the supervision was by a coach. While not explicitly stated in\n   <em>\n    Doe v. DeSoto Parish School Board\n   </em>\n   , the court seemingly equated the position of coach as one of \"teacher\" for purposes of the Article. It is clear, however, that the case did not involve a bus driver as here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8434238,8434293,8434406,8434343\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/167/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   More persuasive is the factually similar matter of\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

East Baton Rouge Parish School Board\n   </em>\n   , 978 So.2d at 435-36 (footnotes omitted), explained further that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   [A]fter an analysis of the terms of LSA-C.C. art. 2320, we find that the School Board is not vicariously liable for the actions of H.B. under the facts and circumstances of this case. As noted previously, the relevant portion of Article 2320 arguably imposes liability on teachers for the damage caused by their students while under their supervision. The plaintiff's argument for imposing vicarious liability on the School Board for the fault of H.B. apparently is based upon an interpretation of Article 2320 that would impose the same liability as that of teachers on school bus drivers in their capacities as employees of the School Board. We disagree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   The starting point for the interpretation of any codal article is the language of the article itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burnette v. Stalder,\n   </em>\n   00-2167 (La.6/29/01),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11086877\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/789/573/#p577\">\n    789 So.2d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577. Generally, courts begin such an interpretation with the premise that legislation is the solemn expression of legislative will, and that the interpretation of a law involves a search for the legislature's intent. LSA-C.C. art. 1 ;\n   <em>\n    Falgout v. Dealers Truck Equipment Co.,\n   </em>\n   98-3150 (La.10/19/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11495337,11495263\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/748/399/\">\n    748 So.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401. When a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences, the law shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made in search of the intent of the legislature. LSA-C.C. art. 9. Moreover, the words of a law must be given their generally prevailing meaning. LSA-C.C. art. 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   In light of these principles, we note that by its relevant terms, LSA-C.C. art. 2320 discusses the liability of teachers. Clearly, Ms. Hunt was employed as a bus driver and not as a teacher as that term is commonly understood. In addition, we note that\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Wallmuth\n   </em>\n   all involve incidents that occurred while the students were under the immediate supervision of teachers, not bus drivers. Accordingly, we find that the School Board is not vicariously liable for the fault of H.B. under the facts and circumstances of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Like the first circuit case, the supervising employee in this case was not a teacher, but a bus driver. That status places the present matter outside of that addressed by the legislature in its clear, unambiguous use of the term \"teacher\" in crafting Article 2320. Simply, the inclusion of this non-teacher employee within the category defined by that specific term is contrary to the supreme court's directive to strictly construe vicarious liability provisions. Accordingly, I find that the trial court's shifting of the fault of the intentional tortfeasor\n   student to the School Board pursuant to Article 2320 was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Likewise, the majority, in my view, is in error in its application of Article 2320. For these reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part. Although I join in the majority's remand to the trial court with instructions to create a reversionary trust for the award of future medical treatment and to amend the judgment to reflect that those damages will not accrue judicial interest, I dissent from the remainder of the opinion. I would instead reverse the JNOV in its entirety upon a finding that the trial court erred in granting a JNOV as to damages as well as in its determination regarding vicarious liability, and I would re-instate the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In accordance with La.R.S. 46:1844(W), the initials of the minors involved in this case are substituted for their names to preserve confidentiality.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Louisiana Civil Code Article 2318 reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    The father and the mother are responsible for the damage occasioned by their minor child, who resides with them or who has been placed by them under the care of other persons, reserving to them recourse against those persons.
