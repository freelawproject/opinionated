Because we determine that the sales were subject to the sales tax, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Patrick Lee Downing was the sole member of Downing Enterprises, LLC (\"the LLC\"), a business that sold, among other products, prepaid authorization numbers allowing access to wireless services on cellular telephones. On December 28, 2011, the Department sent Downing a final assessment of taxes against him, addressing Downing as \"the sole member of Downing Enterprises, LLC, a disregarded entity.\" The final assessment stated that Downing owed $18,617.86 in taxes plus interest for the sales of the prepaid authorization numbers from September 1, 2008, through June 30, 2011. On August 24, 2013, a petition for a refund was filed with the Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the petition, the petitioner's legal name is listed as \"Patrick Lee Downing,\" and the entity that Downing was \"doing business as\" is listed as \"Downing Enterprises, LLC.\" The Department denied the petition for a refund in a letter addressed to the LLC and its counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The LLC appealed the denial of a refund to the Department's Administrative Law Division. See \u00a7 40-2A-7(c), Ala. Code 1975; \u00a7 40-2B-2(g)(2)(a), Ala. Code 1975. The LLC argued that the Department based its tax assessment on statutory provisions that were unconstitutional. The recently created Alabama Tax Tribunal (\"the Tax Tribunal\") heard the appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 2, 2015, the Tax Tribunal entered a final order affirming the denial of the request for a refund based on \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13), Ala. Code 1975, as amended by Act No. 2014-336, Ala. Acts 2014 (\"the 2014 Act\"), effective July 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its order, the Tax\n   Tribunal referred to the LLC as the taxpayer and stated that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutional challenges but that those challenges could be pursued in an appeal to the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 19, 2015, Downing, as \"the sole member of Downing Enterprises, LLC, a disregarded entity,\" filed an appeal of the Tax Tribunal's final order to the circuit court, arguing that the 2014 Act did not have retroactive effect and raising constitutional challenges to \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13) and the 2014 Act. On September 5, 2017, the circuit court conducted a trial. At the trial, Downing testified that he had sold prepaid authorization numbers to access wireless services on cellular telephones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 14, 2017, the circuit court entered a judgment in favor of Downing, ordering the Department to reimburse him for the amount he had paid in response to the final tax assessment. In the judgment, the circuit court found that the sales of prepaid authorization numbers were not subject to the sales tax at the time that those sales were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 26, 2017, the Department filed a notice of appeal to this court. Downing did not file an appellee's brief on appeal. This court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-3-10, Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This court requested that the parties submit letter briefs addressing any jurisdictional issues resulting from the discrepancy in the filings made by Downing as an individual and the filings made by his business, the LLC, in the underlying proceedings.

We conclude that, even if Downing had not paid the full amount of the final assessment against him before filing his petition for a refund, that issue did not deprive the Tax Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the denial of the petition for a refund.

The sales that were the subject of the Department's final assessment occurred between September 1, 2008, and June 30, 2011. In Act No. 97-867, Ala. Acts 1997 (\"the 1997 Act\"), the legislature amended \u00a7 40-23-1 to add \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13). Although \u00a7 40-23-1 was amended in 1999, 2006, and 2013, \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13) was not amended until the 2014 Act was enacted. Therefore, at the time that the applicable sales occurred, \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13) provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"A sale of a prepaid telephone calling card or a prepaid authorization number, or both, shall be deemed the sale of tangible personal property subject to the tax imposed on the sale of tangible personal property pursuant to this chapter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its argument, the Department notes that the 1997 Act also amended \u00a7 40-21-122, Ala. Code 1975, to add \u00a7 40-21-122(4). Section 40-21-122 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"There are hereby specifically excluded from the gross receipts or gross sales of a cellular provider, upon which the tax herein levied is calculated, all portions thereof derived from the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"(1) The furnishings of cellular services which the State of Alabama is prohibited from taxing under the Constitution or laws of the United States of America or the Constitution of Alabama of 1901;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"(2) The furnishing of cellular services which are otherwise taxed under the provisions of Sections 40-23-1 through 40-23-36 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"(3) Wholesale sales; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \"(4) The furnishing of cellular telecommunications service through the use of a prepaid telephone calling card, a prepaid authorization number, or both.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, in the 1997 Act, the legislature added a tax, codified in \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13), to the sales of prepaid telephone calling cards and prepaid authorization numbers, and, in the same act, excluded the gross sales of such items from the taxation scheme provided in \u00a7 40-21-120 through \u00a7 40-21-126. We therefore conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13) to provide for taxation on sales of prepaid telephone cards and prepaid\n   authorization numbers providing cellular telecommunication services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At trial, Downing testified that the LLC sold prepaid authorization numbers for wireless services on cellular telephones. \"Wireless\" is defined as \"telecommunication (as radiotelegraphy or radio-telephony) involving signals transmitted by radio waves rather than over wires.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1437 (11th ed. 2003). Accordingly, wireless service on a cellular telephone does not appear to be distinguishable from \"cellular telecommunications service\" for the purpose of assessing taxation pursuant to \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13). Therefore, the LLC's sales of prepaid authorization numbers were subject to taxation pursuant to \u00a7 40-23-1(a)(13), as that provision existed at the time the applicable sales occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the circuit court's judgment ordering the Department to provide Downing a refund for the taxes he paid pursuant to the Department's final assessment, and we remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. We pretermit discussion of the Department's other arguments, including those regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 40-23-1 and the 2014 Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moore, J., concurs in the result, without writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thomas, J., recuses herself.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Department claims that Downing had not fully paid the amount in the final assessment before the petition for a refund was filed, but the Department mentions that the issue was not raised before the Alabama Tax Tribunal or the circuit court.
