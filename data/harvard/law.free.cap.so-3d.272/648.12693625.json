For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record indicates that on August 18, 2017, Jimmy Morris and Carol Morris, as the plaintiffs, filed a verified complaint in the trial court seeking a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction against defendants Turner Brock and Linda Brock to prevent the Brocks from building a dock in a certain location and to compel them to build the dock pursuant to a compromise allegedly reached between Jimmy Morris and Turner Brock. In the complaint, the Morrises asserted that they were married and jointly owned property on Lakeview Street in Abbeville (\"the Morris property\"). They alleged that the Brocks were married and jointly owned the property contiguous with the Morris property on Lakeview Street (\"the Brock property\"). Both Jimmy Morris and Carol Morris executed the verified complaint. Also on August 18, 2017, the Morrises filed a motion for a preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 65, Ala. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 30, 2017, the Morrises filed an amended complaint adding a paragraph to the original complaint regarding the trial court's jurisdiction over the matter. On September 15, 2017, both Turner Brock and Linda Brock answered the Morrises' complaint. In the answer, the Brocks admitted that they were married and jointly owned the Brock property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The summonses that were served with the complaint and with the amended complaint were in Turner Brock's name only. No summons for Linda Brock is included in the record. Rule 4(a)(1), Ala. R. Civ. P., states that, \"[u]pon the filing of the complaint, ... the clerk shall forthwith issue the required summons or other process for service\n   <em>\n    upon each defendant\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) It is the plaintiff's duty to furnish the clerk with sufficient copies of the complaint to be served. Rule 4(a)(3), Ala. R. Civ. P. That rule further provides that copies are not required if the complaint is filed electronically. The State Judicial Information System (\"SJIS\") indicates that the complaint in this case was filed electronically. The rule also provides that the plaintiff shall furnish the clerk with instructions for service of the complaint, \"and, when requested by the clerk, the plaintiff shall also furnish sufficient properly completed copies of the summons or other process.\" Rule 4(a)(5), Ala. R. Civ. P. We note that the SJIS case-action summary does not indicate that Carol Morris is a plaintiff in this action or that Linda Brock is a defendant. Furthermore, Carol Morris testified at the trial, as did Jimmy Morris and Turner Brock. Linda Brock did not testify, and we cannot discern from the record whether she attended the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There is nothing in the record to indicate that Carol Morris dismissed her claims against the Brocks. In the trial court, Linda Brock did not challenge the insufficient or improper service of process at any time during the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"An argument as to insufficient or improper service of process may be waived if it is not raised in a motion to dismiss or in the first responsive pleading or a proper amendment thereto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 12(h)(1), Ala.
