We find the circuit court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction, so we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. After pleading guilty to aggravated assault and kidnapping charges in 2008, Montalto was sentenced to serve twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) followed by five years of supervised probation. The kidnapping offense involved a young child, so he was also ordered to register as a sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. Because Montalto pled guilty, he did not directly appeal his conviction and sentence. Montalto later filed two PCR motions, which the circuit court dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Montalto v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004388\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/1087/#p1089\">\n    119 So.3d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1089 (\u00b61) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013). Montalto appealed both dismissals, asserting (1) that his due-process rights were violated and (2) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004388\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/1087/#p1089\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004388\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/1087/#p1089\">\n    at 1092-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b69). This Court found Montalto's claims lacked merit and affirmed the circuit court's dismissals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004388\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/1087/#p1089\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004388\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/1087/#p1089\">\n    at 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b626).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. The record indicates that while incarcerated, Montalto served in several jobs as a \"trusty\" and took advantage of self-improvement opportunities offered by MDOC, such that MDOC allowed him to earn credit toward his twenty-year sentence. On December 20, 2014, MDOC released Montalto from incarceration and placed him on earned-release supervision (ERS).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of this process, Montalto\n   registered as a sex offender as previously ordered by the sentencing court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Approximately three weeks after Montalto's release, a field officer filed a Rule Violation Report (RVR) with MDOC asserting Montalto's residence did not meet the sex offender registration requirements. Following an administrative hearing on the RVR, MDOC revoked Montalto's ERS for failure to abide by ERS conditions. Montalto was reclassified and returned to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66. Montalto appealed the ERS revocation through MDOC's administrative remedy program (ARP). On March 17, 2015, MDOC noted that Montalto's \"[f]ailure to complete the conditions of ERS ha[d] been investigated\" and concluded that because his kidnapping conviction was statutorily classified as a sex offense, he had actually never been eligible for ERS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, MDOC denied Montalto's appeal and request for ERS reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67. In April 2015, Montalto filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court and claimed his revocation and reclassification were unlawful. The federal court dismissed the writ due to Montalto's failure to exhaust his state court remedies.\n   <em>\n    Montalto v. Miss. Dep't of Corrections\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-00457-CWR-FKB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204340273\">\n    2017 WL 4340273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 29, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68. In December 2017, Montalto filed an application for leave with the supreme court in an effort to proceed with a third motion for PCR in circuit court based on MDOC's administrative actions. Prior to receiving an order from the supreme court, Montalto filed a motion for PCR in the Rankin County Circuit Court, asserting (1) unlawful revocation of ERS, (2) unlawful revocation of earned time, and (3) unilateral changing of his charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69. On April 27, 2018, the circuit court found it lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-39-7 (Rev. 2015) and dismissed Montalto's third motion for PCR. Specifically, the circuit court found that Montalto's \"conviction and sentence [were] affirmed by the Mississippi Court of Appeals\" and that Montalto had \"failed to obtain the necessary order from the Mississippi Supreme Court allowing him to file a motion for post-conviction relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610. A few days later, the supreme court found Montalto's application for leave was not properly before it, noting \"Montalto was convicted by way of a guilty plea and there has never been a direct appeal of his conviction and sentence.\" The supreme court dismissed the application \"without prejudice to be filed in the [circuit] court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611. Montalto now appeals the circuit court's dismissal of his third motion for PCR, asserting the circuit court \"erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction and dismissing [his motion for PCR that] he had filed contesting his ... ERS revocation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612.

Ct. App. 2015). Questions of law are reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6840029\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/180/767/#p769\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613. The circuit court dismissed Montalto's motion for PCR for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to section 99-39-7. Section 99-39-7 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The motion under this article\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be filed as an original civil action in the\n   <em>\n    trial court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   in cases in which the petitioner's conviction and sentence have been appealed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi and there affirmed or the appeal dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Where the conviction and sentence have been affirmed on appeal or the appeal has been dismissed\n   </em>\n   , the motion under this article shall not be filed in the trial court until the motion shall have first been presented to a quorum of the Justices of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, convened for said purpose either in termtime or in vacation, and an order granted allowing the filing of such motion in the trial court. The procedure governing applications to the Supreme Court for leave to file a motion under this article shall be as provided in Section 99-39-27.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added). As the supreme court pointed out in its order on Montalto's application for leave, albeit after the circuit court dismissed Montalto's PCR motion, \"Montalto was convicted by way of a guilty plea and there has never been a direct appeal of his conviction and sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614. Given that Montalto never directly appealed his conviction and sentence, he was not required to seek leave from the supreme court before filing his PCR motion. The circuit court thus erred in dismissing Montalto's PCR motion for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to section 99-39-7. The circuit court has exclusive original jurisdiction to consider the merits of Montalto's PCR motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

While I acknowledge that we must follow applicable precedent in reversing the circuit court's jurisdictional ruling, all this does is delay the inevitable. Under precedent it is clear that Mr. Montalto was never legally eligible for earned-release supervision (ERS).

After examining the conduct by the State, the district court concluded it was \"alarmed by the facts of this case and distressed with the practices at MDOC and the Attorney General's Office uncovered during these proceedings and which\n   may never have been exposed but for Montalto asserting that he had been deprived due process and the filing of his motions for contempt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

The district court was greatly troubled by this behavior and concerned with \"[t]he nonchalance with which the State adopted false positions\" because this \"highlights the philosophy all too often shown by MDOC and the Attorney General's Office: ensuring just convictions obtained through just means is not a priority, or even a consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The district court recognized the difficulty of defending against the heavy amounts of habeas cases, and that \"prisoners file many, many specious and meritless petitions, and those who have the duty to respond may become jaded.\" The district court warned that \"[b]eing jaded is one thing, but refusing to comply with directives from the court is something which cannot be excused regardless of the validity of any defenses to the claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court advised the attorneys for the State to revisit the Lawyer's Creed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8 n.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624. Regarding the merits of the case, the district court could not see how MDOC's mock \"hearings\" revoking the ERS of the defendant \"satisfy due process considerations,\" since \"[t]here is no way to verify the contents of proceedings or that they even take place at all, because recordings apparently are not maintained and readily abandoned.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. \"And even if the contents were knowable, they do not affect the hearing officer's determination, as [the MDOC officer] testified that she was instructed by MDOC executives to find Montalto guilty before she heard any evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court concluded: \"This admission is more than troubling; it is a betrayal of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the district court declined to impose monetary sanctions on the State, and dismissed the defendant's claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies-where he then made his way to our Court of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625. Before this Court, and despite this ruling by a federal district court, the State dug its heels in again. The State asserted in its brief that \"Montalto was given a proper hearing for both his RVR and his re-classification, [and] his due process was protected ....\" In light of the district court's ruling, and the uncontested facts and procedural posture of this case, I find the State's position statement beggars belief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626. My colleague Judge Lawrence has recently written that \"[t]he entire fundamental foundation of the criminal justice system is that the innocent should suffer no harm under our law and that guilty persons should be held accountable for their illegal acts upon a constitutional and legal investigation and trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Foster v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2017-KA-01466-COA, --- So.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201349723\">\n    2019 WL 1349723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\u00b617) (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2019) (Lawrence, J., specially concurring). I would add to this lofty statement that once convicted, we should continue to treat those incarcerated or recently released with dignity and accord them due process as the law requires. As the district court wrote, \"No person is stripped of all of his dignity or his right to due process upon incarceration.\"\n   <em>\n    Montalto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204340273\">\n    2017 WL 4340273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627. The better path is one where the State genuinely grapples with the claims made by a petitioner, which will allow our Court to understand the real issues and resolve the dispute placed before us. This will allow all those seeking redress before\n   our court system to have a fuller measure of justice and not one plagued by obstruction or delay.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    At the time of Montalto's plea, \"sex offense\" was defined in subsection (g)(i). The Mississippi Legislature subsequently amended section 45-33-23, and the definition of \"sex offense\" is now found in subsection (h)(i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
