C.C.P. art. 1920. Further, this amount was imposed after the defendant had already advanced in excess of $ 100,000 to the special master. Under the circumstances of this case, in which causation and damages have yet to be determined, I consider this amount excessive and violative of the reasonableness requirement of R.S. 13:4165(D).\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
