Code 1975. During the penalty phase of Russell's trial, the jury, by a vote of 8 to 4, recommended that Russell be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving a presentence-investigation report and conducting a sentencing hearing, the circuit court overrode the jury's recommendation, finding that the aggravating circumstances \"far outweigh[ed]\" the mitigating circumstances, and sentenced Russell to death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Russell filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial court denied. This appeal, which is automatic in a case involving the death penalty, followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-53, Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The evidence at trial established the following: At approximately 10:30 A.M. on August 24, 2011, Russell visited Darrell Dorsey at Dorsey's mother's house on Moore Street in Anniston. Dorsey and Russell had a brief conversation, and while they were speaking Dorsey noticed Russell was carrying a gun on his hip. Russell left and went to a house at the corner of Moore Avenue and 19th Street around 11:00 A.M. Russell spoke to the people sitting on the front porch, and, as he walked away from the house, Officer Sollohub pulled up in his patrol car and stopped Russell. Officer Sollohub put out a call on his radio that he was \"out with a black male\" at Moore Avenue and 19th Street. Officer William Bostick heard Officer Sollohub's radio call and responded to that location. Officer Sollohub was conducting a pat-down search of Russell when Officer Bostick arrived. As Officer Bostick approached Russell and Officer Sollohub, Russell said to Officer Bostick, \"I know you, don't I?,\" to which Officer Bostick replied, \"Yes, you do.\" At that point, Russell \"took off running,\" and Officer Sollohub followed Russell on foot. Officer Sollohub put out a call that he was in a foot pursuit of a black male. After hearing the call, several officers made their way to Officer Sollohub's general location to provide assistance. Officer Bostick returned to his patrol car to pursue Russell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Sollohub chased Russell down an alleyway and into the backyard of a nearby residence where Karen Mason and her son, Justin Beard,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were washing a car. While in the backyard, Russell pulled out a gun and shot Officer Sollohub once in the head. Russell then fled the scene and attempted to enter a house on McCoy Avenue where Margaret Gilley and her daughter, Tyler, resided. Gilley told Russell that he could not come into the house, so Russell ran into a vacant house across the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Investigators Justin Hartley and Kyle Price of the Anniston Police Department (\"APD\") arrived at the scene of the shooting, Beard was standing in the alleyway behind the backyard where Officer Sollohub had been shot, frantically pointing toward the house. Officer Sollohub was lying on the ground motionless and unresponsive, and his firearm remained in its holster. Emergency medical personnel transported Officer Sollohub to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (\"UAB\") Hospital,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   where he later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After arriving at the scene of the shooting, Officer Bostick was ordered \"to go out\n   and get the guy\" who shot Officer Sollohub. Officer Bostick began driving around the neighborhood, and, while driving on 20th Street, Officer Bostick saw Russell run out of and back into a nearby wooded area. Shortly thereafter, officers created a perimeter around the wooded area where Officer Bostick had last seen Russell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After he fled the scene, Russell telephoned Shandrika Dotson and asked her if she had heard what happened. Dotson responded that she heard that Russell had shot a police officer. Russell replied \"sort of, kind of\" and then hung up. Russell also called his sister, Cheryl Bush. Russell told Bush that he was scared because someone was chasing him, and he asked her to come get him. Bush then went to her and Russell's father's apartment, where police officers subsequently appeared and asked Bush to contact Russell. Bush attempted-unsuccessfully-to persuade Russell to turn himself in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Investigator David Cash, the district attorney's investigator assigned to the Calhoun-Cleburne drug and violent-crime task force, participated in the search for Russell. Investigator Cash testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Investigator NeSmith and [I] were walking the fence line. We saw what we believed to be a body lying against the edge of the fence. We started giving loud verbal commands to show hands, so he got up and ran. We gave chase through the wood line, and he was apprehended just down from where he had ran.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (R. 1116-17.) After Russell was apprehended, Investigator Cash discovered the firearm-a .22 caliber Taurus brand pistol-used to shoot Officer Sollohub lying \"approximately 10 feet out of reach from where [Russell] was taken into custody.\" The thumb safety on the pistol was on when it was discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Russell was transported to the Anniston City jail, where he gave a video-recorded statement to Sgt. Chris Sparks and Investigator Tom Suits of the APD. The State played for the jury a redacted version of Russell's statement, which is summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Russell had left a friend's house and was walking down the street when Officer Sollohub stopped him and asked him if he knew a particular person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Russell did not know why Officer Sollohub stopped him, but Officer Sollohub asked Russell for his identification and began conducting a pat-down search. Russell explained that when Officer Sollohub stopped him he had outstanding warrants and that the gun, a .22 caliber Taurus brand pistol, was stolen. Russell stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"I just take off running, I run down the street, I running around the house, he run around the house. You know, I had a gun, know what I'm saying, I ain't, I just held it up. I was goin' scare his ass, but, like, by the time I held it up and he came around the corner, like, it like, he grabbed and I jerked, and he just got hit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (State's Exhibit No. 29.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Sgt. Sparks told Russell that he did not believe that Officer Sollohub had grabbed the gun, to which Russell replied that Officer Sollohub \"turned the corner and I held the gun up at the same time\" and that Officer Sollohub \"was trying to brace himself.\" Russell stated: \"I didn't think he was that close on me, I thought he was still coming around from the other side .... I was just goin' scare him.\" Russell explained that his reasoning behind scaring Officer Sollohub with the gun stemmed from an earlier incident in which he pointed a cellular telephone at a police officer as if\n   the telephone was a gun. Russell stated: \"I seen the way he reacted so I just figured maybe if I do [Officer Sollohub] the same way, this'll make him run on and I can go about my business.\" Russell could not recall whether Officer Sollohub had his firearm drawn during the chase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   After Russell shot Officer Sollohub, he picked the gun up off the ground before running across the street and hiding in a field, where he was apprehended approximately seven hours later. While Russell was hiding, he could see the officers searching for him; Russell stated that he \"started to shoot some more but I didn't.\" Russell further stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"I really coulda got away for real.... I was running away and I turned around to look at [Officer Sollohub]. I hesitated, I started to run back to him, and I was like, 'Fuck that, hell nah. I be a damn fool.' But I kind paused for a minute. I was debating should I keep going or should I go back and help his ass .... I don't want nobody to die.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (State's Exhibit No. 29.) Russell apologized \"for what happened\" and stated, \"I was wrong but at the same time, [Officer Sollohub] knows what he did.\" When asked to elaborate, Russell said, \"He knows how it all went down. I can't really explain. It would take both of us to explain but he knows how it went down, though he's in the hospital, wherever he at .... He asked me my information, I gave it to him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Investigator Mark Osburn of the APD crime-scene unit collected a spent cartridge casing from the scene of the shooting, and he collected the pistol and Russell's cellular telephone from where Russell was apprehended. Investigator Osburn forwarded the pistol and the cartridge casing to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences (\"ADFS\"), and he forwarded the cellular telephone to the U.S. Secret Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Emily Ward, a state medical examiner for the ADFS,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducted an autopsy on Officer Sollohub's body. Dr. Ward testified that Officer Sollohub died as a result of the gunshot wound to his head and that the gun was \"probably no more than three inches away when the trigger was pulled. Maybe four, but less than six absolutely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Derrick Headley, a forensic scientist for the firearm and tool-mark section of the ADFS, examined the Taurus pistol and the fired .22 caliber cartridge casing. Headley explained that the pistol has three types of safeties-a thumb safety that blocks the trigger from being pulled and blocks the slide from functioning; a magazine safety that prevents the gun from firing if the magazine is not inserted; and an internal safety that disconnects the sear from the hammer so that the user must pull the trigger each time he fires the gun. Headley stated that the user \"has to actively do something to disallow [the thumb and magazine] safeties to work\" and that the Taurus has a nine-pound trigger pull. Headley testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"A. ... [T]o give you an idea about how much pound-one thing is hard to figure out how much nine pounds would be. If you've ever picked up a gallon of milk or a gallon of water with your finger, with just one finger, a gallon of water weighs approximately eight pounds. So with a gun with a nine pound trigger pull, it will take little more force than what it will take for you to pick up a gallon of water to pull that trigger back to make it go off.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Q. You take this gun, one in the chamber, safety off, magazine in place, in your hands?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A. Something would have had to pull back nine pounds worth of the pressure on the trigger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Q. With my hitting the gun, grabbing the gun, have made that gun go off?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"A. I would not expect it to, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Q. Would my hitting your arm, grabbing your arm, have made that gun go off?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"A. I wouldn't expect it, but I can't say that it can't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Q. Ultimately, somebody is going to have to put one pound more than a gallon of water's pressure right here (pointing) for this gun to expel a bullet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"A. Correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (R. 1464-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On cross-examination, Headley elaborated on his testimony that he could not rule out the possibility that the gun fired inadvertently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Q. ... [I]f somebody was holding that gun and somebody grabbed it, the person who is holding his arm, grabbed at his arm, you couldn't rule out that the gun could accidentally go off. Did I hear you say that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A. Yes. There are-I can't say that there is no way for the gun to inadvertently go off. To put that in perspective, the gun when I tested it in my laboratory, the gun worked as it was suppose[d] to, the safeties as they were designed to. And it did not accidentally or inadvertently discharge on me. I had to manually do something, I had to physically do something to the gun to make it discharge. I had to remove the safeties, pull the trigger, etc., for that to discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Q. But you can't rule that out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"A. I can't say with 100 percent certainty that a gun could not be accidentally discharged.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (R. 1476-77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Jesse Poore testified that his .22 caliber pistol was stolen from his truck at some point between 6:00 P.M. on August 8, 2011, and 3:30 P.M. on August 9, 2011. Brendan Morgan, then of the United States Secret Service electronic-crimes task force,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   analyzed Russell's cellular telephone and discovered a photograph of a pistol that had been taken at 1:48 P.M. on August 9, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Terrence McCurdy, who was dating Russell's cousin in August 2011, testified that about a week before the shooting, he and Russell had a conversation during which Russell stated, \"I'm not going back to jail.\" On cross-examination, McCurdy clarified that their conversation was positive in nature and that it was \"[j]ust a general conversation about anything that had happened prior in [Russell's] life that he would make changes to keep from going back to jail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the close of the evidence, both the State and Russell presented closing arguments, and the trial court charged the jury. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On appeal from his conviction and sentence, Russell raises numerous issues, including some that were not raised in the trial court. Because Russell has been sentenced to death, however, this Court must review the trial-court proceedings\n   under the plain-error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 45A, Ala. R.

Moreover, J.J. did not demonstrate \"absolute bias.\" Russell correctly points out that J.J. repeatedly acknowledged that he would be in favor of imposing the death penalty for a person convicted of killing a police officer and that he could not, based on his knowledge of Russell's case at that time, entertain any possible mitigating circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.J. also stated, however, that he \"would have to consider anything that was presented\" at trial, and he mentioned the possibility of circumstances he had not yet considered.

The State used 11 of its 34 peremptory strikes to remove African-American veniremembers. Russell used 2 of his 33 peremptory strikes to remove African-American veniremembers. Russell's jury consisted of 4 African-American jurors and 8 Caucasian jurors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the 4 African-American jurors comprised 33.33% of Russell's jury.

As noted above, the African-American veniremembers constituted 21% of the venire, and, after the State exercised its peremptory strikes, African-American jurors constituted 33.33% of the final jury. Although the State used 11 peremptory strikes to remove 11 of the 17 African-Americans remaining on the venire after excusals and challenges for cause, this fact does not establish a prima face case of racial discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Moreover, the record contains 10-page jury questionnaires asking several different questions that veniremembers returned to the trial court before they appeared at voir dire. Both the State and Russell's defense counsel received the jury questionnaires in advance of voir dire and had the opportunity to examine the veniremembers' responses before conducting voir dire. Each party's voir dire with respect to individual questioning was limited; the questions focused on the veniremembers' abilities to remain unbiased and to follow the trial court's orders, veniremembers' beliefs with respect to the death penalty, veniremembers' relationships to law-enforcement officers, and veniremembers' attitudes toward firearms. Under these circumstances, we do not find that the State's striking six African-American veniremembers who answered no questions during voir dire supports an inference of racial discrimination. For the foregoing reasons, we find no error, much less plain error, with respect to Russell's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Russell contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress his video-recorded statement to police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Russell claims that the totality of the circumstances of August 24, 2011-specifically, he says, sleep deprivation and the effects of smoking synthetic marijuana, hiding in a drain pipe for seven to eight hours after the shooting, and being \"subjected to physical violence and threats by police\" during and after his arrest-left him \"unable to make an informed decision to waive his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   rights, rendering his statements involuntary and inadmissible.\" (Russell's brief, p. 85-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   On April 29, 2013, Russell filed a motion to suppress his statement, claiming that he \"was not effectively advised of his constitutional rights\"; that \"he was not informed of the charge pending against him\"; that he \"did not have counsel and was not afforded the opportunity to retain counsel prior to being interviewed\"; that he \"was not in a mental or physical condition that he could have been interviewed\"; that he \"could not have knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his constitutional right to remain silent, and his statements were not voluntarily given\"; and that his statements should be excluded under Rules 401, 402, 403, 404(a) and (b), 801(c), and 802, Ala.

Russell further argued that, if the trial court found his statements to be admissible, \"the video of [his] statements must be redacted\" because, he said, \"[t]here are portions of the video that are inflammatory, prejudicial, irrelevant and contain inadmissible hearsay,\" and he requested \"to review the redacted statements to determine whether the redacted statements contain any objectionable parts before the State should be allowed to play the video for the jury.\" (C. 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The record includes a waiver-of-rights form signed by Russell at 7:00 P.M. on August 24, 2011.

The form further stated that anything Russell said could and would be used against him in a court of law; that, if he decided to\n   answer questions, he had the right to stop answering at any time; and that, if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed to represent him before questioning if he so desired.

Listen, I want to help you through this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   \"You need someone in your corner right now. That's our job. We're here for whoever comes in here and talks to us, and we want to help you get through this. I know you've had a bad day. I've had a bad day. I know you're tired. We're all tired.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   (State's Exhibit 29.) Sgt. Sparks asked Russell if he had ever been informed of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, and Russell nodded yes. Sgt. Sparks told Russell to stop him if he had any questions, and Sgt. Sparks then read the waiver-of-rights form to Russell. Sgt. Sparks asked Russell if he understood those rights, and Russell nodded. Sgt. Sparks then showed Russell the waiver-of-rights form and explained that the form was an acknowledgment that Russell was willing to talk to police officers at that time. Sgt. Sparks read aloud the statements from the waiver-of-rights form as quoted above, and when asked if he understood, Russell nodded and said \"Yes.\" Sgt. Sparks asked Russell if he wanted to talk to him, and Russell nodded yes and signed the waiver-of-rights form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   During the interview, Russell fidgeted constantly, yawned several times, and indicated that he wanted to bathe, to change into clean clothes, and to sleep. Russell, however, was able to coherently answer Sgt. Sparks' questions and to relate the details of the stop, the foot chase, the shooting, and his attempt to evade capture. At no time during the interview did Russell request to speak with an attorney or refuse to answer questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   On August 14, 2013, the trial court held a pretrial status conference during which the parties discussed Russell's motion to suppress. The court did not conduct a hearing, and neither party presented witnesses or other evidence aside from Russell's statement itself. Russell agreed to the admission of the video-recorded statement on the condition that it be redacted to remove portions that showed: officers bringing Russell into the interview room and his \"interaction with the police\" at that time; Russell placing a baggie of what was\n   presumably marijuana into his mouth; and any references to Russell's past criminal activity and past contact with the police. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a written order stating that Russell's statement \"shall be edited or redacted in the form as set out in the hearing.\" (C. 165.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   On the morning before the third day of trial, the State brought to the court's attention Russell's objection to the redacted version of his statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   \"[The State]: This morning Mr. Moeller [prosecutor] brought it in to play. Apparently-I was not privy to this conversation-[he] ask[ed] the defense if they had any problems with the redacted video and didn't get an answer to my satisfaction. I think this question was we don't know whether we do or we may have an issue. My concern is I want to be confident that what I play with the Court's instruction to the jury about redaction and obvious issues where when you redact there's a slight lag time, longer in the tape, you know, where the voice and things don't match. That we then don't have an issue where something pops out in front of the jury and a bell has been rung that I can't unring. If there is an objection, I'd like to hear it now so that we can fight about it and if it has to be further redacted, we can get it done. That process takes at least an hour to redact. So, I'm kind of running out of time. I'm not trying to put anybody on the spot but I kind of am. Because we have-it's obviously coming and I'd like to have it come in a form that's as clean as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: It's simply this: We got the redaction yesterday. We couldn't look at it until last night. There is something in there that we feel that was part of our discussions early on, ruling to take certain things out. It refers to a prior incident of which the defendant indicated that he did this on a prior occasion and got away. We discussed that at several of the hearings we had addressing the statement and we were under the impression that the Court ruled that was to be taken out. That's in. I mean, that one issue. It's not a long-it's not a, you know, basically briefly a few seconds, right, Jen [defense counsel]? Just a few seconds where he says that. He really don't (sic) go into it any further than he said it and really just moves on. But at least kind of raises the question of, you know, that he goes around pointing guns at a police officer. That's not the case. That's not the case. There's not a prior incident of him pointing a gun at a police officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   \"[The State]: [Defense counsel], we talking about where he pointed a cell phone at Officer Husk?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   \"[The State]: When he said he tried to scare an officer before?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   \"[The State]: We had already had a hearing on that issue. I think the Court, again, especially now in light of the defense, the Court ruled that was admissible because he says, 'I was attempting to scare the officer previously. I was doing the same thing in this case.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   \"The defense is: 'I didn't intend to kill.' The-he as part of his statement puts that out there. We didn't redact that and the Court said it stays in at the hearing. That's my recollection. Because he puts in as part of his discussion as to why he would do this. On a previous occasion, he had pulled a cell phone, pointed it at the officer and the officer had run away. So he was just trying to scare him. And that was consistent with his statements throughout.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   \"So we've taken out all the things the Court asked us to regarding prior criminal contact, warrants out of Oxford and\n   all that stuff. I didn't know what the issue was. That part, my understanding was to be left in because it goes to his mental state and res gestae. He was intending to scare. His excuse to the police that 'I've done it before' obviously should be admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   \"THE COURT: And we may have discussed this and-[defense counsel], I'm not trying your case, but it sounds like it's a-it works both ways. I mean, if he's saying this was an accident that he pulled the gun to scare Officer Sollohub just like he had in the past, but something unfortunate went on or gun went off or whatever. I'm leaving it in if it goes to mental operation of him and his state of mind. All those things that he had done previously. I mean, I see where it can serve either side. And I'm leaving it in and it's his own statement. And something he put in the statement. I don't know that it was ever asked directly of him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   \"[Defense counsel]: It wasn't. They didn't question him about it. He brought it up. And that was the only-that was the issue that we had and Jen [defense counsel] and I debated it and her and I had some heated discussions about it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   (R. 862-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   During Sgt.

Accordingly, Russell is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   We further note that Russell's objection at trial to evidence that he once scared a police officer using a cellular telephone was the basis of his argument against the admission of the recording, but on appeal he does not raise this issue as part of his challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress. Russell does, however, challenge the trial court's failure to sua sponte issue a limiting instruction regarding collateral-bad-acts evidence, and he attacks references to his statement regarding the cellular telephone in that argument.

Mason also confirmed that she had 39 previous guilty-plea convictions for negotiating a worthless instrument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-502\">\n   The State moved to introduce the video-recordings of the witness statements Mason and Beard gave to police shortly after the shooting occurred. The State did so on the grounds (1) that Russell impeached Beard's credibility when he implied that Beard had told defense investigators that the gun had fired accidentally and (2) that Russell impeached Mason's credibility when he introduced evidence of her prior inconsistent statements and suggested she altered her testimony after speaking with Ms. Hammond, one of the prosecutors. The State argued that the prior consistent statements of Beard and Mason were admissible under Rule 803(1), Ala. R. Evid., the present-sense-impression exception to the rule against hearsay. Russell objected on the ground that he had not successfully impeached Beard or Mason because, he said, they denied making those prior inconsistent statements and, therefore, he did not open the door for the State to introduce any of their prior consistent statements. Russell later conceded that Mason admitted to testifying inconsistently at the preliminary hearing. Russell further argued that Beard's and Mason's interviews were not admissible in their entirety as a present-sense impression. The trial court ruled that Beard's and Mason's statements were not hearsay and were admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(b), Ala. R. Evid., because Russell had suggested that Mason changed details of her statement after speaking with the prosecutor and because Russell had implied that Beard changed his statement when he spoke to defense investigators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-503\">\n   During Investigator Tim Suits's testimony, the State introduced Mason's and Beard's video-recorded statements from August 24, 2011, and Beard's video-recorded statement from August 25, 2011. Mason's statement is summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-504\">\n   On the morning of August 24, 2011, Mason and her son, Justin, were in the backyard of Mason's mother's house on Walnut Street washing a car. Mason heard what she thought was a dog running toward her and then caught a glimpse of Russell,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   who ran from the right side of the backyard between a barbeque pit and a table. Russell stopped briefly at the right side of the back of the house; he was smoking a cigarette and looked at Mason as if to tell her to be quiet. Russell then ran around the front of the house. Officer Sollohub, who was chasing Russell, did not follow Russell to the front of the house; instead, he ran in front of Mason across the backyard to the left corner of the back of the house. Officer Sollohub peeked around the corner of the house twice; the second time he looked, Officer Sollohub saw Russell coming toward him and ducked back behind the house. Russell turned around to keep running, but then turned back and shot Officer Sollohub. Mason heard a pop and saw Officer Sollohub fall. Mason saw Russell shoot Officer Sollohub with a silver gun that was not a revolver. Mason did not see where Russell went after he shot Officer Sollohub. Mason described Russell as short, somewhat heavyset, with cornrows that fell below his ears and as wearing a blue shirt and dark-colored shorts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-505\">\n   Beard's August 24, 2011, statement is summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-506\">\n   Beard entered the interview room at the conclusion of Mason's interview, and the officers left Mason and Beard alone. Mason asked Beard if he had been able to identify the person who shot Officer Sollohub from any photographs the police had shown him. Mason urged Beard, \"If you know something you need to tell\n   these folks\" and \"If you know who that boy is you need to be telling them, Justin.\" After Mason left the interview room, Beard spoke with an officer but was reluctant to provide certain information. Beard stated that he and his mother were outside washing a car when he saw \"someone chasing a light skinned dude\" who \"hangs out on Moore\" Street. Beard said that he thought the two people were gone, so he continued washing the car until he heard a \"bah\" sound and looked up to see Officer Sollohub fall. Beard indicated that he recognized the person who shot Officer Sollohub but that he didn't know his name and that he was unable to identify him from a photographic lineup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   Beard's statement from 9:35 A.M. on August 25, 2011, is summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-508\">\n   Beard was led into the interview room in handcuffs, and, before giving a statement, Beard said, \"I'm just ready to go home.\" Beard identified the man who shot officer Sollohub as \"Josh.\" Beard and his mother were outside washing a car when they looked up to see Officer Sollohub chasing Russell. Russell ran around the house and returned to the back of the house and hid behind a corner. Russell peeked around the corner twice and then drew a gun on Officer Sollohub as Officer Sollohub approached Russell. Officer Sollohub tried to grab Russell, but Officer Sollohub slipped, and Russell shot Officer Sollohub in the head. Beard stated that Russell was waiting for Officer Sollohub. When asked if the shooting was an accident, Beard stated, \"Nah, he did that shit on purpose.\" Beard stated that he recognized Russell from around his neighborhood but that he only knew his name and did not know him personally. Beard confirmed that he identified Russell from a photographic lineup and that he was 100% positive in his identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   Initially, we note that Russell's argument-that the trial court admitted Beard's and Mason's prior consistent statements on the bases that there were inconsistencies between each witness's testimony, that Beard had been threatened with incarceration before giving a second, favorable statement to police, and that Mason had 39 previous convictions involving a crime of dishonesty-is clearly refuted by the record. The State did not rely on any of the above-mentioned grounds in offering the prior consistent statements. In admitting the statements, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-510\">\n   \"[I]t's offered by the State to rebut an express[ ] or implied charge against a declarant [of] improper influence or motive because you directly asked [Mason], 'Did you change a statement after you talked with Ms. Hammond [prosecutor]?,' and then you asked [Beard], 'Didn't you tell my investigator this was an accident?' He said, 'No.' It's in. So, they can offer it under [ Rule] 801 [, Ala. R. Evid].

See also C. Gamble, McElroy's Alabama Evidence \u00a7 177.01 (4th ed. 1991). Even if such consistent statements are admitted, however, traditional case law admits them only for the nonsubstantive purpose of bolstering the credibility of the witness. E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 251 (3d ed. 1984). The present rule, however, admits such statements as substantive evidence of the truth of the matters contained therein.

What is a sufficient charge of recent fabrication or motive to testify falsely, that will open the door to rehabilitation by proof of consistent statement, is committed in large measure to the discretion of the trial court.

On cross-examination, Mason admitted that she had testified differently at the preliminary hearing with respect to certain details of the crime; that she had met with Ms. Hammond, one of the prosecutors, after the preliminary hearing and before the trial; and that she had been less cooperative with defense investigators than she had been with the State. Russell, therefore, suggested the possibility that Mason had been subject to improper influence and was biased in favor of the State. The video-recording of Mason's statement to police showing that Mason made similar statements to those she testified to at trial, therefore, was admissible under the exception to the general rule to rebut the inference that Mason's testimony was subject to improper influence and that Mason was biased in favor of the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

The video-recording of Beard's statement to police showing that Beard had previously made similar statements to those he testified to at trial, therefore, was admissible under the exception to the general rule to rebut the reference that Beard's testimony had recently been fabricated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , McDonald,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625375\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/448/460/\">\n    supra.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   Moreover, the admission of Mason's and Beard's prior consistent statements did not violate Russell's rights under the Confrontation Clause. During Beard's testimony, which occurred before Mason's testimony, the State informed Russell of its intent to introduce Beard's prior consistent statements. Furthermore, Beard and Mason, who were under subpoena by the State, were subject to cross-examination by Russell during trial, and Russell could have requested that they remain available to be called again. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting the prior consistent statement, and Russell is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-524\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-525\">\n   Russell contends that his right to present a defense was impaired and the reliability of the verdict was undermined because of the State's untimely disclosure of \"objective video evidence.\" Specifically, Russell claims: that the State suppressed the video evidence until the end of trial; that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial or, in the alternative, when it did not grant a continuance in his case; and that the trial court erred when it admitted \"testimony and evidence purportedly regarding what was on the cameras.\" (Russell's brief, p. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-526\">\n   On March 16, 2012, the trial court issued a written discovery order directing the State, upon written request from the defense, to provide \"full and complete access to all documents, statements, writings, photographs, recordings, evidence, reports, and any other file materials in the possession of the State or any law enforcement agency involved in this case which may be known to exist or which, with due diligence, could be determined to exist.\" (C. 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   On September 4, 2013, Russell filed a written motion requesting that the State produce \"[a]ny and all video, audio, digital, and/or electronic recordings from the police vehicles [and Scorpion brand body cameras] of Officers Sollohub and Bostick that would show the stop and subsequent chase\" that occurred on August 24, 2011. The trial court addressed Russell's motion at a pretrial hearing held on September 6, 2013:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-528\">\n   \"[The State]: Judge, to my knowledge, there was not a video from either vehicle or from the Scorpion devices that they were wearing or at least Officer Sollohub was wearing.

The record is ultimately silent as to whether Russell was actually afforded counsel or whether the judge in the municipal court engaged in the colloquy necessary to ascertain that Russell knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily desired to forgo his right to counsel. The State, therefore, failed to meet its burden of proving that Russell was represented by counsel or that he validly waived his right to counsel before pleading guilty to the theft charge. Accordingly, the circuit court erred when it allowed the jury to consider that evidence during the penalty-phase proceeding. Furthermore, because the jury relied on that evidence to unanimously determine that Russell was under the sentence of imprisonment at the time he committed the capital offense, it was improper for the court to consider that aggravating circumstance when it overrode the jury's 8 to 4 recommendation that Russell be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-730\">\n   We must now decide whether that error warrants a reversal of the sentence and necessitates a new penalty-phase proceeding.

I, however, respectfully disagree with the majority's interpretation of \u00a7 13A-5-49(1), Ala. Code 1975. Specifically, I disagree with the majority's determination that the aggravating circumstance defined in \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) requires proof that the defendant was represented by counsel or waived counsel during the proceedings that led to his or her imprisonment for the prior offense. Rather, I believe that the validity of the conviction that resulted in the imprisonment is irrelevant to that particular aggravating circumstance. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-751\">\n   Section 13A-5-49(1) defines the following aggravating circumstance: \"[t]he capital offense was committed by a person under sentence of imprisonment.\" Unlike Alabama's Habitual Felony Offender Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   13A-5-9, Ala. Code 1975, or Alabama's aggravating circumstance relating to prior felony convictions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   13A-5-49(2), Ala. Code 1975, the aggravating circumstance defined in \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) does not concern a prior conviction. Thus, the validity of a prior conviction is irrelevant to its application. Applied correctly, \u00a7 13-5-49(1), aggravates any capital offense that was \"committed by a person under [a] sentence of imprisonment,\" regardless of the procedure used to convict and sentence that person. Thus, this aggravating circumstance enhances the punishment of those individuals who refuse to conform their behavior to societal norms despite being under the authority of the State, i.e., it punishes those incorrigible offenders who are impervious to the rehabilitative efforts of the State. It is a circumstance to be considered when determining the punishment of someone who, although under a sentence of imprisonment, chooses to commit a crime that the State has deemed the most reprehensible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-752\">\n   Interpreting a similar but not identical aggravating circumstance, the Supreme Court of Missouri held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-753\">\n   \"Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find as an aggravating circumstance that the capital murder had occurred while appellant was in the lawful custody of a place of confinement because the state had presented no evidence that the custody was lawful.

The statutory condition precedent is lawful confinement.

The point is denied.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-764\">\n   As in Missouri, enhancing a capital defendant's punishment because he or she committed the offense while under a sentence of imprisonment does not require the State to prove the sentence of imprisonment was the result of a valid or legal conviction. To do so would focus the application of this aggravating circumstance to the validity of a prior conviction rather than on the defendant's inability or refusal to adjust his behavior although under a sentence of imprisonment. I do not believe that the legislature intended such a result. Rather, I believe that the legislature enacted \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) to enhance the sentence for capital offenders who prove that they are impervious to the State's rehabilitative efforts and who prove that they are a future danger to society and individuals in the prison system by committing a capital offense while serving a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, I do not believe that the State is required to prove that the capital offender had counsel or waived counsel when he or she was convicted of the offense for which the imprisonment was imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-765\">\n   Because the purpose of \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) is to enhance the punishment of capital offenders who commit capital murder while under a sentence of imprisonment, the State needed to prove only that Russell was under a sentence of imprisonment when he killed Officer Sollohub for this aggravating circumstance to apply. The State did so; therefore, I believe \u00a7 13A-5-49(1) was correctly applied and disagree with the majority's decision to the contrary. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to grant Russell penalty-phase relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-766\">\n   <em>\n    On Application for Rehearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-767\">\n   JOINER, Judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-768\">\n   The State has filed an application for rehearing and a brief in support of that application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 40, Ala.

I also believe that it is unnecessary to explain to the parties that the modified opinion now renders the majority's decision final and subject to an application for rehearing and certiorari review. Accordingly, I concur with the majority's decision to modify its opinion. I, however, dissent from the majority's decision to overrule the State's application for rehearing and its advisory opinion on application for rehearing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
