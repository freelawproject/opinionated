Both the Medical Malpractice Act (\"MMA\") (currently codified in La. R.S. 40:1231.1,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . ), which governs claims against private qualified health care providers, and the Medical Liability for State Services Act (\"MLSSA\") (currently codified in La.

On the night of July 11, 2014, Ms. Downing was seriously injured in a high-speed automobile accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms.\n   Downing was initially treated at a local hospital (former River Parish Hospital in LaPlace, Louisiana). Due to the nature of her injuries, Ms. Downing was transferred to LSU Hospital in New Orleans on the next day. On July 13, 2014, Ms. Downing sustained an anoxic brain injury, which led to her death on April 20, 2015. Ms. Downing's death certificate listed the following three causes of death: (i) respiratory failure; (ii) anoxic brain injury ; and (iii) motor vehicle accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 13, 2015, Ms. Downing's estate and four of her five surviving children (collectively \"the \"Downing Family\") filed a request for a medical review proceeding with the Division of Administration (the \"DOA\"), alleging malpractice by twelve named defendants in the treatment provided to Ms. Downing on July 13, 2014, at LSU Hospital (the \"Complaint\"). Five of the named defendants were private health care providers covered by the MMA; five were state providers covered by the MLSSA;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two were never properly identified and thus dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2015, four of the five state providers filed in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans a Petition to Institute Discovery pursuant to La. R.S. 40:1237.2(D)(4) (the \"CDC Case\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the fall of October 2017, before the completion of the medical review panel proceedings, three of the private health care providers-University Medical Center Management Corp. d/b/a Interim LSU Hospital (\"Interim LSU\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Rebecca Schroll, and Dr. Charles Clark (collectively the \"Private Providers\")-filed peremptory exceptions of prescription in the CDC Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The grounds for the Private Providers' exceptions was the Downing Family's failure to comply with La. R.S. 40:1231.8(A)(1)(c), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A claimant shall have forty-five days from the date of receipt by the claimant of the confirmation of receipt of the request for review in accordance with Subparagraph (3)(a) of this Subsection to pay to the board a filing fee in the\n   amount of one hundred dollars per named defendant qualified under this Part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The penalty for failure to comply with Subparagraph (c) is set forth in La. R.S. 40:1231.8(A)(1)(e), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Failure to comply with the provisions of Subparagraph (c) or (d) of this Paragraph within the specified forty-five day time frame in Subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph shall render the request for review of a malpractice claim invalid and without effect. Such an invalid request for review of a malpractice claim shall not suspend time within which suit must be instituted in Subparagraph (2)(a) of this Subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of their exceptions, the Private Providers argued that the Downing Family's failure to timely pay the entire filing fee they owed for invoking a medical review panel-$ 500 ($ 100 for each of the five qualified private health care providers named in the Complaint)-rendered the entire request invalid and without effect. Accordingly, they contended that the Downing Family's medical malpractice claim against them prescribed, by operation of law, on April 20, 2016, one year from the date of Ms. Downing's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Agreeing with the Private Providers, the trial court orally reasoned that it did not \"find that the requisite fees were appropriately paid.\" For this reason, the trial court sustained the exceptions of prescription and ordered that the Downing Family's \"proposed claim of medical malpractice ... PCF File No. 2015-00753, is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE and the pending medical review panel proceeding in that matter is dissolved.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a medical malpractice case in which the plaintiff's complaint requesting a medical review panel serves initially as the petition and serves to suspend prescription, \"the health care provider can assert a prescription exception in a court of competent jurisdiction and proper venue at any time without regard to whether the medical review panel process is complete.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Med.

We find that it did not qualify as a perfected request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To perfect a request for review, a claimant must pay the full filing fee of $ 100 per provider in accordance with La.

In its acknowledgement letter, the PCF provided the following breakdown of the twelve named defendants: three private providers qualified under the MMA-the Private Providers; two providers pending verification as to whether they were qualified under the MMA-Brenda Laws and Devin Johnson; five providers not qualified under the MMA, but qualified under the MLSSA-the State Providers; and two providers for whom incomplete names were given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the PCF acknowledged receipt of the Downing Family's check for $ 100\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and admonished the Downing Family as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In accordance with R.S. 40:1299.47(A)(1)(c) [now 40:1231.8(A)(1)(c) ] a filing fee of $ 100 per qualified defendant must be received by the Patient's Compensation Fund within 45 days of the postmark of this notice without exception. Please remit full payment to the Patient's Compensation Fund in the amount of $ 200 (balance due). This filing fee may only be waived upon receipt of an affidavit from a physician or a district court's in forma pauperis ruling as set forth in R.S. 40:1299.47(A)(1)(d) [now 40:1231.8(A)(1)(d) ]. Failure to comply shall render the request invalid and without effect and the request shall not suspend the time within which suit must be instituted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 4, 2015, the PCF advised the Downing Family that the two providers pending verification-Ms. Laws and Mr. Johnson-were both qualified private providers. The PCF further advised that a $ 100 filing fee for each of these two qualified private providers must be received by the PCF within 45 days of the postmark of the notice without exception and stated \"[p]lease remit full payment to the [PCF] in the amount of $ 200.\" At this point, the Downing Family owed a total of $ 400 in filing fees to the PCF-$ 100 for each of the five private qualified private providers, as reflected in the PCF's July 23, 2015, and August 4, 2015 letters, less the $ 100 tendered with the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 29, 2015, the Downing Family, through their attorney, sent a check to the PCF in the amount of $ 200. The Downing Family's attorney stated in her August 29, 2015 cover letter to the PCF that \"[a]lso included is a copy of a check that is being submitted to the Division of Administration for $ 500 in accordance with their attached letter dated July 17, 2015 and directing that the check be submitted to the Division of Administration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 1, 2015, the DOA acknowledged receipt of the $ 500 check; the DOA's acknowledgement letter indicated that the claim against the state defendants\n   was assigned Medical Review Panel Number 15 MR 003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 9, 2015, the PCF acknowledged receipt of a check in the amount of $ 200 from the Downing Family. Thereafter, the Downing Family submitted another check to the PCF for $ 200; however, the PCF did not receive this other check until September 28, 2015, which was after the 45-day period had elapsed (the deadline was September 18, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 1, 2015, the PCF notified the Downing Family that \"although money was remitted, a refund is being processed because the balance due [was] received untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore the above cited case [PCF 2015-00753] is considered invalid and without effect as to Brenda P. Laws and Devin Johnson.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response to the October 1, 2015 notice, the Downing Family's attorney sent a letter to the PCF, dated October 15, 2015, in which she stated that she was charged twice for one of the providers, Dr. Schroll. She further stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [T]here are only 8 qualified medical providers and $ 800 was submitted before the additional $ 200.00 payment was received on September 28, 2015. I have been receiving requests for payment from both the Commissioner of Administration and the Patient Compensation Fund and submitting requests for payment to both.... $ 1,000 has been paid. I am owed a reimbursement of the additional $ 200.00 because $ 1,000.00 has been paid and only $ 800.00 is due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This response is inconsistent with the record, which reflects that there were a total of ten qualified providers named in the Complaint-five private providers and five state providers-and that a total of $ 1,000 was due-$ 500 to each of the respective agencies, the PCF and the DOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Likewise, the Downing Family's argument on appeal that they were overcharged for Dr. Schroll is not supported by the record. The Downing Family presented no evidence that they paid the DOA for Dr. Schroll. Indeed, Dr. Schroll was listed on the initial letter from the PCF as a qualified private provider. Regardless, any payments made to the DOA are not relevant on the issue of whether the full filing fee due the PCF was paid. The DOA and the PCF are separate administrative bodies; each administrative body separately collected the respective filings fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Downing Family further contends that the PCF's October 1, 2015 letter stating that the Complaint was only invalid as to two providers-Ms. Laws and Mr. Johnson-supports their position that suspension of prescription is achieved on an individual-defendant basis. Put differently, their position is that the failure to pay the filing fee for one or more providers does not invalidate the entire request and that suspension of prescription should be achieved on an individual-defendant basis when the fee for a particular defendant is paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Private Providers counter that the PCF's statement that the invalidity of the request pertained only to two of the five private defendants is neither judicially\n   binding nor legally correct. Rather, they contend that a failure to pay the fee as to all qualified defendants renders the request for a medical review panel invalid and without effect as to all qualified defendants, even when timely payment was received as to some qualified defendants. Thus, they contend that the invalidity extends to the Downing Family's entire request, which included five private defendants. The Private Providers further contend that the PCF lacks the authority to allocate a filing fee among the named private defendants and that a partial filing fee is not allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   According to the Private Providers, resolution of the issue presented here-whether the Downing Family's medical malpractice claim against them is prescribed-is simple:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 The Downing Family's request for formation of a medical review panel named five qualified private defendants, resulting in them owing the PCF a filing fee of $ 500;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 The Downing Family only remitted $ 300 within the prescribed 45-day period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 The Downing Family's failure to timely remit the full filing fee rendered their request for formation of a medical review panel invalid and without effect per statute; thus,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 The Downing Family's request did not suspend the time within which to institute suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The jurisprudence, as the Private Providers contend, has construed the statutory provision to mean that that if a claimant fails to pay the \"full filing fee\" within the applicable 45-day period to the appropriate administrative agency, the entire request for review panel is invalid and without effect as to all the providers.\n   <em>\n    Rideaux,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20811628\">\n    2013 WL 811628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2.

Where suit is filed against\n   alleged joint and solidary obligors, or joint tortfeasors, the legislature indicates its preference in this second sentence for the same time limitation to be applied to all of the defendants. In that situation, the legislature provides that the filing of a request for review of a malpractice claim against the health care provider, qualified or not qualified, shall suspend the running of prescription for filing suit \"to the same extent that prescription is suspended against the party or parties that are the subject of the request for review.\" This legislation produces the imminently practical result that allegations of joint or concurrent negligence may be determined at the same time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Milbert v.

Although the claimant timely paid the filing fees for the two state defendants, the claimant failed to pay the $ 300 fee for the three private defendants. As a result, the PCF notified the claimant that his request as to the private defendants was invalid and without effect. Thereafter, the claimant filed a supplemental and amending request, reasserting his claims against the private defendants and paying the filing fee associated with that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In response, the private defendants each filed an exception of prescription. They contended that the claimant's initial request for a medical review panel to review the claims against them was rendered invalid and without effect and did not suspend the time within which suit must be instituted, because the claimant failed to pay the $ 300 filing fee or to provide evidence that it should be waived within the applicable 45-day period. They further contended that even though the claimant paid the filing fee with his supplemental and amending request, this request was not timely because it was filed over a year from the date of the alleged malpractice. Agreeing with the private defendants, the trial court granted the exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Reversing, the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   first noted that \"[t]his court and others have recently reviewed a number of cases involving the exception of prescription based on a medical malpractice claimant's failure to submit filing fees or evidence of waiver thereof within 45 days from the confirmation of receipt of the request for review.\"\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   , 07-2262, p. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209701\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1075/#p1080\">\n    991 So.2d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). The line of cases, the appellate court noted, would dictate a finding that the claimant's claim against the private defendants was prescribed if the facts were the same as in those cases. The appellate court, however, found the facts before it distinguishable, emphasizing that \"[the claimant's] case has an additional factual circumstance, in that his request for review included claims against both state defendants and private\n   defendants\"-a joint request.\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   , 07-2262, p. 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209701\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1075/#p1080\">\n    991 So.2d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Construing Sentence Two as applicable to suspend prescription, the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The statute is clear and unambiguous. According to LSA-R.S. 40:1299.39.1(A)(2)(a) [now La. R.S. 40:1237.2(A)(2)(a) ], the filing of a request for review of a claim against a state health care provider \"shall suspend the running of prescription against\n   <em>\n    all joint or solidary obligors\n   </em>\n   , ... to the same extent that prescription is suspended against the party or parties that are [the] subject of the request for review.\" (Emphasis added).... At this stage of the proceedings, it seems unlikely that the allegations would result in a finding of solidary liability among the state and private defendants. However, Smithson claims that his damages resulting from the loss of his eye were caused by two or more persons, including state and private defendants. Therefore, joint liability has clearly been alleged. This triggers the suspension of the running of prescription against all joint obligors, as set forth in LSA-R.S. 40:1299.39.1(A)(2)(a). Accordingly, Smithson's filing of a request for review against the state defendants suspended the running of prescription against the private defendants, unless that filing was deemed invalid and without effect. The evidence shows that the filing against the state defendants was valid, because the filing fee for that claim was paid timely. Therefore, Smithson's claims against the private defendants were not prescribed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   , 07-2262, pp. 8-9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209701\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/991/1075/#p1080\">\n    991 So.2d at 1080-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnote omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Downing Family contends that this court should follow the holding in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   . The Private Providers counter that this court should find\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   factually distinguishable and legally incorrect. Factually, the Private Providers point out that the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   filed a supplemental and amending request against the private defendants; whereas, the Downing Family failed to file a supplemental and amending request against the private defendants. This distinction, however, is not significant. The issue here is a legal one of statutory construction. Simply stated, the issue is whether a supplemental and amending request, if filed (as it was in\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   ), would be considered timely by virtue of applying Sentence Two-joint tortfeasor suspension-in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Legally, the Private Providers contend that\n   <em>\n    Smithson\n   </em>\n   erroneously holds that a request for review against state providers under the MLSSA suspends prescription against private providers under the MMA despite the claimant's failure to pay the required filling fee to perfect that request.

First, in the State Providers' petition in the CDC Case, which was filed on October 13, 2015, the State Providers averred: \"[a] Medical Review Panel proceeding was instituted against movers herein pursuant to LSA-R.S. 40:1237.1,\n    <em>\n     et seq\n    </em>\n    ., and is pending with the Division of Administration in the matter of 15 MR 003, consolidated with PCF 2015-00753.\" Second, in the State Providers' motion to extend the medical review panel filed in the CDC Case, they made the same averment. The only other mention of a joint panel in the record an oral statement by the Downing Family's attorney at the hearing on the exceptions; their attorney argued that, given the statutory requirement of a joint panel, the \"payments made to both the DOA and PCF should be considered together\" and that, collectively, $ 800 in filing fees was paid. As discussed elsewhere in this opinion, the Downing Family attorney's suggestion that the filing fees paid to the DOA should be considered in determining whether the full filing fee was paid to the PCF is unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    For ease of discussion, reference to the agency administering the claims against the state defendants is made to the DOA.
