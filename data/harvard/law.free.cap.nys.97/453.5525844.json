The relator, as a result of a competitive examination was, on October 19, 1896, assigned to duty on the police force in the city of Brooklyn for a probationary term of six months. While serving under such probationary appointment he was tried for a violation of the rules of the police department, convicted and fined 30 days\u2019 pay. After serving the full probationary period, relator was, on April 19, 1897, regularly appointed a member of the police force of the city of Brooklyn, with the rank and grade of patrolman. Thereafter, and pursuant to the provisions of section 278 of the Greater New York Charter (chapter 378, p. 95, Laws 1897) relator was continued as a member of the, police force of the city of New York, with the same rank and grade. On May 5, 1904, relator, as a result of a competitive examination for promotion to roundsman, was notified by the municipal civil service commission that his name had been placed on the eligible list for such promotion, and that he had been given a rating of 80s4,/100 per cent. In arriving at this rating the municipal civil service commission deducted 7% per cent, from relator\u2019s rating on meritorious police service, because of the thirty days\u2019 fine imposed while relator was serving his probationary term. But, for this deduction, relator\u2019s rating on the eligible list would have been 83&lt;\u00a1Vioo per cent., thus placing him some 300 numbers nearer the head of said list. On May 18, 1904, and again on August 10, 1904, relator appealed in writing to the municipal civil service commission, protesting that no part of his record while serving as a probationary appointee should be considered, and asking for a rerating. On October 20, 1904, the municipal civil service commission refused to change relator\u2019s rating, but did not notify relator of this action until January 10, 1905. Meanwhile, relator had appealed personally to President Coler of the municipal civil service commission, who advised him to apply to the police commissioner for a corrected record. The police commissioner thereupon requested the corporation counsel of the city of New York for his opinion as to whether a fine imposed upon a probationary officer should be considered against him on his application for promotion, and the corporation counsel handed down an opinion favorable to the contention of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>lator. The. opinion of the corporation counsel, together with an amended, record of relator, was, on April 10, 1905, submitted by the police commissioner to the municipal civil service commission, together with a communication in writing requesting a rerating of relator. On April 19, 1905, the municipal civil service commission, after due consideration, refused to grant the police commissioner\u2019s request for a rerating. However, no notice of this action came to the knowledge of the relator until after September 1, 1905. This proceeding was commenced October 18, 1905.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-4\">On a motion two questions were presented for the determination of the court, namely: First. Should the record of a member of the police force while serving as a probationary appointee be considered by the municipal civil service commission on the examination for promotion? Second. Was the relator guilty of laches?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-5\">Robert H. Wilson, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-6\">John J. Delany (E. H. Wilson, of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b486-7\">MADDOX, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acr8\">The respondent\u2019s predecessors in office considered the probationary record of the relator improperly included by the police commissioner in the police record of relator submitted to the civil service commission, and in that a wrong was done to relator. The statutes define the duties of the civil service commission and promotion in the police department shall be made on \u201cthe basis of seniority, meritorious police service, and superior capacity as shown by competitive examination.\u201d Section 288, Greater New York Charter (Laws 1901, p. 122, c. 466). In considering the probationary record the commission exceeded the statutory authority given. That was not a judicial act, and cannot be so excused. Relator\u2019s delay is fully explained, and he is not to be charged with laches. In communicating with the police commissioner and the civil service commission he was endeavoring to bring a.bout a correction of the wrong done him.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">No reason is shown why the commission should not have acted, and the motion is granted. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
