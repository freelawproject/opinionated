On February 1st, 1895, the parties entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>a supplemental written agreement modifying the said lease, and giving to the plaintiff during the tenancy \u201cthe privilege to purchase the said premises so demised at any time before January 1st, 1900\u201d for $35,000, by paying not less than $7,000 in cash on taking title and giving back his bond and mortgage for the balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-5\">The complaint alleges that the plaintiff paid to the defendant various installments between the making of the said agreement and January 1st, 1900, amounting to $10,000, \u201cwith the express understanding and upon the express agreement that if plaintiff should not elect to purchase the said premises, then said sum of $10,000 should be returned to the plaintiff with 6 per cent, interest thereon, or be applied on the rent under the said lease.\u201d The plaintiff testifies that an oral agreement to this effect was made between them, and the defendant testifies to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-6\">The complaint also alleges that the plaintiff did not elect to purchase in the time limited, and \u201cthat plaintiff thereupon in the year 1900 and also subsequently, demanded a return of the said $10,000 with interest, or in default thereof that the same be applied upon the rent to become due upon the said premises,\u201d and that the defendant refused either to return it or so apply it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-7\">This action was brought in November, 1903, viz., after the lapse of nearly four years after the time of the purchase option had expired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b771-8\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b771-9\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

On the contrary, he testifies that he told the defendant that \u201cwe could take it out of the rent,\u201d and he repeats several times that he elected to have it applied on the rent. Moreover his election was not necessary\u2014indeed he had no right of election\u2014 for by the alleged oral agreement under which it was paid, as the plaintiff claims, it was to be held by the defendant and applied on the rent as it came due if the plaintiff did not take title under the purchase option, unless the defendant chose to pay it back with interest at six per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">This being the contract relation between the parties, the defendant showed that he had on January 4th, 1901, in the Municipal Court of the city of New York, begun landlord and tenant proceedings under the statute to remove the plaintiff from the demised premises for non-payment of the rent which came due under the lease of November 1st and December 1st, 1900, and January 1st, 1901, and on due service of the precept on the plaintiff, and his appearance and consent on the return day, obtained a final order therein of removal, upon which a warrant was issued, but not executed because the plaintiff paid the rent in arrears; and he has continued in possession and paid the rent ever since. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>This adjudication imports absolute verity,, and. is conclusive evidence that the plaintiff owed the defendant. the rent alleged to be due in the petition, an.d that the defendant had the right to remove him for non-payment thereof, for that could not be the case if the defendant then h\u00e1d\" in his hands $10,000 of the plaintiff which he held, by contract between them for the payment of the rent as it came due-That would have been a complete defense, and was necessarily comprehended in the issue whether the plaintiff was in arrears for rent and could be removed therefor. Nemetty v. Naylor, 100 N. Y. 562, 3 N. E. 497; Reich v. Cochran, 151 N. Y. 122, 45 N. E. 367, 37 L. R. A. 805, 56 Am. St. Rep. 607; Barber v. Kendall, 158 N. Y. 401, 53 N. E. 1 Brown v. The Mayor, 66 N. Y. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Apart from the foregoing, a careful reading of the evidence shows that the case is a grave one for the consideration of a motion to set th\u00e9 verdict aside on the ground of the weight of evidence, and the suggestion by this court on that head when the case was here before (104 App. Div. 94, 93 N. Y. Supp. 547) should be heeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. AH concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
