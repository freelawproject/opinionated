The appellants are the owners of some of such bonds, and have intervened as parties defendant herein. They interposed an answer, among other things, alleging a defect of parties defendant, in that certain other persons, naming them, were owners of some of the bonds and necessary and proper defendants, and that without their presence a complete determination of the controversy could not be had. Subsequently the appellants moved at Special Term to require the plaintiff to make such persons parties defendant herein. From an order denying such motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b705-10\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Where such defect does not appear on the face of the complaint, the obj'ection may be taken by answer; and, if such an objection is not taken either by demurrer or answer, the defendant is deemed, to have waived it. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 498, 499. Even if the objection is not taken by demurrer or answer, the court may on its. own motion in a proper case, where a complete determination of the controversy cannot be had without the presence of other parties, direct them to be brought in. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 452. \u201cConstruing sections-452 and 499 together, their meaning is that a defendant, by omitting to take the objection that there is a defect of parties by demurrer or-answer, waives on his part any objection to the granting of relief on: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that ground, but when the granting of relief against him would prejudice the rights of others, and their rights cannot be saved by the judgment, and the controversy cannot be completely determined without their presence, the court must direct them to be made parties before proceeding to judgment.\u201d Osterhoudt v. Board of Supervisors of the County of Ulster, 98 N. Y. 243; Steinbach v. Prudential Insurance Company, 172 N. Y. 476, <em>65 </em>N. E. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Whether the parties sought by the appellants to be brought into the action were proper or necessary parties was a question to be determined by the court on the trial of the action. Such question was not properly raised by motion. The appellants pursued the proper practice in raising such question by answer, and were at liberty on the trial to litigate the issue thus raised, at which time the court would have properly disposed of the question having reference to the facts as then established. A defendant, however, cannot by motion dictate to a plaintiff whom the latter shall make defendants, thereby subjecting the plaintiff to the burden and perhaps the costs of a litigation with * some third party which may possibly prove to be unsuccessful. Plaintiff has a right to select his own defendants, subject to the right of a defendant to raise the objection by demurrer or answer that the proper parties are not before the court. Plaintiff may, then, unless he prefers to bring in such parties, litigate with the defendant the question as to the propriety of the presence of such parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
