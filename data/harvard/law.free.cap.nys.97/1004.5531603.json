Hunken, 40 App. Div. 129, 57 N. Y. Supp. 712), because it would be idle to permit the plaintiff to prove a state of facts which when proven could result only in a nonsuit. When such a motion is granted, however, the plaintiff should be allowed to amend, so as, if possible, to cure the defect. The allowance of such an amendment is made obligatory by subdivision 4, \u00a7 145, of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1536, c. 580), when a written demurrer is sustained, and by analogy should follow upon the granting of a motion to dismiss for insufficiency, which is, in effect, an oral demurrer. The justice erred in refusing plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to amend, and the judgment must for that reason be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Judgement reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
