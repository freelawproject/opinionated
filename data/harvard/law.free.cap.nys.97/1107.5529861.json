From a judgment for plaintiff, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A3c\">Reversed and remanded.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1139-17\">One \u00a1McCarthy shipped potatoes over the defendant\u2019s road in the winter, under a written contract by which, for a reduced freight rate and the carriage of the person accompanying them without charge other than the sum paid for carriage of the potatoes, he agreed that the\" company should not be liable for any injury, by negligence or otherwise, to the potatoes or the person accompanying them. The shipper acknowledged that he had an option to accept this reduced rate and those terms or pay the official tariff, and thereby receive the security of the liability of the company as a common carrier, and that he had voluntarily accepted the reduced rate under the contract. Attached to the contract was a contract signed by the decedent, who was in charge of the potatoes, reciting that, in consideration of his carriage upon a freight train in charge of the potatoes without a charge other than the sum paid for carrying the potatoes mentioned in the contract, he voluntarily assumed all risk of accident or damage,to his person and released and discharged the company from every and all claims, liabilities, and demands of every kind, nature, and description, for or on account of any personal injury or damage of any kind sustained by him, whether caused by the negligence of the company or otherwise. While the potatoes in the intestate\u2019s charge were in transit, he was killed by reason of the alleged negligence of the defendant or its servants. By the judgment appealed from his administratrix recovers damages for his death, the court ruling that the exemption from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>liability provided by the contract did not include any liability to the next of kin, which question was not contemplated by the contract, but, if it was. intended to be included in the contract, that the intestate had no power to make it, and that the contract in that respect was void; and the court charged the jury that if the defendant was negligent the plaintiff could recover, to which rulings exceptions were duly taken. The charge allowed a recovery .for negligence, without' regard to whether it was the act or omission of the defendant\u2019s servants in not performing their duties, or of the company itself, or whether the negligence was gross or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1140-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Co., 49 N. Y. 263, 10 Am. Rep. 364; Bissell v. N. Y. C. Railroad Co., 25 N. Y. 442, 82 Am. Dec. 369. The cause of action for causing death by negligence is given by section 1902 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and is given only against a person \u201cwho, or a corporation which, would have been liable to an action in favor of the decedent by reason thereof if death had not ensued.\u201d In Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Adams, 192 U. S. 440 24 Sup. Ct. 408, 48 L. Ed. 513, where theldaho statute gave a cause of action \u201cagainst the person causing the death,\u201d and contained no provision similar to the one above quoted from our statutes, it was held that the company was not liable to the estate of a person killed by the company\u2019s negligence, where he was riding on a contract which provided that the company should not be liable for any injury to his person. The same rule has been applied in this state. Bissell v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., supra; Perkins v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 24 N. Y. 196, 82 Am. Dec. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">The judgment and order are therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
