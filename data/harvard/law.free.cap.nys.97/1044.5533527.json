The answer admits the incorporation of the bank by not denying it, and denies every other allegation of the complaint, except the allegation \u201cthat prior to the death of the said Josef Bielat, deceased, the said Josef Bielat deposited with said defendant the sum of three hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-11\">Upon the trial there was no affirmative proof of the death of Josef Bielat, unless that fact may be inferred from the granting of letters testamentary upon his estate. There was no proof as to the date upon which Josef Bielat died. The only testimony tendered which refers to the time of Josef Bielat\u2019s death was that, when the administrator made demand upon an official of the bank for the $300, he stated that Josef Bielat died on March 29, 1905. This declaration out of court by the administrator has no probative force as evidence of death or time of death. In addition to testimony that letters testamentary were issued to plaintiff, the only other evidence adduced was a passbook of the account of the deceased with defendant, produced by the defendant under a subpcena duces tecum served upon it, from which it appeared that the deceased had deposited .with defendant on January 31,1905, the sum of $300, and had withdrawn said sum on March 30, 1905. As there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>a complete failure of proof as to the date of the death of Josef Bielat, there was no evidence that at the time of his death there was any money belonging to the deceased on deposit with defendant. The admission in the answer that during his lifetime the deceased had deposited said sum with defendant cannot be construed as an admission that at the time ' of his death said sum was still on deposit, accompanied as it was with an express denial that any sum was so held at the time of Josef Bielat\u2019s death, and of the proof from the passbook that on March 30, 1905, said sum was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">The cases relied on by plaintiff as to the affirmative duty of defendant to prove a rightful payment to the one entitled thereto after the death of a depositor have no application to the facts here disclosed. Had it been shown that Joseph Bielat died on March 29, 1905, a prima facie case might have been presented in favor of plaintiff. The complaint was properly dismissed, and the order setting aside the dismissal and granting a new trial was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Order reversed, and motion denied, with costs to appellant in this court and $10 costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
