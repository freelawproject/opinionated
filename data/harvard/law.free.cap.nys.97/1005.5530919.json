Gouge, 13 Abb. Prac. 315), it is clear that the complaint does not set forth any legal measure of damages. (Heyward v. Willmarth, 87 App. Div. 125, 84 N. Y. Supp. 75; Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Durant-Lane Improvement Co., 144 N. Y. 34, 39 N. E. 7). The motion to vacate the attachment should therefore have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
