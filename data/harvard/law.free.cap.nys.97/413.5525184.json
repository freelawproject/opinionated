The constitution and by-laws are in the Polish. language. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>translation thereof is in the record, but parts thereof were interpreted and read\u2019in \"evidence. It seems that the object of the society-is \u201cto pay sick arid death benefits.\u201d When the intestate fell ill he was entitled, under the constitution and the by-laws, to receive during his illness certain weekly sums graded for six months, three riionths, and then $2 weekly during the\u2019 period of illness. He fell ill on\" May 3, 1898, and received sick benefits until March 10, 1902; but thereafter nothing. This action is to recover the sum of the $2 weekly payments for the period intervening March 10, 1902, and his death. The defendant showed that on March 10, 1902, the constitution (?) and'the by-laws were amended so as to prohibit the payment of more than $300 to any member for sick benefits, and proved that the sum theretofore paid to the intestate exceeded that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">It is not asserted that the intestate ever assented to this change, or that he ever had notice thereof. The appellant contends that such change was within the powers of the association, and cites two authorities, with stress upon Poultney v. Bachman, 131 Hun, 49. His contention is also sustained by the judgment in Pain v. Societ\u00e9 St. Jean Baptiste, 172 Mass. 319; 52 N. E. 502, 70 Am. St. Rep. 287, wherein Poultney\u2019s Case, supra, is cited. But in Parish v. New York Produce Exchange, 169 N. Y. 34, 36, 61 N. E. 977, 56 L. R. A. 149, the court, after mention of the holding in Pain\u2019s Case, supra, on the precise point now up, says that \u201cthe trend of authority in this state is, however, in the other direction.\u201d That is, that such an association cannot under power of amendment divest rights which have vested. Moreover, I think that we are committed to this view by our judgment in Bottjer v. Supreme Council, 178 App. Div. 546, 75 N. Y. Supp. 805, 79 N. Y. Supp. 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs, All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
