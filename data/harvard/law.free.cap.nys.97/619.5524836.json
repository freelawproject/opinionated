The exchange was effected, and subsequently thereto Signed incorporated and organized the defendant Central National Realty &amp; Construction Company, which took the title. Certain transactions by way of mortgage, exchange, sale, and building construction took place, and an agreement 'was made reciting the former agreement between plaintiff and Signed, in which the company\" agreed to pay to plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>certain sums at certain times from the net proceeds of the operations, and a careful method for ascertaining those proceeds was set out,_ and the agreement was that upon the first $10,000 being realized plaintiff should receive $1,600, after the first $10,000 have been realized plaintiff should receive 25 per cent, until an additional $10,000 had been realized; and that after $20,000 had been realized plaintiff should receive 50 per cent, of the net balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\">Plaintiff has made frequent use of the phrase \u201cjoint enterprise or adventure.\u201d The facts are not to be established by mere characterization. Plaintiff\u2019s services were evidently those of a broker, and its claim is for payment therefor. It brought about an exchange of property between owners thereof; and for that service one of them agreed to pay it at an agreed time an agreed sum. It had no title or interest in either of the properties. It acquired neither a vendor\u2019s nor a vendee\u2019s lien. It does not profess to have acquired any title to the property, to have expended any money thereon, or to be entitled to any use or possession thereof. Its sole claim is to a certain sum from the realized net proceeds of sale thereof, after the deduction of all moneys, with all interest thereon, actually expended by the company in improving the properties, in carrying them, in paying off any mortgages upon them, or any taken in exchange, and all moneys actually expended in effecting exchanges and in acquiring and making sales. I do not understand that a broker acquires a lien upon real property, the sale or exchange of which he has negotiated, for his fees. Nor that such an interest is produced by an agreement to pay his fees out of the net proceeds after realization. It does not seem that he has a right to have the property sold for such purpose at his will, nor that the court could sell it at his instance. It may be that, as to the proceeds, he has a right to have the amount thereof determined and his share ascertained, and in such case would have the right to test the good faith of the sales and to establish the actual amounts realized thereon. The difficulty is, however, that on a motion to cancel a lis pendens we are not authorized to look into the facts as upon a trial, nor to search the complaint as upon a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In Mills v. Bliss, 55 N. Y. 139, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">\u201cWhether the action can be sustained is not a question to be passed upon on this appeal. The plaintiff may fail to prove the facts alleged, or the court may hold that the action is untenable upon the facts stated. * * * The questions of fact as well as of law must be disposed of upon the trial and hearing of the cause. They cannot be determined upon an interlocutory motion. That the action, upon the theory upon which it is brought and upon the complaint as framed, does affect the title to real property, asserting as it does a legal and equitable right to a lien thereon, cannot be questioned, and upon the face of the complaint the notice of lis pendens was properly filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Brainerd v. White, 12 Abb. N. C. (N. Y.) 407, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\u201cIn this present case\u2019, if the motion had been granted,- It would have been in consequence of the defendant contending that the plaintiff had not legal right to have the real estate charged, and of the court so holding. That would have been a determination of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, against him. * * * The matter cannot Be heard upon motion. Under section 1670 the nature of the judgment which'the action is brought to recover is the description of' the action which' a notice of lis' pendens may be filed, and not the validity of the cause of action, as. described.in the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In Brox v. Riker, 56 App. Div., at page 391, 67 N. Y, Supp., at page 774, Mr. Justice Ingraham said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">\u201cI think it must be apparent that upon a motion of this character the court cannot determine whether or not the action is well brought, or critically examine the complaint to see whether a demurrer to it would be sustained. If the object of the action is to recover a judgment specified in section 1670 of the Code, the court has no power to cancel the notice of pendency of action because it would be of the opinion from the allegations of the complaint that the action could not be maintained for that purpose. Where, however, the action is brought for an entirely different purpose than that specified in this section of the Code, having no possible relation to real property, and where there are no allegations in the complaint which would bring the action within the class of those which affect the title to real property, a mere demand for a judgment which is entirely foreign to the cause of action alleged would not justify the plaintiff in filing the notice. Whether or not the action is brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to real property must be determined by the allegations of the complaint, and if no fact is alleged which would justify such a judgment, and where the complaint as a whole shows that the action is brought merely to enforce a personal obligation of the defendant which has no relation to the real estate described it would seem to be clear that such an action is not one brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to real property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In St. Regis Paper Co. v. Santa Clara Co., 62 App. Div. 538, 71 N. Y. Supp. 82, there was a motion made to cancel the lis pendens. The court upon a prior appeal in the same case, where the question of the injunction was under consideration, had said, \u201cThis contract is one relating to chattels, and in no sense is it a contract relating to realty,\u201d and very strongly intimated that action could not be maintained; and thereafter the trial court had dismissed the complaint. The plaintiff, however, had appealed. Mr. Justice Kellogg, speaking for the Appellate Division of the Third Department, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201cIf the complaint discloses the clear purpose to be the recovery of a judgment affecting real property, its use, possession, or enjoyment, the right to file a lis pendens is assured by section 1670. * * * The contest over all the matters set forth in the complaint, as also over the sufficiency of the complaint or of the facts therein stated, or of the right to maintain the action, must all be fought out in the action itself. * * \u00bb It is only where it is apparent from the complaint that the action is not brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to, or the possession, use, or enjoyment of, real property\u2014that is, that such is not the purpose of the action\u2014that a court on motion may direct the cancellation of the record of the notice on grounds other than those prescribed in section 1674.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">And the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">So in the case at bar, looking into the complaint as drawn, the purpose of it was to procure a judgment affecting the title to real estate. It alleges that the transfers were in the agreement itself \u201csubject to the express arrangement that the premises were subject to the rights of the plaintiff under the said agreement of July 24, 1902\u201d; that certain conveyances were \u201cwithout consideration and void as against this plaintiff, in fraud of its rights, and were a trick and device * * * by which said defendants attempted to divest itself if its property, and put the same out of reach of the plaintiff, and to reserve for its own benefit and use property which would otherwise be applicable to the payment of the net amount due the plaintiff under said joint enterprise and adventure\u201d; and, further, that it intends by this same trick and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>device to get rid of the remaining properties now standing unconveyed of record in its name, and defraud the plaintiffs' of its rights, unless the court comes to the equitable aid of the plaintiff. The judgment demanded is that the rights and interests of plaintiff in the property unconveyed may be ascertained and settled, the property sold under the direction of the court, the proceeds divided in accordance with the agreement, \u201cand that plaintiff be declared to have a lien in its favor for such amounts as it may be entitled to,\u201d that the defendants account for any and all property which came into their hands under said joint enterprise or adventure as well as the value or proceeds thereof, and that an injunction issue against their disposing of said real property. It thus appears that, whether the complaint be good or bad, the purpose of the action is to have a lien upon real property declared and enforced; and therefore the action is brought to recover a judgment affecting the title to, or the possession, use, or enjoyment of, real property. Being so, the right to file the lis pendens was absolute, not resting in the discretion of the court, but conferred by statute, and, having been properly filed, it cannot be canceled, except pursuant to section 1674 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Beman v. Todd, 124 N. Y. 114, 26 N. E. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
