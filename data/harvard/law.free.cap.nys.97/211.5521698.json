It appeared that the defendant had prevented complete performance of the work upon the latter building under the contract, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony left no doubt of the fact that he had not fully performed the work; indeed, he stated that he had finished only three-quarters of it, while leaving materials sufficient upon the premises to finish it. There was no proof of the reasonable value of the work done or omitted, nor of prospective profits lost; and the recovery of $300 is based, apparently, on nothing other than the contract price for the work. This contract, however, which stated only a gross price for completed work, was no measure of the value of the partial work done, and a recovery of the full price was thus, to some indeterminable degree, excessive and unwarranted by the proof.
