The determination of the question turns upon the construction to be put upon the will of one John Tice, who died on or about the 31st of December, 1832, seised of the premises described in the complaint. If the title to such real estate passed under the will of Tice to his widow, then the plaintiffs have good title, and defendants do not own, and have no interest in, such land. The trial\" court reached the conclusion that the widow never had good title because Tice intended by his will to dispose of only his personal estate, and as-to his- real estate he died intestate. It is true the will commences with the statement that the testator wishes to \u201cmake a suitable disposition of all such personal property\u201d as he might leave; but this-does not indicate, when the balance of the will is read in connection with it, an intent not to dispose of anything but personal property. On the contrary, what follows indicates, as it seems to me, a clear and well-defined intent to dispose of all his property, both \u2018real and personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">After the recital referred to the testator proceeded to dispose of his household furniture by gift to his wife, with the exception of certain articles which he gave to one of his daughters. He then proceeded to dispose of his interest in certain cloths manufactured in a certain factory, and then directed that certain accounts between him and one Higgins be adjusted and a balance struck, which should be paid to his executrix and executor to be applied by them to the payment of his debts. Then followed this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201cAnd it is my. will and wish that all other property of which I may die possessed, be applied to the payment of my debts, and I hereby give and bequeath to my wife Mary all the rest, residue and remainder of my property, after my debts are paid, to have and to hold the same for her and her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The. will was evidently drafted by the testator himself or by some person unfamiliar with drafting a paper of this kind; but, notwithstanding that fact, more comprehensive language could scarcely have been used in the residuary clause if he intended to dispose of all the property which he possessed. \u201cAll other property\u201d is disposed of without limitation, and this is to be applied to the payment of his debts and after such application, if anything is left, the wife is to take \u201call the rest, residue and remainder.\u201d There are no words of exclusion or limitation. The gift to the wife is \u201call the rest, residue and remainder of my property.\u201d This included real estate in which an absolute fee was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">It is true the word \u201cdevise\u201d is the appropriate term to pass title to real estate, and \u201cbequeath\u201d the term applicable to gifts of personal property, but a strict adherence to technical words is not neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sary to give effect to a testator\u2019s intent (Lasher v. Lasher, 13 Barb. 106), and the fact that the word \u201cdevise\u201d was not used does not prevent the title to real estate passing by the use of the word \u201cbequeath.\u201d Lamb v. Lamb, 131 N. Y. 227, 30 N. E. 133. The intention of a testator, when it can be ascertained from the language used, will be allowed to control the legal operation of words, however technical. Indeed, it has been held that words and phrases may be transposed, or even inserted or- left out of a provision, if it becomes necessary to do so in order to carry out a clearly expressed intention of a testator. Wager v. Wager, 96 N. Y. 164. The fact that the testator made a will at all creates a fair presumption that he intended to dispose of all his property (Byrnes v. Baer, 86 N. Y. 210), and this presumption is strengthened when it is considered in connection with the rule which favors a construction preventing a partial intestacy. Schult v. Moll, 132 N. Y. 122, 30 N. E. 377; Johnson v. Brasington, 156 N. Y. 181, 50 N. E. 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">I am of the opinion, -therefore, that by the use in the residuary clause of the words \u201call other property\u201d the testator intended to include his real estate. The doctrine seems to be established that where the residuary bequest is not circumscribed by clear expressions in the instrument, and the title of the residuary legatee is not narrowed by special words of unmistakable import, the residuary legatee will take whatever may fall into the residue. Morton v. Woodbury, 153 N. Y. 243, 47 N. E. 283. If the foregoing conclusions be correct, then it follows that the title to the real estate in question passed under the will of Tice to his widow, and the plaintiffs, having succeeded to her interest, have good title to the land described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
