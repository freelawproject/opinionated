Under these circumstances, the defendant, by virtue of such lien, was entitled to retain the possession of the wagon until the amount due was paid, and hence was not guilty of a conversion by refusing to deliver the same to the plaintiff. From this it is clear that there should have been judgment for the defendant, and we would so modify the judgment, without costs, if we have the power to do so in such a case as this. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel upon the argument was given the opportunity of obtaining a return of the wagon in controversy upon payment of the amount of the loan, and thus to end the litigation; but he refused to accept such offer, and insisted upon a reversal of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, but, under the circumstances, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
