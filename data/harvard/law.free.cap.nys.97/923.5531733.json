Stein, Surgeon Dentist, B. C., 220 E. Broadway, Cor. Clinton Street, New York.\u201d The defendant was examined in his own behalf, and testified that the witness for the prosecution came into the dental office in which he was employed on the 28th day of January and wanted some work done when the registered man was out at dinner. He does not deny that he operated upon this witness, and does not claim that he has ever received a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">At the end of the people\u2019s case a general motion to dismiss was made, which was denied. At the end of the whole case the question was submitted to the court,' who found the defendant guilty. There was no suggestion that there was any failure of proof as to the locality of the office in which the defendant was engaged in practicing dentistry, or that 220 East Broadway was not in the county of New York. If the defendant had intended to rely upon the failure of proof that 220 East Broadway was in the county of New York, the attention of the court should have been called to the evidence when it could have readily been supplied. The jurisdiction of the court was not questioned. There was no substantial dispute about the facts. It was assumed by all the parties that East Broadway was in the county of New York, and I think this point is not available for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">The defendant also claims that'the testimony of the employes of the dental society, who were witnesses for the prosecution, was not corroborated, and that the conviction was improper without such corroboration. If such corroboration was necessary, though it was not, the defendant himself, by his testimony, corroborated the testimony of these witnesses. The defendant was clearly guilty, and was properly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">The judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
