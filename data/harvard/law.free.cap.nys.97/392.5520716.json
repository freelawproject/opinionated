The case, as made, justified a recovery. Briggs v. Boyd, 56 N. Y. 289. The cases relied upon by defendant to sustain the contention that the Municipal Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action upon a quasi contract (Harrington v. City of New York, 40 Misc. Rep. 165, 81 N. Y. Supp. 667; Goldstein v. Abramson [Sup.] 86 N. Y. Supp. 30) have been overruled by the Appellate Division (Pache v. Oppenheim, 93 App. Div. 221, 87 N. Y. Supp. 704).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
