On a motion to dismiss inferences most favorable to plaintiff\u2019s case must be drawn, and it cannot be said from the facts developed that there was not evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence in failing to observe the automobile, which was running ahead of it for some distance so near the track as to make a collision inevitable if the car attempted to pass it.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">If plaintiff\u2019s testimony be true, it was not negligence on his part to fail to look behind for approaching cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
