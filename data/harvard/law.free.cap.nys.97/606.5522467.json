The plaintiff was awarded the preference allowed by the Code, entitling him to have his case preferred over the cases noticed for the same term, but his application for a further preference was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">The action was commenced on November 36, 1904. On the 36th day of January, 1905, the defendant served an answer admitting the making of the notes, but alleging that the same were altered after they were made and delivered, and further alleging that the notes were delivered in pursuance of a usurious agreement between himself and one Muirhead, and that he is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to whether said notes were discounted by the Federal Bank. The objection of the defendant to the granting of this application was a tender consideration for the rights of other litigants which may be effected by giving this action a preference; but, considering the necessity of a prompt settlement of the affairs of this insolvent corporation and the peremptory order that has been granted requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>this plaintiff to file his accounts as receiver, we think the court might well have given to this case a preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It would appear that the main question here is whether the bank is a bona fide holder for value before maturity of these notes. That question can certainly be disposed of without a protracted trial, so that the rights of other litigants will not be seriously affected by allowing this action to be promptly disposed of. The delay of the plaintiff in promptly commencing the action and noticing the case for trial should not be given controlling influence in an action where the plaintiff sues as receiver. If the plaintiff were a private individual seeking to enforce his rights, I should be disposed to think that his failure to promptly notice the case for trial after it was at issue would be a sufficient reason for denying his application; but under the circumstances I do not think that the delay should defeat the right of the people to have the offices of this insolvent corporation closed up as soon as possible; and to accomplish this, and to enable the receiver to comply with the order of the court and render the final.accounting at the time required, the order should be reversed, and the plaintiff awarded a preference on the Trial Term calendar, with $10 costs and disbursements of this appeal, to abide the final event of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
