J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEd\">This is an action by a real estate broker for commission. Unlike most of such actions, it is brought against the purchaser. The plaintiff brought to defendant\u2019s attention some houses 'which were for sale, and was authorized to buy them upon certain terms. The sale was never consummated, and the property was sold to some one else. Plaintiff, persisting, next solicited authority from the defendant to negotiate for the purchase of the contract of sale. He was unable, however, to negotiate such a purchase on terms acceptable to the defendant, and while he was working at it another broker step<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>ped in, and procured an offer acceptable to and accepted by defendant. To charge a purchaser with liability for commissions requires satisfactory proof of a special contract to that effect, for in the usual course of business it is the seller, and not the purchaser, who pays the commission. There is no proof of such a contract, and there is positive proof that plaintiff never brought about the sale. Doubtless, he was active and energetic in his efforts, but he failed. There was nothing in the evidence to justify the judgment. Upon the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
