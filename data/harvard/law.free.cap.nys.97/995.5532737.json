There is not the slightest evidence of such use, and in the light of defendants\u2019 apparent admission by letter, that some of the skins had been injured in the dyeing, we cannot say that the jury were uninfluenced by the incompetent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event.
