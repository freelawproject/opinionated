Cuyler v. Vanderwerk, 1 Johns. Cas. (2d Ed.) 247, note. The rule recites that the d\u00e9-fendant answered before making the application, and the point is made by the respondent that the defendant not having made the motion until after serving its amended answer, waived by its laches any right which it might have had to the stay. In the case cited, it is said: \u201cPer Curiam. The defendant is never too late, pending the second suit, before the' trial, to make his application to stay the proceedings.\" In Jackson v. Miller, 3 Cow. 57, the motion was made after a verdict in the second action had been taken subject to the opinion of the court; objection was made that the application came too late: \u201c Per Curiam. The application comes before us in season, if made at any time while the cause is in a course of litigation.\u201d In Spaulding v. American Wood Board Co., 58 App. Div. 314, 68 N. Y. Supp. 945, the case relied upon by the respondent, the motion was made although not heard, before an answer was served. That fact was referred to in the opinion, and it was observed, that the motion was in time, from which it might be inferred that the motion should be made before serving an answer. But as there was no discussion of the question, the case cannot be regarded as an authority for overturning the long established rule, that the right is absolute, and that the application for the stay may be made at any time while the cause is in the course of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs, and disbursements, and order restraining plaintiff\u2019s further proceedings until payment of the costs of the former action granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
