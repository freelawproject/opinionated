Miller, \u2022under the firm name and style of McEwen &amp; Miller; that said Miller was a man of large resources, whereas,\u00bbin truth, said Miller and said defendant had not formed a copartnership. With this complaint there was submitted to the judge who granted the order of arrest the affidavit of the general manager of the plaintiff in the city of New York, who deposes to the representations made by the defendant, and that he \u2022obtained the merchandise upon such representations; the affidavit of the treasurer of the plaintiff that it relied on such representation; and the affidavit of Miller, who deposes that there was never such a firm and that he never was in business with the defendant. Upon these affidavits an order of arrest was granted, whereupon the defendant moved to vacate such order of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Although an affidavit of the defendant was submitted, he does not deny any of the facts stated. Assuming that the verification of the complaint is irregular, in that the venue is laid in the state of New York and county of New York, when it appears from the certificate of the notary publicthat the affidavit of notification was taken before a notary publicinthe stateof New Jersey, it is as good as an unverified complaint. The affidavits clearly establish the representations upon which the goods were sold, the falsity of the representations, and bring the case within section 549 of the Code, which provides that a defendant may be arrested where it is alleged in the complaint that the defendant was guilty of a fraud in contracting or incurring a liability. Section 557 of the Code provides that the order may be granted in the case specified in section 549 of the act, where it appears by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or-any other person, that a sufficient cause of action exists against the defendant, as prescribed in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">It follows that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs arid disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
