The sons who predeceased the testator left issue. The question is whether the bequest of this mortgage was to the sons as a class so that the two who survived their father took, or whether it was the intention of the testator to devise it to the four sons living at the time he made the will, so that the issue of the deceased sons would take their parent\u2019s share. It is important to note that concerning the heirs of the sons he uses the disjunctive which implies a substitution of the heirs for a deceased son. He directs that upon the death of his wife the principal of the mortgage be divided equally between \u201cmy sons or their heirs.\u201d He anticipated that one or more of his sons might die prior to the division, at least; and the question is, did he not anticipate that this might happen before his own death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>and intend that, in either event, the heirs of the deceased son should take the share intended for the parent? Light is shed on the true construction of the will by the second clause in which he names his four sons, and devises and bequeathes to thepi \u201cor. their heirs\u201d the rest, residue, and remainder of his property in equal shares. It is not questioned but that the issue of the deceased sons take their parent\u2019s share in the remainder here bequeathed and such is and would \"be, even if the word heirs was not used, the construction required by section 52 of the statute of wills (2 Rev. St. [1st Ed.] pt.. 2, c. 6, tit. 1), which provides.that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201cWhenever any estate, real or personal, shall he devised or bequeathed to <em>a. </em>child or other descendant of the testator, and such legatee or devisee shall die during the lifetime of the testator, leaving a child or other descendants who shall survive such testator, such devise or legacy shall not lapse, but the property so devised or bequeathed shall vest in the surviving child or other descendants of the legatee or devisee, as if such legatee or devisee had survived the testator and had died intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The testator is presumed to have' known the' law. Presumably, therefore, he knew that if any of his own children should die during his own lifetime leaving issue, such issue would share in the remainder. Now did he intend a different rule with respect to the principal of the mortgage? There is nothing to indicate that he did. The failure to name his children in the first clause when he intended to name them in the second, and knew that they were named in the second, is not evidence of such intention. On the contrary, we think it quite clear that by the designation \u201csons\u201d in the first clause of the will he did not mean such sons as would survive him, but he meant his sons then living, who were named in the second clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">It follows,- therefore, that the learned surrogate properly construed the will, and the decree should be affirmed, \"with separate bills of costs to the respondents appearing separately, payable by the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
