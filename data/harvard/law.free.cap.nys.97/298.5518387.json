The notice of appeal was returned upon the ground that it was served after the time to appeal had expired. The defendant seeks relief from the default upon the ground that the notice of entry of judgment, as served upon him, was defective and insufficient to start running the time within which to appeal. The sole defect relied upon is that, while the judgment is signed \u201cThomas F. Smith, Clerk,\u201d the copy served upon defendant\u2019s attorney is signed \u201cThos. F. Smith, Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">The simple abbreviation of the word \u201cThomas\u201d to \u201cThos.,\u201d in the clerk\u2019s signature upon the copy judgment served upon the defendant\u2019s attorney, seems, alone, insufficient to invalidate the. notice of entry from which to start running the time to appeal.' Gabay v. Doane, 38 Misc. Rep. 661, 78 N. Y. Supp. <em>224, </em>upon which the defendant relies, is distinguishable, in that two other mistakes occurred in the copy judgment. See, also, Falker v. Railroad Co., 100 N. Y. 86, <em>2 </em>N. E. 628; People v. Keator, 101 N. Y. 610, 3 N. E. 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
