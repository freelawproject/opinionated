Two of the pads were then produced, and the witness testified that they were two of the pads delivered by the witness to Bendt, and that about 9 o\u2019clock on the same evening Bendt returned very drunk, and upon an examination of his tickets it was found that nine pads of tickets of 100 each were missing. The witness then testified that each of these tickets represented 33 cents. Bendt testified that he was in the employ of Bradley as a ticketman; that he received these tickets from the former witness in Bradley\u2019s office on Friday, January 22, 1905, and that he carried them in a canvas bag furnished to him by Bradley; that after he received the tickets he went to a saloon and had a drink, and after that, as he left the saloon on the southwest corner of Twenty-Fourth street and Third avenue, some one struck him in the back of the neck and took the tickets out of the bag. The two pads of tickets produced and introduced in evidence the witness identified as the tickets that were in his bag and which were stolen from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Another witness was called and testified that he was one of the dock foremen employed by Bradley on the dock between Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets, at the East river; that his duty was to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the load tickets and give out pay tickets in exchange for them, and superintend the dumping; that the pads of-tickets that were in evidence were load tickets; that about half-past 6 or 20 minutes before 7 o\u2019clock on the evening of January 27, 1905, the defendant, in policeman\u2019s uniform, came to the witness, accompanied by a young man about 24 years of age, dressed in dark clothes; that the witness and the two men talked together for about 10 minutes, when the man with the defendant said that he had about-500 tickets altogether and wanted to dispose of them; that the defendant had in his possession two of the pads and the other man had three; that he offered to sell them to the witness for $50; that the defendant said the man had not gotten the tickets right. The witness said he could get the $50 and made an appointment with the defendant\u2019s companion to meet him Saturday afternoon at the same place, when the defendant said that he had to be back on reserve at the station house. The defendant then spoke about repeating the appointment for the following day, and that he would be there also. Both the defendant and the man with him made an appointment to meet the witness on the following day. After the defendant showed the witness these two pads of tickets he put them back in his coat. The next time the witness saw the defendant was in the station house on the evening that he was arrested. The witness further testified that these load tickets had a value of 33 cents each, and that he was not allowed to issue a pay ticket to anybody who did not present a load ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Another witness was called who kept a cigar store in Hudson street. He testified that on Saturday, January 28, 1905, the defendant dame to his store, and after staying there a short time laid these two packages of tickets down, and said he would call for them on the following day, and that the next day the captain of the precinct came and obtained the tickets, and the two packages of tickets introduced in evidence were those that the witness received from the defendant and delivered to the police captain. An employ\u00e9 of the district attorney\u2019s office testified that he had an interview with the defendant at the station house; that defendant said that on Friday evening (January 27th) he was in a saloon at Eighteenth street and Third avenue, and that a man known to him as Pending came in the saloon and said that he had robbed a man of some snow tickets; that Pending gave defendant two packages of these tickets; that with these tickets in his possession he had heard Pending offer to sell them to Bradley\u2019s employ\u00e9 for $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The only point insisted on by the defendant is that these tickets were of no value, and were not the subject of larceny. I think it clear 'that the person stealing them from Bendt was guilty of larceny under section 528 of the Penal Code. Section 536 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u201cAll the provisions of this chapter apply to cases where the property taken is an instrument for the payment of .money, an evidence of debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">And section 545 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u201cIf the thing stolen consists of a written instrument, being an evidence of debt, other than a public or corporate certificate; script, bond, or security having a market value, or being the transfer of or evidence of title to any .property, or. .of. the creating,-releasing, or-discharging of any .demand, right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>or obligation, the amount o\u00ed money due thereupon or secured to be paid thereby and remaining unsatisfied, or which, in any contingency, might be collected thereupon or thereby &lt;= * * is deemed the value of the thing stolen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Section 550 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cA person who buys or receives any stolen property, or any property which has been wrongfully appropriated in such a manner as to constitute larceny according to this chapter, knowing the same to have been stolen or so dealt with, or who corruptly, for any money, property, reward or promise or agreement for the same, conceals, withholds or aids in concealing or withholding any property, knowing the same to have been stolen or appropriated wrongfully in such a manner as to constitute larceny under the provisions of this chapter * * * is guilty of criminally receiving such property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The evidence is quite clear that these tickets were stolen, and that the defendant received them knowing them to have been stolen, and took part in a negotiation for selling the tickets to Bradley\u2019s employ\u00e9. With such knowledge, he concealed them on his person, instead of delivering them to Bradley\u2019s employ\u00e9, and subsequently took them to this cigar store, and left them there, where they were found by the police captain. It is true that these tickets did not upon their face provide for the payment of money, but they were tickets which, when delivered with a load of snow at the dock, entitled the person delivering them to receive from Bradley the sum of 33 cents for each ticket. They were this \u201cevidence of * * * the creating * * * of a demand, right or obligation.\u201d No one engaged in removing snow could secure from Bradley the money to be paid for carting the snow from the street to the dump except upon presentation of such a ticket. The obligation of Bradley to pay. consisted of proof that the man claiming the pay had removed the load of snow from the street to the dock from which it was dumped. These tickets were a necessary part of the creation of an obligation of Bradley to pay 33 cents for each ticket. Under section 545 of the Penal Code it was not necessary that the tickets should upon their face bear an obligation to pay money, but, where they were written instruments which was evidence of the creating of a demand, right, or obligation, they were a subject of larceny; and in determining the grade of the offense the amount of money which in any contingency might be collected thereupon or thereby was deemed- to be the value of the thing stolen. Each of these tickets, therefore, was under this provision to be deemed of the value of 33 cents, and undoubtedly the person that stole them was guilty of grand larceny under section <em>528 </em>of the Penal Code. That being so, the defendant was guilty of receiving the stolen property. None of the cases cited by the defendant have any application.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">It follows that the evidence satisfactorily shows that these instru-' ments were within section 545 of the Penal Code; that the defendant was clearly guilty of receiving them, knowing them to have been stolen; and that the judgment was right, and is affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
