Upon the trial the physician, who attended the plaintiff and dressed the wounds' received by her, testified with considerable certainty as to the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s head, but stated that he was unable to say that such injuries were \u201clikely\u201d to be permanent. The following question was then asked him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-15\">\u201cIf the witness testified at this present time, which is four months past the time of receiving the injury that she still has spells, when her head is turned around she feels dizziness, is it your opinion as a physician that this is apt to be permanent?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">This was objected to, the objection was overruled, and the witness answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-17\">\u201cThe tendency would be that some portion of it would remain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-18\">A motion to strike out this answer was denied. This was error. The answer viewed in the light of the physician\u2019s previous testimony was manifestly speculative and indefinite, and was not followed by any testimony showing or tending to show what portion of the trouble complained of as being in the plaintiff\u2019s head would remain, nor was it shown that he could -state with reasonable certainty that any portion of it would be permanent. See Raynor v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 106 App. Div. 449, 94 N. Y. Supp. 632; Boland v. N. Y. City Ry. Co. (App. Term Nov. 1905) 96 N. Y. Supp. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">What effect th\u00e9 admission of such improper evidence may have had upon the jury it is impossible to determine, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to\" appellant to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
