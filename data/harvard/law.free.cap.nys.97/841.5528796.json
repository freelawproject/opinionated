Plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">\u201cAs soon as the car went across the track and struck the second curve it jogged me like that and I was thrown off and I didn\u2019t know any more. It was not the ordinary jog of turning that I had experienced before. * * * I knew of this bend in the car tracks crossing Fulton street; I knew there-was a bend there. And I knew where I was when the car got there. I knew the car was crossing those tracks. The ear stopped just before crossing Fulton street, and then it did not start up with the bell in the usual way to go across, it started off very quick. He put on the power first, and then he-put on more, and it shot across the track so fast I didn\u2019t have time to think where I was, and as soon as he struck the second curve, I was thrown. He put it on very quick. I didn\u2019t see how much he put on, but I could feel it. I didn\u2019t have hold of anything. There wasn\u2019t anything to take hold of. * * * I didn\u2019t notice a rail there, I had my back turned. I did not look to see whether there was anything' to take hold of. * * * I say this car was going fast across those tracks and I knew the bend was there that that bend would swing the car around when it went around that fast. I didn\u2019t have that thought about me. I didn\u2019t think much about that. I knew it was there, and I did not take hold of anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">One witness for the plaintiff, who observed the movement of the car from the sidewalk, testified that it came around \"pretty swift,\u201d that it seemed \"to be going quick speed.\u201d \u201cMy attention to the accident was first attracted by the car 'coming around so fast, I said there will be something doing some day these cars going at such a rate.\u201d Another witness testified that he observed the car, and that it was going at the rate of nine miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">On behalf of the defendant evidence was introduced tending to prove that the plaintiff was intoxicated, and that the conductor requested him to step inside the car, but that he refused to do so. Three witnesses, passengers, who were standing up in the car, testified that they did not observe anything unusual about the motion of the car. It appeared that people were standing in the aisle and upon the platform from which the plaintiff fell, but it does not appear that the equilibrium of any other person was disturbed by the motion of the car in rounding the curve. While it is well settled that it is not negligence per se for a passenger to occupy a position on the platform of a crowded car if accepted as a passenger, such person must be held to assume the ordinary risks-incident to such a position. This proposition seems so clear as to require neither argument nor citation of authority to support it. Every one knows that in the usual operation of cars propelled by electricity there is inevitably a certain amount of jolting and swaying particularly when rounding curves. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that he was thrown from the car by reason of some unusual movement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>caused by its negligent operation, and in my judgment the characterization of the speed of the car as \u201cpretty swift,\u201d and as \u201cabout nine miles an hour,\u201d and of the movement as not being an \u201cordinary jog,\u201d is insufficient to make a case, particularly where, it appears that other persons in the same situation as the plaintiff observed nothing unusual. Moskowitz v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 89 App. Div. 425, 85 N. Y. Supp. 960; Id., 183 N. Y., 76 N. Y. 1101; Ayers v. Rochester Railway Co., 156 N. Y. 104, 50 N. E. 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony he was doing nothing whatever to protect himself, and it is just as likely that the ordinary movement incident to the rounding of a curve was the force that caused him to fall as it is that any unusual thing occurred, but even if I am in error in this regard, it must be clear that the plaintiff has entirely failed to prove freedom from contributory negligence. The plaintiff knew all about the situation, he knew that he was in a position that exposed himself to the danger of being thrown by any jolting or swaying of the car, and yet according to his own testimony he did nothing whatever to protect himself, and did not even look to see whether there was anything from which he could obtain support. In the absence of any evidence tending to show the exercise on his part of the slightest care, I do not see how it is possible to hold that he met the burden of proving freedom from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">It, therefore, follows that the judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
