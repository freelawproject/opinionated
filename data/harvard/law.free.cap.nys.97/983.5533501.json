The only circumstances that connects defendant\u2019s servants with the occurrence is that two of them were working on one of the floors above, around the opening where the accident happened, and that about half an hour before the occurrence, when some rubbish fell through the opening, one of defendant\u2019s workmen, in response to the remonstrance by plaintiff, \u201cWhat are you doing there? Why don\u2019t you let a fellow know when you are throwing anything down?\u201d answered, \u201cIt is about time we got a chance at you.\u201d The trial justice put the defendant to its proof, and it appeared that pieces of rubbish had fallen through the opening in question during the day of the accident from floors above the one that defendant\u2019s men were working on, and that the workmen employed on these upper floors were employ\u00e9s of plaintiff\u2019s employer, who were engaged in removing pieces of terra cotta and other rubbish preparatory to the laying of flooring. That the work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>men not employed by defendant were engaged in removing rubbish on the upper floors was admitted by the plaintiff and his witnesses. .Defendant\u2019s workmen positively denied that at any time they dropped any object or permitted anything to fall through the opening, and it is consistent with 'the facts that the remark made by one .of the defendant\u2019s workmen when some rubbish had previously fallen was jocular, and not intended as an admission that he was to blame for it. Be that as it may, however, neither the plaintiff nor his witnesses knew what it was that struck him. There is also a complete and absolute absence of identity of the character of the thing that caused the injury, and whether it was stone, terra cotta, wood, or metal would be idle conjecture. The plaintiff\u2019s men were engaged upon ironwork, and they positively asserted that they were not using any tools in .connection with their work at the time of the accident, and that the only articles of small bulk that they were then using were bolts and nuts, which were affixed with the hand, and that none of 'these had been dropped. There is thus a total lack of proof as to the identity of the object that struck the plaintiff, and no proof whatever that the object was seen to come from the floor upon which defendant\u2019s workmen were working. Added to this deficiency of proof, we have the established fact that others were engaged in upper-floors removing d\u00e9bris, and that rubbish had.previously been dropped by them through the opening in question. Under such conditions, plaintiff has failed to establish a case of negligence against the defendant. Wolf v. American Nat. Society, 164 N. Y. 30, 58 N. E. 31, 51 L. R. A. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
