J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3O\">The verdict was clearly against the weight of the evidence;' The'witnesses for the plaintiff, as to the happening of the accident, were the driver of the wagon and one bystander. The driver\u2019s-evidence was of a character which gave no clear idea of how the accident happened. The bystander testified that the car was coming north on the easterly track, at a high rate of speed, about midway between Thirty-Seventh and Thirty-Eighth streets when the wagon was at the southwest corner of Thirty-Eighth street and Ninth avenue, and that the driver went right ahead, and drove in front of the car. One of the car driver\u2019s versions seems to agree with this story, which in consistent with the testimony given by .all of the defendant\u2019s witnesses that the driver tried to cross' about 15 or 20 feet ahead of the car. The result of the evidence is that the driver saw, or could have seen, the car coming in ample time to avoid a collision; but, either recklessly or stupidly kept on, and drove directly in front of it, thus inviting the collision that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The judgment should be reversed, ard a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
