He had been there walking while the car was coming several hundred feet, at least. The people generally of that locality walked along the track as he did. The deceased was going toward his home, about 600 feet away. ' The electric cars passed each way about once an hour. At the place of the accident the tracks of a steam railroad ran along side of the highway, about 16 feet from the trolley track, and at the time of the accident, or the moment before it, a freight train was passing in the opposite direction, laboring up grade, and making much noise. No bell was rung or other warning given on the trolley car. . \u2022 ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-18\">The jury could have found the foregoing facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b452-19\">.

The deceased had the right to walk'\u2019along the track, but with that right went by .law a duty for him to be ordinarily vigilant with eye and ear to know when a car was coming, and to be out of the way before it got to him, so as not to stop it, or even make it slow up, for it had the right of way. But considering that the electric cars ran only about once an hour, and the distraction of the passing steam freight train along the side of the highway about 16 feet a'w\u00e1y, it-was too much to say as matter of law that the deceased was negligent in not knowing the electric car was coming up so close behind him, especially as no bell was rung or warning given on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
