The questions presented are the same as those presented in Wilcox v. McClellan, as Mayor, etc., et al. (argued and decided herewith) 97 N. Y. Supp. 311, except that neither the rapid transit act nor the amendments thereto have any bearing on the application upon which action is sought to be enjoined herein, and, of course, the provisions of section 18, art. 3, of the Constitution, with respect to the consent of the local authorities to the construction and operation of street railways, have no direct, application to the petition of the telephone company. Neither, however, claims any distinction in principle or that the act can be upheld in part, and both unite in asking a decision on the broad ground as to the jurisdiction of the Legislature to 'vest those powers in the board of' estimate and apportionment, to the exclusion of the board of aldermen. Even if the amendments to the rapid transit act (chapter 631, p. 1550, Laws 1905) should be void on account of the provision concerning the vote on the application, by which a minority might grant the consent, yet since the provision on that subject contained in the amendments to the city charter (chapters 629, 630, pp. 1533, 1548, Laws 1905) would in all cases require at least a majority vote, still power would exist in the board of estimate and apportionment to grant these applications. The decision in the Wilcox Case, adverse to the plaintiff, is decisive of the questions presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs to the respondents, and the order, so far as appealed from, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
