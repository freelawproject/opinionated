The relator raises the point that the determination was void because the deputy police commissioner had not been duly authorized or delegated to make it. No particular defect is assigned, and obviously the contention is based upon the proposition that, inasmuch as the determination up for review was that of an inferior tribunal, it was incumbent on it to show its jurisdiction. The return is that on.or before the 5th day of September, 1902,.Frederick H. E. Ebstein, second deputy commissioner of police, \u201cwas duly designated to hear the evidence upon the said charges.\u201d With this return the relator was satisfied, and came to a hearing thereon. I think, under the circumstances, the relator is confronted with the rule that jurisdiction prima facie may be established by recitals in the record. Potter v. Merchants\u2019 Bank of Albany, 28 N. Y. 641, 653 et seq., 86 Am. Dec. 273; Barber v. Winslow, 12 Wend. 102; Belden v. Meeker, 2 Lans. 470; Smith v. Reid, 134 N. Y. 568, 31 N. E. 1082; Comstock v. Crawford, 3 Wall. 396, 403, 18 L. Ed. 34. If the relator was not satisfied, he could have moved for a further return. People ex rel. Miller v. Wurster, 149 N. Y. 549, 44 N.
