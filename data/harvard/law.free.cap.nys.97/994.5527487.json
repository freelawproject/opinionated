The latter evidently intended to give plaintiff the entire value of the horse, on the assumption that title and possession would remain in defendant. This is a very different thing from giving plaintiff the whole value of the horse, with the right to resume possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-18\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event, unless plaintiff will stipulate to reduce the judgment by $75, in which case the judgment as so modified will be affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
