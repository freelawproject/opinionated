Plaintiffs deposited with the defendant the sum of' $50 on account of said agreement, whereupon the defendant executed and delivered to them^a writing, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">\u201cBrooklyn, N. Y. Aug. 4, \u201904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">\u201cReceived from Messrs. Winter and Kershefskey fifty dollars deposit on \u2022 premises No. 134 Boerum St. Bklyn, N. Y. Price of property six thousand dollars (6,000). Subject to a first mortgage of ($2,600) which is to run for 4 years, a second mortgage of ($1,625) payable one h\u00fandred twenty-five dollars every six months with interest at the rate of 6%. A third mortgage shall be taken by the owner which shall be seven hundred seventy-five dollars to run for four years payable fifty-dollars every six months with interest at U%. Contract to be drawn Monday evening, August 8, 1904, at the office of Mr. Zirn No. 14 Graham Ave. Oity. Two hundred and fifty dollars to be paid at the drawing of contract. Seven hundred dollars shall be paid at the closing of title. H. Friedman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">The parties met at the time and place named in the instrument, and a disagreement arose as to what the contract to be executed should contain. The plaintiffs insisted that the defendant had agreed to convey the property to them free from tenement house violations, and asked that a provision to that effect be inserted in the contract. The defendant refused to assent to this, and the negotiations ended. The plaintiffs thereupon brought this action to recover the sum deposited. The court upon the trial refused to receive any evidence of the oral agreement or of the conversation between the parties prior to the execution of the above writing, which was held to constitute the contract between the parties in which the oral agreement was merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">It is evident that the paper was executed and delivered as a receipt. It is so designated in the pleadings. I do not think it was intended as a contract. It clearly appears from the evidence that it does not contain all of the agreement then entered into, and it provides in terms for drawing a formal contract. It has long been held that, when a written instrument is executed as evidence of a part performance of an oral contract, and as incident thereto, there is no merger; and the rule prohibiting parol evidence, the effect of which is to vary or change a written agreement, does not apply where the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>contract was verbal, and the writing was only executed as a part performance of an entire oral agreement. Juilliard v. Chaffee, <em>92 </em>N. Y. 529, 535; Eighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. 288. I think evidence of the parol agreement was competent, and its exclusion by the trial justice was such an error as to call for a reversal of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
