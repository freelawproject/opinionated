The plaintiff used the ticket to Trenton, and on the morning of May 23d boarded a train of the defendant at Trenton to return to New York. The conductor refused to accept the remaining portion of the ticket, which plaintiff tendered him, on the ground that it had .expired at midnight of the day previous, and demanded payment of the regular fare. Upon plaintiff\u2019s refusal to comply, the conductor compelled plaintiff to get off the train at Monmouth Junction. Plaintiff brought this action for damages for being forcibly ejected from the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">The judgment finds no support in the facts. The ticket by its express terms expired on the midnight of the day before plaintiff attempted to use it, and therefore did not entitle plaintiff to carriage on defendant\u2019s train. Plaintiff\u2019s plea that when he purchased the ticket he asked for a six-day ticket, and that plaintiff was entitled to a ticket expiring on May 23d, under the rule of excluding the first day and including the last, has no merit. The ticket does not purport to be a ticket known as a \u201csix-day ticket,\u201d but expressly declares the hour and day when it is to expire. Practically, it may be designated as a six-day ticket, because it was available for use on the day of its issue and for five consecutive days thereafter. But, even if it be assumed that plaintiff was misled when he purchased the ticket in believing that his ticket expired on May 23d, the conductor was justified in assuming the fact as it appeared from the face of the ticket, and it was the passenger\u2019s duty to yield compliance to the demand of the conductor, or else get off the train.
