At the time when this order was granted the appellant was away on his vacation, and service was not made upon him personally. It is claimed, however, that it was served upon his counsel, pursuant to a direction therein contained, who appeared specially upon the return thereof, and called attention to the fact that the \u201cshow cause order\u201d had not been served upon the appellant, and that, as he had ceased to act as his attorney, he had no authority to appear for him in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-21\">We think that in entertaining the proceedings and making the order from which this appeal is taken the learned court at Special Term acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>without jurisdiction. It is true that the attorney upon whom the service was made had appeared as counsel for the appellant upon a motion in this action some months prior to the date of the pretended service upon him, but he had ceased to act for him as his counsel. Even if the relation of counsel and client continued to exist, this would not validate the service of the \u201cshow cause order.\u201d It was a new proceeding, in which it was not pretended that appellant had engaged counsel to represent him. \u201cA proceeding relative to a contempt is a new proceeding, requiring new authority to the attorney. He has no general authority to accept service of an order to show cause in proceedings against the party for contempt. Personal service is necessary.\u201d Weeks, Attys. at Law (2d Ed.) \u00a7 243; Pitt v. Davison, 37 Barb. 97. It is true the appellant was not adjudged in contempt. An entirely different order was made from the one contemplated in the \u201cshow cause order.\u201d The person upon whom it is claimed the service was made had no way of knowing before the hearing the nature of the order to be asked for. In a case where service upon an attorney can properly be made, the notice ought to be so definite that a reasonable opportunity is given to oppose. Here the general prayer for relief did not give such notice. \u201cUnder a general prayer for relief upon a motion, every possible relief should not be granted, but it should be allied to what is asked for.\u201d Boston Nat Bank v. Armour, 50 Hun, 176, 177, 3 N. Y. Supp. 22. Appellant was required to show cause why he should not be adjudged' in contempt. We do not think the order made was akin to that asked by plaintiff. It follows, therefore, that it must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
