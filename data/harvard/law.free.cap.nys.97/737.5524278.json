Defendants denied this allegation, and after issue was joined an order was made, upon plaintiff\u2019s application, requiring that the defendants be examined and their depositions taken as prescribed by section 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>upon the defendants, moved at Special Term to vacate this order, and from the order denying the motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">It appeared in Tenoza v. Pelham Hod Elevating Co., 50 App. Div. 581, 64 N. Y. Supp. 99, to which our attention is called, that the application there was made for the sole purpose of discovering whether any cause of action existed, with the view of discontinuing the action if it .did not, but we cannot say from the record before us that the application was for such a purpose. The defendants having denied that they owned and operated the car, plaintiff\u2019s cause of action fails unless it is shown upon the trial that they did. It appears by the \u00a1affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s guardian ad litem, read on the \u00e1pplication for the .order, that neither she nor the plaintiff had any information upon the subject; that, \u201calthough diligent inquiry and effort has-been made on behalf of the said plaintiff, it has been impossible to obtain any proof in regard thereto or to learn where said proof can be found. All those facts are peculiarly within the personal knowledge of the defendants.\u201d Plaintiff would have a right to call the defendants as witnesses upon the trial, and it is equally clear that their evidence can be taken before trial. Vial v. Jackson, 73 App. Div. 355, 76 N. Y. Supp. 668; Sweeney v. Sturgis, <em>24 </em>Hun, 162; Matter of Application of Nolan, 70 Hun, 536, 24 N. Y. Supp. 238; Clark v. Wilcklow, 75 Hun, 290, 27 N. Y. Supp. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We think, therefore, that the order was properly granted, and the order of the Special Term must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
