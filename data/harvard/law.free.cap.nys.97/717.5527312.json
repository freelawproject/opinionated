The judgment was entered July 7, 1903, upon a decision filed June 38, 1903. The learned trial court stated in the decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">\u201cPursuant to chapter 339, p. G94, of the Laws of 1892, the stone embankment upon which the defendants\u2019 railroad in Park avenue was previously operated was increased in height about 11 feet, and since February 1G, 1897, the defendants have operated their railroad upon said embankment, increased in height as aforesaid. The work done in Park avenue pursuant to chapter 339, p. 694. of the Laws of 1892, and the maintenance of said embankment nt snir[ inm-eased height, and t\u00fc\u00e9 operation of the defendants\u2019 railroad thereon since February 16, 1897, have caused damage to the plaintiff\u2019s said premises, over and above the damages caused by the said railroad as the same was maintained and used prior to 1892; but all of said damages comes within the legal principle of damnum absque injuria, and no one of the defendants is liable therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">And judgment was entered thereon dismissing the complaint on the merits, and with costs. For this decision the court had the direct and controlling authority of Fries v. New York &amp; Harlem R. R., 169 N. Y. 270, 62 N. E. 358, decided in December, 1901. But the doctrine of the Fries Case was overruled in Muhlker v. N. Y. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 197 U. S. 544, 25 Sup. Ct. 522, 49 L. Ed. 872, and in Sander v. State of New York, 182 N. Y. 400, 75 N. E. 234, Chief Judge Cullen said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">\u201cBut on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the Muhlker Case, with several oth\u00e9rs which followed that <em>decision,' </em>was reversed, the Supreme Court holding that under the decisions of this court in the elevated railroad cases, abutting owners had special easem\u00e9nts in a street, an invasion of which by the erection of a viaduct, without compensation for such invasion, was taking property without due process of law in contravention of the federal Constitution. Of course, with the decision of the Supreme Court in the Muhlker Case, our own decisions in the cases cited-have \u00bfeased to be authorities.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be reversed, and a new tri\u00e1l' granted, with costs to the appellant'to abide the event. All concur. \u2022 -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
