The adjournment was granted at first on terms by the trial court, but, as appears from the record, after argument and an examination of the papers, the court dismissed defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and gave judgment for the plaintiff, because of a statement on plaintiff\u2019s billheads that \u201call claims must be made within ten days after receipt of goods.\u201d These facts seem to indicate that the trial court, while favoring an adjournment, gave judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor upon an erroneous conception of the binding effect of the printed statement upon the defendants that rendered the-question of adjournment immaterial, and which does not seem to have been taken into consideration in the final disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs and disbursements to appellant to abide the event.
