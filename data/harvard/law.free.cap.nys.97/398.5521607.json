Defendant was the contractor engaged in doing all the work in the erection of a building adjoining on the west, except the excavation, steel construction, and laying of sidewalk. During the progress of defendant\u2019s work, bricks and mortar fell from the building in course of construction by it, upon the' roof of plaintiffs\u2019 premises, breaking the same and causing leaks therein, necessitating two separate repairs thereof, at an expense, respectively, of $29 and $50. The bricks and mortar- from the adjoining building .also fell into the yard of the premises, destroying sodding and bushes therein, to the extent of $38. A bridge was erected, resting on plaintiffs\u2019 sidewalk, and barrels of cement and quantities of building material were dumped upon said sidewalk to be used in defendant\u2019s work, causing damage to the sidewalk and parts of the stoop in the sum of about $50. Repainting of plaintiffs\u2019 house and stoop was necessitated by the falling of brick and mortar, and the sprinkling thereon of the acid used to clean down the walls of the building being erected by defendant, to plaintiffs\u2019 damage $50. All these things are proven to have occurred while defendant\u2019s work was going on and as the result of the casting or falling upon plaintiffs\u2019 premises of various substances hereinbefore referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-26\">The acts complained of and established by proof amounted to a trespass, and for the damage thus caused defendant was liable. Since the case of Hay v. Cohees Co., 2 N. Y. 159,.51 Am. Dec. 279, it has been uniformly held that, where one .-in making improvements trespasses on or injures his neighbor\u2019s property by casting material thereupon, he is liable absolutely for the damage, irrespective of any question of care or negligence. Plaintiffs were entitled to the undisturbed possession of their premises, and to be protected against any invasion thereof by defendant, and are entitled to damages \u2022 for the injuries caused by the latter\u2019s trespass. The alleged settlement sought to be established by defendant was not made with the infant plaintiffs, but only with their mother, not the owner of the fee, and, as far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>as the present state of the proof shows, was to apply only to the inside damages to said premises, and had no application to the damage to the roof, exterior, or yard of said premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
