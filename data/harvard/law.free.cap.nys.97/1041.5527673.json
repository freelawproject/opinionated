J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax5O\">I agree that' this judgment should be reversed, and a new trial had. That the defendant was guilty of negligence in leaving the horse standing unhitched and unattended is clear. Gorney v. City of New York, 102 App. Div. 259, 92 N. Y. Supp. 451. The hypothesis that plaintiff\u2019s horse ran into defendants\u2019 rests merely upon inference drawn from- a state of facts supported by very slight evidence. N.or can it be said, upon the evidence, that plaintiff\u2019s driver :was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>shown to have been guilty of contributory negligence. He was confronted with a sudden and serious peril, which necessitated quick thought and rapid action. Under such circumstances, he. is not to be charged with negligence merely because at the moment he did not adopt the best course to avoid a collision. Indeed, it is by no means clear that he did not do all that any one could have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
