Plaintiff afterwards ascertained that the bonds were stolen, and defendant now pleads that the note is usurious on the theory that the transaction was a loan. The trial judge held that the action is one to recover damages for false and fraudulent representations, and dismissed the complaint, because of plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure of proof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b448-7\">Argued before JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, and MILLER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-8\">I.

It seems to us, however, that it may fairly be viewed as an action for conversion, based on the alleged promise of the defendant to invest the plaintiff\u2019s $10,000 for him in a water company, his acknowledged failure to do so, and his retention of the money to his own use. Certainly .there is some evidence of such a promise; the defendant admits that he did not invest the money for the plaintiff at all, and his assertion that it was a loan is an implication, if any further evidence than his failure to return it were needed, that he has applied the money to his own purposes. We think there was a question for the jury, and that the complaint should not have been dismissed. The judge was not authorized to decide, as matter of fact, that the transaction was in reality a loan, in view of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony tending to show that such was not its true character; the circumstance that the form of the papers indicated a loan was not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The plaintiff appears to have fared rather hardly in this litigation. He has parted with $10,000, without receiving any value for it, to a stranger who makes no substantial excuse or apology for not repaying the money, and who has succeeded in imposing a penalty of $250 upon the plaintiff, in the shape of an additional allowance by way of costs, for trying to get it back.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">The judgment and both orders should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Judgment and orders reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
