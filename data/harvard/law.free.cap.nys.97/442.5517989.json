J., and WOODWARD, JENKS, HOOKER, and GAYNOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-5\">Jerome A. Peck, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-6\">Ralph E. Prime, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-7\">GAYNOR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFI\">This case, following the complaint, was tried on the theory that the amendment by chapter 219, p. 589, of the Laws of 1902 to section 4 of title 5 of the charter of this village provided for a new and independent scheme in and of itself for street openings and improvements, irrespective of the rest of said section, and that as it prescribes no local assessments, the expense for improvements inaugurated under it is a charge on the village at large, and the learned court acquiesced in that construction. This we decide to be error in the Matter of Opening Locust Avenue (decided herewith), 97 N. Y. Supp. 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">And the contract of purchase shows that this theory was an afterthought, for by its provisions local assessments were to be levied for the improvement, the assessment that would be cast against the plaintiff\u2019s remaining land was to be offset against the purchase price of her land, and she was to await the levying of the assessments before being paid. If the fund realized from the assessments should not suffice to pay her, then the village has to pay her; for one whose land is taken for a local improvement cannot be made to depend for payment on local assessments therefor alone; the state or one of its political subdivisions or municipal corporations has to be pledged to such payment. Sage v. City of Brooklyn, 89 N. Y. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">The judgment of specific performance, i. e., that the village accept the conveyance and pay the purchase price, cannot be sustained on the ground of neglect or refusal to cast the local assessment. The complaint presents no such issue; on the contrary, the theory of the action is that there could be no local assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
