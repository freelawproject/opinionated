At the clos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>e of the charge, in which the' jury were fully and' properly instructed upon- the law, the attorney for the plaintiff evidently desirous .of obtaining from the court a binding instruction to the jury that certain- specific facts and acts if found would, as matter of law, free his client from the charge of contributory negligence, requested .-the court to charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">\u201cThat in the event that they find that the plaintiff Truley drove ou the track, and that his horses were on the track, going on the track' when the car was about, as he testified, from 75 to 100 feet away, that there was no negligence on the part of Truley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The court so charged, and the defendant excepted. The court thereupon said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cThat as, if the fact be as you state\u2014if he was driving on the track when - the car was 100 feet away\u2014I charge that it was not negligence on his part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Counsel for plaintiff, not content with this, endeavored to get the court to further limit the function of the jury by an instruction :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201cThat if the jury came to the conclusion that he drove on this track while it was 50 feet away, that that would not be negligence.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">To this the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201cI decline to so charge. I leave it to the jury to say whether under all the circumstances it was negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The record before us does not show'that Truley testified as stated in his attorney\u2019s request to charge. The record shows that he. testified, in substance, that he looked up and down Third avenue as he reached the line of the sidewalk in that avenue and proceeded on; that a car passed to the south just as his horses \"entered on the track,\u201d and then he saw a car coming below Ninety-Seventh street; that when the horses were in the middle of the track the car was 150 or 300 feet away. The evidence presented in behalf of the defendant tends to show that the horses were driven onto the track just in front of the car. It was therefore competent for the jury to find that Truley drove upon the track, as stated in the request, when the car was only 75 feet \u00e1way. The horses were driving a heavy load of sand up a slight grade, and moved slowly. They were not driven across the track at right angles. Truley intended to drive down the westerly side of Third avenue. There was an elevated railroad pillar in the centre .of the crossing. Truley drove onto the track diagonally toward the south, passing close to the south of this pillar. This course lengthened the distance that he would have to go to clear the track, and brought him nearer the approaching car. In view of all these circumstances,' it cannot be held, as matter of law, that he was free from contributory negligence if he drove upon the track when the car was only 75 feet away. The jury might have found that he should have seen that the car was approaching at such speed that it could not have been stopped after the mdtorman discovered that the driver of the horses was asserting a right of way over the car. Moreover, the request charged eliminated from the consideration of the jury the . driver\u2019s conduct after getting upon the track. It will not do to say that the error was cured by the remarks of the court in refusing to hol'd as matter of law, as requested, that the jury must' find 'the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>driver free from.contributory negligence, if the car was 50\"feet distant when he drove onto the track. These remarks had direct reference to the request relating to 50 feet. If the court intended to withdraw the former charge, it should have been so done that every juror would understand it. That cannot be affirmed on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment in each case should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
