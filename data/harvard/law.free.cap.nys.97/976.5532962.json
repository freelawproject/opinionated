Thereupon defendant\u2019s counsel renewed his motion to dismiss, and also moved for a direction in favor of defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved for a direction in favor of plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s motions were denied, and plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted. Defendant\u2019s counsel then moved for a new trial \u201cupon all the grounds specified in section 999 of the Code,\u201d and this motion was denied. It appears that, immediately. after this disposition of the case, the counsel conferred with the court, and the court agreed to receive briefs and reconsider the matter. The parties are not in accord as to what precise motion or motions the court then undertook to consider, but the record shows that the learned justice before whom the cause was tried rendered an opinion in which he referred to the motion as one \u201cto set aside the verdict as contrary to law and the evidence,\u201d that he granted said motion, entered an order in accordance therewith, and denied defendant\u2019s subsequent motion seeking to resettle said order. Defendant appeals from the order granting a new trial, contending that the proper practice was to set aside the verdict directed for the plaintiff, and direct a verdict in favor of defendant. So far as the record discloses, defendant\u2019s motion was granted, and, under such circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend how he can successfully appeal from an order entered in his favor upon his own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">It seems to me fruitless here to consider what course of procedure might or should have been followed by the court below or by the defendant\u2019s counsel. It may be suggested that, had the defendant contented himself with his exceptions to the court\u2019s rulings upon the motions to dismiss and to direct verdicts, this court might have been in a position, upon an appeal from the judgment, to make a final disposition of the case;-but upon the record as presented appellant seems to have obtained all it asked for, and no convincing reason justifying an appeal on its part is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
