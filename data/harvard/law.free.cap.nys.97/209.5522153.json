J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">I am of opinion that the plaintiff can recover in this action no more than the sum which was tendered by defendants and paid into court. The lease in the first place provided for a yearly rental of $2,500 per annum payable monthly. In a later clause, it was agreed that the owner should allow the tenants the sum of $150 per year from the aforementioned rent for repairs, lighting the halls, and keeping the halls and stairs cleaned at all times, \u201cwhich the tenant hereby agrees to do.\u201d It is further provided: \u201cSaid sum to be deducted in equal monthly parts from the rent when due.\u201d This provision had the effect of reducing the amount to be paid each month by one-twelfth of $150, for it was to be allowed from the rent, and to be deducted therefrom when due. As the clause was worded the amount allowed to the tenant was not to be treated as a claim against the landlord independent of the rent, but as a monthly reduction of the amount to be paid. The deduction was not made to depend upon whether or not the tenant did actually light and clean the halls and stairs, but was positively agreed upon, in consideration of which the tenant agreed to do certain things. If, as the plaintiff claims, the tenant failed to live up to this agreement in these particulars' the landlord\u2019s remedy was to sue for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">The judgment should be reduced to the sum of $391.66 less the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>defendants\u2019 costs in the court below as provided for in section 148 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1537, c. 580), and, as so modified, should be affirmed, with costs to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">DOWLING, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b242-6\">BLANCHARD, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1p\">(dissenting). Action is brought by the lessor\u2019s assignee against the lessee for two months\u2019 rent, computed pro rata, upon a lease providing for the payment of rent at $2,500 per annum, payable monthly. It was provided in the lease that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThe owner shall allow the tenants the sum of $150 per year from the aforesaid mentioned rent for repairs, lighting the halls and keeping the hall and stairs clean at all times, which the tenant hereby agrees to do, such sum to be deducted in equal monthly parts from the rent when due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff the defendants appeal. The clause under discussion, inserted after the usual covenants of the lessee regarding repairs and care of the premises, was intended to liquidate the cost of said services and to impose the burden thereof upon the landlord and to specify the time of payment. The provision that an equal monthly .part of said sum should be deducted from the rent was not intended to alter the amount of the monthly rent, but merely to direct a recoupment of a certain sum against the monthly rent. It seems clear that if the lessee had desired to plead this provision, he should have pleaded it as a counterclaim,' and not as a defense. Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Durant L. I. Co., 144 N. Y. 34, 44, 39 N. E. 7; Ely v. Spiero, 28 App. Div. 485, 51 N. Y. Supp. 124. It results, therefore, that the plaintiff properly brought action for the undiminished amount of rent; and that upon the evidence that no consideration had been given, for which the landlord was bound by the lease to reimburse the defendant, the trial court rightly gave judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
