A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Plaintiff Kazmer-Standish Consultants, Inc. (Kazmer), a Cleveland, Ohio, company, styles itself as \u201cmanagement consultants on mergers and acquisitions.\u201d It brought an action in the Law Division against Schoeffel Instrument Corporation, a West-wood, New Jersey manufacturer of scientific instruments, and Kratos, Inc., a California conglomerate, to collect a $100,000 business broker\u2019s or finder\u2019s fee. Plaintiff alleged that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>services were highly instrumental in bringing Schoeffel and Kratos together for a December 1977 sale of Schoeffel\u2019s entire assets to Kratos for $2.7 million. This acquisition of assets by Kratos included the transfer of real estate, the Schoeffel plant in Westwood. At the closing the real property was transferred to Kratos by a full warranty deed, reciting a consideration of $375,000, about 14% of the entire transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff was not a New Jersey real estate broker and thus was barred from recovering any commission on a transaction involving, to any extent, the sale of real estate in this State. The Law Division judge agreed with defendants and granted the motion. Our Real Estate Broker\u2019s Act states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">No person shall engage either directly or indirectly in the business of a real estate broker or salesman, temporarily or otherwise, and no person shall advertise or represent himself as being authorized to act as a real estate broker or salesman, or to engage in any of the activities described in section 45:15-3 of the Revised Statutes, without being licensed so to do as hereinafter provided. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Any single act, transaction or sale shall constitute engaging in business within the meaning of this article. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-2]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">No person, firm, partnership, association or corporation shall-bring or maintain any action in the courts of this State for the collection of compensation for the performance of any of the acts mentioned in this article without alleging and proving that he was a duly licensed real estate broker at the time the alleged cause of \u00bfction arose. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">An unbroken line of New Jersey cases, beginning with <em>Kenney v. Paterson Milk &amp; Cream Co., </em>110 <em>N.J.L. </em>141 (E. &amp; A. 1933) (9-4 decision), supports the Law Division judge\u2019s ruling that plaintiff is barred from recovery as a matter of law by these provisions of the Real Estate Broker\u2019s Act. In <em>Kenney </em>plaintiff provided defendant with a ready, willing and able buyer for defendant\u2019s dairy business pursuant to a written brokerage agreement. The broker agreement listed all the dairy\u2019s assets, including the real property, improvements and fixtures thereon. The value of the real estate was admittedly about one-third of the sale price. Our then highest court held that the transaction was not divisible or severable and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>unlicensed plaintiff could recover no commissions, even on the portion of the transaction unrelated to real estate. The holding in <em>Kenney </em>has been followed consistently over the years with no signs of erosion. <em>See Kaplan v. Meranus, </em>136 <em>N.J.L. </em>425 (Sup.Ct.1948), aff\u2019d 1 <em>N.J. </em>219 (1948); <em>Corson v. Keane, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>221 (1950); <em>Cohen v. Scola, </em>13 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472 (App.Div.1951); <em>Tanenbaum v. Sylvan Builders, Inc., </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342 (App.Div.1958), aff\u2019d 29 <em>N.J. </em>63 (1959); <em>Kaufman, Inc. v. American Machine &amp; Foundry Co., </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1 (App.Div.1968), aff\u2019d 54 <em>N.J. </em>239 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Kenney </em>has spawned the nationwide majority rule which \u201chas consistently held that if any real estate at all is involved in the transaction, the business broker must be licensed under the appropriate real estate licensing code\u201d before any commission may be collected. Green, \u201cThe Business Broker and the Oklahoma Real Estate Licensing Code,\u201d 12 <em>Tulsa L.Rev. </em>398, 404 (1976). The minority, or New York rule, \u201cholds that where the central or dominant feature of a transaction is the sale of a business as a going concern rather than the transfer of real estate, the business broker need not be licensed as a real estate broker\u201d to collect a commission. <em>Id. </em>at 399. <em>See Weingast v. Rialto Pastry Shop, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.Y. </em>113, 152 <em>N.E. </em>693 (Ct.App.1926). The <em>Kenney </em>court was aware of the <em>Weingast </em>decision but explicitly rejected its rationale. 110 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 144-146.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The competing merits of the so-called New Jersey and New York rules are ably analyzed in the <em>Tulsa Law Review </em>article, and the respective authorities are exhaustively collected in Annotation, \u201cNecessity of Having Real Estate Broker\u2019s License in Order to Recover Commission As Affected by Fact That Business Sold Includes Real Property,\u201d 82 <em>A.L.R. </em>3d 1139 (1978). <em>See, also, Thomas v. Jarvis, </em>213 <em>Kan. </em>671, 518 P.2d 532, 82 <em>A.L.R. </em>3d 1130 (Sup.Ct.1974) (adopting New Jersey rule). As the <em>Tulsa Law Review </em>article points up, the precise wording of a state\u2019s regulatory statute may in a given situation dictate one result or the other; but generally speaking, the two lines of authority are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>distinct linear descendents of <em>Kenney </em>decided in 1932 and <em>Weingast </em>decided in 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We are bound by the holding in <em>Kenney </em>and do not feel free to reexamine the problem in light of modern economic conditions which have proliferated national and multinational corporate mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers of assets and spinoffs which have fostered the business broker\u2019s profession. Indeed, our present regulatory scheme is even stricter than in 1932 when <em>Kenney </em>was decided by reason of L. 1953, c. 229, p. 1687, \u00a7 2, which amended the statutory definition of \u201creal estate broker\u201d to embrace anyone who \u201csolicits for prospective purchasers or assists in the procuring of prospects or directs in the procuring of prospects or the negotiation or closing of any transaction which does or is contemplated to result in the sale, exchange, leasing, renting or auctioning of any real estate.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-3. The real thrust of the real estate broker\u2019s regulatory scheme is to protect the relatively unsophisticated consumer. \u201cIn contrast to the typical real estate transaction involving unsophisticated consumers, the business broker engages in arm\u2019s-length transactions with sophisticated business professionals.\u201d Green, 12 <em>Tulsa L.Rev., supra </em>at 401. The policy of rigid application of the <em>Kenney </em>majority rule to today\u2019s world of modern corporate financial transactions may be seriously questioned, but any change of such a firmly embedded rule of law must come from the Supreme Court or the Legislature, not from an intermediate appellate court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We concur generally with the remarks made by Judge Spaeth, in a similar context speaking for the Commonwealth\u2019s interme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>diate court of appeals in <em>Burke v. Israel, </em>264 <em>Pa.Super. </em>286, 399 A.2d 779 (Super.Ct.1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">We recognize that in affirming we may be depriving appellant of money he has truly earned, and allowing appellees to repudiate their agreement with appellant while retaining the benefits of his labors. Perhaps it is true that \u201c[\u00a1Injustice is the hallmark of the brokers\u2019 licensing acts.\u201d Comment, <em>supra </em>at 524. Yet the legislative policy of disallowing any action for a commission without a license is clearly expressed in the Real Estate Brokers License Act, and has been upheld by decisions of the Supreme Court and this court: If the policy is to be changed, the change must be made by the legislature. <em>See Lurie </em>V. <em>Republican Alliance, </em>412 <em>Pa. </em>61, 192 A.2d 367 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">These comments may be qualified by the observation that the New Jersey statute does not expressly include a transaction involving the sale of a business in which the value of the real estate is a small portion of the whole, as in the case at hand. Unfortunately, perhaps, for the development of the rule, the sale of the real estate was specifically included in the brokerage agreement in <em>Kenney. </em>In the case at hand, plaintiff contends that the sale of the real estate as such was not essential, since the transaction might have been consummated by the sale of controlling shares of stock in the acquired corporation. Thus, although plaintiff may have performed the required services and might otherwise have been entitled to a commission,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> its right to recover may be barred by the ultimate form of the transfer decided upon defendants. The <em>Kenney </em>rule, therefore, would allow form to prevail over substance. We would prefer to see the nature of the transaction control rather than its form.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In <em>Solomon v. Goldberg, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>69, 73 (App.Div.1950), written by then Judge William J. Brennan, Jr., (now U. S. Supreme Court Justice), the court applied the <em>Kenney </em>rule to the transaction, but in dictum recognized a distinction to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>found in the nature of the transaction. Justice Brennan there wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">Moreover, plaintiff does not come under the protection of the decisions holding that real estate brokerage licenses are not necessary where services beyond those of a mere broker are to be performed. Agreements requiring services beyond the mere listing for and negotiating of sale of the real estate of another may be actionable when the facts support an inference the one rendering these services is not a mere broker but a promoter; <em>Montgomery v. East Ridgelawn Cemetery, </em>189 <em>Misc. </em>99, 68 N.Y.S.2d 836 <em>(Sup.Ct.1947); </em>affirmed [272 <em>A.D. </em>1048] 75 <em>N.Y.S.</em>2d 287 <em>(App.Div.1946), </em>construing <em>R.S. </em>45:15-3 of New Jersey statute; or a developer whose services also require him to improve the owner\u2019s lands, <em>Ruta </em>v. <em>Werner, </em>1 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455 (Ch.1948); or whose agreement is with another broker in a joint promotion venture to sell lands of a real estate development company. <em>Chew v. Markheim, </em>125 <em>N.J.L. </em>595 (Sup.Ct.1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">For the foregoing reasons we are constrained to affirm the summary judgment entered in the Law Division. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The trend may be away from the so-called majority rule. <em>See Quick Shops of Mississippi, Inc. v. Bruce, </em>232 So.2d 351 (Miss.Sup.Ct.1970) (follows <em>Weingast\u2019s </em>New York rule). In California, which supposedly follows the New Jersey rule and treats business brokers as realtors, plaintiff here could probably recover because of a long-standing finder\u2019s exception for one who \u201csimply finds and introduces two parties to a real estate transaction.\u201d <em>Tyrone v. Kelley, </em>9 Cal.3d 1, 8, 106 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>761, 507 P.2d 65 (Sup.Ct.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Apart from plaintiffs lack of a real estate broker\u2019s license, defendants do not concede that there was an agreement to pay plaintiff for its services or that plaintiff was authorized to solicit a purchaser for the Schoeffel corporation. Because of the entry of summary judgment as a matter of law it was unnecessary for the trial court to resolve any factual disputes that may have been presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
