Cummins, are optometrists licensed by the New Jersey Board of Optometrists (\u201cBoard\u201d). On October 3, 1979, the Board notified defendants by letter that it had reviewed their newspaper advertisement regarding soft contact lenses and had determined that it violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:12-ll(h) and (o) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:l-21(b) in that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">1. There is no delineation of what 'professional care\u2019 includes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">2. It appears that, in fact, the patient does not actually purchase the lenses for $65 (professional care required at additional cost).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:12-ll(h) prohibits \u201cfalse, fraudulent or misleading advertising of the practice of optometry,\u201d (o) prohibits \u201cany conduct which is of a character likely to deceive or defraud the public,\u201d and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:l-21(b) prohibits engaging \u201cin the use or employment of dishonesty, fraud, deception, misrepresentation, false promise or false pretense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">The Board offered defendants \u201cthe opportunity of disposing of this matter without a hearing,\u201d if they signed a form admitting their violation of these statutes and each paid a $750 penalty. Defendants were advised that, if they wished \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>discuss mitigation of said penalty, you may present your arguments in writing or in person at a regularly scheduled Board meeting.\u201d Finally, the Board ordered them \u201cto cease and desist such manner of advertising immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Defendants\u2019 counsel requested the opportunity to appear before the Board to object to its actions. The Board held a plenary hearing. Defendants\u2019 counsel appeared, as did Dr. Shack. Dr. Cummins was not present. Dr. Shack was the only witness to testify before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A final decision and order by the Board held that defendants\u2019 \u201cadvertisement <em>both </em>on its face and as applied within the usual commercial setting is deceptive and misleading and, therefore, violative of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:12-1(h) and (o), and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1-21(b) and (e).\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In so holding, the Board ordered defendants to cease and desist from advertising contact lenses for sale to the consuming public at a stated price unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">(i) the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses a single total dollar price for the advertised lenses and all usual and necessary services and goods related thereto, <em>or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">(ii) the advertisement clearly and conspicuously discloses separate prices for the advertised lenses and all usual and necessary services and goods related thereto, the sum total of said prices to equal the total price to be paid for the advertised lenses and related services and goods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The Board also ordered that the advertisements must set forth clearly and conspicuously \u201call usual and necessary services and goods,\u201d which must at least include an optometric examination fee, a contact lens evaluation fee, storage and sterilizing equipment, use instruction, and follow-up care. Finally, the Board assessed civil penalties against each defendant in the amount of $750 and imposed costs in the amount of $127.60 against defendants, jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">On appeal, defendants contend that the Board\u2019s letter-notice violated their procedural due process rights; that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>advertisement was not misleading; that the Board used \u201cthe most ignorant consumer\u201d as a measuring standard, which violated their first amendment rights to freedom of expression; and, that the Board used an \u201cimpermissible standard\u201d (i. e., misleading on its face and as applied) to judge their advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">While we agree that the Board\u2019s letter, at least facially, did not satisfy the due process requirements of notice provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-9(a) and (b) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45-3.1(d), it did reveal to defendants the basis for the charges against them and the pertinent statutes determined to be violated. And the Board did eventually afford defendants a plenary hearing at which they were represented by counsel; Dr. Shack testified, and all of the violation determinations in the Board\u2019s letter were reviewed and challenged. As was observed in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>254, 267-268, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1011, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>287, 299 (1970), due process is satisfied if a defendant has \u201ctimely and adequate notice\u201d detailing the charges and \u201can effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The Board did give defendants timely and adequate notice of the charges against them and it did not deprive them of a full opportunity to be heard on the charges before formally assessing the penalties against them. <em>Malady v. Bd. of Review, Div. of Emp. Security, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>523, 530 (App.Div.1979). <em>See also, Horsman Dolls v. Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n., </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>541, 550-551 (1951), <em>cert. </em>den. 342 <em>U.S. </em>890, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>201, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>667 (1951); <em>N. J. Zinc Co. v. Board of Review, 25 N.J. </em>235, 239 (1957). Consequently, we find that defendants\u2019 procedural due process rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Defendants contend that their advertisement is not misleading, because they are no misleading statements contained \u201cwithin the four corners\u201d of the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:12- 11(h) and (o) prohibit a licensee from engaging in \u201cmisleading advertising\u201d or conduct \u201cof a character likely to deceive or defraud the public.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1 14 <em>et seq., </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sets up uniform standards for license revocation, suspension and other disciplinary proceedings by professional and occupational boards within the Division of Consumer Affairs, prohibits licensees from engaging in the use of \u201cdeception\u201d or \u201cmisrepresentation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1 21(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We have found no reported cases after the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1 -14 <em>et seq. </em>(July 13, 1978) construing or applying these particular aspects of the above statutes. We believe, however, valid analogies may be drawn from those cases construing the \u201cdeception\u201d portions of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Section 5(a) of FTCA (15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 45(a(1)) declares \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce\u201d to be illegal. The Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8 2, defines an unlawful practice to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">[t]he act, use or employment of any .. deception [or] misrepresentation .. in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate .., whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Defendants\u2019 assertion that their advertisement cannot be deemed \u201cmisleading\u201d because there are no misleading statements in it is not well founded. It has long been recognized that \u201ca half-truth can be as deceptive as a positive misrepresentation\u201d and this principle has been routinely applied under the FTCA. \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Deceptive Advertising,\u201d Note, 80 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>1005, 1047 (1967). A failure to disclose material information may cause an advertisement to be false or deceptive even though it does not state false facts. <em>Simeon Management Corp. v. FTC, </em>579 F.2d 1137, 1145 (9 Cir. 1978). The \u201cprime ingredient of deception\u201d is the advertisement\u2019s \u201ccapacity to mislead.\u201d <em>Fenwick v. Kay American Jeep, Inc., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>372, 378 (1977). The criterion by which advertising is judged is \u201cthe likelihood of deception or the capacity to deceive.\u201d <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. FTC, </em>379 F.2d 666, 670 (7 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>At the Board hearing, Dr. Shack stated that he dispensed about 50 pairs of contact lenses a week. He asserted that his patients basically fell into two categories: (1) those who have never worn contact lenses before and who have received a contact lens prescription from another practitioner, and (2) those who already wear contact lenses and are just seeking new or replacement lenses. However, Dr. Shack admitted that out of these 50 pairs of contact lenses, only two pairs involved patients who came to him with prescriptions from other doctors. Dr. Shack also confirmed that the minimum contact lenses price set forth in the advertisement would apply only to a patient who came to him with a prescription from another practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Board found that, in the \u201cvast majority of situations,\u201d consumers responding to defendants\u2019 advertisement will need \u201csome professional optometric services,\u201d, for which they will be charged. Based on these findings, the Board apparently concluded that an advertisement, which does not disclose the above circumstances, is \u201cdeceptive and misleading\u201d and violates the subject statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the Board\u2019s conclusion was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable; that it violated legislative policies expressed or implied in the statutes governing the Board, or that it lacked fair support in the evidence. Therefore, we find no grounds to upset the Board\u2019s determination that the advertisement is \u201cdeceptive and misleading.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Dept. of Civil Service, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"A6-\">We find that defendants\u2019 advertisement is misleading in that it fails to disclose that, in the \u201cvast majority of situations,\u201d consumers responding to advertisement will need \u201cprofessional care.\u201d In other words, a consumer reading the advertisement knows that \u201cprofessional care\u201d (whatever it may consist) is not included in the advertised minimum price. The consumer also knows that there will be an \u201cadditional\u201d charge for any \u201cprofessional care\u201d received. What the advertisement does not tell the consumer is- that \u201cprofessional care\u201d is virtually certain to be required. At that point, the consumer is deceived or misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Defendants assert that the Board, in determining that the advertisement was deceptive and misleading, utilized \u201cthe most ignorant consumer\u201d as its measuring standard. On its face, the Board\u2019s decision and order indicates that the standard applied was \u201cthe average consumer.\u201d We, therefore, find defendants\u2019 contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Defendants\u2019 contention that the Board used an \u201cimpermissible standard\u201d to judge their advertisement is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In view of the foregoing we conclude that if defendants desire to advertise with the inclusion of a price, then that price must include professional services as well as materials; otherwise, no price may be mentioned in an ad.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1 -21(e) provides for suspension or revocation of a professional license, if the holder \u201c[h]as engaged in professional or occupational misconduct as may be determined by the board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
