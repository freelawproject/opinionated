The trial judge, obviously moved by developmental and regional considerations inspired by <em>So. Burl. Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Mt. Laurel Tp.; </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>151 (1975) and <em>Oakwood at Madison, Inc. v. Madison Tp.; </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>481 (1977), found the rezoned tract to be \u201cparticularly suited for the proposed development.\u201d 169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 38 (Law Div. 1979). In such case, he opined, the requirement that \u201ca developing municipality must \u2018bite the bullet\u2019 and rezone for least-cost housing,\u201d also mandates that \u201cits fully developed neighbors must endure the inconvenience of potential increased traffic and decreased property values.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We agree with this position, at least in the circumstances of this case, and so with respect to the substance of the matter we affirm. In thus reporting our reasons for concurrence we recognize, without particular mention (other than our emphasis upon \u201cthe circumstances of this case\u201d), the remaining findings in the penultimate paragraph of the published opinion of the trial judge. These are meager to say the least, but assuming, for instance, that \u201ccareful consideration has been given to environmental problems\u201d implies that the proposal is found to be free of fatally impinging environmental stresses, they are enough. We are satisfied that such as they are, they might reasonably have been reached on credible evidence in the whole record and we will not interfere. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In his opinion, the trial judge did not address the argument of plaintiff, raised below and again before us, that defendant offended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(d) by its failure to amend its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>master plan to include a policy statement concerning contiguous municipalities. It is undisputed that Mahwah adopted a master plan prior to the August 1, 1976 effective date of the Municipal Land Use Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D 1 <em>et seq. </em>While <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-28(d) does indeed require a master plan to contain a specific policy statement concerning its relationship with the plans of contiguous municipalities, the authority to adopt or amend zoning ordinances granted by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62(a) of the Municipal Land Use Law requires only that the land use plan element of a master plan have been adopted. The newer statute does not require a master plan be conformed to all subsequently adopted statutory requirements before a zoning ordinance may be adopted. We observe that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-89 does not require a general review of the master plan until 1982. We reject plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Plaintiff also asserts here, following timely objection below, that certain testimony by defendant\u2019s planner \u201cin respect to an application then pending before the Defendant\u2019s Planning Board in connection with the development of the PRD- 4 zone\u201d was harmful error. While, as plaintiff here insists, this testimony may have had little if any probative value respecting that which plaintiff conceived to be \u201cthe fundamental issue: namely, whether or not <em>any studies were conducted </em>during the planning stage to show the impact, if any, on the Plaintiff\u201d (emphasis supplied), we are satisfied it was sufficiently relevant to the fact question respecting traffic impact on Allendale (as contrasted with the question of whether planning stage studies had been conducted) to justify it admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Finally, it is apparent from the opinion of the trial judge that a confident judgment in the matter could be reached without any resort to presumptions of any nature. Our affirmance also needs no such buttressing, in our judgment. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary in this case to consider the question respecting what happens to the presumption of validity generally accorded municipal actions in matters in which both contestants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>are municipalities. For that reason we express no opinion with regard to the statement in the opinion of the trial court that in cases where municipalities have an interest in contiguous land neither is entitled to the benefit of any presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
