A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">This case presents the question whether representation of appellant and his two co-defendants by staff attorneys of the same local public defender\u2019s office, absent any showing of actual conflict of interest or possible prejudice, constituted a denial of appellant\u2019s state or federal constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel in a criminal proceeding. <em>U.S. Const., Amend. </em>VI; <em>N.J. Const. </em>(1947), <em>Art. </em>I, \u00a7 10; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>531 (1980); <em>R. </em>3:8-2. We conclude that such joint or dual representation of co-defendants by public defenders from the same local office, does not, without more, constitute a denial or impairment of their constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Defendant-appellant Rogers and his co-indictees Kitt and Williams were indicted for armed robbery and illegal possession of revolvers in Fairlawn, Bergen County, on January 18, 1979. Appellant remained in jail in default of $25,000 bail pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">On May 30, 1979 a so-called Green<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing was held before Judge Schiaffo at appellant\u2019s Rogers request one week before the preemptory trial date. He there contended for the first time just a week before trial that representation of the three defendants by three public defenders from the same office created an irreconcilable conflict of interest. Rogers\u2019 deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>public defender, Mr. LoLordo, voiced his client\u2019s objection to his representation\u2014\u201cbasically it\u2019s [Rogers\u2019] apprehension\u2014he felt he had information vital to his defense and I think he was basically apprehensive about telling me because he thought co-counsel might find out what that information is and it might be used against him at the trial of the matter by the co-defendants.\u201d Rogers\u2019 concern was allegedly aroused because his co-defendant Williams had written an apologetic letter the week before to one of the victims of the crime. The prosecutor quickly agreed not to use the letter in the State\u2019s case, thereby obviating any <em>Bruton</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>problem. The letter never became a factor at trial. Rogers\u2019 fears, insofar as his attorney LoLordo could communicate them, boiled down to the fact that he didn\u2019t trust his lawyer because of the public-defender association among defense counsel. As counsel put it: \u201cHe won\u2019t tell me what it is, but he feels that perhaps our files are accessible to everybody, that another attorney might see this information and use it against him in some manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The Law Division judge carefully outlined in defendant\u2019s presence each counsels\u2019 duty of confidentiality to each client whether a staff public defender, pool attorney for the public defender\u2019s office,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or a privately retained attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge dismissed defendant\u2019s fear of his counsel\u2019s lack of professionalism as ungrounded, if not paranoid, and an insufficient reason for the appointment of pool counsel from the private bar, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>paid by the public defender\u2019s office. Attorney LoLordo\u2019s application to withdraw as counsel was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Before trial began on June 4, 1979 before Judge Huot, appellant\u2019s counsel sought an adjournment and again sought to withdraw because Rogers still refused to confide in him in preparation of a defense. LoLorda repeated Rogers\u2019 contention: \u201cHe felt it wasn\u2019t wise to tell me what the facts of the defense are because of the possible conflict. He felt that it would be against his interests to have the co-defendants aware of this information\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re three men in the same office.\u201d Judge Huot denied LoLordo\u2019s application concluding that \u201cany lack of preparation is directly attributable to your refusal to cooperate with [counsel] in the preparation of the defense.\u201d Appellant then opted for LoLordo\u2019s continuing representation rather than self-representation when offered this choice by the judge. He was advised that no waiver of his currently-voiced objection would arise from this choice. Gratuitously, but understandably, the trial judge registered his impression that \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned this entire picture is one of delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The case was tried before Judge Huot from June 5 through June 8, 1979. Appellant Rogers was found guilty on all three counts. The co-defendants Williams and Kitt did not testify and were granted mistrials because of improper remarks by the prosecution in summation impinging upon their rights to remain silent. A motion for mistrial by Rogers, who did testify, was denied because \u201cthe comments of the prosecutor did not harm him in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">At trial, the State presented proof that on Saturday, December 23, 1978 Santiago and Anna Nieves, who operated a meat market in the Bronx, were about to enter their home in Fair-lawn with the day\u2019s receipts of $14,000 stuffed in a brown paper bag when they were set upon and robbed at gun point by the three defendants. Rogers and Kitt were seized by the police as they were leaving the Nieves house. Rogers had the bag of money, checks and food stamps in his hand when he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>captured. Williams was apprehended nearby five minutes later. Alert neighbors had called the police when suspicious activity about the Nieves house was observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">At the trial neither Williams nor Kitt testified or called any witnesses in response to the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Appellant did testify. He stated that an unnamed relative of Nieves had given him directions to go to their home in Fairlawn and \u201cpick up\u201d $20,000. This person also gave appellant a loaded handgun, handcuffs and $1,000 remuneration for the task. Appellant gave Kitt and Williams $100 each to accompany him. Appellant actually admitted carrying two loaded handguns to the Nieves\u2019 home. Appellant claimed the three were voluntarily admitted to the victims\u2019 home where Mr. Nieves willingly gave him the bag of cash, checks and food stamps. Rogers said Mrs. Nieves thereafter began to protest her husband\u2019s conduct and attempted to reclaim the money. Appellant said he then pulled his handgun allegedly to \u201ccool\u201d Mrs. Nieves down. Rogers said \u201cMr. Nieves had held his hands out as to, you know, he wanted me to\u2014it like he wanted to be handcuffed. So I handcuffed him and left.\u201d Despite instructions by the judge to do so, appellant would not, allegedly because of fear of reprisal against appellant\u2019s relatives in the Bronx, answer the prosecutor\u2019s question and name the relative of Nieves who had dispatched him to pick up the $20,000. Ultimately, therefore, appellant would not tell the judge and jury the defensive matter he alleged that he was afraid to tell his public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Throughout the trial appellant\u2019s public defender, LoLordo, represented him with manifest competence and great vigor. We see no shred of support in the record to support any possible contention that counsel was ineffective; indeed, appellant advances no such contention as to trial effort. Obviously, the only witness appellant could have called to corroborate his testimony was his alleged employer whom he refused to identify to anyone. No one but appellant could be blamed for this flaw in the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contentions here are three-fold: (1) this provision for defense counsel amounted to joint or dual representation within the meaning of <em>R. </em>3:8- 2, as amended effective September 10,1979, and the recent pronouncement of our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>531 (1980); (2) this court should find an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice and reverse; and (3) an actual conflict in fact existed requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We have approached the questions posed on the basis that <em>Bellucci </em>is fully retroactive because the right to effective counsel is the core of the integrity of the truth-seeking process. <em>See Kitchens v. Smith, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>847, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1089, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>519 (1971), where the United States Supreme Court observed \u201cas we have often noted, <em>Gideon [v. Wainwright, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>335, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>792, 9 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>799 (1963)] is fully retroactive.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Howery, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569 (1979) <em>(Franks v. Delaware </em>not retroactive); <em>State v. Czachor, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>392, 408 410 (1980) (decision abolishing <em>Allen </em>charge given limited retroactive effect). We also view this as essentially' a state constitutional question. The United States Supreme Court recently held that a defendant must show an actual conflict before a presumption of prejudice sufficient to sustain a violation under the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution would be indulged. <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>335, 348, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333, 347 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the reasons to be explicated we find that no actual conflict existed, nor was actual prejudice demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As our Supreme Court stated, the question in <em>Bellucci, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, was \u201cwhether our constitutional guarantee of effective counsel is fully satisfied when two lawyers who are partners separately represent criminal co-defendants.\u201d The court concluded that a partnership \u201cmust be considered as a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>attorney,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 543, in assessing an alleged constitutional violation. The court adopted a <em>per se </em>rule for such cases, stating \u201conce a potential conflict exists, prejudice will be <em>presumed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Ibid. </em>Absent a carefully advised waiver in such instances, the court held that the constitutional right is violated and a new trial is required. <em>Id. </em>at 545. Such joint representation would only be countenanced in future cases after a <em>R. </em>3:8-2 hearing and with judicial permission. <em>See also State v. Land, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>24 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The opinion in <em>Bellucci </em>gave several reasons for the conclusion that representation by private partners would be equated to single-attorney representation. They were: (1) ready access to confidential information among members of a law firm, (2) shared economic interests of the entire firm, (3) and the erosion of public confidence if conduct proscribed for a lawyer could be performed by his partner. In a footnote, 81 <em>N.J. </em>at 542 n.3\u00a1 the court observed that: \u201cThese considerations have led courts to hold that the Sixth Amendment and a lawyer\u2019s professional responsibility are violated when two public defenders from the same office represent <em>conflicting </em>interests, even in the absence of the economic consideration present when a private firm is involved. (Emphasis added.)\u201d Two authorities are cited for this statement: <em>Borden v. Borden, </em>277 A.2d 89 (D.C.Ct.App.1971); <em>Turner v. State, </em>340 So.2d 132 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1976). In <em>Borden </em>the District of Columbia Court of Appeals found an ethical violation existed where lawyers employed by the Neighborhood Legal Services Program represented opposing parties to a contested divorce proceeding, citing as authority in part New Jersey Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics, Opinion No. 155, 92 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>9 (1969). In <em>Turner </em>the Florida Court of Appeals held that where \u201ca conflict of interest between the defense of petitioner and one of the other co-defendants\u201d in a burglary case existed, \u201cseparate attorneys within the public defender\u2019s office\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>could not properly represent all.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>The Florida court stated: \u201cWe view the public defender\u2019s office of a given circuit as a \u2018firm\u2019 within the discipline of this canon. [DR5 -105]\u201d Both <em>Borden </em>and <em>Turner </em>were cases of clear conflicts potentiating for real prejudice to clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We do not read this allusion in <em>Bcllucci </em>so broadly as to require reversal of the conviction in the case before us. Although recognizing that the public defenders in this case worked out of the same office, we conclude that where there was no suggestion of actual conflict in the theory and presentation of the defense or any possibility of prejudice as the trial unfolded, there is insufficient reason to reverse this conviction. Nor has our research disclosed any case where the identity of counsel as co-public defenders from the same office alone automatically mandated reversal of a criminal conviction. The Supreme Courts of Arizona and Illinois have refused to apply a <em>per se </em>disqualification rule mandating reversal where no actual conflict or possibility of prejudice was demonstrated in joint or multiple public defender representations. <em>People v. Robinson, </em>79 <em>Ill.2d </em>147, 37 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>267, 402 <em>N.E.2d </em>157 (Sup.Ct.1979); <em>State v. Jelks, </em>105 <em>Ariz. </em>175, 461 P.2d 473 (Sup.Ct.1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where an actual conflict or the possibility of harm has been shown, a conviction must be reversed and the courts of the land have been responsive to this necessity. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Westbrook, </em>484 Pa. 534, 400 A.2d 160 (1979); <em>Turner v. State, supra, </em>340 So.2d 132; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Allen v. District Court, Colo., </em>519 P.2d 351 (Sup.Ct.1974); <em>Commonwealth v. Bracey, </em>224 <em>Pa.Super. </em>294, 307 A.2d 320 (Sup.Ct.1973); <em>People v. Baxtrom, </em>61 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>546, 18 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>718, 378 <em>N.E.2d </em>182 (Ct.App.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The record here is devoid of any actual conflict in contrast to the seminal case of <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 <em>U.S. </em>60, 72-75, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>457, 465-467, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>680 (1942), where defense counsel failed to cross-examine a prosecution witness whose testimony linked his client to the crime and failed to resist the presentation of arguably inadmissible evidence. Both omissions resulted from counsel\u2019s desire to diminish the jury\u2019s perception of the guilt of a co-defendant whom he also represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Deputy Public Defender LoLorodo owed allegiance only to appellant. The case did not involve sharply divergent degrees of culpability among the three defendants. The State\u2019s evidence-in-chief was virtually fungible and condemned defendants in common and on an equal basis. Each defense counsel was inclined to challenge the State\u2019s case with equal vigor. The allegedly incriminating letter written by Williams to the victims and which implicated appellant was never mentioned during the case. Neither co-defendant testified in contradiction to appellant, nor did they otherwise impede presentation of or cast doubt upon his unlikely defense. In fact, all three public defenders harmoniously adopted the same theory of defense. Appellant\u2019s asserted pretrial fear, apparently that co-defendants might try to minimize their culpability at his expense, could not have been effectively assuaged by a pool attorney or even by privately-engaged counsel. The prophylactic presumption of prejudice created by <em>Bellucci </em>does not overcome the reality that there was no prejudice to this defendant at his <em>pre-Bellucci </em>trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">There is no reason to believe that appellant\u2019s conviction was in any sense \u201ctainted by trial counsel\u2019s encumbered or diluted representation.\u201d <em>Bellucci, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 547 (concurring opinion). To the contrary, faced with a difficult task, trial counsel performed with skill and zeal. We are constrained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>conclude, additionally, that this record strongly suggests that defendant was obdurate in his efforts to avoid a prompt trial in the hope that somehow the prosecution might go away in the future, and that his constitutional argument was, in this setting, a contrivance designed to avoid a proper reckoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Count three of the indictment charged defendant with possession of a revolver without a permit. <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15L-41(a)). The arresting officer\u2019s testimony established defendant\u2019s possession of the handgun. In order to negate the existence of a permit, an investigator from the County Sheriff\u2019s Firearms Identification Bureau was permitted, over objection, to read an affidavit by Sergeant Hendrikson of the New Jersey State Police Firearms Investigation Unit which recited that a diligent search of the office\u2019s records failed to disclose application for a permit by defendant or issuance of any to him. The affidavit was then placed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Defendant contends that admission of the affidavit, in lieu of producing the live witness, violated his right of confrontation under the federal constitution. We disagree. Reasonable hearsay exceptions developed by state law do not violate the confrontation clause. <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>74, 83, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>210, 216, 27 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>213 (1970). <em>See also Federal Rules Evidence, </em>\u00a7 803(10); 5 <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>(Chadbourn Ed. 1974) \u00a7 1678 at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The plain language of <em>Evid.R. </em>63(17) contemplates this type of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">Subject to Rule 64, a writing purporting to be a copy of an official record or of an entry therein is admissible to prove the content of that record providing the writing meets the authentication requirements of Rule 68. <em>A writing made by the official custodian of the official records failure to find a record is admissible to prove the absence of a record in a specified office. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\"><em>Wigmore </em>speaks of the common law rule precluding a custodian\u2019s certificate of a due search which disclosed nothing thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>... It will someday be reckoned as one .of the most stupid instances of legal pedantry in our annals. The certificate of a custodian that he has diligently searched for a document or an entry of a specified tenor and has been unable to find it ought to be usually as satisfactory for evidencing its nonexistence in his office as his testimony on the stand to this effect would be; and accordingly by statute or court rule custodians\u2019 certificates of this sort have been expressly made admissible. <em>[Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 1678 at 868.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Moreover, the burden of going forward with proof on this issue falls upon the defendant, although the ultimate burden of persuasion rests on the State. <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526 (1969), <em>cert. </em>den. 399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 26 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>797 (1970); <em>see also Ellison v. Housing Auth. of So.
