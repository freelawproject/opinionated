It was sold by auction by the plaintiff to the defendant, on September 13, 1883, and a contract in writing, the terms of which are above set forth, was executed by the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-10\">The defendant, on being tendered a deed, refused to accept the same, on the ground that the title to lot 7, being the greater portion of the premises and embracing the frontage on Nahant Road, was defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-11\">The plaintiff has done all required to entitle her to specific performance, if the title shown by her is such as can be forced upon a purchaser, and the defendant has done all required to discharge himself from all obligations under the contract, if the title shown is not such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The territory known as Nab ant was originally a part of Lynn, and was in 1706 owned by the inhabitants of the town collectively. It was in that year, by a vote of the town, a copy of which is printed in the margin,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> divided into lots, and set off and assigned in fee to individual proprietors. After these Nahant lots were so set off, the portion thereof not fenced and occupied by the owners was called the \u201c common pasture,\u201d and was managed by an association of proprietors, and records thereof were kept by persons called the clerks of the pasture. Between 1820 and 1850 the ownership of three acres of land in the common pasture entitled a person to the pasturage of one cow, and such right was commonly called a cow lease or right; and such descriptions are not infrequently found in old deeds. Said lot 7, containing two acres and thirty-four poles, was set off in the above division to one Jeremiah Shepard. The children of said Shepard conveyed their homestead lot, with all their father\u2019s common lots (without other description of the common lots than that they conveyed all such lots belonging to their father), to one Joseph Jacobs, in 1720. No settlement of said Shepard's estate is found in the Probate Court, and no deed is found of record from said Shepard or his heirs affecting the locus, except said deed to Jacobs; and no deed is found of record from said Jacobs or his heirs, (it being unknown who were the heirs of Jacobs at his decease, or who are his heirs at the present day,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>or from any other person, describing the Shepard lot by definite description, until the deed of Caleb Johnson hereinafter referred to, which purports to convey land forming a part of said Shepard lot, although no reference is made in the deed to said lot by name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim of title is as follows: Isaiah Breed\u2019s will was proved in 1809 in Essex, and the residue of his estate was devised to his grandsons Moses Breed and Jabez Breed (called junior), on condition of their making certain payments to other legatees. His inventory claimed six acres of pasture land in Nahant, without further description, which were not disposed of by the will except by the residuary clause. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">Moses and Jabez Breed, by deed dated January 20, 1818, conveyed three acres of land in Nahant in a different part of the \u201c general pasture \u201d from the locus, with a definite description.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">Jabez Breed conveyed to Moses Breed, by deed dated January 21,1818, \u201c all my right, title, and interest in the general pasture Nahant, conveyed me by grandfather Josiah Breed by his last will and testament, and is by estimation three acres,^ wherever the same may be found.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">Moses Breed conveyed to Caleb Johnson, by deed dated July 28, 1845, \u201c one cow lease in the common pasture on Nahant, comprising three acres of land which I inherited from my grandfather, Isaiah Breed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">Caleb Johnson enclosed a tract of land, being about three quarters of the Jeremiah Shepard lot, and the whole of said lot southwest of Nahant Road, of which the locus is apart, in the fall of 1845, and at that time it bore no marks of having ever been fenced, or of having been used otherwise than as pasturage ground; and he and his grantees have been in open and peaceable possession of the same from that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">Caleb Johnson conveyed the locus to Artemas Murdock by warranty deed dated April 10,1854, recorded with Essex Deeds, Southern District, book 494, leaf 50.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s title is under the will of her father, said Murdock, who died March 18,1882, and she takes whatever title her father possessed; and evidence was duly perpetuated of the giving of notice of the appointment of his executor, who qualified April 17, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The records of the proprietors of the common pasture show that Moses Breed claimed to be one of the proprietors of the pasture, and acted with them at their meetings and otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-4\">The organization of proprietors was abandoned several years ago, nearly all the land in Great Nahant having become occupied in severalty by the different owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">No litigation is known to the parties to be pending or threatened affecting the locus, except this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">The parties have no knowledge of any person ever having been in possession of the locus other than Caleb Johnson (who died in 1868) and his grantees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">Land at Nahant until within fifty years was of little value, and the proprietors were careless in drawing and recording their deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">Between 1819 and 1855, Caleb Johnson took at least eight deeds of land and cow leases in the common pasture Nahant (including said Breed cow lease), without location or definite description.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">In 1855, Caleb Johnson recorded in the registry of deeds for Essex county a paper writing, certifying that, having purchased several acres of land in the Nahant pasture, and having good and sufficient deeds of the same bearing different dates, \u201cbut not definitely describing the land, only locating it on Nahant,\u201d and that, \u201c having ascertained that there are at this time several lots of land on Nahant in the general pasture which are not claimed,\u201d he entered upon certain described lots, and took possession of them, as part of the lands purchased by him, by the deeds above referred to.

No purchaser could rea'onably be held to expect, from these terms and conditions, that a title by adverse possession, depending upon a long and difficult investigation of facts, would be offered to him. The title may be good; but a purchaser under such terms and conditions ought not to be held bound to accept it, and assume the burden of defending it against all comers. <em>Butts </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>136 Mass. 221. <em>Bill dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
