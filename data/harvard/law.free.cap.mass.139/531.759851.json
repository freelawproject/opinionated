Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bacon, </em>J., who reported the case for the determination of this court, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuxX\">The plaintiff and the defendants were brokers, and members of an association in Boston known as the Boston Mining and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Stock Exchange, from 1880 until the early part of the year 1882. On October 25, 1881, the plaintiff at said Exchange, in open board and by auction in the usual way, sold the defendants three hundred shares of the stock of the Milton Mining and Milling Company, a corporation established under the laws of the State of Maine, on sixty days, buyer\u2019s option; and, in pursuance of the usage of the Exchange, to allow one day\u2019s delay before the papers are passed in such cases, on October 26, 1881, a paper was executed and signed by the defendants at their place of business in Boston, and was there delivered to the plaintiff, as follows: \u201c300 Shares. Boston, Oct. 25,1881. We have purchased of L. B. Frazier three hundred shares of the stock of the Milton Mining and Milling Company at one dollar and nineteen cents per share, payable and deliverable buyer\u2019s option, sixty days, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-4\">In these transactions both the plaintiff and the defendants were, without notice to each other, acting as brokers for other parties; and, at the time of the execution of said paper, the plaintiff bad in his possession certificates for three hundred shares of said stock, which he was duly authorized by his principal to sell for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">Said certificates were not put in evidence, it being agreed at the trial that they appeared upon their face to have been issued to parties not concerned in this suit, and that each certificate bore upon its back, at the time the above paper dated October 25 was signed, the usual power of attorney to transfer the stock thereby represented, such power of attorney appearing upon its face to have been executed in blank (and witnessed) in the usual way by the party to whom such certificate appeared upon its face to have been issued; and said certificates also bore upon their face a provision that said stock was only transferable on the books of the company; and it was further agreed that no transfer of the stock in question on the books of said Milton Mining and Milling Company, either to the plaintiff or to the defendants, was ever made or attempted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">On October 27,1881, the plaintiff called for a margin of twenty per cent of the contract price; and on the following day, October 28, in pursuance of certain rules of said Exchange, a copy of which rules is hereinafter set forth, the plaintiff deposited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>in the hands of the American Loan and Trust Company, at its office in Boston, said certificates for said three hundred shares of stock, with a power of attorney on each, executed in blank, and received from said trust company the following receipt: \u201c Three hundred shares.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvH\">There may be a bargain and sale of goods, sufficient to transfer the title, and thus to support an action for goods bai\u2019gained and sold, without any such delivery as will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>amount to a transfer of possession. The former is quite consistent with the vendor\u2019s retaining a lien for the price, and thus retaining possession till the price is paid. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>106 Mass. 430, 432. <em>Haskins </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>115 Mass. 514, 533. <em>Safford </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>120 Mass. 290. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Delano, </em>4 Cush. 33, 38. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>5 B. &amp; C. 857. 2 Kent Com. 492. In the present case, it may be assumed that the title to the shares did not pass at once, upon the completion of the contract of October 25,1881. The words \u201cwe have purchased\u201d do not necessarily import a present transfer of property to the purchaser, if it appears that the intention of the parties was otherwise. <em>Sherwin </em>v. <em>Mudge, </em>127 Mass. 547. The words \u201c payable and deliverable, buyer\u2019s option, sixty days,\u201d go to show that the parties did not intend a present transfer. But according to the rules of the Mining and Stock Exchange, to which both parties belonged, on all contracts for stocks or bonds sold on time, either party might require deposits to be made at any time during the existence of the contract; and when such deposit should be called for after the next session of the board, on buyer contracts where the cash price, at the time a deposit is called, is below the contract price, the buyer shall deposit an amount equal to the difference between the contract price and the cash price at the time the deposit is called, and ten per cent of said cash price additional; and the seller shall deposit ten p\u00e9r cent of the cash price at the time the said deposit is called. And the seller shall always have the privilege of depositing the whole amount of the stock sold in lieu of the cash, in which case the margins shall be paid to him by the buyer, and the amount credited on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">It does not expressly appear, in the present case, that on October 27 the cash price of the shares in question was below the contract price; but this is fairly to be inferred from the call that was made, and the defendants\u2019 acquiescence in it, and indeed nothing to the contrary has been suggested by the defendants at the argument. On that day, the plaintiff called for a margin of twenty per cent of the contract price; and on October 28, in pursuance of the above rules, he deposited with the American Loan and Trust Company the certificates of the shares, with powers of attorney for their transfer executed in blank; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>and on the same day the defendants paid to the plaintiff twenty per cent of the contract price. This was a part payment of the price. The trust company thereafter held the shares, and the plaintiff could not withdraw them without the defendants\u2019 concurrence. Nothing more was to be done by the plaintiff to effect a complete delivery of them, except to indorse and surrender the receipt taken from the trust company. The specific shares were appropriated to the defendants, the price was ascertained, the defendants were entitled to obtain possession of them at any time upon payment of the balance of the price, the receipt was merely in the nature of a vendor\u2019s lien for the price, and the whole transaction was assented to by the defendants; and we are of opinion that this amounted to a transfer of the title, subject simply to the right of the plaintiff to require the trust company to obtain the price before surrendering the possession of the certificates. The plaintiff was bound to indorse the receipt, as soon as payment should be made. The deposit of the stock in lieu of the cash, and the payment of the margin by the defendants to the plaintiff, to be credited on the contract, under the twenty-fifth rule, show a change in the condition of the parties after that transaction, and amount to a transfer of title, and entitle the plaintiff, after the expiration of the sixty days, to maintain an action for the price. See also <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>112 Mass. 265; <em>Middlesex Co. </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>4 Gray, 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The defendants further contend that it was necessary for the plaintiff, in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case, to show that he was authorized by the owner to sell the shares at the time when the contract was made. But this objection is covered by the statement in the report, that, at the time of the execution of the paper, the plaintiff had in his possession certificates for three hundred shares of the stock, which he was duly authorized by his principal to sell for him. This takes the case out of the statute. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>105, \u00a7 6. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
