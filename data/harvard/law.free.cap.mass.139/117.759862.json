Bacon, and certain legatees thereunder, against the executor of the will of Eliza F. Eddy, Lucy Stone, wife of H. B. Blackwell, Susan B. Anthony, and other legatees thereunder, and the Attorney General, to compel \u25a0 the executor of said Eddy\u2019s will to pay over to the plaintiffs the residue of her estate. The bill alleged the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">Francis Jackson, the father of said Eliza F. Eddy, died in 1861, leaving a will, by the sixth article of which he gave $5000 to Wendell Phillips, Lucy Stone Blackwell, and Susan B. Anthony, in trust, \u201c to be expended by them without any responsibility to any one, at their discretion, in such sums, at such times, and in such places as they may deem fit, to secure the passage of laws granting women, whether married or unmarried, the right to vote, to hold office, to hold, manage, and devise property, and all other civil rights enjoyed by men ; and for the preparation and circulation of books, the delivery of lectures, and such other means as they may judge best.\u201d By the eighth article he gave one third of the residue to a trustee, to pay the income to his daughter, Eliza F. Eddy, during her life, and upon her death one half of the income to the trustees and on the trusts named in the sixth article, and the other half to Mrs. Eddy\u2019s daughter, Mrs. Lizzie F. Bacon, during her life, and, on the death of Mrs. Bacon, the principal to the trustees and on the trusts named in the sixth article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>It was held by this court that these bequests were not a charity. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>14 Allen, 539.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">In consequence of this decision, certain agreements, releases, and a partition were made, by which one third of the residue of Mr. Jackson\u2019s estate became the property of Mrs. Eddy, subject to being held in trust for herself for life, and thereafter, as to one half, for her daughter, Mrs. Bacon, during her life. Mrs. Eddy died, December 29,\" 1881, leaving a will by which she. gave absolute legacies to the amount of $24,500 to various persons therein named. This disposed of all her estate except what came to her from her father\u2019s estate. Her will then provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">\u201c What is.left after paying the above legacies I direct shall be divided into two equal portions; one of said portions I leave to Miss Susan B. Anthony, of Rochester, in the State of New York, as her absolute property, and the other portion I leave to Lucy Stone, wife of H. B. Blackwell, as her own absolute and separate property, free from any control of him. I request said Susan and Lucy to use said fund thus given to further what is called the Woman\u2019s Rights Cause. But neither of them is under any legal responsibility to any one or any court to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">The bill further alleged that this residue was substantially the estate received from Francis Jackson; that the will was intended by the testatrix to defeat the decision of this court, before mentioned; that the testatrix had no personal acquaintance with Lucy Stone or Susan B. Anthony; that said gift was intended as a gift <em>in perpetuam </em>to the said cause, and was, without limit of time, upon trust in favor of said cause; and that said cause was not a charity within the meaning of the law, and was null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">The defendants demurred to the bill for want of equity. The case was heard by <em>0. Allen, </em>J., on the bill and demurrer, and a decree was entered sustaining the demurrer, and dismissing the bill. The plaintiffs appealed to the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-8\"><em>R. M. Morse, Jr. &amp; S. J.

It had been held in <em>Jackson </em>v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 539, that a certain bequest made by Mr. Jackson in trust was not, legally speaking, a public charity, and that it could not therefore pass to the beneficiaries named in his will. The property which he thus attempted to bequeath descended therefore to his legal representatives, of whom Mrs. Eddy was one. She received it with the same right to deal with it or dispose of it in her lifetime, or by will at her decease, that she had in any other estate which was her lawful property.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The bill alleges \u201c that said will was intended by the testatrix to defeat the decision of the court, before mentioned; that the testatrix had no personal acquaintance with Lucy Stone or Susan B. Anthony; that said gift was intended as a gift <em>in perpetuam </em>to the said cause.\u201d But if Mrs. Eddy has complied with the rules of law in the disposition of her property, even if she has hoped thereby to attain the same object as that desired by her father, the decision referred to is not defeated, but is recognized and conformed to; and, whatever her intention may have been, her bequest is to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Her gift to her beneficiaries is absolute in terms. They may do what they will with the property bequeathed to them, as they may with any other property which is lawfully their own. It is true that the gift is accompanied by a request that they will use the fund bequeathed \u201c to further what is called the Woman\u2019s Rights Cause.\u201d A request made by one who has the right to direct is often, perhaps generally, interpreted as a command. For this reason, recommendatory or precatory words used in a bequest are frequently treated as an express direction. Thus if a legacy were given to A. with a request that out of the sum bequeathed he would pay to another a certain sum, or a portion thereof, it might well be construed as a legacy, to the amount named, to such person. The expression of the desire of the testator would be the expression of his will, and the words in form recommendatory would be held to be mandatory and imperative. Where such words are used, it is therefore a question of the fair construction to be attributed to them. <em>Whipple </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>v. <em>Adams, </em>1 Met. 444. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>98 Mass. 274. <em>Spooner </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>108 Mass. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">But the testatrix in the case at bar has left nothing to construction. Apparently aware that a request, where she had a right to direct, might be treated as a command, and desirous to make it entirely clear that no restraint or duty in any legal sense was imposed upon her legatees, and that the request of the will was such in the limited sense of the word only, and in no respect mandatory, she adds thereto, referring to the legatees, \u201c But neither of them is under any legal responsibility to. any one or to any court to do so.\u201d Each of the legatees is therefore the sole judge of whether she will follow, or how far or in what way she will follow, the suggestion of the testatrix in the disposition of the estate absolutely bequeathed to her. It is a matter in which she is to be guided only by her judgment and conscience, and no trust is imposed upon the property she receives.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">As no trust is created, it would be superfluous to consider whether, if the request of the testatrix were treated as a command, one would then be indicated capable of enforcement according to the rules of law. <em>Bill dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
