Forbes, upon a promissory note in the sum of $1000, dated June I, 1868, payable, with interest, on demand, to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and signed by the defendant. Writ dated June 13, 1883.

I am very sorry to be obliged to disappoint you, but at present I cannot do anything. I have not fairly got to going since my stoppage, but am getting things into better shape, and if I can have time shall meet all my obligations. I have not yet received one cent on the old account, but have the promise of some, and as soon as I get anything shall do something for you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">\u201c September 24, 1881. It is my honest determination to pay every cent I owe, but to save my life I could not do it now. I must have time. I regret exceedingly that I cannot do more for you at this time. I am laboring at a disadvantage for want of available capital, and every dollar I take out of my business now makes it worse. I will send you a check, which you can get cashed at any place where you are known.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">\u201c December 19,1881. I received a letter from you some time ago saying that you would want a hundred dollars the first of January, and I made arrangements to have it for you. Since that letter I received one \u2014 not from you \u2014 saying you would like to have me send some money the middle of the month. That letter was not signed by you ; therefore I did not answer it. I regret exceedingly that I cannot send you all your money now. I trust you will get all some time, but it will be impossible to raise it now. I send you fifty now, and another fifty as soon after the first of January as I can collect it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">\u201c Boston, April 11,1882. I have the promise of some money this month; until I get it cannot send any. Have patience and I will work it out some time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">\u201c May 3,1882. Your note I have just received, and will send you twenty-five dollars now, and will send more just as soon as I can collect it. I have money due me the same as you have, and I have to wait the same as you do. By taking money out of my business now makes the chances less for getting money to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>pay the old demands. If I can have time to get a fair start I shall work it all out in time. I got caught as many others did, and I gave up all I had. I am now laboring at a disadvantage, but mean to see that all shall have their pay ; but they must not press me, as I cannot accomplish impossibilities. Hoping that you will be able to keep along until I can do more for you, I will send this, which I cannot well spare at this time. I have been disappointed as you have been, and that is the reason I have for disappointing you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">\u201c Boston, June 5, 1882. I have just received your call. Wish I could give you the whole, but cannot at present. Hope to be able to send you more soon. You must get along a little while : there are others as needy as you are. I hope to be able to satisfy them all some time, but cannot just now. I will send a check for fifty dollars now, and more as soon as I can get it. Please let me know if you get this all right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">The judge ruled that these letters did not contain a sufficient promise to enable the plaintiff to maintain the action; and gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-6\"><em>R. B. Caverly J. L. Hunt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>C. C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A467\">The letters of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate set forth in the bill of exceptions are not sufficient evidence of a new contract which deprives the defendant of the benefit of his discharge in insolvency. They refer to his insolvency, express his desire to pay all his debts, and his hope and trust that he will be able to pay the debt of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate in the future, speak of partial payments, and express regret that he is not able to do more ; but they do not contain language which amounts to a clear and unequivocal promise to pay the whole debt, or an undertaking which is inconsistent with a reliance upon his discharge. The cases of <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Cumner, </em>136 Mass. 102, and <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>ante, 12, are decisive of the case at bar. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
