At the same term, the declaration was amended by adding a third count, and by inserting certain words in the first and second counts. The plaintiff had also leave to amend her writ by adding after the word \u201c tort \u201d the words \u201c or contract, the plaintiff being doubtful to which class of actions this action belongs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\">The declaration as amended was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">\u201c 1.

And the plaintiff says that she, having a lawful right to do so, and having a ticket therefor, partook of the food and drink furnished by the defendant on that occasion, trusting and believing that the same was good and wholesome, and fit and suitable to be eaten, and had been properly and carefully prepared by defendant; but the plaintiff says said food and drink were not good and wholesome and properly prepared, but were improperly and negligently prepared, were poisonous, unwholesome, and unfit to be eaten, and, by reason thereof, the plaintiff was poisoned and greatly injured and made very sick, and endured thereby for a long time, even to the present time, great pain and suffering, and was subjected, by reason thereof, to great expense for medical attendance and medicine, and was obliged to have, and did have, nurses to wait upon and attend her in her sickness, and massage treatment; and she further says, by reason thereof, she was unable to attend to her usual and ordinary duties in her profession of music, and was so unable to attend for many months, and is so unable to attend to them, and was lastingly and permanently injured; and she further says, that, at the time she was so poisoned and injured, she had made contracts and engagements to sing at concerts and give music lessons, and by reason of said poisoning and sickness she was unable to fulfil her contracts and engagements, and was subjected, by reason thereof, to great pecuniary loss; and she says further, that, by reason thereof, she was obliged to live in a different manner and at a greater expense than she otherwise would have .done, not only in having nurses, medicines, and medical attendance, and massage treatment, but to obtain, \"at great expense, delicacies she would not have had to obtain, and to go away to the sea-shore and other places, at great expense, for the recovery of her health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">\u201c 3. And the plaintiff further says, that, on or about May 7, 1883, she attended, with a large number of others, and whosoever wished, the triennial ball of the Handel and Haydn Society, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in Boston, and bad a ticket therefor, and was rightly and properly present on that occasion; and she says that the defendant is by profession a caterer, and holds himself out to the public to be skilled in the preparation and compounding of foods and drinks, and claims to furnish the public with good and wholesome food and drink; and the defendant was employed to cater at said ball for all who might attend the same, if they so desired, and to furnish good and wholesome food and drink, and to be paid therefor at the rate of $1.25 a plate, to all who paid for or were furnished with supper tickets, so called; and the defendant undertook to and did do the catering at said ball, and was himself present, attending to overlooking and superintending the catering, and furnished the attendants and waiters therefor, who waited upon and furnished the food and drink for each and every person who partook thereof; and the defendant furnished all the tables and chairs and other things necessary to do the catering on that occasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">\u201c And the plaintiff says, that supper tickets, so called, were issued on said occasion at $1.25 each, entitling the holder thereof to the supper and refreshments furnished by the defendant on that occasion; and she says she had, or was furnished with, such a ticket; and the $1.25, so paid for said ticket, was paid over to the defendant, and the defendant, in consideration thereof, undertook to and did furnish plaintiff with food and drink on that occasion, and she ate of the same, trusting and believing that the same was wholesome and good, and safe to be eaten, and had been properly prepared by the defendant; but the plaintiff says that said food and drink were improperly and negligently prepared, and were unwholesome, poisonous, dangerous, and unfit to be eaten; and by reason thereof the plaintiff was poisoned and greatly injured, and made very sick, and endured thereby for a long time, even to the present time, great pain and suffering, and was subjected, by reason thereof, to great expense for medical attendance and medicine, and was obliged to have, and did have, nurses to wait upon and attend her in her sickness, and massage treatment; and she further says, by reason thereof, she was unable to attend to her usual and ordinary duties in her profession of music, and so unable to attend for many months, and is still so unable to attend to them, and was lastingly and permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>injured; and she further says, that, at the time she was so poisoned and injured, she had made contracts and engagements to sing at concerts and give music lessons, and, by reason of said poisoning and sickness, she was unable to fulfil her contracts and engagements, and was subjected, by reason thereof, to great pecuniary loss; and she says further, that, by reason thereof, she was obliged to live in a different manner and at a greater expense than she otherwise would have done, not only in having nurses, medicines, and medical attendance, and massage treatment, but to obtain, at great expense, delicacies she would not otherwise have had to obtain, and to go away to the seashore and other places, at great expense, for the recovery of her health.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, assigning the following reasons therefor: \u201c 1. The said declaration does not, nor does either count thereof, state a legal cause of action in the manner or with the substantial precision and certainty required by the statutes and by the rules of law and practice in this Cdmmonwealth. (\u00ab.) Because neither the ticket referred to in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, nor a copy thereof, nor the legal effect thereof, is set out and made part of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. (5.) Because divers alleged causes of action are averred, without specifying from which cause the plaintiff\u2019s injury is claimed to have arisen, and for some of which causes as set forth, if not for each and all of them, the defendant is not liable, (c.) Because of repugnancy between the averments in the different counts of the declaration. <em>2. </em>Counts in contract and counts in tort are improperly joined in the said declaration. 3. Said declaration does not, nor does either count thereof, allege any relation or duty of the defendant to the plaintiff, for the breach of which the plaintiff\u2019s action will lie, nor does the declaration or either count thereof allege any breach of any such relation. 4. Said declaration does not, nor does either count thereof, anywhere aver any wrongful act or omission of duty of the defendant, for which he can be held responsible to the plaintiff. 5. Said declaration does not, nor does either count thereof, allege knowledge on the part of the defendant of any defect in any food or drink alleged to have been supplied by the defendant, or any negligence in the selection of either.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and ordered judgment for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-4\"><em>J. </em>D. <em>Bryant, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>B. C. Moulton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b433-6\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axy\">If one who holds himself out to the public as a caterer, skilled in providing and preparing food for entertainments, is employed as such, by those who arrange for an entertainment, to furnish food and drink for all who may attend it, and if he undertakes to perform the service accordingly, he stands in such a relation of duty, towards a person who lawfully attends the entertainment, and partakes of the food furnished by him, as to be liable to an action of tort for negligence in furnishing unwholesome food, whereby such person is injured. This liability does not rest so much upon an implied contract, as upon a violated or neglected duty voluntarily assumed. Indeed, where the guests are entertained without pay,' it would be hard to establish an implied contract with each individual. The duty, however, arises from the relation of the caterer to the guests. The latter have a right to assume that he will furnish for their consumption provisions which are not unwholesome and injurious through any neglect on his part. The furnishing of provisions which endanger human life or health stands clearly upon the same ground as the administering of improper medicines, from which a liability springs irrespective of any question of privity of contract between the parties. <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Sewall, </em>106 Mass. 143. <em>Longmeid </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>6 Exch. 761. <em>Pippin </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>11 Price, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s action was originally entitled \u201c in an action of tort.\u201d The plaintiff obtained leave to amend by adding the words \u201c or contract, the plaintiff being doubtful to which class of actions this action belongs.\u201d This amendment was unnecessary, and may be disregarded, all the amended counts upon which the plaintiff relies being in tort. It is not necessary to sustain the demurrer on account of this lack of literal precision in entitling the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The defendant relies on several other extremely fine points of objection, but, without dwelling on them in detail, it may be said, in general terms, that the several counts sufficiently set forth the facts from which the duty of the defendant towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the plaintiff sprung, and it is not necessary to state formally and in terms that the defendant occupied such a relation towards the plaintiff that the law cast upon him the duty; they also sufficiently aver that the defendant neglected that duty, and that the plaintiff was injured by reason thereof. It is not necessary to aver that the defendant knew of the injurious quality of the food. It is sufficient if it appears that he ought to have known of it, and was negligent in furnishing unwholesome food, by reason whereof the plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
