The bill of lading further provided, that the Despatch Company should not be liable for certain risks; and that, in case of loss whereby any legal liability might be incurred, \u201c that company shall alone be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same may be at the time of the happening thereof; \u201d and that, in case of loss \u201c for which either of said companies may be liable, it is agreed that said company shall have the benefit of any insurance effected by or for account of the owner of said goods.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that for a loss occurring between B. and C. the owner of the goods could maintain an action against all the corporations forming the association.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-9\">Contract, against the Fitchburg Railroad Company and seven other railroad corporations, described in the writ as \u201c doing business together as a line for the purpose of carrying freight, under the name of \u2018 Erie and North Shore Despatch,\u2019 \u201d and having a usual place of business in Boston. The declaration alleged a delivery of a package of goods to the defendants at Boston, to be delivered to the plaintiff at Denver, Colorado, under a bill of lading, and the non-delivery thereof. The bill of lading, which was headed \u201c Erie and North Shore Despatch Fast Freight Line,\u201d and acknowledged the receipt of the package, contained the following clauses:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">\u201c It is understood and hereby agreed that the Erie and North Shore Despatch will not be liable for loss or damage or delays to the above goods on any river or lake, and the goods may be stored at the risk and expense of the owners when reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>necessary, and said company and any company carrying said property will not be liable for any loss, damage, or delay caused by guerillas, military seizure or occupation of engines, cars, or road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\">\u201c The property is supposed to be marked as per margin, and is to be transported by the Fitchburg Railroad, and thence by the Erie and North Shore Despatch to Chicago, and there delivered to the agents of connecting steamboat or railroad company, and by them to be delivered to the next connecting steamboat or railroad company, and in like manner to be delivered to each connecting company, until said goods shall have reached the point named in this bill of lading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">\u201c And in consideration that this company has reduced the price of such transportation below the local rates, the shipper and owner does hereby release the Erie and North Shore Despatch, and the steamboat and railroad company which may receive said property, from liability from leakage of all kinds of liquids, breakage of all kinds of marble, glass, carboys of acid (or articles packed in glass), stoves and stove furniture, castings, machinery, furniture, carriages, musical instruments of all kinds, packages of eggs, and other frail and brittle articles; also, from loss or damage on hay, hemp, cotton, or any article that may be carried in open cars; and from damage to perishable property of all kinds; and also from damage or loss to any article from or by fire or explosion of any kind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">\u201c It is further stipulated and agreed, that in case of any loss, detriment or damage done to or sustained by any of the property herein receipted for, during such transportation, whereby any legal' liability or responsibility shall or may be incurred, that company shall alone be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same may be at the time of the happening thereof.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4G\">The evidence at the trial tended to show that the several defendant corporations formed an association or company under the name of the \u201c Erie and North Shore Despatch Fast Freight Line,\u201d for the transportation of merchandise between Boston and Chicago; that the association had an agent in Boston, who was authorized to receive goods at Boston for transportation over the line to Chicago, and to give bills of lading or contracts for transportation like the one upon which the plaintiff sues; that the plaintiff delivered goods to such agent, and received the bill of lading in suit, and that a part of the goods were lost between Boston and Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">By the bill of lading, the \u201c Erie and North Shore Despatch \u201d contracts to carry the goods from Boston by the Fitchburg Railroad, and thence by the Erie and North Shore Despatch, to Chicago, and there to deliver them to connecting railroad lines, to be forwarded to Denver, their destination. The several railroad companies which form the association are not named in the contract. It is a single and indivisible contract, by which the Erie and North Shore Despatch Line agrees to carry the goods to Chicago, the freight to be earned upon the delivery there to the connecting line. So far as the question in this case is concerned, it is unlike those cases where a railroad forming one link in a line of connecting roads between two points receives goods to be transported over its line and delivered to the connecting road, in which it has been held in this Commonwealth that each railroad in the continuous line is liable only for loss or damage happening on its own road. <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester </em>Railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>11 Allen, 295. <em>Gass </em>v. <em>New York, Providence, &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>99 Mass. 220. <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Norwich &amp; Worcester Railroad, </em>100 Mass. 26. <em>Aigen </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>132 Mass. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The defendants formed a company, and in its name made a special contract to carry the plaintiff\u2019s goods from Boston to Chicago. They are, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, partners, and liable jointly and severally for any loss or damage to his goods between Boston and Chicago, unless they are exempted from liability by the terms of the contract. <em>Hill Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Lowell Railroad, </em>104 Mass. 122. The principal difficulty in this case is as to the true construction of the contract of carriage. It contains the provision, that, in case of loss or damage to the property received, \u201cwhereby any legal liability or responsibility shall or may be incurred, that company shall alone be held answerable therefor in whose actual custody the same may be at the time of the happening thereof.\u201d It also contains a provision, that, in case of loss' or damage of any of the goods \u201c for which either of said companies may be liable, it is agreed that said company shall have the benefit of any insurance effected \u201d thereon by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendant contends that the expression \u201c that company,\u201d in the clause above cited, means that railroad company in any part of the continuous line between Boston and Denver; so that, although the plaintiff\u2019s loss occurred between Boston and Chicago, that railroad company in whose\" custody the goods were when lost is alone liable. This is not the necessary, and we do not think it is the fair, construction of the defendants\u2019 contract. By it, the Erie and North Shore Despatch, as a company, undertakes to carry the goods to Chicago, and there to deliver them to a connecting line. The several railroads which constitute this company are not named or referred to in the contract. It is in the same terms as if the Erie and North Shore Despatch had been a single railroad corporation, with a road from Boston to Chicago.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In other parts of the contract, the expressions \u201cthis company\u201d and \u201csaid company\u201d are used in connections which clearly show that they refer to the Despatch Company, and not to any railroad company between Boston and Chicago. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>there is the provision, that it is \u201c agreed that the Erie and North Shore Despatch will not be liable for loss or damage or delays to the above goods on any river or lake,\u201d and \u201c said company and any company carrying said property will not be liable for any loss\u201d by guerillas or military seizure. So there is the provision, that, \u201c in consideration that this company has reduced the price of such transportation below the local rates, the shipper and owner does hereby release the Erie and North Shore Despatch, and the steamboat and railroad company which may receive said property, from liability for leakage,\u201d &amp;c. In these clauses the word \u201c company\u201d clearly refers only to the Despatch Company and the connecting company or companies between Chicago and Denver.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The words \u201c said company,\u201d or \u201c said companies,\u201d used in the clause as to insurance and in other places, by their natural interpretation, refer to companies which have previously been named. We cannot see why the words \u201c that company \u201d in the clause we are considering should receive a different construction from that given to equivalent or similar words in other parts of the contract. The plaintiff was dealing with the Despatch Company alone for the transportation as far as Chicago. He did not know the parties who composed that company, and entered into no separate contract with either of them. He had the right to interpret the words \u201c that company \u201d as meaning the Despatch Company, and not a railroad company nowhere named in his contract. The effect of this interpretation is, what seems to have been in the minds of the parties, to release the Despatch Company from liability after it had carried the goods to the end of its route, according to its contract, and had delivered them to the connecting carrier, and to hold it liable to the point to which it had assumed and contracted to transport the goods as a common carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We are of opinion that this is the fair construction of the contract, and therefore that the learned justice who presided at the trial in the Superior Court erred in directing a verdict for the defendants. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
