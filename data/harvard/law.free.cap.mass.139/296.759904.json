The record showed an item for service of writ, $5.86, which included a charge of $3, for \u201c custody and keeping; \u201d also $1, for a \u201c commission,\u201d and $10, for \u201c commissioner\u2019s fee; \u201d and a certificate of the clerk that the last was taxed according to an affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he paid the same, the commissioner not returning any fees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-9\">It further showed that the plaintiff claimed forty-seven term fees; that the clerk of the Superior Court allowed three for that court, and three more for each time the questions of law were before the Supreme Judicial Court; that Blodgett, J., allowed the plaintiff five additional term fees, and in other respects affirmed the clerk\u2019s taxation of costs; and that the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-10\"><em>S. H. </em>Dudley, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-11\"><em>J. C. </em>Lane, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-12\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXn\">The papers do not disclose in what particulars the defendant contends that the judgment of the Superior Court is erroneous. In his argument here he objects to two items; of which the first is $3 for the custody and keeping of property attached, and the second is $10 for the fee of a commissioner in taking a deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">As the plaintiff claimed forty-seven term fees, it may be assumed that the action was brought eleven or twelve years ago, and that the attachment was made before the passage of the St. of 1878, e. 272, and before the decision of this court in <em>Cutter </em>v. Howe, 122 Mass. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>But there are no facts before us that enable us to say that the charge of $3 was not an expense reasonably incurred by the attaching officer in keeping the attached property in the manner required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The fees of commissioners in taking depositions are regulated by statute. We do not know where the deposition was taken. We infer that it was taken without the Commonwealth, by a commissioner appointed pursuant to the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7 9; Gren. Sts. <em>c. </em>14, \u00a7 41; and that the fees to be allowed are determined by the Pub. Sts. c. 199, \u00a7 22; St. 1862, <em>a. </em>76. We do not know the number of pages contained in the deposition, as it is not before us, nor do we know whether the amount allowed exceeds the statutory fees; but as the Superior Court, to which the deposition was returnable, was authorized by statute to make a further allowance than that definitely prescribed by the statute, its judgment in this respect cannot be revised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
