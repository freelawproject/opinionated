At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples, </em>J., the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tended to show the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">At the time of the acts complained of, the plaintiffs were, and have ever since been, the owners in fee of the northerly half of Wales Island and the flats adjacent thereto, situated in said South Bay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-10\">At a meeting of the common council of the city of' Boston, held on June 3,1880, the following order was passed: \u201c Ordered, That the board of health be requested to cause to be abated the nuisance at present existing in the South Bay, east of the New York and New England Railroad, and the expense attending the same to be charged to the appropriation for health.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-11\">At a meeting of the board of aldermen of said city, held June 10, 1880, the said order was referred to the committee on health, in concurrence with the vote of said council, passed June 3, aforesaid. At a meeting of said board of aldermen, held July 6, 1880, the eighth annual report of the board of health of the city of Boston, dated May 1, 1880, made as provided in the Public Statutes, was received and sent down; and at a meeting of the common council, held July 8, 1880, said report was placed on file. This report, among other matters referred to, contained the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">\u201c The flats between Dorchester Avenue and the New York and New England Railroad, near Washington Village, are left bare at low tide, and are a source of very offensive odors. The deposit from sewers, and the unclean filling which takes place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>more or less each year, add very much to their offensive condition. Each year since complaints have been made, the board of health have added clean gravel to cover the worst part of the nuisance, and with good effect; but to remedy the whole evil would involve an expenditure of money too large for the appropriation of this department. If the whole of those flats above the Norway Iron Works could be kept covered with water to a depth of two feet by means of a dam, we think that all reasonable complaints would subside; but, so far as we have been able to ascertain from good authority, the great cost of the dam and the risk of damage to adjoining structures would not justify us in the attempt. Clean gravel and deep water alone will effectually abate the nuisance which must till then continue to arise from such filthy mud. A plan is now under advisement by the joint committee on health, by which it is hoped that an inexpensive dam can be built from the rear of the Norway Iron Works on Dorchester Avenue to the New York and New England Railroad, and which would keep the flats covered at all times.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-4\">At a meeting of the common council of said city, held March 29, 1880, the following petition, signed by Daniel J. Cross and others, was presented: \u201c To the city council of the city of Boston : We the undersigned respectfully represent that a portion of South Bay, lying between Dorchester Avenue and the New York and New England Railroad, has become an intolerable nuisance; we therefore request your honorable body that you will take immediate action to abate said nuisance by flowage or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">At a meeting of said common council, held July 12, 1880, said committee on health, to whom was referred the petition of said Cross, reported thereon, that the subject had been duly considered and by them referred to a sub-committee, which had consulted the city engineer, who submitted a statement that a temporary dam as high as grade 5, city base, could be built, which would flood to a depth of two feet, and the estimated cost of which would be $4600; and the committee recommended the passage of the accompanying preamble and order: \u201cWhereas, the board of health has declared a nuisance exists, consisting of offensive flats on the territory between the track of the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>York and New England Railroad Company and Dorchester Avenue, which can be abated by the construction of a dam at an estimated cost of $4600, and as the annual appropriation granted to said board does not contemplate such an expenditure, it is hereby ordered, that the committee on finance be directed to furnish the means for the abatement of the aforesaid nuisance.\u201d This report was accepted, and the said order passed by both branches of said city government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">At a meeting of the board of aldermen, held July 26,1880, the following report was submitted by the committee of finance of said board: \u201c South Bay Nuisance. The committee on finance to whom was referred the report of the committee on health, covering an order that this committee furnish the means for the abatement of the nuisance existing on the territory between the track of the New York and New England Railroad and Dorchester Avenue, would respectfully report the accompanying order granting the request: \u2018 Ordered, that the auditor of accounts be and he hereby is authorized to transfer from the reserved fund the sum of $4600, and that said sum constitute a special appropriation for the purpose of constructing a temporary dam across South Bay, between the New York and New England Railroad track and Dorchester Avenue, for the abatement of the nuisance on the flats therein located; and that the board of health is hereby authorized to have said temporary dam constructed at an expense not exceeding the sum herein provided.\u2019 \u201d This order was passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">At a meeting of the common council, held July 29, 1880, said report and order for a transfer of $4600 from the reserved fund for the construction of a temporary dam across South Bay, between the New York and New England Railroad track and Dorchester Avenue, for the abatement of a nuisance, was passed in concurrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">At a meeting of the common council, held September 23,1880, it was ordered that the committee on health be requested to report to the city council why the nuisance existing in the South Bay has not been abated, an order having been passed and the money appropriated for the same, July 29. This order of September 23 was passed by the common council, and by the board of aldermen in concurrence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>At </em>a meeting of the board of aldermen, held November 1, 1880, said joint committee on health reported that \u201c no further action is required on the order to abate a nuisance on South Bay, said nuisance now being abated; \u201d which report was accepted, and the same was sent down to the common council. At the last-named meeting of the board of aldermen, the committee on health reported on said order of inquiry respecting the nuisance on South Bay flats, \u201cthat the cause of delay in abatement of the nuisance was unavoidable. The work is now progressing and will be completed in a few days.\u201d This order was likewise accepted and sent down to said council. At a meeting of said council, held November 4, 1880, both the last-named reports were accepted in concurrence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">All of the foregoing orders were duly approved by the mayor of said city. On September 8, 1880, Henry M. Wightman, the city engineer of Boston, presented a petition to the board of harbor commissioners of the Commonwealth, for a license \u201c for the construction of a temporary dam in the South Bay from the New York and New England Railroad embankment to Wales Island, so called, .... for the purpose of abating a nuisance existing in that portion of the South Bay south of the dam.\u201d Said board thereupon granted the license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">On or about September 15, 1880, workmen, acting under the direction of Henry M. Wightman, who was at this time city engineer, constructed the dam in question, in accordance with the license of the harbor commissioners, and the cost of building the dam was paid for out of said appropriation. The easterly portion of said dam was built across the flats, and upon a part of the portion of the island owned by the plaintiffs, by driving piles and pile-sheeting into the flats and island, and with gates in the part known as Pine Island Channel, which adjoined said flats. By reason of the omission properly to ballast said dam, said gates were washed away, and the dam was weakened. After this occurred, a large amount of stones and slag were strewn upon the flats along both sides of said dam, and a quantity of larger stones were put into the space in Pine Island Channel, which was left open by the washing away of the gates. Said dam was not securely built, and the water has since the erection of the dam gradually undermined the same, and is now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>flowing out in large quantities underneath the dam, and washing away the bottom of the flats of the plaintiffs. By reason of the confinement of the waters of South Bay by said dam, there has been carried away by the rushing of said water by and over the easterly end of said dam, a large portion of the island owned by the plaintiffs; and this washing away might have been prevented by the building of the dam higher at that end of the island. The tide ebbs and flows in South Bay and about said island; and, before the erection of this dam, the plaintiffs used the island for keeping and storing piles and other timber owned by them, partly together and in part separately; and such use has been to a large extent prevented, the approach to the island from the harbor of said city has been obstructed, and the free flow of water about the island has been almost stopped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">The nuisance complained of existed on flats in said bay south of the plaintiffs\u2019 flats and away from them, and no nuisance existed on the plaintiffs\u2019 flats.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The charter of the city of Boston, St. 1854, <em>o. </em>448, provides in \u00a7 40 as follows: \u201c All the power and authority now by law vested in the city council, or in the board of mayor and aider-men, relative to the public health, and the quarantine of vessels, shall continue to be vested in the city council, to be carried into execution by the appointment of one or more health commissioners ; or in such other manner as the health, cleanliness, comfort, and order of the city may, in their judgment, require, subject to such alterations as the Legislature may from time to time adopt.

L. Pierce\u2019s lumber and planing mill to the track of the New York and New England Railroad, according to a plan submitted by you, at an expense not exceeding forty-six hundred dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">To the admission of this order and letter the plaintiffs objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">It appeared that there was no other dam save the one in question to which the acts and proceedings aforesaid, as shown by the evidence on both sides, could relate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">The defendant then put in evidence, without objection, the bills for building said dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">This was all the evidence in the case material to the question of liability. The judge ruled that the action could not be maintained ; and directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-8\"><em>W. E. L. </em>Dillaway, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-9\"><em>T. M. </em>Babson, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b449-10\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-D\">The difficulty with the plaintiffs\u2019 case is, that neither the board of health nor the city government had any authority to abate the nuisance in the manner which was adopted. That manner was by the erection of a dam, the easterly portion of which was built across the flats and upon the upland of the plaintiffs, for the purpose of raising the water so as to flow over other flats away from the flats of the plaintiffs ; the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence tending to show that no nuisance existed on their own flats. This was an occupation of the plaintiffs\u2019 land which the city had no power to make, without the plaintiffs\u2019 consent. No statute conferred the power of appropriating the plaintiffs\u2019 property for public uses, nor provided compensation to them for damages sustained by such appropriation. When the preservation of the public health has been thought to require such acts as the filling of land, or raising its grade, over a considerable extent of territory, or the covering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of land with water, or the removal of dams from streams, in order to allow better drainage or to prevent the accumulation of offensive materials, it has been usual to pass statutes giving the requisite authority, and making due provision for the protection of the property of individuals. Instances of such legislation may be found in the St. of 1867, <em>c. </em>308, authorizing the city of Boston to take certain lands in the Church Street district, so called, which was before this court for consideration in <em>Dingley </em>v. Boston, 100 Mass. 544, and in <em>Cobb </em>v. Boston, 109 Mass. 438, and 112 Mass. 181; in the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>378, authorizing the county commissioners of Middlesex county to remove all dams on certain streams, for the purpose of securing proper drainage in certain towns, which was under consideration in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>County </em>Commissioners, 122 Mass. 258, and in <em>Phillips </em>v. Middlesex, 127 Mass. 262; in the St. of 1872, <em>c. </em>299, where the cities of Cambridge and Somerville were authorized to raise certain low lands to a proper level, which was before the court in <em>Cambridge </em>v. Munroe, 126 Mass. 496, <em>Bancroft </em>v. Cambridge, 126 Mass. 438, and <em>Read </em>v. Cambridge, 126 Mass. 427; and in the St. of 1873, <em>c. </em>340, providing for the filling of lands in the Northampton Street district, so called, in Boston, which was considered in <em>Farnsworth </em>v. Boston, 121 Mass. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The general power vested in boards of health and in city governments is not adequate to dealing with such cases, if it is impossible to come to an agreement with the owners of property to be affected. There is no general statute vesting in these bodies the right of eminent domain, or making provision for the compensation of persons whose property may be taken. The general phrases contained in the city ordinances, which have been referred to, authorizing the city council to exercise the powers vested in them for the preservation of the public health in any manner which they may prescribe, cannot be held' to give them authority to take private property for public uses. No such power existed in the body which enacted the city ordinances. In the present case, the acts of which the plaintiffs complain amount to an occupation of their land for the purpose of building a dam thereon in such a manner that clearly it was an appropriation of the land to a public use. It was not a mere transient entry and occupation, though the dam was styled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>temporary ; but there was a substantial and practically exclusive occupation of a portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 land. Such an act was clearly illegal. It does not fall within the principle upon which a brief or momentary occupation of private lands is sometimes justified through necessity, as, for example, for the purpose of making an arrest, or of the perambulation of the boundaries of towns by the selectmen, or of ascertaining boundaries for public purposes. <em>Winslow </em>v. Gifford, 6 Cush. 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The present case is a much stronger one than <em>Brigham </em>v. Edmands, 7 Gray, 359, where a verdict was sustained against the commander of a division of the militia, as a trespasser, for holding the annual encampment provided for by law upon private lands, without the owner\u2019s consent. See also <em>Baker </em>v. Boston, 12 Pick. 184, 194. No doubt the plaintiffs might have obtained an injunction to restrain the prosecution of the work, if they had sought their remedy in that form. <em>Boston Water Power Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester </em>Railroad, 16 Pick. 512, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The acts done having been beyond the authority and power of the city to do, the city cannot be held responsible in damages for what was done under the supposed authority of illegal and void votes. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Hyde </em>Park, 137 Mass. 554. <em>Lemon </em>v. Newton, 134 Mass. 476. <em>Cushing </em>v. Bedford, 125 Mass. 526. But the liability, if any, rests upon the individuals who performed those acts, as in <em>Brigham </em>v. Edmands, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The plaintiffs seek to avoid this result by urging that a part of the damage came from the negligent construction of the dam. But since it was an illegal act to build it at all, it is not apparent how negligence in the trespassers can entail a responsibility on the city. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
