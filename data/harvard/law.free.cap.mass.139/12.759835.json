Writ dated May 15, 1883. Answer : 1. The statute of limitations. 2. A discharge in bankruptcy of debts existing on July 18,1876. Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Brigham, C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-10\">The defendant made the contract alleged. On January 80, 1878, under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>obtained a discharge from all debts provable against his estate in bankruptcy which existed on July 18, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\">On October 7, 1880, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff the following letter: \u201c When I come to Boston I will call and see you. I mean right; I will also pay something on account.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">On February 28, 1881, the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff, containing the following: \u201c I shall pay you something as soon as possible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">After said letters, and before this action, the defendant was in Boston, and had the ability to pay the account declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The judge ruled, upon the above facts, that the defendant\u2019s letters constituted a new promise in writing by him to pay said account; and that this new promise avoided in legal effect his defence in this action of the statute of limitations, and of a discharge in bankruptcy; and found for the plaintiff, and ordered judgment accordingly. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-8\"><em>A. M. </em>Goodspeed, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-9\"><em>L. L. </em>Stimpson, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-10\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">The strength of the plaintiff\u2019s case is in the words, \u201cI will also pay something on account.\u201d There is force in the suggestion that the words \u201c on account \u201d recognize the debt as subsisting, and therefore imply a promise to pay it. But it is to be remembered that the defendant has as much right to his defence as the plaintiff once had to her recovery. The law cannot be supposed to look with disfavor upon a bar of its own creation. Hence the defendant is not to be deprived of his right, unless he uses words that plainly mean to renounce it, or at least express a clear undertaking for the future, which is inconsistent with further reliance upon the discharge. This is the meaning of the often repeated statement, that a new promise, to avoid the effect of a discharge in bankruptcy, must be distinct and unequivocal, <em>(Merriam </em>v. Bayley, 1 Cush. 77, and <em>Elwell </em>v. Cumner, 136 Mass. 102, 104,) a statement which is equally correct in principle, whether the obligation when revived stands on the new promise as such, or on a waiver of the bar which the statute has given the defendant to use or renounce at his will, which is the view adopted by our decisions, although they sometimes seem to imply that such a waiver can only be accomplished by a promise. <em>Cook </em>v. Shearman, 103 Mass. 21. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>Way </em>v. <em>Sperry, </em>6 Cush. 238. <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>3 Met. 439, <em>Maxim </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>8 Mass. 127. See <em>Cambridge Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>6 Cush. 210, 213; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>5 Cush. 484, 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">It follows from what has been said, that an admission that the debt was incurred and has not been satisfied, or, in the language of Chief Justice Shaw, \u201c an acknowledgment of the existence of the debt,\u201d is not enough to prevent a defendant from relying on his discharge. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>7 Cush. 462, 464. Neither is a part payment on account. <em>Cambridge Institution for Savings </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>and <em>Merriam </em>v. <em>Bayley, ubi supra. </em>It stands on a different footing from part payment of a debt barred by the statute of limitations, which has been allowed a greater effect. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>197, \u00a7 16. <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>2 Met. 168. We see no reason why a promise to pay a sum on account should do what an actual payment of it would not do. The words \u201c on account\u201d simply admit the existence of the original debt unsatisfied, and apply the payment to it. They do not in terms waive any defence, and the implication of a new promise is excluded by the promise which is expressed. The latter promise is not to pay the debt, but to pay \u201c something,\u201d that is to say, a sum the amount of which the defendant reserves the right to determine himself. It cannot therefore do more than revive a nominal portion of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The \u2022 words \u201c I mean right \u201d neither amount to a sufficient promise of themselves, nor enlarge the effect of the following words, which have just been discussed. <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Cumner, ubi supra. United Society </em>v. <em>Winkley, </em>7 Gray, 460. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>18 Wall. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The second letter is not so strong as the first, and is disposed of by the same considerations and authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
