Appellant, the city of Port Clinton, is appealing the judgment entered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>favor of appellees, Kenneth J. Berger and Nancy Berger. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The facts of this case are as follows. On October 17, 1988, Kenneth Berger was taking his customary morning walk with two friends, John Crosser and Gary Rasmussen. As Berger proceeded along a public sidewalk in Port Clinton, he stepped into an uncovered manhole and was injured. After assisting Berger, Rasmussen noticed the manhold cover in the nearby grass and replaced it. Crosser later reported the incident to Max McLaury, the director of Public Safety and Service for Port Clinton. Subsequently, Berger brought this negligence action against the city of Port Clinton.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On January 8, 1992, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Bergers in the amount of $75,000. Following a subsequent hearing on a motion for the determination of collateral benefits, the trial court reduced the award by $499.83, which it determined was the amount of collateral benefits received. On June 2, 1992, final judgment in the amount of $74,500.17 was entered in favor of the Bergers.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">It is from such judgment that the city of Port Clinton raises the following four assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u201c1. The Trial Court erred in overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment^] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u201c2. The Trial Court erred in overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motion in limine[.] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u201c3. The Trial Court erred in instructing the jury on the issue of constructive notice[.] * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u201c4. The Trial Court erred in the determination of collateral benefits that were deducted from the jury verdict[.] * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">As its first assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant its motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the city argues that it did not have actual or constructive notice that the manhole cover had been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">Initially, this court notes that Civ.R. 56(C) governs the granting of a motion for summary judgment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. A summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47, the court held that summary judgment may be granted \u201cupon the tripartite demonstration: (1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We now address the more specific question as to whether summary judgment was appropriate given the Bergers\u2019 negligence claim against the city of Port Clinton. R.C. 723.01 imposes a duty upon municipal corporations to keep public roads, sidewalks, and other public places \u201copen, in repair, and free from nuisance.\u201d Further, R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) provides that a municipal corporation is \u201cliable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property caused by [the municipal corporation\u2019s] failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, or public grounds within the political subdivision open, in repair, and free from nuisance.\u201d However, a municipality can be held liable for failing to maintain public ways only upon proof that such municipality\u2019s \u201c \u2018agents or officers actually created the faulty condition from which injury resulted or that [the municipality] had notice thereof, actual or constructive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruwe v. Bd. of Springfield Twp. Trustees </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 59, 60, 29 OBR 441, 442, 505 N.E.2d 957, 958, quoting <em>Cleveland v. Amato </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 575, 9 Ohio Law Abs. 606, 176 N.E. 227, paragraph one of the syllabus. Further, constructive notice may be inferred where it is foreseeable that a hazardous condition is likely to occur. <em>Knickel v. Dept, of Transp. </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 335, 339, 3 O.O.3d 413, 415, 361 N.E.2d 486, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In the present case, the city of Port Clinton argued in support of its motion for summary judgment that it had no constructive notice that the manhole cover was missing. The trial court had the following testimony before it in deciding the motion for summary judgment. John Crosser, who had accompanied Kenneth Berger on his walk, contacted Max McLaury, the director of Public Safety and Service for Port Clinton in order to inform him of the incident. Crosser, by way of affidavit, testified as follows concerning, his conversation with McLaury:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cLater that morning, roughly 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., (10-17-88) I phoned Max McLaury, Safety Director, to notify him of the manhole incident. Max said he had not heard about Berger, falling into the manhole. I told Max we had been walking on Fulton to Perry and that we were on Perry just west of Fulton when it happened. <em>Max said </em>7 <em>know exactly where that\u2019s at. We have had problems there before with manhole covers being taken off by kids. \u2019 </em>I told Max that I wanted to make him aware of the missing cover, and he said he would send a crew over right away to replace it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In contrast, Max McLaury testified by way of deposition as follows concerning the conversation he had with John Crosser:</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u201cQ Okay. Yes. I guess what I asked you before was did you recall saying to John and I quoted, I know exactly where that\u2019s at. We\u2019ve had problems there before with manhole covers being taken off by kids. You indicated you didn\u2019t recall the substance\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u201cA I don\u2019t remember ever having that conversation with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">\u201cQ Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">\u201cA I know exactly where that particular one is because I had had a call one time previously that a lady told me that it was part way off and it looked like kids had been playing with it and I sent the police out to check and it was in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u201cQ Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u201cA You know.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">\u201cQ When was that, when do you\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">\u201cA It was years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">\u201cQ Okay. So it\u2019s your testimony then aside from that incident, years ago, you don\u2019t recall any other incidents?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">\u201cA No.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">\u201cQ Involving this manhole cover?</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">\u201cA No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-18\">Crosser\u2019s testimony, although contradicted, is evidence that McLaury knew that this particular manhole cover had been removed several times by children prior to the incident in question. It follows that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the city of Port Clinton had constructive notice that the manhole cover was missing on the date Kenneth Berger was injured. Therefore as a matter of law, the city of Port Clinton was not entitled to summary judgment as to the issue of constructive notice. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As a second assignment of error, the city of Port Clinton argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that, after Berger was injured, the city of Port Clinton tack welded the manhole cover shut, thus preventing its removal by unauthorized persons. The city argues that such testimony was inadmissible to prove negligence under Evid.R. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Evid. 407 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cWhen, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In the present case, Richard Packard, the street supervisor for the city of Port Clinton, testified that it was not practical to tack weld manhole covers shut in order to prevent their removal by unauthorized persons. The trial court, over the city\u2019s objection, then permitted the following cross-examination of Packard:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u201cQ Your response to Mr. Crosser\u2019s questions, you just previously indicated that you do not feel that it would be feasible to tack weld manhole covers to keep them off?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u201cMR. COPPELER: I am going to object, Your Honor, because it misstates my question, which was, Why not tack weld all the manhole covers in the City?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\u201cQ Okay. In response to Mr. Crosser\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\u201cMR. COPPELER: I didn\u2019t say as to a particular one. For the record, my name is Coppeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">\u201cQ Excuse me. In response to Mr. Coppeler\u2019s question, you indicated that would not be feasible, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">\u201cA That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">\u201cQ However, on the date that you were dispatched to the scene of Mr. Berger\u2019s accident, October 17th, 1988, that is precisely what you did, is it not?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">\u201cA Yes, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">\u201cQ Tack welded it?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">We find that Packard\u2019s testimony concerning the subsequent tack welding of the manhole cover went to the controverted feasibility of precautionary measures that could have been taken by the city of Port Clinton. Such testimony is specifically permitted under Evid.R. 407. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>As its third assignment of error, the city of Port Clinton argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of constructive notice.' The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u201cThe test for determining whether the City of Port Clinton had constructive notice that the manhole cover would be removed and that injury would result is whether that danger existed for a sufficient period of time reasonably to support the inference that the failure to prevent its removal was attributable to the lack of ordinary care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The city argues that such instruction improperly would create liability whenever a manhole cover was removed by unauthorized persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">We disagree. The jury was instructed to determine whether the \u201cdanger existed for a sufficient period of time\u201d in order to attribute constructive notice to the city of Port Clinton. There was evidence introduced at trial that the removal of the particular manhole cover in question was not an isolated incident. Testimony established that the city\u2019s director of public safety knew of several previous incidents where this particular manhole cover had been removed by children. Therefore, we hold that the jury instruction as given was a \u201c \u2018correct statement of the law applicable to the facts in the case and reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828, 832, quoting Markus <em>&amp; </em>Palmer, Trial Handbook for Ohio Lawyers (3 Ed.1991) 860, Section 36:2. Accordingly, the third assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">As its fourth assignment of error, the city of Port Clinton argues that the trial court erred in determining the amount of collateral benefits received by Kenneth Berger that would reduce the amount awarded by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">R.C. 2744.05 codifies the collateral source rule with respect to awards against political subdivisions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u201cIf a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for injuries or loss allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or any other source, the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political subdivision recovered by that claimant. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">In the present case, Kenneth Berger received $9,368.17 in medical benefits from his insurance company. However, the trial court did not reduce the jury award by this amount of benefits. Instead, the trial court determined that the amount of $9,368.17 was to be offset by $8,868.34 representing the amount that Kenneth Berger and his employer had paid in premiums for the medical insurance coverage. Thus, the trial court reduced the jury award by only $499.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>We find no authority in R.C. 2744.05 that would permit the amount of collateral benefits received from insurance claims to be reduced by any premiums paid by the claimant in obtaining such insurance. Thus, the trial court should have reduced the jury award by the total amount of medical benefits received, <em>ie., </em>$9,368.17. Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is found well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, in accordance with the above decision. It is ordered that the parties equally share in the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-7\">Glasser, P.J., Abood and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
