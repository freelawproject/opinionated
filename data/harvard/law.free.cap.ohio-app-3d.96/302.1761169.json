Mahoney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Appellant, Ohio State Racing Commission, appeals the determination of the court of common pleas that the terms \u201cbreeding season\u201d and \u201cstud season\u201d in R.C. 3769.082(D), R.C. 3769.085, and Ohio Adm.Code 3769-15-34 mean the period from February 1 through July 31 of a given year. Finding no error in the definition of those terms as found by the trial court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Appellee, Pickwick Farms, Inc., breeds, raises, and races standardbred horses in Ohio and elsewhere. Ohio conducts stakes races for colts and fillies sired by standardbred stallions but limits eligibility for the races to offspring of stallions registered with the racing commission. To be registered, the stallions must, under R.C. 3769.082(D), regularly stand \u201cthe entire stud season in Ohio\u201d; and under R.C. 3769.085(B), the stallion must stand in Ohio for \u201cthe entire breeding season of the year the colt or filly was conceived.\u201d Under Ohio Adm.Code 3769-15-34, a stallion standing for the first time in Ohio \u201cmust be registered prior to the time he first services a mare that particular breeding season.\u201d Thus, these provisions require that the colts or fillies be sired in Ohio by stallions which have spent the entire stud season/breeding season in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Virtually all standardbred horses are bred in the United States between mid-February and mid-July. In the southern hemisphere, the breeding season is about November through January. Pickwick Farms, Inc. desires to ship certain stallions to Australia or New Zealand for breeding with mares during the southern hemisphere breeding season after the stallions have bred in Ohio in February through July, and to ship to Ohio from those countries stallions for the purpose of breeding in Ohio in February through July, without the Ohio offspring of such stallions losing eligibility to participate in Ohio\u2019s races. The practice of breeding stallions in two breeding seasons in the same calendar year is called \u201cdouble-breeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The Ohio State Racing Commission took the position that stallions which were double-bred could not be registered for Ohio races notwithstanding that the stallions were bred in Ohio in February through July. In short, the commission\u2019s position is, that to be registered in Ohio, the stallions must not breed outside Ohio in the same calendar year. Pickwick Farms, Inc. filed for a declaratory judgment that the terms \u201cstud season\u201d and \u201cbreeding season,\u201d as used in the statutes and code, mean mid-February through mid-July, thus allowing \u201cdouble-breeding.\u201d Trial was held and the court ruled in Pickwick Farms, Ine.\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The following assignments of error are set forth in appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u201cA. The trial court failed to ascertain the legislative intent and erred in declaring that the terms \u2018breeding season\u2019 and \u2018stud season\u2019 as used in R.C. 3769.082(D), R.C. 3769.085, and O.A.C. 3769-15-04 [sic] mean the first of February until the end of July to allow Ohio registered stallions to stand stud during breeding seasons in different countries in the same calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201cB. The trial court erred in failing to consider the Ohio State Racing Commission\u2019s consistent administration of R.C. 3769.082(D), R.C. 3769.085, and O.A.C. 3769-15-04 [sic ] for the past twenty years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The racing commission does not dispute the trial court\u2019s determination that the terms \u201cstud season\u201d and \u201cbreeding season\u201d are synonymous. The trial court properly found that the terms are ambiguous. See <em>State ex rel. Cunningham v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 73, 76, 30 OBR 176, 179, 506 N.E.2d 1179, 1181; R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The racing commission asserts that the rationale of the legislature was to \u201cenhance the standardbred industry in the state of Ohio by attracting with lucrative sire stakes race purses top quality horses * * * and to protect Ohio\u2019s horse breeding industry from loss of business to other states that have similar stakes race programs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Since well-nigh all standardbred horse breeding takes place in the United States in February through July, we cannot see how the definition of \u201cstud season/breeding season\u201d as meaning February through July will work to harm Ohio racing interests. If the breeder wishes its colts and fillies to participate in Ohio\u2019s races, then the stallions must breed only in Ohio during the breeding season. This ensures that the stallions will not breed in other states, thus keeping the offspring from other states\u2019 races.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">The trial court thoroughly considered the issues and stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">\u201cThe Court finds that no guidance can be gleaned from the legislative purpose and intent * * *. In order to be registered, the stallion must stand in Ohio the entire stud or breeding season. * * * [N]owhere in Title 37 are the terms \u2018breeding season\u2019 or \u2018stud season\u2019 expressly defined. * * * [A]n express defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tion was not written into the statute due to the fact that the definition was so widely .accepted as being the middle of February through the middle of July. Moreover, the legislature chose to use the word \u2018season\u2019, instead of the word \u2018year.\u2019 It is likely that the terms \u2018stud season\u2019 and \u2018breeding season\u2019 were written into the statutes because horses, particularly mares, are seasonal breeders. It is well-accepted within the Standardbred community that customarily the breeding season of Standardbred horses in Ohio runs from the 15th of February through the 15th of July each year, and the breeding season in southern hemisphere [countries] * * * opens in September and closes in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u201cDouble breeding was not a concept considered at the time of the drafting of the statutes. Insofar as the intent of Ohio\u2019s General. Assembly is to prevent horses breeding elsewhere, it can be presumed that they are referring to northern hemisphere breeding. * * * [I]t would not want a stallion to breed in states of Ohio and Kentucky in the same year. Since the southern hemisphere breeding season does not coincide with Ohio\u2019s breeding season, this Court cannot say that double breeding defeats the intent of R.C. \u00a7 3769.082 or R.C. \u00a7 3769.085.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u201cFurther, double breeding neither promotes nor prevents breeding in other states since the breeding in all the northern hemisphere takes place virtually at the same time, from February through July.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We adopt the reasoning of the trial court. Further, as the Standardbred Development Fund Committee voted in October 1992 to prohibit \u201cdouble-breeding,\u201d and the Ohio State Racing Commission has never formally specified that the breeding season in Ohio is the entire calendar year, we do not discern any \u201ctwenty-year\u201d long position by the racing commission that \u201cdouble-breeding\u201d is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. As Pickwick Farms, Inc. aptly notes, the General Assembly is free to adopt the position of the Ohio State Racing Commission should that be the position of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-9\">John C.
