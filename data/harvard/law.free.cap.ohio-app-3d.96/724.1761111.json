Brown, appeals a judgment of the Probate Court which granted $3500 in attorney\u2019s fees to J. Ross Haffey, appellee herein, who represented appellant\u2019s guardian, Paul Kavanaugh, Esq., during hearings held in response to appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion to terminate guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">In two assignments of error, appellant claims that the court should have denied fees because appellee failed to demonstrate that his services were of direct benefit and because appellant\u2019s guardian failed to secure prior approval to employ counsel. Upon review, we find appellant\u2019s assignments of error to be without merit. The judgment of the probate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Paul K. Kavanaugh was appointed guardian of the person and the estate of the appellant on December 5, 1979, pursuant to a court-ordered psychiatric examination indicating mental incompetency due to organic brain syndrome, a condition described as irreversible. During the twelve-year period of Kavanaugh\u2019s guardianship, appellant\u2019s estate grew from $1,876,760 to $3,878,595.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">On November 14, 1990, appellant filed a motion to terminate guardianship. On February 13, 1991, the court held a hearing wherein appellee cross-examined \u25a0witnesses called by the appellant, including the appellant herself. The transcript demonstrates that appellant was fully aware of the purpose of the hearing, that she was pleased with her guardian\u2019s management and that she wished to maintain his management with respect to her real estate holdings. Appellant stated however, that she desired (1) to terminate the guardianship to increase her decisionmaking power and (2) to regain the ability to manage her stock portfolio herself. Appellant\u2019s response to questioning was rational and coherent. On occasion, however, her testimony became unresponsive and slightly rambling. At the close of the hearing, the court ordered a psychiatric examination. The examination indicated \u201cinsufficient evidence to support the need for a guardianship based upon mental disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>On July 16, 1991, the court terminated appellant\u2019s guardianship and appointed a conservator. Appellee filed an application for fees which the referee denied, finding appellee\u2019s services to be of only incidental benefit. Appellee objected, arguing that the referee\u2019s report effectively denied a licensed attorney the right to obtain counsel to protect his appointment and the assets of the estate and that his retention was necessary as the Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 5-102(A), prohibited appellant\u2019s guardian from serving as both counsel and potential witness in this matter. The court sustained appellee\u2019s objections and granted fees. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\u201cWhether the trial court erred in granting the movant\u2019s request for the payments of fees for the legal expenses incurred by Paul K. Kavanaugh where the services were incurred solely to determine whether or not Paul K. Kavanaugh would continue to serve as guardian and where the movant failed to demonstrate that the services rendered were beneficial to the estate or to the ward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In her first assignment of error, appellant, relying on <em>In re Guardianship of Wonderly </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 40, 10 OBR 304, 461 N.E.2d 879, argues that fees should have been denied because they were incurred solely to continue the guardianship and because appellee\u2019s services were of no benefit. Appellant\u2019s argument fails for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">First, appellant\u2019s counsel presented no evidence below to suggest that Kavanaugh incurred expenses solely to continue his guardianship. Appellant\u2019s counsel, who also represents her on appeal, had two opportunities to raise the issue of Kavanaugh\u2019s motives. Counsel could have filed an objection to appellee\u2019s representation immediately upon notice of same pursuant to R.C. 2111.13(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Counsel could also have called Kavanaugh to the stand to examine him with respect to this allegation. Since counsel failed to object to appellee\u2019s representation and also failed to raise the issue of Kavanaugh\u2019s motivation below, she is precluded from doing so on appeal. <em>Hungler v. Cincinnati </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 338, 25 OBR 392, 496 N.E.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Second, appellant\u2019s counsel relies upon authority which is off point. In <em>Wonderly, </em>legal fees were incurred when grandparents, prohibited from custody by the explicit terms of their son\u2019s will, employed counsel to challenge a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>guardianship which remained lawfully in force in Indiana for over nine years. The Supreme Court of Ohio denied fees, holding that:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\u201cAbsent a specific demonstration that the actions are beneficial to the estate or ward, a guardian may not be reimbursed from the estate for legal expenses incurred <em>in proceedings relating solely to the determination of whether the guardian may serve in that capacity. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Wonderly, </em>the primary purpose of the grandparent\u2019s action was to establish a prohibited guardianship. The facts and circumstances of <em>Wonderly </em>are too extreme to be applicable to the instant case. Particularly in light of the fact that appellant made no attempt to allege or prove improper motive below. Without such affirmative evidence, this court must assume that appellant\u2019s guardian acted in good faith and employed counsel to make himself available to testify and to better determine the issue of appellant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Third, appellant\u2019s argument disregards the fact under DR 5-102(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an attorney/guardian seeking to contest a motion to terminate has no choice but to retain counsel to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">In the instant case, the probate court granted fees based upon appellee\u2019s argument that his services were necessary, proper and performed for the benefit of the guardianship. We find evidence in the record to support appellee\u2019s assertion of direct benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">First, appellant\u2019s guardian, pursuant to R.C. 2111.14, was obligated to protect the appellant and her estate until the court declared her competent. By retaining counsel, appellant\u2019s guardian enabled the appellant and the court to call him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Second, R.C. 2111.49(C) (effective Jan. 1, 1990) shifts the burden of proving competency from the ward to the guardian. Hence, guardians who possess a good faith belief that termination is not in the best interest of the ward or the estate now have to testify should they wish to prove continuing incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. The record demonstrates that the appellee and appellant\u2019s guardian had reservations regarding appellant\u2019s competency. These reservations were not entirely unfounded. The appellant was ninety-one years old when she moved for termination and had suffered several strokes. While advanced age has been removed from the statutory definition of incompetency, it can remain a consideration. Also, the court ordered a psychiatric examination even after hearing the appellant, her physician and her daily companion testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Third, appellee\u2019s cross-examination of witnesses provided the court with information from an alternative perspective. Appellee\u2019s cross-examination tested the observations of appellant\u2019s physician and her companion, thereby providing the court with a more complete picture of appellant\u2019s daily activities, the influences in her life and her interactions. It is understandable that the appellant may view appellee\u2019s services as a threat or an obstacle. However, we cannot say, on this record, that appellee\u2019s services were not of benefit as the court was able to make its determination based upon hearings which addressed both sides of the issue of appellant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\u201cR.C. 2111.1.4 lists a guardian\u2019s duties in the administration of a ward\u2019s estate. From those duties the Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that a guardian of the estate of a ward may employ legal counsel and reasonable attorney fees shall be allowed as part of the expenses of administration. See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 2113.36; <em>In re Wonderly </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 40, 42, 10 OBR 304, 305, 461 N.E.2d 879, 881. \u2018However, any legal expense incurred by the guardian of the person or the estate must directly benefit the estate or the ward in order to be chargeable to the estate.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 42, 10 OBR at 305, 461 N.E.2d at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">\u201cPursuant to C.P.Sup.R. 40, the probate division of the court of common pleas has discretionary power with regard to authorizing payment of attorney fees. Whether or not such expenses are necessary or beneficial to the ward\u2019s interest is squarely within the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u2019 <em>In re Guardianship of Escola </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 42, 47, 534 N.E.2d 866, 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">U * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\u201cEven though the allowance of attorney fees is discretionary with the probate court, the court\u2019s determination is still subject to review. <em>In re Jaymes </em>(App. 1935), 18 Ohio Law Abs. 613. The probate court\u2019s determination, however, will only be reversed upon a finding of abuse of discretion. \u2018Abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 <em>Worthington v. Worthington </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 73, 21 OBR 371, 488 N.E.2d 150.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Rider </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 709, 711-712, 589 N.E.2d 465, 466-467.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the court\u2019s award of fees did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">\u201cWhether the trial court erred in granting movant\u2019s request for payment of fees where the guardian failed to obtain approval of the court to employ legal counsel in order to bind the ward or her estate to pay for the legal services rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Appellant claims that the express language of R.C. 2111.13(B) mandates a guardian to seek court approval prior to employing legal counsel. We find appellant\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">R.C. 2111.13(B) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">\u201c[N]o part of the ward\u2019s estate shall be used for the support, maintenance, or education of such ward unless ordered and approved by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">A cursory reading of the above-cited statute demonstrates that it is silent with respect to <em>when </em>an order or approval for support, maintenance or education must be obtained from the court. While guardians must obtain prior approval for contingency fee contracts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant cites no case law to support her assertion that prior approval is required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">C.P.Sup.R. 40, Probate Division of the Court of Common Pleas, dealing with counsel fees, provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">\u201c(A) Attorney fees relative to all matters shall be governed by The Code of Professional Responsibility, DR-2-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\"><em>U </em>* * #</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">\u201c(G) An application shall be filed for the allowance of counsel fees for services rendered to a guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary. * * * The application shall set forth a statement of <em>the services rendered </em>and the amount claimed in conformity with Paragraph A.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">We find that the local rules envision an application for fees after they have been incurred. The ward\u2019s estate is protected by the discretionary power of the court to determine that expenses were incurred in good faith and that they were reasonable, necessary and beneficial. Absent a showing of legal error or an abuse of that discretion, we shall not disturb the probate court\u2019s judgment. See <em>Rider, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-13\">We note however, that appellant\u2019s guardian, as a fiduciary, had two procedural paths open to him upon receipt of notice of appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant\u2019s guardian could have contested the motion, as he did, or he could have ordered a psychiatric examination. We feel the latter response would have been the better choice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-14\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-17\">Matia, P.J., and Weaver, J., <em>concur.</em></judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\">.
