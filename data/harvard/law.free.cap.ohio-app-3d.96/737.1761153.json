(\u201cKessco\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">On April 23, 1991, DMFC applied for and the trial court granted a search warrant for Kessco\u2019s pharmacy, located in Columbus, Ohio. In support of its warrant application, DMFC filed with the court an affidavit of DMFC special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>agent, Beth Harding, detailing the basis for DMFC\u2019s belief that evidence of criminal activity was located on Kessco\u2019s premises. In addition, the affidavit identified the informant upon whom DMFC was relying for much of its information regarding appellee\u2019s alleged criminal activity. DMFC requested that the municipal court seal the affidavit on the grounds that \u201cdisclosure of the facts contained in the affidavit * * * would be detrimental to the criminal investigation * * By an entry dated April 23, 1991, the municipal court ordered that the affidavit \u201cbe sealed for 30 days from this date, or until an arrest is made in the investigation of Kessco, Inc./Dane Drug # 7, which occurred on April 23, 1991, whichever is sooner, or upon further order of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">On May 26, 1992, DMFC concluded its investigation of appellee and the case was resolved pursuant to a settlement agreement. Appellee\u2019s principal, Leon D. Kessel, was never arrested, and in the settlement documents he explicitly denied any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On June 8, 1993, appellee filed a motion in the Franklin County Municipal Court seeking to have the affidavit unsealed. Following a protracted hearing on the matter, the municipal court granted appellee\u2019s motion to unseal the affidavit and in addition ordered \u201cthe state of Ohio to provide petitioner with a [complete] copy of the search warrant affidavit * * The state appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\u201cI. The municipal court erred when it ignored unrebutted evidence that the sealed search warrant affidavit was a confidential law enforcement investigatory record and failed to make a determination as to whether the sealed redacted portions of the search warrant affidavit fell within the confidential law investigatory record exception to the Public Records Act (R.C. 149.43[A][2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\u201cII. The municipal court erred in its application of R.C. 149.43 by improperly weighing Kessco, Inc.\u2019s unsupported arguments of business interest with the state\u2019s, society\u2019s, and the informant\u2019s interests in maintaining the confidentiality of information falling within the confidential law enforcement investigatory record exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\u201cHI. The municipal court abused its discretion when it held that Kessco, Inc.\u2019s business interests, which were entirely unsupported by any evidence in the record, outweighed the state\u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the informant\u2019s identity because of the informant\u2019s fear of retaliation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Prior to reaching the merits of the state\u2019s assignments of errors, we must address the procedural posture of this case. Both parties discuss the state\u2019s assignments of error in the context of a public records request under R.C. 149.43, which establishes a statutory right of access to \u201cpublic records\u201d and sets forth the procedures for exercising that right. See <em>Miller v. Myers </em>(Apr. 6, 1994), Wayne App. No. 2800-W, unreported, 1994 WL 119029.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Under the provisions of R.C. 149.43, a person wishing to obtain \u201cpublic records\u201d initially is to request copies of the desired records from the \u201cperson responsible\u201d for the records. If the \u201cperson responsible\u201d fails to make the requested records available, a mandamus action may be commenced to obtain a judgment ordering disclosure of the \u201cpublic records\u201d requested. R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Here, DMFC relinquished control over the affidavit in question when it filed the document with the clerk of the Franklin County Municipal Court. Pursuant to R.C. 1901.31(E) and 1901.30(B), the clerk of a municipal court is charged with the duty to oversee and keep all documents used by the municipal court in its decisionmaking capacity. <em>State ex rel. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers v. Gosser </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 30, 33, 20 OBR 279, 281, 485 N.E.2d 706, 709. \u201cWhen statutes impose a duty on a particular official to oversee records, that official is the \u2018person responsible\u2019 under R.C. 149.43(B).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, upon the affidavit being filed with the clerk for the Franklin County Municipal Court, the clerk became the \u201cperson responsible\u201d for the record under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Accordingly, under the provisions of R.C. 149.43, Kessco could request a copy of the affidavit from the clerk of the Franklin County Municipal Court and, if the clerk refused to make the requested document available for copying, it could bring a mandamus action in the appropriate court. Instead, Kessco filed a motion in the municipal court seeking to have the affidavit in question unsealed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> apparently on the prudent assumption that the clerk would defer to the court\u2019s sealing order until that order was formally lifted. Thus, the issue raised by the state\u2019s three assignments of error, which we address jointly, is not whether the affidavit is subject to a public records disclosure under R.C. 149.43, as no request under R.C. 149.43 has yet been made. Rather, the issue is whether the municipal court erred in unsealing the search warrant affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>The municipal court\u2019s decision to unseal the affidavit sealed by its previous order is a matter of judicial discretion. See <em>Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc. </em>(1978), 435 U.S. 589, 598, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 1312, 55 L.Ed.2d 570, 579. Accordingly, the court\u2019s decision may be reversed only upon a finding that the court abused its discretion. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error in judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s decision is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142; <em>Angelkovski v. Buckeye Potato Chips Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 159, 11 OBR 242, 463 N.E.2d 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In granting Kessco\u2019s motion to unseal the affidavit, the trial court balanced the state\u2019s interest in keeping the affidavit sealed against Kessco\u2019s interest in obtaining the information contained therein. It concluded that \u201cany interest the state would have in this matter has ended,\u201d since the sole reason DMFC advanced in its request to seal the affidavit was that disclosure would be detrimental to the ongoing criminal investigation of Kessco. The trial court\u2019s conclusion being reasonable, we are unable to say that the trial court abused its discretion in so determining. Indeed, although the practical effect of the court\u2019s order may be to give Kessco access to the affidavit in the office of the municipal court clerk, the affidavit was in fact legally unsealed thirty days after the date of the order sealing it, given the express terms of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">DMFC, however, asserts that even if the trial court\u2019s determination does not run afoul of R.C. 149.43, the informant\u2019s identity, revealed in the affidavit, must be held confidential under the rationale of <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 74, 4 OBR 196, 446 N.E.2d 779. <em>Williams </em>recognized the need to protect the identity of a confidential informant at trial if the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and cross-examination could also be protected through examination of others present at the incident in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The rationale of <em>Williams </em>rarely, if ever, arises in the context of a search warrant affidavit, as affidavits filed by law enforcement personnel generally do not disclose the identity of confidential informants; other indicia of reliability usually eliminate the need to disclose the informant\u2019s identity. Moreover, unlike <em>Williams, </em>the state\u2019s contentions relate to documents in the possession of a clerk, not testimonial evidence to be presented at trial by an informant known only to law enforcement. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the present case involves the state\u2019s own disclosure of the identity of the informant, since the order preserving his or her confidentiality under seal was effective for only thirty days. Given the factual dissimilarity between <em>Williams </em>and the present case, the rationale of <em>Williams </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Whether the state, having relinquished control of the document containing the informant\u2019s identity, can use R.C. 149.43 to prevent a \u201cperson responsible\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>releasing a document it otherwise is willing to produce, even if the document is not a \u201cpublic record\u201d due to an exception contained in R.C. 149.48, is an issue we need not reach; nor do we need to address the alternate issue of whether the affidavit must be produced pursuant to R.C. 149.43 if the \u201cperson responsible\u201d is unwilling to do so, as no such request has been made. Instead, we find only that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in unsealing the affidavit, especially in light of the specific language of the sealing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">However, we are compelled to note that while the municipal court had the authority to order the affidavit filed with the municipal court clerk unsealed, the court was without any authority to order the state to take any action with respect to the affidavit. A municipal court is without subject-matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the disclosure of \u201cpublic records\u201d pursuant to R.C. 149.43. R.C. 149.43(C). Therefore, that portion of the trial court\u2019s entry ordering the state \u201cto provide petitioner with a copy of the search warrant affidavit which discloses the previously redacted sections\u201d is vacated. Should the clerk, upon Kessco\u2019s request, refuse to grant Kessco\u2019s access to the affidavit despite its unsealing, appellee may bring a mandamus action in the appropriate court to compel disclosure of that portion of the affidavit constituting a \u201cpublic record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Given the foregoing, the state\u2019s three assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed, as modified, to the extent indicated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed as modified.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b774-8\">John C. Young and Mahoney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b774-9\">Edward J. Mahoney, J., retired, of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\">. On April 24, 1991, DMFC applied for and was granted a' second search warrant for appellee\u2019s premises by the Franklin County Municipal Court. In support of this warrant application, DMFC filed an affidavit identical to that filed in support of the first warrant. DMFC also requested that the warrant be sealed, and the court apparently granted the request. However, that affidavit is not at issue in the current action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. Even if we were to assume that appellee did make a request of the clerk of the Franklin County Municipal Court to copy the affidavit, which the clerk denied, appellee\u2019s motion to unseal the affidavit cannot be treated as an action for mandamus, as the municipal court is without jurisdiction to hear such an action. See R.C. 149.43(C); compare <em>Miller v. Myers, supra </em>(wherein a motion filed in the common pleas court was treated as a mandamus action).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
