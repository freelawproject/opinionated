Dinkel. Appellee requested a permanent injunction to prevent Dinkel from parking his 1989 GMC pickup truck in the common areas of The Bluffs of Wildwood in violation of Section 7.1(C) of the Bluffs of Wildwood Declaration and Bylaws of Condominium Ownership (\u201cDeclaration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Under the trial court\u2019s January 27, 1993 pretrial order, the deadline for filing motions for summary judgment was February 15, 1993. On February 16, 1993, Dinkel filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellee failed to respond to the motion and no hearing was held. The trial court filed a decision granting Dinkel\u2019s motion on March 16, 1993. The following day, on March 17, 1993, appellee filed a \u201cMotion to Allow Answer to Summary Judgment Out of Time.\u201d In addition, appellee filed a \u201cMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Countermotion for Summary Judgment.\u201d On March 18,1993, appellee filed a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Summary Judgment.\u201d Dinkel filed a motion in response to appellee\u2019s motion to set aside summary judgment and to allow summary judgment out of time on April 16, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On May 11, 1993, the trial court filed an \u201corder granting appellee\u2019s motion to set aside summary judgment and for leave to respond out of time to * * * [Dinkel\u2019s] motion for summary judgment.\u201d In its order, the trial court stated that it had considered appellee\u2019s motion to set aside summary judgment to be a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). The trial court found that appellee\u2019s failure to respond to the motion for summary judgment occurred because of excusable neglect. The court denied both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment on July 12, 1993. The matter proceeded to trial on October 15, 1993. Finally, on January 28, 1994, the trial court entered judgment permanently enjoining Dinkel from parking his pickup truck on the common areas of the condominium property.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On appeal, Dinkel raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cThe trial court denied the defendant due process when it improperly reconsidered and reversed summary judgment granted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it held the condominium restriction at issue enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In his first assignment of error, Dinkel argues the trial court abused its discretion and denied him due process when it <em>sua sponte </em>construed appellee\u2019s motion to set aside summary judgment as a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment and reversed the grant of summary judgment. Dinkel, relying on <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Forest Cartage Co. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 333, 588 N.E.2d 263, essentially argues appellee\u2019s motion was an invalid motion to reconsider and that all judgments or final orders by the trial court that flow from the motion are void. Dinkel also argues the trial court erred in not holding a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Forest </em>is factually distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Forest, </em>the trial court was presented with a motion captioned \u201cMotion for Reconsideration and Motion for Extension of Time in Which to File a Reply Brief.\u201d The motion did not request \u201crelief pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B) or request the trial court \u2018vacate\u2019 \u201d its prior orders. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 588 N.E.2d at 267. Thus, the motion was not considered a Civ.R. 60(B) motion. The court found the motion to be a nullity and found all orders flowing from the trial court\u2019s decision granting the motion void.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In the present case, although the motion to set aside summary judgment is inartfully drafted, we find that it constituted a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment. Appellee\u2019s March 18,1993 motion was captioned as a \u201cMotion to Set Aside Summary Judgment.\u201d In the motion, appellee requested that the trial court set aside its previous order granting summary judgment. The motion also incorporated by reference an affidavit of appellee\u2019s counsel and appellee\u2019s motions and memoranda filed on March 17, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The affidavit of appellee\u2019s counsel sets forth particular facts tending to show excusable neglect due to personal and family illness. The motion was timely made. In addition, the supporting memoranda incorporated by reference into appellee\u2019s motion tended to demonstrate that appellee had a meritorious claim to present if relief was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">As a result of determining that appellee\u2019s motion was a valid Civ.R. 60(B) motion, we are unable to reach the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision granting the motion. An order vacating a judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B) is a final order. <em>GTE Automatic Elec. v. ARC Industries </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 O.O.3d 86, 351 N.E.2d 113, paragraph one of the syllabus. Dinkel forfeited his right to assign as error the trial court\u2019s order vacating its prior judgment because he did not timely appeal. See <em>Bates &amp; Springer, Inc. v. Stallworth </em>(1978), 56 Ohio App.2d 223, 230, 10 O.O.3d 227, 231, 382 N.E.2d 1179, 1185. Accordingly, Dinkel\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">In his second assignment of error, Dinkel argues that appellee failed to set forth competent, credible evidence to carry its burden of establishing reasonable grounds for enforcing the condominium restriction contained in Section 7.1(C) of the Declaration. Dinkel argues that the condominium restriction is <em>per se </em>unreasonable because it does not promote any common scheme or plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Section 7.1(C) of the Declaration provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u201cNo part of the common areas or limited common areas and facilities shall be used for parking of any trailer, truck, boat, motorcycle, scooter or anything other than operative automobiles. * * * The word \u2018truck\u2019 shall include and mean every type of motor vehicle other than passenger cars and other than any pickup truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>which is used as the sole automobile vehicle by a family occupying one of said units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Compliance with condominium declarations and bylaws is required under R.C. 5311.19 where the restrictions are reasonable. See <em>Monday Villas Property Owners Assn. v. Barbe </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 167, 171, 598 N.E.2d 1291, 1294; <em>Worthinglen Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. Brown </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 73, 75-76, 566 N.E.2d 1275, 1277-1278; <em>River Terrace Condominium Assn. v. Lewis </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 52, 57, 514 N.E.2d 732, 737. Ohio courts have applied a three-part test to determine if a condominium restriction is reasonable. Under the reasonableness test, a reviewing court must determine (1) whether the decision or rule is arbitrary, (2) whether the decision or rule is applied in an evenhanded or discriminatory manner, and (3) whether the decision or rule was made in good faith for the common welfare of the owners and occupants of the condominium. <em>Brown, supra, </em>57 Ohio App.3d at 76, 566 N.E.2d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The reasonableness test offers some guidelines for courts to use when reviewing condominium restrictions. However, where the restriction is contained in a condominium declaration and is in existence prior to the purchase of a condominium unit, the reasonableness test has less relevance. In such a case, it must be remembered that:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cIt has long been recognized that persons have a fundamental right to contract freely with the expectation that the terms of the contract will be enforced. This freedom \u2018is as fundamental to our society as the right to write and to speak without restraint.\u2019 <em>Blount v. Smith </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St.2d 41, 47, 41 O.O.2d 250, 253, 231 N.E.2d 301, 305. Government interference with this right must therefore be restricted to those exceptional cases where intrusion is absolutely necessary, such as contracts promoting illegal acts. * * *\u201d <em>Nottingdale Homeowners\u2019 Assn., Inc. v. Darby </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 32, 36, 514 N.E.2d 702, 705-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Dinkel stipulated at trial that he is the fee simple owner of a condominium at The Bluffs of Wildwood and that he is bound by all legal restrictions imposed by appellee. Dinkel also stipulated that his family owns a passenger car and a pickup truck. Dinkel concedes that by parking his pickup truck in the common areas he is in violation of the plain language of Section 7.1(C) of the Declaration. Dinkel, however, argues that Section 7.1(C) is unenforceable because it discriminates against his family status and his right to own a pickup truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that prior to closing on his condominium unit Dinkel received and read a copy of the Declaration containing the restriction and that he was advised by appellee\u2019s president that he could not park his pickup truck on the common areas. Further, the trial court found that Dinkel was aware of the restriction before entering into a contract to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the condominium unit. Finally, the trial court found that the restriction has been applied consistently and uniformly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We find that the restriction contained in the Declaration is reasonable. See <em>Brown, supra. </em>In addition, there is competent, credible evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding that Dinkel freely and knowingly entered into the contract with appellee. See <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 411, 461 N.E.2d 1273,1276; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. Dinkel has failed to demonstrate that the contract is unenforceable as against public policy. Thus, Section 7.1(C) of the Declaration is enforceable. <em>Darby, supra; </em>R.C. 5311.19. Accordingly, Dinkel\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-8\">Koehler and Walsh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
