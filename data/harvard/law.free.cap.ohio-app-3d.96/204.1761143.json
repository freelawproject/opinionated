Because we find that appellant, who was the plaintiff in the trial court, failed to present facts which would establish an intent on the part of the appellee to deceive the public or unfairly compete pursuant to the requirements of R.C. 4165.02, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">Appellant, Olde Towne Windows, and appellee, Michael Baker, d.b.a. Custom Window Company, both sell custom-measured, vinyl replacement windows. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>pellee buys his windows essentially pre-made from Vynex, a Pennsylvania company. Appellee\u2019s facilities consist of a storefront, basement, and rented garage. Appellee also maintains adjacent workshops, where some adjustments and assembly can be made on the windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Appellee advertised its products in a written ad that included the words, \u201cbuy factory direct.\u201d Appellant, in its complaint for injunctive relief, claims that, because \u201cfactory direct\u201d means the seller must also be the \u201cmanufacturer,\u201d appellee misled the public, in violation of R.C. Chapter 4165, Ohio\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We disagree. R.C. 4165.02 is generally applied, in the advertising context, where a defendant tries to \u201cpass off\u2019 his product as another\u2019s. See <em>Lozier v. Kline </em>(1973), 40 Ohio App.2d 277, 282-283, 69 O.O.2d 261, 264-265, 319 N.E.2d 204, 208-209 Consumer confusion may result when a defendant uses a trade name or phrase which has developed a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d associated specifically with a certain brand or business. <em>Visiting Nurse Soc. v. All-Ohio Home Health Care </em>(Dec. 12, 1983), Stark App. No. CA 6157, unreported, 1983 WL 5653. However, generic words commonly used to describe business activities are regarded as common property, as long as the usage does not mislead persons possessing ordinary powers of perception. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In this case, nothing in the record indicates that appellee\u2019s use of \u201cfactory direct\u201d in his advertisement is likely to mislead consumers into buying inferior products at false savings. R.C. 4165.02 provides no protection for a consumer who merely fails to comparison shop the price and quality of products purchased. Appellant\u2019s arguments regarding warranties and overhead costs do not establish any intent by appellee to deceive the public or unfairly compete and are simply not relevant to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Last, after thoroughly reviewing the record, we agree with the trial court that the commonly used phrase \u201cbuy factory direct\u201d could include appellee\u2019s business activities as a \u201cmanufacturer.\u201d Although appellee\u2019s windows are ordered from an out-of-state factory, the manufacturing process utilizes machinery owned by appellee or appellee\u2019s company and installation requires some .aspects of assembly. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The judgment of the Huron County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Court costs are assessed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-11\">Handwork, Melvin L.
