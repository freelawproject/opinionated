The land is in Montgomery County; the case was filed in Frederick County; the trial took place in Calvert County before Bowen, J., without a jury. \u201cJudgment Nisi\u201d in favor of the appellees (defendants below) was entered on 25 February 1970. On 26 March 1970 the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Calvert County was directed to \u201center an appeal to the Court of Appeals from the judgment for the defendants.\u201d The judgment nisi is the only judgment ever en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tered in the case. To repeat what we said in <em>Merlands Club, Inc. v. Messall, </em>238 Md. 359 (1965), and confirmed in <em>A. &amp; A. Masonry Contractor's, </em>Inc. <em>v. Polinger, </em>259 Md. 199 (1970), \u201cany order for appeal filed prior to the entry of * * * [a] judgment absolute is premature and without effect.\u201d While we shall dismiss the appeal, the appellant may find consolation in learning that even had we entertained it we would have affirmed Judge Bowen\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">The trial generated about 100 pages of testimony. Judge Bowen confessed that it was a \u201cclose case\u201d and, indeed, that it gave him a headache. However, he faced up to the necessity of having \u201cto decide it one way or another.\u201d We have examined with care the testimony, noting the conflicts therein, the exhibits, and Judge Bowen\u2019s careful and comprehensive opinion. He was there; he saw the witnesses; he heard them testify. Maryland Rule 886 would require us to give \u201cdue regard\u201d to his \u201copportunity * * * to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d We are satisfied that we would be unable to say his judgment on the evidence was clearly erroneous. Nor is there any indication that he misapplied the controlling principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
