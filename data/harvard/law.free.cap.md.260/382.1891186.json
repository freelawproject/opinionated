Vol.) Art. 75, \u00a7 96. See <em>Vitro Elec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>tronics v. Milgray, </em>255 Md. 498, 258 A. 2d 749 (1969). This appeal is from an order denying Milgray\u2019s motion under Maryland Rule 323 to quash service of process and dismiss the action against it. On our own motion and in accordance with Rule 835 a 2 we have determined that its appeal must be dismissed. \u201cIt has long been established that no appeal will lie from an order overruling a motion to quash a writ of summons, [citations omitted] because it is interlocutory only, and not a final judgment.\u201d <em>Hillyard Constr.
