Yankey filed suit forthwith. The Jordans tell us that Yankey\u2019s judgment against them ($6,000) should be set at naught. Although the juicier details of the affair have been omitted from the record, the facts, as we now relate them, are virtually undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Precisely when Yankey became enamored of Rosemary Jordan is uncertain, but that it was prior to 26 July 1969 is clear. It seems that in the evening of that day they met at the home of Floyd Ratliff in Damascus, which is about ten miles north of their Gaithersburg residences. \u201cIn the small hours of the morning of Sunday 27 July\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Ivan and Wayne broke into Ratliff\u2019s house. They found Rosemary in the bedroom. Yankey was not in sight but shortly thereafter Wayne found him in the bedroom closet. He dragged him out and called his father. Ivan came into the bedroom and together they set upon Yankey. They kicked him in the right eye, they broke his nose, they fractured his cheek bone and they knocked out one of his teeth. What happened to Rosemary was not revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The case came on for trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County before Moore, J., and a jury, on 7 January 1970. The evidence established, among other things, that Yankey suffered about a 30 per cent impairment of his right eye, that he lost time from his job, and that he incurred substantial medical expense. Judge Moore refused to direct a verdict for the Jordans both at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case and again at the close of the whole case. Instead he directed a verdict for Yankey against Ivan on the issue of liability. He then submitted the case to the jury with what we shall assume were adequate and appropriate instructions, since no exceptions were noted by either party. Late in the afternoon the jury returned to the courtroom and announced that they had \u201cagreed upon a verdict.\u201d What follows is an excerpt from the partial transcript of the proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cTHE CLERK: Whom do you find for, the plaintiff Floyd Yankey or defendant Wayne Jordan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cTHE FOREMAN: For the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cTHE CLERK: For what amount do you find in compensatory damages ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">\u201cTHE FOREMAN: <em>Whatever the fixed amount; </em>five thousand was the amount we arrived at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-11\">\u201cTHE CLERK: Five thousand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">\u201cTHE FOREMAN: Yes; for punitive <em>cmd I presume compensatory.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: You did not make a separate award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cTHE FOREMAN: No, we did not. <em>We were under the impression that the compensatory were fixed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c (A bench conference was had, as follows:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: There should technically be a separate amount for damages as to each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cMR.

On 18 May he signed an order denying the motion, which order was filed on 20 May along with an opinion setting forth his reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>so doing. Judgments were entered on the same day, one for $1,000, the other for $5,000. On 8 June the Jordans appealed \u201cfrom the Opinion and Order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County dated May 18, 1970 and the <em>jury verdict entered thereon.\u201d </em>In the absence of comment or objection by Yankey we shall assume the Jordans intended their appeal to be from \u201c[the judgment] entered thereon\u201d rather than the <em>\u201cjury verdict </em>entered thereon.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The first of the Jordans\u2019 two contentions is that Judge Moore erred when he failed, in his supplemental instruction, to limit the jury\u2019s award of compensatory and punitive damages to a total of $5,000. They argue that \u201cit was implicit in the foreman\u2019s statement that the total dollar value of the plaintiff\u2019s award was not to exceed $5,000.\u201d They overlook the clear meaning of the foreman\u2019s answer that the amount of the compensatory damages was \u201cthe fixed amount.\u201d He added that they (the jury) \u201cwere under the impression that the compensatory [damages] were fixed.\u201d While the record is of no help to us in this regard we think it fair to assume that the evidence in respect of compensatory damages fully supports a figure of $1,000. Obviously the jury did not <em>increase </em>the verdict from $5,000 to $6,000. They simply restated it in terms of total dollars rather than $5,000 plus \u201cthe fixed amount.\u201d In any event, the argument must be rejected because there can be no doubt that it was within the power of Judge Moore to re-instruct the jury. <em>Leupen v. Lackey, </em>248 Md. 19 (1967). No exception was noted and the suggestion that it (the supplemental instruction) \u201cwas highly prejudicial to the\u201d Jordans is groundless. Nor is there any doubt that, in these circumstances, a jury may vary its verdict at any time before the verdict is recorded. <em>Ager v. Baltimore Transit Company, </em>213 Md. 414, 419 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Disposition of the Jordans\u2019 second contention, like the \u201cshort horse [that] is soone currid,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires little time and less effort. They assign error because Judge Moore did not instruct the jury to apportion the damages be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tween Ivan and Wayne. It does not appear that an instruction to that effect was sought by either of them nor is there anything to show that they excepted to the instructions that were given. They were sued as joint tortfeasors; the plea filed on their behalf states that <em>\u201cthey </em>did not commit the wrongs alleged,\u201d that <em>they </em>\u201cwere not guilty,\u201d that <em>\u201cthey </em>acted with justification and with self defense,\u201d and that Yankey first assaulted them. (Emphases added.) And, we might add, the drubbing they gave Yankey is surely a textbook example of a joint tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-15\">.
