Justice Chattin</author>\n<p id=\"AW9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Appellee, complainant in the trial court, Gulf Oil Corporation, filed this action under the Declaratory Judgments Act against the defendants, appellants here, Clarence E. Phifer, Administrator of the Estate of Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Phifer, Deceased; and the City Bank &amp; Trnst Company of McMinnville.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The facts leading to this action are ably and succinctly stated by the able Chancellor in his memorandum opinion, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201cComplainant is a corporation engaged in the production and sale of petroleum products, tires, batteries and accessories. In the course of its business, one Paul Phifer, now deceased, was appointed distributor and salesman for complainant's products. This business, which operated for a number of years, was located in McMinnville, Warren County, Tennessee. Mr. Paul Phifer died July 1, 1964. Thereafter his son, Clarence E. Phifer, one of the defendants, was appointed Administrator of Paul Phifer\u2019s estate and is now engaged in the administration of said estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201cOn February 26, 1963, Paul Phifer executed and delivered to defendant Bank a chattel mortgage to secure an indebtedness in the principal amount of $20,000.00. This instrument purported to convey title to a Trustee, to tires, batteries, accessories and \u2018all additions to stock of merchandise of said Paul Phifer, as a merchant. \u2019 This chattel mortgage was recorded in the Register\u2019s Office of Warren County May 11, 1963, in Trust Book 44. In addition to same, the Bank held other mortgages on real estate, motor vehicles, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cPursuant to Section 64-1802 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, complainant obtained from Paul Phifer a lien agreement, executed July 1, 1963. Notice of this lien was filed in the Register\u2019s Office of Warren County on the same date, July 1, 1963, and the same was later recorded August 8, 1963, in Deed Book 136. Lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Agreement was for the purpose of securing an indebtedness owing to complainant of approximately $7,100.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cAt the time of Mr. Paul Phifer\u2019s death, he was indebted both to defendant Bank which had loaned him considerable money and to the complainant for goods sold and delivered to him and for monies advanced. The Lien Agreement held by complainant covered goods and merchandise, or stock in trade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cAt the time of Mr. Paul Phifer\u2019s death, he had or held a considerable amount of merchandise consisting of tires, batteries and accessories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cBy agreement of parties, the Administrator has sold this stock in trade for which he received the sum of $6,000.00, and which is being held subject to a determination of the question of validity and priority of claims or liens asserted by complainant and defendant Bank, respectively. Each of the creditors involved here have perfected claims against the Phifer estate being administered in the County Court of Warren County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The original bill, after reciting the foregoing facts, alleges that: \u201cComplainant, G-ulf Oil Corporation, avers that it is lawfully entitled to the fund derived from the security held by it by virtue of its lien and recording thereof under the provisions of Section 64-1801, et seq., Tennessee Code Annotated. It avers that the chattel mortgage held by defendant, City Bank <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company, upon the same property is void and invalid as a violation of the Bulk Sales Act of Tennessee, Sections 47-1401, et seq., Tennessee Code Annotated. To resolve the conflicting claims between the parties, complainant, Gulf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Oil Corporation, filed this bill under the provisions of the Declaratory Judgments Act of Tennessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">To the original bill, the Bank interposed a demurrer upon the ground that its chattel mortgage is prior in time to the merchandise lien of Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A pro confesso was entered against the defendant, Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Chancellor overruled the demurrer of the Bank and ruled that the instrument as evidenced by the Bank\u2019s chattel mortgage is void and of no effect while Gulf\u2019s lien is a valid and prior lien on the \u2018 \u2018 stock in trade, \u2019 \u2019 which Paul Phifer owned at the time of his death. A discretionary appeal has been granted to this Court in order that the efficacy of the demurrer may be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The demurrer raises the sole question of whether the chattel mortgage is a legal and proper instrument as the result of the passage of Chapter 83, Public Acts of 1953, codified as T.C.A. Section 64-1801 et seq., which permits liens on merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">If the chattel mortgage is permitted by the above cited Section, the Bank will prevail under the doctrine of \u201cfirst in time, first in right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The general rule in Tennessee has been that a chattel mortgage on merchandise for sale is void per se as to creditors of the mortgagor, but remains valid as between the mortgagor and the mortgagee. <em>Morgan Bros. v. Dayton Coal Company, </em>134 Tenn. 228, 183 S.W. 1019 (1915); <em>Bank of Cookville v. Bier, </em>95 Tenn. 331, 32 S.W. 205 (1895); <em>Bank of Rome v. Haselton, </em>83 Tenn. 216 (1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Prior to the passage of the Uniform Commercial Code, which went into effect July 1,1964, and subsequent to the transactions in question, a chattel mortgage upon a stock of merchandise held for resale with possession and control in the mortgagor was fraudulent in law and absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The Uniform Commercial Code as embodied in T.C.A. Section 47-1-102 (Chapter 81, Public Acts of 1963), under compiler\u2019s notes of Section 47-1-101, expressly repeals Section 64-1801 et seq., as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201cSpecific repealer: Provision for transition. \u2014 (1) The following chapters and sections of Tennessee Code Annotated and all other laws or parts of laws inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed: * * * Chapter 18 of Title 64, being Sections 64-1801 through 64-1807, dealing with liens on merchandise. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">However*, Section 64-1801 et seq., applies to the case at bar in that the Uniform Commercial Code in T.C.A. Section 47-1-110 goes on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201cTransactions validly entered into before midnight on June 30, 1964, and the rights, duties and interests flowing from them remain valid thereafter and may be terminated, completed, consummated or enforced as required or permitted by any statute or other law amended or repealed by chapter 81 of the Public Acts of 1963 as though such repeal or amendment had not occurred. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">A diligent search has produced no case or any authority which construes T.C.A. Sections 64-1801 et seq., the law which must be applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">T.C.A. Section 64-1802 provides for a \u201ccontinuing general lien upon such merchandise of the borrower as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>from, time to time after the execution,\u201d of tire written agreement. It further provides: \u201c * * * with or without such merchandise being taken into the constructive or actual possession or custody of the lender or of a third person for the account of the lender, and such liens shall secure the lender for all his loans * *</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">While it fixes a lien upon the property, the merchandise lien does not disturb the title. T.C.A. Section 64-1804 provides that the lien is a floating lien: \u201cWhen merchandise subject to the lien provided for by this chapter is sold in the ordinary course of the business of the borrower, such lien, whether or not the purchaser has knowledge of the existence thereof, shall terminate as to the merchandise so sold and shall attach to any proceeds of such sale at any time in the hands of the borrower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On the other hand, a chattel mortgage is a conveyance from the mortgagor to the mortgagee of the title to the property mortgaged, subject to defeasance on payment by the mortgagor of the mortgage debt. <em>Blackwood Tire &amp; Vulcanizing Company v. Auto Storage </em>Company, 133 Tenn. 515, 182 S.W. 576, L.R.A.1916E, 254 (1915); 14 C.J.S. Chattel Mortgages sec. 1, page 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Under the Merchandise Lien Act, title, possession and power of sale remain in the borrower. The lien created attaches to the goods but title is not affected. Upon a sale, title passes to the purchaser but the lien is transferred by operation of the statute to the proceeds of the sale. A chattel mortgage, on the other hand, conveys title to the merchandise and the borrower has no title to pass to an ordinary purchaser in the course of trade. It is because of passage of title under the chattel mortgage which mal\u00edes the law frown on a mortgage on merchandise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>which, is held for sale. The buyer does not usually inquire into the location of title of goods held for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The Bank invoked the equitable maxim, \u2018 \u2018 equity looks to the intent rather than to form.\u201d The Bank had its election to use the merchandise lien; instead, it sought to use a different instrument and labeled it \u201cchattel mortgage\u201d which expressly conveyed title to a Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">A lien created by statute is limited in operation and extent by the terms of the statute, and can arise and be enforced only in the event and under the facts provided for in the statute; it cannot be extended by the courts to cases not provided for by the statute. 33 Am.Jur., Liens. Section 26; <em>Parker-Harris Company v. Tate, </em>135 Tenn. 509, 188 S.W. 54, L.R.A.1916F, 935 (1916); <em>Rent-A-Car Company v. Belford, </em>163 Tenn. 590, 45 S.W.2d 49 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Since the merchandise lien has only such force as the statute gives it, and a chattel mortgage was not expressly included in T.C.A. Section 64-1801, then this Court cannot mold a chattel mortgage into a merchandise lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The Uniform Commercial Code in T.C.A. Section 47-9-101 et seq., has as its purpose to provide a simple and unified structure within which the immense variety of present-day secured financing transactions can go forward with less cost and with greatest certainty. See comments to official text, T.C.A. Section 47-9-101. In addition, the traditional distinction among security devices, based largely on form, are not retained. The single term \u201csecurity interest,\u201d applies to all transactions intended to create security interests in personal property and fixtures, even though the old descriptive terms such as chattel mortgages, conditional sales, trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>receipts, factors liens, etc., may still be used. See T.C.A. Section 47-9-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Furthermore, under the Uniform Commercial Code there is no distinction in determining whether \u201ctitle\u201d to collateral is in the secured party or in the debtor and adopts neither a \u201ctitle theory\u201d' nor a \u201clien theory\u201d of security interest. See comment to official text, T.C.A. Section 47-9-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">While rights, obligations and remedies under T.C.A. Section 47-9'-101 et seq., do not depend on the location of title; title was of paramount importance under the prior existing law which controls this case. The contention of the Bank that T.C.A. Section 64-1801 et seq., and the Uniform Commercial Code are in pari materia is without merit. It is too far fetched to relate the \u201csecurity interest\u201d theory of the Uniform Commercial Code back to T.C.A. Section 64-1801 et seq., and then to incorporate a chattel mortgage on merchandise held for sale as valid under T.C.A. Section 64-1801 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It is evident that the Legislature intended to, and did, create an entirely new security device in enacting T.C.A. Section 64-1801 et seq. Under it, title, possession and power of sale remain in the borrower. The lien created attaches to the goods, but title is not affected. Upon a sale, title passes to the purchaser, but the lien is transferred by operation of the statute to the proceeds of the sale. The rule that is relied upon to invalidate the chattel mortgage of the Bank has been too well intrenched in this State to infer that the Legislature intended to wipe it out by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Thus, the rule which states that a mortgage upon a stock in trade with power of disposition left in the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>gagor is void as to other creditors makes the chattel mortgage of the Bank void.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">For the reasons herein stated, the decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-6\">Burnett, Chief Justice, and Dyer and Creson, Justices, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b190-7\">White, Justice, not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
