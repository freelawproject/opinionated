Because defendant\u2019s spouse was not examined as a witness, we conclude that the privilege was not available in the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">We are required also to determine whether the circuit court properly applied the second edition of the sentencing guidelines when this defendant was last resentenced in light of the fact that he earlier had been sentenced and resentenced for the same crime while the first edition was still in effect. We find no error in the application of the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">During an altercation with defendant Richard Fisher, William Tappert was stabbed with a hunting knife at the home of Mary Fisher, defendant\u2019s estranged wife. Tappert died the next day, and defendant was charged with first-degree murder. MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">The prosecutor maintained that the killing was premeditated and motivated by jealousy. Although defendant and his wife were separated, he visited the home almost daily to see his children. The prosecution contended that defendant was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>turbed because Tappert, who was Mary Fisher\u2019s boyfriend, had been staying at the house during several of the nights which preceded the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In testimony at his trial before an Eaton County jury, defendant claimed that Tappert was physically abusing Mary Fisher, and that he was coming to her aid when Tappert was stabbed. According to defendant, the two men engaged in a scuffle, he took out a small hunting knife merely to scare Tappert, and the stabbing was accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The jury rejected defendant\u2019s version of the events, and convicted him of second-degree murder, MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549. Thereafter, he was sentenced by Circuit Judge Richard M. Shuster to forty to sixty years in prison. On appeal in the Court of Appeals, defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed. However, because the sentence exceeded the then-recommended minimum sentencing guideline range of seven to sixteen years, the case was remanded to the circuit court for resentencing with instructions to provide a more adequate articulation on the record of reasons for departure from the guidelines. 166 Mich App 699; 420 NW2d 858 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">On remand, the circuit judge reread parts of the original sentencing transcript and again sentenced defendant to forty to sixty years. The judge reasoned that when individuals reach the age of sixty they seldom commit violent acts; therefore, by sentencing the twenty-seven-year-old defendant to a minimum of forty years, society would be given some degree of assurance that he would not commit a similar crime. Defendant again appealed in the Court of Appeals, which found the rationale given for the sentence to be \"totally inappropriate\u201d and ordered that the defendant be resen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tenced by a different judge. 176 Mich App 316, 318; 439 NW2d 343 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Upon return to the circuit court for further proceedings, the matter was assigned to visiting Judge Patrick McCauley, who sentenced defendant to a prison term of twenty-five to fifty years. Judge McCauley made clear that he had considered the recommended minimum of ten to twenty-five years set forth in the revised, or second, edition of the sentencing guidelines, which had not been in effect when defendant was earlier sentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Defendant appealed for a third time, and the Court of Appeals once again reversed. This time the panel ruled that the lower court erred in two respects: first, in considering for sentencing purposes certain statements in the presentence investigation report that were attributed to Mary Fisher, and, second, by utilizing the revised, or second, edition of the sentencing guidelines. Once again, the case was remanded for resentencing by yet another judge. 190 Mich App 598; 476 NW2d 762 (1991). After the prosecutor unsuccessfully sought rehearing in the Court of Appeals, this Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">At the sentencing proceeding conducted by Judge McCauley, defendant challenged the truthfulness of certain statements in the presentence report attributed to Mary Fisher, and he objected on the ground of marital privilege to use of the statements for sentencing purposes. Brief excerpts from the report that include the emphasized challenged statements are:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>[1] While there Rick [defendant] looked into the bedroom area and said to Mary [Fisher], \"Is <em>your fuckin boyfriend here? Tell him to come in here so I can stick him a couple of times.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">[2] Bill Tappert fell to the ground and Mary saw that he was bleeding. She started to cry and asked Rick, <em>\"Did you stab him?\u201d, </em>to which he replied, <em>\u201dFuck yes I stuck him.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">[3] Mary followed Rick outside of the house and <em>Rick told her to tell the police that Tappert had fallen into the knife.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Addressing the issue of marital privilege, the visiting circuit judge noted that defendant and Mary Fisher were no longer married, having divorced during the period between the first and third sentencing proceedings. The court found that the challenged statements implicated only the spousal privilege, and that it was inapplicable because the spousal privilege \"terminated at the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">After holding an evidentiary hearing at which defendant and the police investigator testified, the court concluded that the statements as reported were truthful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, in explaining its reasons for imposition of the twenty-five to fifty-year sentence, the court left no doubt that each of the challenged statements was taken into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Responding to defendant\u2019s third appeal, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court\u2019s disposition of defendant\u2019s claim of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>spousal privilege. While acknowledging that the spousal privilege (precluding one spouse from testifying against the other) does not survive divorce, the panel emphasized that the communications privilege encompassed within the same statute precludes testimony by one who is, or was, a spouse \"with regard to any confidential communication that occurred during the marriage irrespective of a subsequent divorce.\u201d 190 Mich App 603. The panel concluded that at least \"the third statement at issue, which was a request by defendant to his estranged wife asking her to lie to the police, was barred by the confidential communications privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">For reasons other than those articulated by either the trial court or the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the three statements at issue were not precluded from consideration as part of the presentence report by the privilege statute, MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Privileges are governed by the common law, except as modified by statute or court rule. MRE 501. Because there is no court rule governing marital privileges, the statute controls. <em>People v Love, </em>425 Mich 691, 699; 391 NW2d 738 (1986) (opinion of Cavanagh, J.)._</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">A husband shall not be examined as a witness for or against his wife without her consent; nor a wife for or against her husband without his consent . . . nor shall either, during the marriage or afterwards, without the consent of both, be examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>People v Hamacher, </em>432 Mich 157, 161-162; 438 NW2d 43 (1989), this Court distinguished between the spousal privilege and the marital communication privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Section 2162 of the eja provides two distinct privileges. The first, the spousal privilege, is only applicable when the witness and the spouse are married at the time of trial. This privilege bars one spouse from testifying for or against the other without the other\u2019s consent except in (1) actions for divorce, (2) prosecutions for bigamy or for a crime committed against the children of either or both, (3) actions growing out of a personal wrong or injury done by one to the other or the refusal or neglect to furnish the spouse or children with suitable support, (4) cases of desertion or abandonment, and (5) certain cases relating to marriage and title to property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">The second privilege, the communication privilege, bars one spouse from testifying \"as to any communications made by one to the other during the marriage\u201d without the consent of the other. The communication privilege applies whether the testimony is sought \"during the marriage or after-wards,\u201d as long as the communication occurred during the marriage. Section 2162 of the eja states no exceptions with respect to the communication privilege.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Because the spousal privilege is not available except during the marriage, and defendant and Mary Fisher were divorced when Judge McCauley conducted the sentencing proceeding, it is clear that only the applicability of the communications privilege could be at issue. However, the prosecution contends that the marital communication privilege is inapplicable because it is testimonial in nature; since Mary Fisher was not \"examined as a witness\u201d either at trial or during the evidentiary hearing, her statements given to the police and written into the presentence report were not subject to the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The prosecution further argues that the statements, albeit hearsay,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were nonetheless admissible under MRE 1101(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">The rules [of evidence] <em>other than those with respect to privileges </em>do not apply in the following situations and proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUz\">(3) . . . Proceedings for extradition or rendition; <em>sentencing, </em>or granting or revoking probation; issuance of warrants for arrest, criminal summonses, and search warrants; and proceedings with respect to release on bail or otherwise. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">On the other hand, defendant contends that even though MRE 1101(b)(3) allows the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of hearsay evidence at sentencing, the same rule expressly excepts privileged communications from the expansive scope of sentencing information. He argues that the prosecutor should not be able to indirectly introduce privileged evidence that he would be prohibited from educing directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The Michigan marital privilege statute does not specifically address situations in which a confidential communication inadvertently or purposefully comes into the hands of a third party. While the scope of the privilege has been interpreted by this Court on numerous prior occasions, the applicability of the statute in this precise context has not been tested before. Indeed, it has been over eighty years since this Court last encountered a question involving the admissibility, through a third person, of a privileged marital communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\"><em>O\u2019Toole v Ohio German Fire Ins Co, </em>159 Mich 187; 123 NW 795 (1909), was a civil suit involving a claim that the plaintiff wife intentionally burned her barn with the purpose of defrauding the defendant insurance company. The particular issue relevant to the instant case was the admissibility of two incriminating letters made by the wife to, and received by, the husband. The letters inadvertently came into the possession of a third party, who in turn indirectly passed the letters on to the defendant insurance company. The trial court allowed the letters to be received into evidence despite plaintiff\u2019s claim that they constituted privileged communications. Relying more upon common-law doctrine from other jurisdictions than the language of the statute itself,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court affirmed the trial court, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>And so it has been held, and, we think, correctly, that where the communication, oral or written, has, without collusion or voluntary disclosure, escaped the custody and control of the parties communicating or the custody or control of their agents or representatives, it is not privileged. <em>[O\u2019Toole, supra, </em>p 193.][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In reviewing other authorities, the <em>O\u2019Toole </em>Court noted that \"[t]he cases are not numerous; the rulings are not harmonious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This observation still holds true today. Two annotations on the general topic of the interception by third parties of privileged marital communications reflect a wide disparity in the case law in other jurisdictions. See <em>Applicability of marital privilege to written communications between spouses inadvertently obtained by third person, </em>32 ALR4th 1177, and <em>Spouse\u2019s betrayal or connivance as extending marital communications privilege to testimony of third person, </em>3 ALR4th 1104. To some courts, the mere fact that a marital communication came within the possession or knowledge of a third person is sufficient to render it admissible in evidence. Other courts have held that the admissibility of a third person\u2019s testimony concerning a confidential marital communication depends on whether access to the communication was gained with or without the connivance of the spouse. Yet other courts have held that confidential marital communications are absolutely privileged and never admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ble, no matter how obtained. See annotations, <em>id., </em>and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Two cases from other jurisdictions have addressed the unusual situation presented in the instant case. In <em>United States v Burton, </em>631 F2d 280 (CA 4, 1980), the defendant contended on appeal that it was improper for the court, in determining the appropriate sentence, to consider a presentence report containing alleged incriminating privileged marital communications. The appellate court found the defendant\u2019s contentions to be without merit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">No marital privilege \"prevents the government from enlisting one spouse to give information concerning the other or to aid in the other\u2019s apprehension. It is only the spouse\u2019s testimony in the courtroom that is prohibited.\u201d <em>Trammel v United States </em>[445 US 40, 52, n 12; 100 S Ct 906; 63 L Ed 2d 186 (1980)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">The purpose of a probation report, which is not made available to the court until after conviction, is to give the sentencing judge the fullest possible information concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics so that he may be able to impose an appropriate sentence. See <em>Williams v New York </em>[337 US 241, 250; 69 S Ct 1079; 93 L Ed 1337; 18 USC 3577 (1949)]. There was nothing unusual or improper in the probation officer interviewing defendant\u2019s wife, and in obtaining from her pertinent information concerning the defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct, and in including in the probation report the information supplied by defendant\u2019s wife to the government agents. In so doing, there was no violation of any privileged marital communication. The court was clearly entitled to consider the presentence report, including such information, in its determination of an appropriate sentence. <em>[Burton, supra, </em>pp 281-282.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In <em>State v Minor, </em>188 Neb 23; 195 NW2d 155 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(1972), the court held that a judge at the time of sentencing could consider hearsay statements of the defendant\u2019s wife that were in the presentence report. Noting that the modern trend is to restrict or abolish the marital privilege, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">We construe a wife\u2019s incompetency in criminal proceedings against her husband to be limited to testimonial utterances. She is competent to supply information for a presentence report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">In <em>State v Rose, </em>183 Neb 809 [811], 164 NW2d 646 [1969], we said: \"It is a long accepted practice in this state that before sentencing a defendant after conviction a trial judge has a broad discretion in the source and type of evidence he may use to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within the limits fixed by statute. ... A presentence investigation has nothing to do with the issue of guilt. The rules governing due process with respect to the admissibility of evidence are not the same in a presentence hearing as in a trial in which guilt or innocence is the issue. The latitude allowing a sentencing judge at a presentence hearing to determine the nature and length of punishment, other than in recidivist cases, is almost without limitation as long as it is relevant to the issue.\u201d <em>[Minor, supra, </em>p 27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Our determination in the instant case, however, ultimately turns upon an interpretation of Michigan law. While the statutory language governing the marital communications privilege has not undergone significant substantive changes in the eighty years since O\u2019Toole was decided, society certainly has, accompanied by an increasing recognition that the broad cloak of the marital privilege is no longer justified under certain circumstances. The undisputed modern trend is toward a restrictive, rather than expansive, interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>privilege. As Justice Boyle noted in her dissenting opinion in <em>People v Hamacher, supra, </em>pp 186-187,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">The confidential communications privilege is said to inspire marital confidences. McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 86, p 201. Over time, case law has blurred the justifications, and it is sometimes observed that the validity of both privileges rests on the utilitarian ground of promoting marital harmony. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Criticism of both marital privileges centers on the fact that they conflict with the jurisprudential objective of advancing the truth-finding function. As Professor McCormick observes, \"while the danger of injustice from suppression of relevant proof is clear and certain, the probable benefits of the rule of privilege in encouraging marital confidences and wedded harmony is at. best doubtful and marginal.\u201d McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 86, p 202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The principle that privileges should be narrowly defined and the exceptions to them broadly construed is not new. The <em>O\u2019Toole </em>Court qualified its holding with the admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">The privilege is in derogation of the general rule that all persons may be compelled to testify concerning facts inquired about in courts of justice. It should be made effective, but ought not to be extended by the courts to cases where there has been no injury to the relation of the parties by the betrayal of the confidence reposed. <em>[Id., </em>p 193.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">More recently, in <em>People v Love, supra, </em>pp 700, 701 (opinion of Cavanagh, J.), this Court reiterated the fundamental rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">\"Testimonial exclusionary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle that 'the public . . . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>As such, they must be strictly construed and accepted 'only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.\u2019 \u201d [Quoting from <em>Trammel v United States, </em>445 US 40, 50; 100 S Ct 906; 63 L Ed 2d 186 (1980) (citations omitted). See also <em>People v Hamacher, supra, </em>p 188 (dissenting opinion of Boyle, J.).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">With these principles in mind and our primary focus on the language used in the Michigan statut\u00e9, we conclude that MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162, does not apply in the circumstances presented. The statute provides that neither spouse may \"be examined\u201d with respect to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage. This phrase, \"be examined,\u201d connotes a narrow testimonial privilege only \u2014 a spouse\u2019s privilege against being questioned as a sworn witness about the described communications. In other words, the spouse must testify for the privilege to apply. The introduction of the marital communication through other means is not precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In the instant case, the marital communications privilege is inapplicable because Mary Fisher was not called to testify either at trial or at the evidentiary hearing conducted by Judge McCauley.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The three contested statements made by her to the police detective were set forth in an affidavit to obtain a search warrant. Later, the same statements were included in the presentence report. Although the detective testified concerning the statements made to him, which became part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>presentence report, at no time was Mary Fisher examined as a witness against her husband.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Because we hold that the marital communications privilege is a testimonial privilege that is limited to those situations in which a spouse is being \"examined\u201d in court proceedings with regard to the communications, the three hearsay statements that in this case were written into the presentence report were properly considered by the sentencing court. MRE 1101(h)(3), which provides that the Rules of Evidence do not apply to sentencing proceedings, certainly contemplates that hearsay that does not fall within the protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>tion of an established privilege, may be included in presentence reports.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, it is recognized by Michigan courts that the evidentiary rules governing trial procedure and sentencing are different:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">Historically, separate evidentiary rules have been fashioned for the trial and sentencing procedures. Evidence admitted at trial to determine whether the defendant is guilty of a specific criminal conduct is largely limited by evidentiary rules to first-hand or verifiable testimony directly related to the offense charged. But under Michigan\u2019s indeterminate sentencing law, MCL 769.8; MSA 28.1080; the responsibility for setting the limits of sentence between the statutory minimum and maximum rests squarely on the sentencing judge. At the sentencing hearing, after the issue of guilt has been decided, full information regarding the defendant\u2019s character, background, and criminal record have generally been deemed admissible under concepts of individualizing punishment. The presentence report, mandatory for felony cases in Michigan since 1931, allows the court to make an informed judgment as to possibilities for rehabilitation, and to effectively utilize sentencing alternatives. <em>[People v Lee, </em>391 Mich 618, 634-635; 218 NW2d 655 (1974). See also <em>Williams v New York, supra; People v Potrafka, </em>140 Mich App 749, 751; 366 NW2d 35 (1985); <em>People v Burton, </em>44 Mich App 732; 205 NW2d 873 (1973), lv den 389 Mich 795 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">We realize that our holding today effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>overrules <em>O\u2019Toole </em>and other cited cases to the extent that they can be read as recognizing a broader privilege. However, our ruling by no means represents an abrogation of the marital communication privilege. The dissent of the Chief Justice asserts that our holding would eliminate the statute\u2019s consent requirement, and he refers for an example to a spouse\u2019s divulgence of confidential marital communications in the course of intense police interrogation. According to the dissent, \"[e]ven if the spouse refuses to testify in court regarding the communications, the police can testify because the majority holds that if the spouse does not testify, the privilege does not apply.\u201d (Cavanagh, C.J., <em>post, </em>p 589.) Of course, the flaw in this reasoning is that use of such third-party testimony in a nonsentencing setting would be governed by the rule against hearsay set forth in MRE 802. See, e.g., <em>People v Williams, </em>181 Mich App 551; 450 NW2d 85 (1989); <em>People v Burton, </em>177 Mich App 358, 362; 441 NW2d 87 (1989); <em>People v DeWitt, </em>173 Mich App 261; 433 NW2d 325 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Moreover, as Professor McCormick has posited,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">The argument traditionally advanced in support of the marital communications privilege is that the privilege is needed to encourage marital confidences, which confidences in turn promote harmony between husband and wife. This argument . . . rests upon certain assumptions concerning the knowledge and psychology of married persons. Thus it must be assumed that spouses will know of the privilege and take its protection into account in determining to make marital confidences, or at least, which is not the same thing, that they would come to know of the absence of the privilege if it were withdrawn and be, as a result, less confiding than at present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">In the absence of any empirical validation, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>propositions have appeared highly suspect to many, though not all, commentators. Thus the most convincing answer to the argument of policy appears to be that the contingency of courtroom disclosure would almost never (even if the privilege did not exist) be in the minds of the parties in considering how far they should go in their secret conversations. What encourages them to fullest frankness is not the assurance of courtroom privilege, but the trust they place in the loyalty and discretion of each other. If the secrets are not told outside the courtroom there will be little danger of their being elicited in court. In the lives of most people appearance in court as a party or a witness is an exceedingly rare and unusual event, and the anticipation of it is not one of those factors which materially influence in daily life the degree of fullness of marital disclosures. [1 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 86, pp 309-310.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Of course, it is the prerogative of the Legislature, if it chooses, to expand the marital communications privilege beyond its testimonial nature. However, in the absence of such direction, we follow the mandate of strict construction, particularly where, as here, ascertainment of the truth transcends the need to exclude relevant evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the decision of the Court of Appeals on this issue must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">We now consider whether Judge McCauley used the appropriate guidelines when he sentenced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Administrative Order No. 1988-4 requires the circuit courts to apply the second edition of the sentencing guidelines when sentencing a defendant after October 1, 1988:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines Advisory Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>is authorized to issue the second edition of the sentencing guidelines, to be effective October 1, 1988. Until further order of the Court, every judge of the circuit court and of the Recorder\u2019s Court for the City of Detroit must thereafter use the second edition of the sentencing guidelines when imposing a sentence for an offense that is included in the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Defendant contends that the retroactive application of the revised sentencing guidelines under the present circumstances was a violation of the proscription against ex post facto laws in the state and federal constitutions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> his constitutional right to due process,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and his right to appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant reasons that since he was resentenced twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>because of court error, it is unfair to subject him to a harsher recommended sentence. He explains that the revised guidelines were not applicable when he was first sentenced. Under the original guidelines, the recommended minimum sentence range was seven to sixteen years; however, under the new guidelines, the recommended minimum sentence range is ten to twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Defendant concedes that our decision in <em>People v Potts, </em>436 Mich 295; 461 NW2d 647 (1990), which was decided during the course of defendant\u2019s appeals, obviates the ex post facto issue. In <em>Potts, </em>the defendant challenged application of the revised sentencing guidelines to her May 1988 offense. Noting that use of the revised edition is tied to the date that sentences are imposed (rather than the date that offenses are committed) and that the Michigan sentencing guidelines do not establish a presumptive sentencing range,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this Court held that constitutional ex post facto requirements were not violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">Sentencing judges in this state are required by this Court\u2019s administrative orders to consider the minimum range recommended by the guidelines, but are not bound by it. As the Court of Appeals observed, the guidelines are but \"a tool to assist the sentencing judge in the exercise of discretion.\u201d 181 Mich App 313 [448 NW2d 820 (1989)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">It cannot be said, therefore, that the Michigan guidelines convey substantive rights. Since there are no presumptive sentences, the guidelines as revised did not increase the punishment for the defendant\u2019s crime. Neither before nor after the revisions did the guidelines limit the discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>afforded the sentencing judge in this case by the indeterminate sentencing act. MCL 769.8; MSA 28.1080. There is no violation of the ex post facto provision where the enactment at issue alters modes of procedure rather than substantial personal rights. [Potts, <em>supra, </em>p 303.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Given our conclusion in <em>Potts, </em>that the revised guidelines convey no substantive rights, it logically follows that application of the revised nonbinding sentencing guidelines to a defendant who has appealed his sentence neither chills his right to appeal nor infringes upon his right to due process. The revised guidelines did not increase defendant\u2019s punishment in this case; the only change was in what was deemed appropriate punishment pursuant to the guidelines. Moreover, the revisions did not limit the discretion afforded the sentencing judge. <em>Id., </em>p 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Practically speaking, this defendant has no cause to complain. His first two sentences, being forty to sixty years, exceeded the original guidelines recommendation. The twenty-five-year minimum imposed when he was sentenced a third time under the revised guidelines is actually fifteen years less than the forty-year minimum sentence originally imposed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the twenty-five-year minimum sentence is within the revised guidelines and is therefore presumptively valid. <em>People v Broden, </em>428 Mich 343, 354-355; 408 NW2d 789 (1987).

If the marital communication privilege applies, the police officer\u2019s testimony also should be barred. See <em>People v Salisbury, </em>218 Mich 529, 535; 188 NW 340 (1922) (\"cross-examination is restricted as to other witnesses when the answers would reveal confidential communications, the divulgence of which is prohibited by statute\u201d). It is irrelevant that hearsay is admissible at sentencing pursuant to MRE 1101(b)(3) because only \"hearsay that does not fall within the protection of an established privilege, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>included in presentence reports.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Griffin, J., <em>ante, </em>pp 576-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">This Court has interpreted the privilege statute to encompass two distinct privileges. The first, the spousal privilege, prevents a defendant\u2019s spouse from testifying in court without the defendant\u2019s consent. The second, the marital communication privilege, prevents a defendant and the defendant\u2019s spouse<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from disclosing confidential marital communications at judicial proceedings, unless both spouses consent. <em>People v Hamacher, </em>432 Mich 157, 161; 438 NW2d 43 (1989). This case involves the marital communication privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The marital communication privilege is \"a rule of public policy; the privilege being the privilege of the spouse making the communication, <em>the lips of both being sealed, unless both, otherwise, personally consent.\u201d Sweikhart v Hanrahan, </em>184 Mich 201, 207; 150 NW 833 (1915). (Emphasis added.) It has been said that \" '[t]he exclusion of such communications when made in confidence between persons occupying the intimate relation of husband and wife is predicated on the necessity of fostering such relation and the greater injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>likely to result from permitting their disclosure than the benefit to be gained thereby/ \u201d <em>People v Ignofo, </em>315 Mich 626, 638; 24 NW2d 514 (1946) (quoting <em>Salisbury </em>at 532).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The marital communication privilege also applies at sentence proceedings. Although the statute itself neither limits nor expressly provides for application of the privilege rule to sentencing, <em>MRE 1101(b)(3) certainly does:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">(b) Rules Inapplicable. The rules <em>other than those with respect to privileges </em>do not apply in the following situations and proceedings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">(3) Miscellaneous Proceedings. Proceedings for . . . sentencing .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The problem raised here is that Ms. Fisher disclosed to a police officer confidential marital communications made by her husband, the defendant. The police officer then included the statements in Mr. Fisher\u2019s presentence report, which was considered at sentencing. The prosecutor argues that such use was appropriate because hearsay is admissible at sentencing. MRE 1101(b)(3). If the statements are barred by the marital communication privilege, however, the police officer\u2019s testimony also should be inadmissible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">The majority dismisses this problem by holding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\"[b]ecause . . . the marital communications privilege is a testimonial privilege that is limited to those situations in which a spouse is being 'examined\u2019 in court proceedings with regard to the communications, the three hearsay statements that in this case were written[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] into the presentence report were properly considered by the sentencing court.\u201d Griffin, J., <em>ante, </em>p 576. In effect, the majority allows circumvention of the marital communication privilege and MRE 1101(b)(3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by allowing evidence indirectly that is prohibited directly, a ploy this Court long has forbidden.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Aside from erroneously concluding that the spouse must testify for the privilege to apply, the majority does recognize that MRE 1101(b)(3) \"certainly contemplates that hearsay that does not fall within the protection of an established privilege, may be included in presentence reports.\u201d Griffin, J., <em>ante, </em>pp 576-577. Logically, the inverse should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>also be true. Hearsay that falls within the protection of an established privilege may not be included in presentence reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The hearsay statements here are the confidential marital communications defendant made to his wife. If the statements are protected by the marital communication privilege then both spouses are barred from testifying regarding the statements. To give meaningful effect to that requirement, it must follow that \"cross-examination is restricted as to other witnesses when the answers would reveal confidential communications, the divulgence of which is prohibited by statute.\u201d <em>Salisbury </em>at 535.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Consequently, the police officer\u2019s testimony here would be inadmissible. The majority attempts to elude this prohibition by holding that the privilege does not apply because the spouse was not called to the stand or examined about confidential marital communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">I suggest there is no rational or legal basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s spouse must be called to testify for the marital communication privilege to apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, putting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the spouse on the stand is not a requirement for a communication to fall within the protection of the marital communication privilege.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, and more importantly, under the spousal privilege the defendant\u2019s spouse cannot take the stand unless the defendant first consents. Under the marital communication privilege, both spouses may testify, but both must consent before either can be examined regarding confidential marital communications. Therefore, the prosecutor \"could not call defendant\u2019s\u201d spouse to the stand because he was prohibited by statute. <em>Ignofo </em>at 640. Consequently, the majority\u2019s analysis is seriously flawed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Even if the defendant consented to his spouse taking the stand, \"[t]here is no question but that the wife of defendant could not be asked to disclose such communications,\u201d unless the marital communication privilege also is waived. <em>Id. </em>at 639 (quoting, <em>Salisbury </em>at 535). The distinction between the consent required to waive each privilege further demonstrates that the focus of the marital communication privilege is on prohibiting disclosure of confidential marital communications in court, absent consent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The majority\u2019s conclusion eliminates the right of both spouses to consent before either may disclose confidential marital communications. If confidential marital communications are admissible because neither spouse testifies, but one spouse discloses the statements to a police officer, who then testifies regarding those statements, then the consent requirement would be pointless. That result is contrary to this Court\u2019s responsibility to interpret statutes to avoid rendering any provision meaningless. See <em>Girard v Wagenmaker, </em>437 Mich 231, 238; 470 NW2d 372 (1991) (the Court \"must still give the statute a valid and reasonable construction that will reconcile any inconsistencies and give effect to all its parts\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Consider the implications of the majority\u2019s rule. The police interrogate a defendant\u2019s spouse, who, under the heat of the lights and the pressure of the officers, discloses otherwise confidential marital communications. Even if the spouse refuses to testify in court regarding the communications, the police can testify because the majority holds that if the spouse does not testify, the privilege do\u00e9s not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Besides eroding the consent requirement, the majority rule renders the marital communication privilege virtually nonexistent at sentencing, thus overruling MRE 1101(b)(3). If the privilege does not apply because the spouse does not take the stand, then confidential marital communications could be disclosed to third persons who may testify at sentencing despite the otherwise applicability of the privilege. In order for the privilege to apply after today, the defendant would have to call the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>spouse to the stand, since it is doubtful the prosecutor will. In effect, defendant is forced to consent to his spouse taking the stand and being examined regarding confidential marital communications. It seems odd that the defendant would have to consent, and then moments later object to the same questions being asked in order to invoke the privilege. Such a rule is imprudent because it renders the marital communication privilege unworkable, and it impedes the privilege\u2019s purpose. Although some of my colleagues have advocated eliminating the marital communication privilege altogether, until it is eliminated, this Court must continue to interpret and apply the privilege in a meaningful manner as it is written. This, is to say, testimony regarding confidential marital communications is not to be admitted in court, absent consent or an applicable exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The cases on which the majority relies really do not bear close scrutiny. The marital communication privilege was not an issue in <em>People v Williams, </em>181 Mich App 551; 450 NW2d 85 (1989), which only involved the spousal privilege. Similarly, <em>People v Burton, </em>177 Mich App 358; 441 NW2d 87 (1989), does not involve the marital communication privilege, and the statements at issue in <em>People v DeWitt, </em>173 Mich App 261; 433 NW2d 325 (1988), were not confidential marital communications.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"><em>Williams, </em>nonetheless, warrants further explica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tion. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant allegedly shot her tenant. The defendant\u2019s husband imm\u00e9diately called for emergency assistance and reported that a \" 'woman just shot her tenant.\u2019 \u201d The defendant\u2019s husband was prohibited from testifying in court against<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the defendant without the defendant\u2019s consent. The <em>Williams </em>Court concluded, however, that the statement to the 911 operator itself is not protected by the spousal privilege; therefore, the 911 operator could testify regarding the statement \"if indeed the court determined that a hearsay exception applied . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554. I agree with that holding because the spousal privilege bars the spouse from testifying, but does not purport to preclude any specific category of testimony. If the defendant had consented to her husband taking the stand, he could have testified about his statement to the 911 operator, if such testimony otherwise is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">If the husband\u2019s statement was a confidential marital communication, however, the outcome in <em>Williams </em>would be different. For example, assume that the defendant consented to her husband taking the stand, and, while testifying, the prosecutor attempted to question the husband regarding confidential marital communications. Because both parties must consent to either spouse being examined in court regarding confidential marital communications, either the husband could refuse to answer the question, or the defendant could prevent him from answering, by invoking the marital communication privilege. Thus, the marital communication privilege does not prevent the spouse from taking the stand, but does specifically prohibit certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>testimony from being disclosed without both spouses\u2019 consent. Therefore, the marital communication privilege protects the statement itself. Consequently, the third party to whom the statement later is disclosed also should be prohibited from disclosing the statement in court. Holding otherwise thwarts the purpose of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In holding that the marital communication privilege is testimonial only, the majority also relies on Justice Levin\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Hamacher, </em>in which he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Hamacher\u2019s wife, without violating \u00a72162, related the statement she attributed to her husband to social service workers, police officers, the prosecutor, and could have done so to newspaper and other reporters. She could indeed have gone on the nightly news and made a full statement of the confidential communication without violating \u00a72162. The \"secret\u201d would then no longer have been secret and \"never again a wholly private matter.\u201d Nevertheless, <em>there can be no doubt that despite the wide communication to the world at large of the \"secret,\u201d Hamacher\u2019s wife could not, consistent with \u00a72162, \"be examined\u201d in court with regard to the communication. </em>[432 Mich 177. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The majority claims that Justice Levin concluded that the marital privilege statute only precludes <em>testimony </em>of the spouse. Although Justice Levin did say the purpose of the statute was to preclude \"the spouse from 'be[ing] examined\u2019 in court,\u201d I do not read my colleague\u2019s opinion so narrowly. <em>Id. </em>at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Justice Levin merely was offering support for this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Breisenmeister v Knights of Pythias, </em>81 Mich 525; 45 NW 977 (1890), which involved the patient-physician communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>privilege.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Breisenmeister, </em>this Court interpreted the patient-physician privilege to \"include[ ] both the security against publication, and the right to control the introduction in evidence, of such information or knowledge communicated to or possessed by the physician.\u201d Id. at 535. The Court stressed that the \"latter right exists although the former has ceased to be of any benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Justice Levin merely was reiterating the principle that even if the secret no longer exists, the privilege does.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">I think it is clear that the marital communication privilege, precludes more than just the spouse\u2019s testimony. Inherent in Justice Levin\u2019s conclusion is that any third party to whom the spouse discloses the confidential marital communication is prohibited from testifying in court regarding the communication. If others could testify it would have been unnecessary to argue that the privilege still exists, because the party could have brought in the communication through another witness. The majority ignores that this Court already has explained this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">The public may know; but shall the jury be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>permitted to receive and weigh testimony derived from a source which the law has put the seal of silence upon, unless released by the party who alone has the right to say whether that particular witness shall be the medium of conveying such knowledge to the jury? For instance, the party may have disclosed to a third person all that he has to his physician. Now, while his admissions may be proved in a proper manner by such third person, they cannot be proved by the physician against the objection of the party. The privilege conferred is that the physician shall not <em>disclose or testify </em>to those matters which the statute inhibits without the consent of the party to whom the privilege is extended .... <em>[Id. </em>at 535-536. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Significantly, this Court used the terms \"disclose\u201d and \"testify.\u201d A logical interpretation is that the Court said the physician may not \"testify\u201d or \"disclose\u201d the communication to ensure that the communication is not used in court by anyone to whom the physician discloses the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Justice Boyle\u2019s dissent in <em>Hamacher </em>also supports not allowing disclosure of confidential marital communications in court. Although Justice Boyle disagreed with the privilege altogether, she stated that with \"the passage of 1861 PA 125, Michigan codified the rule of conditional competency or spousal bar and enacted a separate <em>privilege protecting from disclosure at a judicial proceeding </em>all confidential communications between spouses made during the marriage.\u201d <em>Hamacher </em>at 185. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Justice Boyle explained that the two privileges involved \"the right to bar the spouse from testifying and the right to prevent the spouse from revealing confidential communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185-186. Recognizing that the spouse may testify under the marital communication privilege but still not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\"reveal\u201d the communication indicates that the marital communication privilege involves something more than prohibiting spouses from testifying. Obviously, the court cannot prevent a spouse from telling the whole world, but the court can prevent the communication from being revealed at any time during judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">I would hold that because the privilege bars testimony regarding confidential marital communications at trial, whether or not the spouse testifies, and because privilege rules apply at sentencing, the same testimony is barred at sentencing. Once the communication falls within the marital communication privilege, it remains privileged and may not be admitted through a third party.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> I, therefore, agree with the Court of Appeals that the marital communication privilege bars the disclosure by the police officer at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Finally, I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the Court of Appeals order for resentencing under the first edition of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Afm\"> MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> I agree with the principle that evidence not admissible at trial generally is admissible during sentencing; however, MRE 1101(b)(3) bars privileged information during sentencing.

Nonetheless, we reject the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the communication is admissible because the marriage could not be saved.

Nonetheless, the Legislature and the courts have developed the marital communication privilege and must have had a reason, such as, preventing the information from being disclosed in court.

MRE 1101(b)(3) demonstrates that when the Court adopted the rule, it had in mind ensuring that third parties, who did not witness the making of statements were not able to testify regarding confidential marital communications. Despite the fact that this Court promulgated MRE 1101(b)(3), the majority looks to other jurisdictions to support ignoring the rule\u2019s clear mandate that privilege rules apply at sentencing.

Similarly, the spouse can refuse to testify even if the defendant wants the spouse to disclose the confidential marital communications in court.

For the same reason, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Trammel v United States, </em>445 US 40; 100 S Ct 906; 63 L Ed 2d 186 (1980), is mistaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b711-5\"> Interestingly, the statute does not differentiate between admitting favorable or unfavorable testimony.

Richard Erick Fisher was convicted of second-degree murder on evidence tending to show that he stabbed William Tappert with a hunting knife at the home of Mary Fisher, his estranged wife. At a sentencing hearing, a police detective, who interviewed Mary Fisher at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the crime scene, testified that she told the detective that Fisher had asked her \"to tell the police that Tappert had fallen into the knife.\u201d That statement is also recited in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that the detective\u2019s testimony and the recital in the presentence report were evidence that Fisher had asked his estranged wife to lie to the police, and was barred by the marital communications privilege.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The majority concludes that the marital communications privilege does not bar the introduction in evidence of the testimony of the detective or of a document, the presentence report, reporting what Fisher is said to have said to his wife because the privilege is limited to sworn testimony by a spouse in court. No decision of this Court supports this construction of this statutory privilege. What little authority there is in this jurisdiction indicates that the privilege is not limited to spousal testimony in court. The authorities in other jurisdictions overwhelmingly support the view that the privilege bars the introduction in evidence of marital communications through the testimony of a person who spoke to one of the spouses or in the form of a writing containing statements from one spouse to the other obtained through connivance or betrayal by the spouse from whom the writing was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Fisher was sentenced to serve a term of forty to sixty years in prison. On remand from the Court of Appeals, he was sentenced to serve a term of twenty-five to fifty years. Before resentencing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>judge conducted a sentencing hearing during the course of which three statements were admitted in evidence, over objection, through the testimony of the police detective. These statements were also recited in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to consider whether the first of the three statements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was privileged because the sentencing judge said he would not consider the first statement. Nor was it necessary for the Court of Appeals to consider the second statement because it was made in the presence of a third person, and thus was not a confidential communication protected by the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In imposing sentence on Fisher, the judge said that he considered the third statement, wherein Mary Fisher reported that Fisher had asked her to tell the police that Tappert had fallen into the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that the third statement, \"which was a request by defendant to his estranged wife asking her to lie to the police, was barred by the confidential communications privilege. An element of confidentiality is implicit in a request to tell a lie.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The marital communication privilege is statutory.

In holding that the letter was admissible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>this Court quoted with approval the following statement from <em>O\u2019Toole:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\"And so it has been held, and, we think, correctly, that where the communication, oral or written, has, <em>without collusion or voluntary disclosure, </em>escaped the custody and control of the parties communicating, or the custody and control of their agents or representatives, it is not privileged.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 351. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Twelve years later, in <em>People v Salisbury, </em>218 Mich 529, 533; 188 NW 340 (1922), the defendant had been convicted of assault with intent to commit rape. He was cross-examined at length concerning his denials of \"admissions\u201d claimed to have been made by him to his wife. He was asked to read \"a statement in writing [from his wife] to him, in which she had said that defendant made the admissions which he as. a witness denied.\u201d The Court said that the prosecutor \"could not and did not seek to call the wife as a witness,\u201d and that it was error requiring reversal to place before the jury indirectly \"that such damaging admissions had been made by the defendant to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\"><em>Salisbury </em>thus stands for the proposition that it is violative of the marital communications privilege to place before the trier of fact, a wife\u2019s statements concerning statements made to her, orally or in writing, by her husband. The wife in <em>Salisbury </em>was not called or sworn as a witness. Nevertheless, this Court said that what was done was violative of the marital communications privilege, and concluded that \"[f]or the error thus committed, the verdict must be set aside and a new trial granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The Legislature has not spoken in the seventy years since <em>Salisbury </em>was decided. It is not appropriate at this late date, over eighty years after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>O\u2019Toole </em>and <em>Bowen </em>were decided, to revise the construction, consistently placed by this Court on this privilege, to the effect that it bars evidence of marital communications without regard to whether it is sought to introduce evidence of the marital communication through the testimony of a spouse as a sworn witness in court, or by some other means such as a writing containing statements from one spouse to the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Absent an authoritative decision of this Court, the majority adverts to statements I made in a concurring opinion in <em>People v Hamacher, </em>432 Mich 157; 438 NW2d 43 (1989), in response to statements in a dissenting opinion in that case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The dissenting justice sought to limit the privilege so that it could not be invoked where the privacy of the communication/marital relationship had already been violated by disclosure of the statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">When facts which might otherwise be privileged are disclosed for all to inspect, the purpose of the privilege is destroyed. Just as one cannot unring a bell, a secret once disclosed in open court is never again a wholly private matter.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Responding to that statement, I wrote that the communications privilege did not bar a spouse from disclosing a confidential communication to a prosecutor, newspaper reporter or someone else. Nevertheless, although the \"secret\u201d would then no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>longer be secret, \"Hamacher\u2019s wife could not, consistent with \u00a7 2162, 'be examined\u2019 in court with regard to the communication.\u201d I take it that if I had stopped there, the majority would not regard my concurring opinion as support for overruling <em>O\u2019Toole </em>and other decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">But then I went through the fence, adding that it would be inappropriate, one hundred twenty-five years after enactment of the privilege, to restate, as would the dissent, the purpose of the communications privilege as designed \"to protect the secrecy of the communication\u201d or \"that the legislative purpose in 1861 was <em>other than the literally stated purpose of precluding the spouse from 'be[ing] examined\u2019 in court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">On more careful study, it is clear that the words \"examine\u201d or \"examined\u201d are not limited to examination of a witness in court. Neither Ballantine\u2019s Law Dictionary, 3d ed, nor Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 4th ed, define either word. Corpus Juris Secundum defines \"examine\u201d without reference to the examination of witnesses in court in much the same way as that word is defined in standard English language dictionaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">Examine. To inspect or survey carefully; look into the state of; scrutinize and compare the parts of; view or observe in all aspects and relations, with the purpose of forming a correct opinion or judgment; to test by an appropriate method; to inspect carefully; to investigate; scrutinize. The term necessarily implies the power of allowance or rejection, and, in a particular connection, it is only a disputed fact that can be the subject of the examination. [32A CJS, p 855.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The <em>Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>defines \"examine\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">examine ... 1. to inspect or scrutinize carefully: <em>to examine a prospective purchase. </em>... 3. to inquire into or investigate: <em>to examine one\u2019s motives. </em>4. to test the knowledge, reactions, or qualifications of (a pupil, candidate, etc.), as by questions or assigning tasks. 5. to subject to legal inquisition; put to question in regard to conduct or to knowledge of facts; interrogate; <em>to examine a witness; to examine a suspect. </em>[Second Edition, Unabridged, p 674.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Similarly, see <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>p 790. It thus clearly appears that \"examine\u201d means to inspect or scrutinize, to inquire into or investigate, to test, to interrogate, and also to examine a witness. The inquiry or interrogation of a witness may thus be in court or out of court \u2014 the inquiry or interrogation need not be under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">That the inquiry or interrogation of a spouse might not be in court was recognized by the Legislature in 1861, when it enacted the marital privileges, and has been carried forward to this day. The spousal privilege \u2014 the privilege against spousal <em>testimony</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 is stated as a privilege against examination <em>as a witness:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">A husband shall not be <em>examined as a witness </em>for or against his wife without her consent; nor a wife for or against her husband without his consent, except .... [MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">But the marital communications privilege is not limited to examination \"as a witness.\u201d The privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>lege is stated, rather, without the \"as a witness\u201d qualification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">[N]or shall either, during the marriage or after-wards, without the consent of both, be <em>examined </em>as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage .... [MCL 600.2162; MSA 27A.2162. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The Legislature thus carefully drew a distinction between \"examined as a witness,\u201d the privilege against spousal testimony, and \"examined,\u201d the privilege against use of a marital communication. Clearly, without regard to whether the inquiry or interrogation is in or out of court, a spouse may not be \"examined\u201d concerning a marital communication without the consent of both spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The majority claims that its pronouncement today follows \"the mandate of strict construction.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Adherence to strict construction would, however, require recognition of the distinction between \"examined as a witness\u201d and \"examined\u201d so clearly drawn by the Legislature over one hundred thirty years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">I acknowledge my error in stating that the legislative purpose in 1861 was confined to the \"literally stated\u201d purpose of precluding a spouse from \"be[ing] examined\u201d in court. It is clear from the dictionary definitions that \"examine\u201d or \"examined\u201d are not literally limited to either examination in court or to examination as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">It is also clear, on the authority of the four earlier statements of this Court in <em>Bowen, O\u2019Toole, Dunnigan, </em>and <em>Salisbury, on </em>principle, and on the basis of the overwhelming weight of authority in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>other jurisdictions, that the privilege extends to writings from one spouse to another, and generally bars introduction in evidence in court of a marital communication either through the testimony of a witness who spoke with a spouse or in the form of a document containing statements from one spouse to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">I must, therefore, dissent from the obiter dictum in my concurring opinion in <em>Hamacher, </em>and from the Court\u2019s reliance on such a weak reed. Because no other justice signed my concurring opinion, it does not constitute a decision of this Court. My statement in <em>Hamacher </em>does not support or justify overruling <em>O\u2019Toole </em>and other decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Ordinarily, as in two of the three Court of Appeals decisions relied on by the majority, the hearsay rule will bar the testimony of a person who spoke to a spouse who revealed a confidential marital communication, and will also bar admitting in evidence a writing containing statements from one spouse to the other. In <em>People v DeWitt, </em>173 Mich App 261, 266; 433 NW2d 325 (1988), and <em>People v Burton, </em>177 Mich App 358, 362; 441 NW2d 87 (1989), the Court held that statements claimed to have been made by a spouse and a writing prepared by a spouse were barred by the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">In <em>DeWitt, </em>however, before holding that the hearsay rule barred evidence concerning a wife\u2019s statements, the Court said that because her statements were introduced through a third person and the wife did not testify, the marital communications privilege was inapplicable. The Court made that statement without reference to <em>Bowen, O\u2019Toole, Dunnigan, </em>or <em>Salisbury, </em>or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>authority in this or any other jurisdiction, on the basis of implication: \"The statute clearly states that neither spouse may be 'examined as a witness\u2019 against the other spouse, <em>implying </em>that either spouse must testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Implication is not a substitute for research of law concerning how the privilege has been applied in this and other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The obiter dictum in <em>DeWitt </em>was the only authority cited in <em>Burton, supra, </em>p 362,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and <em>People v Williams, </em>181 Mich App 551, 554; 450 NW2d 85 (1989).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">While the hearsay rule would ordinarily bar a witness from testifying, as did the detective concerning what Fisher said to his estranged wife, and would ordinarily also bar admitting in evidence a writing reciting her statements, the Rules of Evidence provide that the rules do not apply to sentencing proceedings. The rules also provide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>however, that the privileges <em>do apply </em>to sentencing proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Court today, in a criminal prosecution, limits the scope of the communications privilege. But the limitation announced today will apply in civil cases as well.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The question is therefore broader, and the decision of this Court more far reaching than whether the communications privilege \"may be invoked in a <em>sentencing proceeding </em>to preclude consideration by the sentencing court of certain extrajudicial statements made by defendant\u2019s estranged wife and set forth in the presentence report.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Courts generally have had some difficulty deciding whether the communications privilege bars the introduction in evidence of letters from one spouse to another \u2014 which, like the presentence report here at issue, are writings containing statements from one spouse to the other. Letters can be mislaid and find their way into the hands of third persons. Many courts have analogized letters that inadvertently come into the hands of a third per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>son to statements overheard by a third person<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which, because they are not then confidential, are not protected by the communications privilege.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But courts generally have also concluded that the privilege bars the introduction of letters deliberately transferred by the addressee spouse to a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">McCormick reports that many if not most of the cases state that the privilege will not be lost if \"the delivery or disclosure of the letter be due to the <em>betrayal or connivance </em>of the spouse to whom the message is directed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) McCormick appears to agree with that approach, stating: \"Just as that spouse would not be permitted, against the will of the communicating spouse, to betray the confidence by testifying in court to the message, so <em>he or she may not effectively destroy the privilege by out-of-court betrayal.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Wigmore similarly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">(3) <em>For documents of comm unication coming into the possession of a third </em>person, <em>a distinction </em>should obtain, analogous to that already indicated for a client\u2019s communications (\u00a7\u00a7 2325 and 2326 <em>supra). </em>That is, <em>if they were obtained from the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>addressee spouse by voluntary delivery, they should still be privileged (for otherwise the privilege could by collusion be practically nulli\u00f1ed for written communications); </em>but if they were obtained surreptitiously or otherwise without the addressee\u2019s consent, the privilege should cease. The rulings here are not harmonious. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Decisions in other jurisdictions support McCormick\u2019s and Wigmore\u2019s statements that the spouse to whom the communication is made may not \"destroy the privilege by out-of-court betrayal\u201d or \"collusion.\u201d <em>Dalton v People, </em>68 Colo 44; 189 P 37 (1920) (husband could not testify concerning letter written by wife); <em>Selden v State, </em>74 Wis 271; 42 NW 218 (1889) (letters from the defendant to his wife subpoenaed by the prosecutor were inadmissible); <em>Wilkerson v State, </em>91 Ga 729; 17 SE 990 (1893) (a letter from the defendant to his wife delivered by her to the prosecutor was inadmissible); <em>Scott v Commonwealth, </em>94 Ky 511; 23 SW 219 (1893) (letter from defendant to his wife, which appears to have been delivered by her to the prosecutor was inadmissible); <em>Mahner v Linck, </em>70 Mo App 380, 388 (1897) (letters from a husband to his wife are not admissible \"whenever they have come to the possession of a third party by the agency of the husband or the wife\u201d); <em>State v St John, </em>94 Mo App 229; 68 SW 374 (1902) (a communication from a husband to his wife delivered by her to a third person was inadmissible); <em>Cole v Texas, </em>48 Tex Crim 439; 88 SW 341 (1905) (evidence that the defendant husband learned the contents of a letter from his wife\u2019s father to his wife was inadmissible as a confidential marital communication); <em>McCoy v Justice, </em>199 NC 602; 155 SE 452 (1930) (letters between a husband and his wife turned over by her to a third party were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>inadmissible); <em>Martin v State, 203 </em>Miss 187; 33 So 2d 825 (1948) (the admission of a letter from a wife of a witness to the witness was erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In <em>Commonwealth v Fisher, </em>221 Pa 538, 544; 70 A 865 (1908), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that letters from the defendant to his wife, delivered by her to the district attorney, were inadmissible. The court said that the letters \"could not be produced by the wife and offered in evidence as coming from her because this <em>in effect was permitting the wife to testify against her husband </em>. . ., which cannot be done under our statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Nor is third-party testimony admissible concerning a marital communication that has been divulged. <em>Brown v Wood, 121 </em>Mass 137 (1876) (the testimony of third parties to whom a husband and wife repeated details of a transaction was inadmissible). See also <em>Gross v State, </em>61 Tex Crim 176; 135 SW 373 (1911) (a third party who casually read a letter from a husband to his wife cannot testify concerning its contents).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Modern cases make the same distinction between inadvertent and deliberate disclosure of letters by a spouse. In <em>State v Myers, </em>230 Kan 697, 702; 640 P2d 1245 (1982), the defendant sought to prevent the admission of letters he had written to his wife that were found by her former landlord and delivered to the police. The Supreme Court of Kansas affirmed the trial court\u2019s admission of the letters, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">Under the statute, a defendant charged with a crime has a right to <em>prevent the other from violating the con\u00f1dentiality of the marital relationship </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>by disclosing a con\u00f1dential communication. </em>Where, however, the confidential communication <em>inadvertently and unintentionally </em>falls into the hands of a third person, the admission of testimony about the confidential communication would not constitute a violation of the marital privilege.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In an earlier decision of the Kansas Supreme Court, <em>State v Holt, </em>223 Kan 34; 574 P2d 152 (1977), the court held that it was error, albeit harmless error, to have admitted a note<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> from the defendant to his wife, left by him in the kitchen of their home and delivered by her to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">These Kansas cases, <em>Myers </em>and <em>Holt, </em>are noteworthy because the thin line of authority relied on by the majority all trace back to the Kansas case of <em>State v Buffington, </em>20 Kan 599 (1878), which, as appears from <em>Myers </em>and <em>Holt, </em>is no longer followed in Kansas. See part c.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In <em>McCravey v State, 2 </em>Tenn Crim App 473; 455 SW2d 174 (1970), the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals held that a defendant\u2019s letter to his wife, delivered by her to the authorities, was improperly admitted in light of the privilege, but the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The Illinois Court of Appeals, in <em>People v Gardner, </em>105 Ill App 3d 103, 116; 60 Ill Dec 951; 433 NE2d 1318 (1982), affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a letter written by a codefendant to his wife on the basis of the privilege:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>[T]he privilege is not lost even if \"the delivery of the letter be due to the betrayal or connivance of the spouse to whom the message is directed.\u201d [Quoting <em>People v Simpson, </em>68 Ill 2d 276; 12 Ill Dec 234; 369 NE2d 1248 (1977).][<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The Court of Appeals of Georgia held that a note left by a husband for his wife shortly before he died as a result of a gunshot, claimed to have be\u00e9n self-inflicted, was inadmissible because it was a confidential marital communication. <em>Georgia Int\u2019l Life Ins Co v Boney, </em>139 Ga App 575; 228 SE2d 731 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">A New York court held that letters written by a wife to her husband were inadmissible, and dismissed an indictment because otherwise there was insufficient evidence. <em>People v Harris, </em>39 Misc 2d 193; 240 NYS2d 503 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held that the rules of privilege, including the marital communications privilege, apply to proceedings before a magistrate for the issuance of a search warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">Marital confidences would not be meaningful if a spouse could decide to reveal the confidence to a third person and thereby destroy the protection of the privilege. We conclude that a communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>which is privileged when made remains so, regardless of an unauthorized out-of-court disclosure. The status of the particular marital relationship has no bearing on whether a privilege exists for marital communications. The fact that the defendant was served with a divorce summons shortly after his wife\u2019s disclosures is therefore irrelevant to the issue here. Sec. 885.18, Stats. 1971, prevents disclosure during the marriage or \"afterwards.\u201d <em>[Muetze v State, </em>73 Wis 2d 117, 129-130; 243 NW2d 393 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The majority adverts to two alr annotations<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and concludes that there is \"wide disparity in the case law in other jurisdictions.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Both McCormick and Wigmore report, however, that the majority of jurisdictions follow the approach of this Court in <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>holding that the communications privilege bars the admission in evidence of a letter obtained through the betrayal or connivance of a spouse, but not a letter obtained through interception, loss or misdelivery.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">A few courts have, indeed, held that letters from one spouse to another are not protected by the privilege even where a spouse deliberately delivers the letters to a third person. But on examination, these cases all appear to trace back to <em>State v Buffington, supra, </em>in which the Kansas Supreme Court analogized to the situation where a third person inadvertently overhears a conversation between spouses. As this Court indicated in <em>O\u2019Toole, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>that analogy does not justify holding that the privilege does not bar introduction in evidence of a confidential marital communication <em>deliberately </em>delivered by a spouse to a third person.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On principle, there is no reason to distinguish between a deliberate oral statement by a spouse to a third person of a confidential communication, and a deliberate delivery by a spouse to a third person of a written communication. Manifestly\u2014 we all agree \u2014 a spouse could not be examined in court concerning an oral confidential communication simply because that spouse had deliberately revealed the substance of the communication to third persons. That being the undoubted rule of law, there is no basis in reason for holding that the privilege does not bar the testimony of a witness who spoke to a spouse who reported to the witness a confidential marital communication, or that the privilege does not bar the admissibility of a document containing communications from one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>spouse to the other. As stated by Justice Miller of the United States Circuit Court in <em>Bowman v Patrick, </em>32 F 368, 369 (ED Mo, 1887):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">I am quite clear that the wife has no right to publish these communications; that she would not be permitted to produce the letter if she were a witness on the stand; that she could be enjoined from producing the letter if she were supposed to be hostile to her husband ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The alr article relied on by the majority cites a handful of cases, beginning with <em>Buffington, </em>decided in 1878, and concluding with a Louisiana case decided in 1920 for the view it adopts today. A number of the cases cited are not in point.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The alr article, published in 1981, cites no case later than 1920, the pocket part cites no later case, and the majority cites no later case that supports the extreme view, adopted by the majority, that \"the mere fact that [written] a marital communication came within the possession or knowledge of a third person is sufficient to render it admissible in evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The majority states that the \"undisputed modern trend is toward a restrictive, rather than expansive, interpretation of the privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But the majority does not cite a single modern case that, in keeping with that \"trend,\u201d supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>specific limitation it imposes today, confining the communications privilege to testimony by the spouse as a witness in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">United States Courts of Appeal, which may expound on the \"privileges from the principles of the common law 'in the light of reason and experience? Fed R Evid 501,\u201d have recently ruled that an fbi agent who spoke to the defendant\u2019s wife should not have been permitted to testify concerning what the defendant was claimed to have said to her,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and that a letter turned over to the government by the wife, who had entered into a plea bargain, was inadmissible.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Despite the \"trend,\u201d the Uniform Rules of Evidence, 1974 Act,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and the Model Code of Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(1942),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> do not limit the scope of the communications privilege to repetition by the spouse of the marital communication in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">There have, indeed, been recent changes in the scope of the communications privilege, especially by the federal courts where the privileges are not statutory<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> but the change imposed today finds no support in any recent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The majority states that the \"unusual situation presented in the instant case\u201d is addressed in <em>United States v Burton, </em>631 F2d 280 (CA 4, 1980) and <em>State v Minor, </em>188 Neb 23; 195 NW2d 155 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Both courts did indeed hold that it was not violative of a defendant\u2019s rights to include in a presentence report hearsay statements made by his wife to a probation officer. As set forth in the quotation from <em>Burton </em>in the majority opinion,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> the wife provided \" 'information concerning the defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct.\u2019 \u201d In providing such information, said the court, \"there was no violation of any privileged marital communication.\u201d Clearly there is a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>difference between providing information concerning a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct, which need not include the substance of any marital communication, and repetition of a marital communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In <em>Minor, </em>the Nebraska Supreme Court similarly held that it was not violative of the defendant\u2019s rights to include, in a presentence report, hearsay statements of his wife. The court said, as set forth in the majority opinion, that it construed \"a wife\u2019s <em>incompetency </em>in criminal proceedings against her husband to be limited to testimonial utterances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The substance of the hearsay statements made by the wife contained in the presentence report is not set forth in the opinion of the court. There is no basis for inferring that her statements concerned confidential marital communications. The court referred to an earlier decision of the Nebraska Supreme Court, but there is no indication that the information there provided was other than background information.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We have found two cases concerning the applicability of a privilege to presentence reports. In <em>Southern Blue Grass Mental Health v Angelucci, </em>609 SW2d 931 (Ky App, 1980), and <em>Idaho v Browning, </em>121 Idaho 239; 824 P2d 170 (Idaho App, 1992), the intermediate appellate courts of Kentucky and Idaho held that the physician-patient privilege was applicable to presentence reports, and therefore confidential information covered by the privilege could not be considered in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-9\"> 190 Mich App 598; 476 NW2d 762 (1991).
