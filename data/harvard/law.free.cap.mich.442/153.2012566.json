Specifically, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courts\u2019 conclusions that an anonymous telephone call relied upon by the Alpena Police Department to make an investigative stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle did not provide the basis to support a reasonable suspicion of criminal behavior. Resolution of this issue requires this Court to consider for the first time the effect of <em>Alabama v White, </em>496 US 325; 110 S Ct 2412; 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>L Ed 2d 301 (1990), upon Michigan jurisprudence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that given the totality of the circumstances, the police officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigative stop. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">At approximately 6:30 p.m. on July 9, 1988, the Alpena police dispatcher received a telephone call from an anonymous source who stated that defendant was presently transporting a quarter pound of either marijuana or cocaine in a \"newer model blue pickup, possibly a Datsun.\u201d The caller stated that defendant was en route to Alpena via Werth Road. The informant also stated that defendant would be turning onto Hobbs Drive, then possibly onto either Third or Grant. According to the tip, the drugs were concealed in a carrying case behind the front seat of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">This information was relayed to Officer Michael Roy of the Alpena Police Department and to other law enforcement authorities including the state police. Minutes after receiving the information, Officer Roy observed a blue Mazda pickup truck traveling on Hobbs Drive. Officer Roy recognized defendant driver from a previous arrest and began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>to follow him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A lein search of the license plate revealed that defendant owned the blue pickup truck. When defendant turned onto Grant Street, Officer Roy pulled him over and explained that he had been stopped in connection with a drug investigation. Officer Roy conducted a weapons search of defendant and placed him in the back of his patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">At about the same time, Michigan State Police Trooper Roger Liedke arrived at the scene. Having heard the same information that was relayed to Officer Roy, Trooper Liedke approached the pickup truck. Through the open passenger side window, Trooper Liedke detected the strong odor of fresh marijuana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subsequent search of the pickup truck uncovered a black attach\u00e9 case containing eleven bags of marijuana behind the front seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The district court ordered suppression of the evidence on the ground that the anonymous tip did not support the investigative stop that led to seizure of the contraband. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal, as did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the Court of Appeals, which concluded that the facts failed to establish the existence of a \" 'special familiarity with [defendant\u2019s] affairs\u2019 \u201d to the extent that it was unreasonable for the police to conclude that the anonymous caller\u2019s information regarding the drugs was correct simply because the statements about defendant\u2019s travel route and the pickup truck were correct. 193 Mich App 499, 504; 484 NW2d 670 (1992). This Court granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal the issue whether the anonymous tip, together with independent police corroboration, created a \"reasonable suspicion\u201d supporting an investigative stop in accord with the totality of the circumstances test enunciated in <em>White.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The exclusionary rule providing for suppression of unlawfully obtained evidence derives from protections contained in the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> US Const, Am IV ensures the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The Fourth Amendment, then, protects citizens from <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures. <em>Terry v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Ohio, </em>392 US 1, 9; 88 S Ct 1868; 20 L Ed 2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 US 873, 878; 95 S Ct 2574; 45 L Ed 2d 607 (1975); <em>United States v Sharpe, </em>470 US 675, 682; 105 S Ct 1568; 84 L Ed 2d 605 (1985); <em>People v Shabaz, </em>424 Mich 42, 52; 378 NW2d 451 (1985). The reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure balances the governmental interest that justifies the intrusion against an individual\u2019s right to be free of arbitrary police interference. <em>Terry, supra </em>at 20-21; <em>Brignoni-Ponce, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In addition, the federal constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures have been extended to state proceedings through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Mapp v Ohio, </em>367 US 643, 655; 81 S Ct 1684; 6 L Ed 2d 1081 (1961); <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196, 211; 341 NW2d 439 (1983) (opinion of Brickley, J.); <em>People v Burrell, </em>417 Mich 439, 448, n 15; 339 NW2d 403 (1983). Because the Michigan Constitution does not provide more protection than its federal counterpart, under the circumstances of this case, federal law controls our inquiry. Thus, consideration of defendant\u2019s motion for exclusion of the marijuana necessarily implicates his federal constitutional rights. See <em>People v Toohey, </em>438 Mich 265, 270-271; 475 NW2d 16 (1991), and <em>People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 25-31; 475 NW2d 684 (1991).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">The seminal federal case recognizing the validity of investigative stops is <em>Terry v Ohio, supra. </em>In <em>Terry, </em>a police officer stopped three men whom he suspected of \" 'casing a job, a stick-up\u2019 \u201d after observing two of the men repeatedly walk past and peer into a store window. 392 US 6. The officer stopped the men and asked for identification. Because adequate identification was not provided, the officer conducted a weapons search of the petitioner. The search uncovered a .38 caliber revolver in the left breast pocket of the petitioner\u2019s overcoat. Another weapon was found in the possession of one of the other men. In response to the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress the guns as the product of an illegal search and seizure, the Supreme Court recognized an intermediate form of weapons search for less than probable cause to arrest as long as the search was based upon specific and articulable facts together with any rational inferences drawn from those facts. <em>Terry, supra </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Over a decade later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Adams v Williams, </em>407 US 143; 92 S Ct 1921; 32 L Ed 2d 612 (1972), in which it concluded that the information provided by a <em>known </em>informant supported a reasonable suspicion of criminality that justified an investigative stop. In <em>Adams, </em>the informant told a police officer that an individual seated in a nearby vehicle possessed narcotics and carried a gun at his waist. On the basis of this information, the officer asked the individual to get out of his vehicle. Instead, the defendant rolled down his window. Although the gun was not visible, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>officer reached into the vehicle and found the weapon where the informant said it would be. The subsequent search incident to the arrest for suspected illegal possession of a weapon uncovered another gun, a machete, and a substantial quantity of heroin. The Court concluded that the tipster\u2019s information carried with it sufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigative stop, distinguishing the case from the type requiring probable cause subject to the strictures of the <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli </em>cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Informants\u2019 tips, like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene, may vary greatly in their value and reliability. One simple rule will not cover every situation. Some tips, completely lacking in indicia of reliability, would either warrant no police response or require further investigation before a forcible stop of a suspect would be authorized. But in some situations . . . the subtleties of the hearsay rule should not thwart an appropriate police response. [407 US 147.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In <em>United States v Cortez, </em>449 US 411; 101 S Ct 690; 66 L Ed 2d 621 (1981), the Supreme Court was asked to assess the constitutionality of an investigative stop of a truck containing illegal aliens. The Court concluded that the observations of border patrol officers were sufficient to justify an investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>gative stop of a vehicle. The border patrol was suspicious of the smuggling of aliens into the United States along a particular portion of the Mexican border.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The border patrol suspected that the aliens, initially on foot, were met by a vehicle that could carry a large group without arousing suspicion. On surveillance, the border patrol saw only two vehicles that could carry a large group of people. The vehicle that returned from the east after having passed the officers earlier from the west was stopped and its driver was informed that he had been pulled over for an immigration check. When the driver consented to a search of the rear of the vehicle, the border patrol discovered six illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In assessing the validity of the investigative stop, the <em>Cortez </em>Court relied upon the totality of the circumstances test. Specifically, the Court concluded that an assessment of constitutionality must be based upon all of the circumstances. Furthermore, the assessment of all the circumstances must yield a particularized suspicion that the specific individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing. The Supreme Court also voiced the following caution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common-sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same \u2014 and so are law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>enforcement officers. Finally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement. <em>[Cortez, supra </em>at 418.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Several years later, the Supreme Court rejected the two-pronged <em>Ag\u00failar-Spinelli </em>test for probable cause to search or arrest on information provided by an anonymous tip. <em>Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213, 238; 103 S Ct 2317; 76 L Ed 2d 527 (1983). In reaffirming the use of the totality of the circumstances test for probable cause, the <em>Gates </em>majority noted that the two-pronged <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test had \"encouraged an excessively technical dissection of informants\u2019 tips, with undue attention being focused on isolated issues that cannot sensibly be divorced from the other facts . . . .\u201d <em>Gates </em>at 234-235.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the informants\u2019 bases of knowledge and veracity are still highly relevant to the issue whether probable cause exists, the failure of one no longer requires the conclusion that probable cause does not exist. Rather, deficiencies in one may be compensated for by strengths of the other, or by other factors. See <em>id. </em>at 233-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In <em>United States v Sokolow, 490 US </em>1; 109 S Ct 1581; 104 L Ed 2d 1 (1989), the Supreme Court reversed the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for its creation of unnecessary difficulty in dealing with the concepts concerning the reasonable suspicion analysis embodied in the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 7. The ninth circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dichotomized the facts offered in support of a reasonable suspicion into the following categories: those that described actual, ongoing criminal activity and those that described \"personal characteristics\u201d of drug couriers. The court of appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction upon the basis of its belief that a \"reasonable suspicion\u201d must be supported by at least one factor of ongoing criminality. The <em>Sokolow </em>majority rejected the artificial dichotomy and concluded that the facts and circumstances in their totality supported a finding of reasonable suspicion to make the investigative stop. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">With regard to the issue whether an anonymous tip supports a reasonable suspicion to stop a suspect, Michigan .case law tracks federal precedent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, the decisions of our courts regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>the existence of probable cause on the basis of informants\u2019 tips are also rooted in federal case law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">B. <em>ALABAMA v WHITE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">On April 22, 1987, Corporal Davis of the Montgomery Police Department received an anonymous phone call informing him that Vanessa White would be leaving apartment 235-C of the Lynwood Terrace Apartments at a particular time later in the day. The caller also described White\u2019s vehicle as a brown Chrysler station wagon with a broken right taillight lens. According to the caller, White was going to Dobey\u2019s Motel with a brown attach\u00e9 case containing about an ounce of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Corporal Davis staked out the apartment complex, where he and his partner saw the vehicle described by the anonymous informant. The officers also saw White enter the station wagon and proceed toward Dobey\u2019s Motel. Davis radioed ahead for a patrol unit to pull White over. White was asked to step to the rear of the vehicle and informed that she had been stopped for suspected possession of narcotics. When asked if she would permit a search of the vehicle, White consented. White also gave the officers the combination to a locked brown attach\u00e9 case found in the vehicle. The attach\u00e9 case contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">White was charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Montgomery County Court denied a motion to suppress the narcotics evidence. On appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>peals reversed on the ground that the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop. The Alabama Supreme Court denied the state\u2019s writ for certiorari. The United States Supreme Court granted the state\u2019s petition for certiorari<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to reconcile the differing views of state and federal courts regarding the issue whether an anonymous tip could furnish reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop. <em>White, supra </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by recalling its decision in <em>Adams v Williams, supra. </em>In <em>Adams, </em>the majority concluded that the information provided by a <em>known </em>informant, though unverified, carried with it sufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigative stop and weapons search. <em>White, supra </em>at 328. Next, the <em>White </em>majority revisited the <em>Gates </em>decision in which the Court rejected the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>two-pronged test for the reliability of <em>anonymous </em>tips in favor of the totality of the circumstances test.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <em>Adams </em>and <em>Gates </em>precedents formed the basis for the <em>White </em>Court\u2019s test for assessing whether an anonymous tip furnishes the reasonable suspicion necessary to make an investigative stop.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The Court concluded that independent police corroboration of the informant\u2019s predictions \u201cimparted some degree of reliability to the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>allegations made by the caller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. Moreover, the caller\u2019s ability to predict White\u2019s future behavior demonstrated a special familiarity with White\u2019s affairs. <em>Id. </em>This \"special familiarity\u201d distinguished the caller\u2019s information from that observable by the general public, which in turn supported a reasonable belief that the caller had access to reliable information regarding White\u2019s illegal activity. <em>Id. </em>In effect, the <em>White </em>majority used the independent corroboration to satisfy the veracity factor and the \"special familiarity\u201d to satisfy the basis of knowledge factor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Once these factors were assessed under the totality of the circumstances test, the majority concluded that the Montgomery police had reasonable suspicion to make an investigative stop that originated from the anonymous phone call.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">C. FACTUAL COMPARISON OF <em>WHITE </em>AND <em>FAUCETT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">In <em>White, </em>an anonymous caller (1) identified Vanessa White, (2) knew the apartment from which she would be leaving, (3) specified the time, (4) described the vehicle, and (5) told police White\u2019s destination. For purposes of comparison, we borrow from the <em>White </em>opinion certain weaknesses noted in their findings. First, the police on surveillance observed White leave the apartment building but not apartment 235-C. Second, Corporal Davis did not state the exact time that was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to him for the time of White\u2019s departure. Rather, the majority concluded that White departed within the time frame predicted by the caller. Third, the police stopped White before she reached Dobey\u2019s Motel. <em>Id. </em>at 327. Although White drove the most direct route toward the motel, the finding is nonetheless weakened because the premature stop prevented police from corroborating this aspect of the caller\u2019s information.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In this case, we find the following facts to be critical: (1) the anonymous caller identified defendant, (2) the caller knew at the time of the call that defendant was en route, (3) the caller described the pickup truck with substantial accuracy, and (4) defendant\u2019s travel route was described in significant detail. Furthermore, Officer Roy of the Alpena Police Department corroborated defendant\u2019s identity through a lein search of the pickup truck\u2019s license plate, defendant\u2019s travel on Hobbs Drive as stated, and the predicted turn onto Grant Avenue before making the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Although the caller\u2019s information lacked a point of departure as in <em>White, </em>we believe that this information lacked relevance because at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the tipster called, defendant was already traveling toward Alpena. In addition, we do not believe that the caller\u2019s description of the pickup truck was fatally inaccurate. The caller described the vehicle as a \"newer model blue pickup, possibly a Datsun.\u201d Though the pickup truck turned out to be a Mazda, the lein search ensured that Officer Roy was following the pickup truck described by the anonymous caller. Finally, the caller in this case described defendant\u2019s travel route in detail rather than the final destination. We compare this to <em>White </em>where the police stopped the defendant <em>before </em>they verified her predicted destination. Moreover, the tipster in <em>White </em>did not describe the travel route to be taken by White.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">III. SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As noted earlier, the Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Terry, Brignoni-Ponce, Sharpe, Shabaz, supra. </em>From <em>Terry, </em>we learn that brief investigative stops short of arrest are permitted where police officers have a reasonable suspicion of ongoing criminal activity. <em>Adams </em>teaches that information from known informants may supply reasonable suspicion where it carries sufficient indicia of reliability. The <em>Cortez </em>holding made clear that the totality of the circumstances test was to be used in investigative stop cases. Moreover, the <em>Cortez </em>Court warned against overly technical reviews of a police officer\u2019s common-sense assessment of the probabilities that criminal activity was afoot. In <em>Gates, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the inflexible requirement that an anonymous tipster\u2019s information satisfy both the basis of knowledge prong and the veracity prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test in probable cause cases. Instead, these factors are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>be considered under the totality of the circumstances rather than independently. The <em>Sokolow </em>majority rejected the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals artificial dichotomy of \"personal characteristics\u201d facts and \"ongoing criminal activity\u201d facts. Again, all facts are to be considered in their totality. Borrowing from its predecessors, the <em>White </em>Court held that a case involving an <em>anonymous </em>tipster must be tested under the <em>totality of the circumstances </em>with a view to the question whether the tip carries with it <em>sufficient indicia of reliability </em>to support a <em>reasonable suspicion </em>of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The district court concluded that the information provided by the anonymous informant was insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">[Tjhere is no [police] corroboration except for the fact that the officer observed the Defendant Faucett in the general area . . . and that it was Merl Faucett and he was driving a blue late model pickup truck, although the wrong make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Similarly, in its opinion, the circuit court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">that the anonymous tip did not contain the necessary range of details concerning the Defendant\u2019s present and future actions. Herein, <em>the anonymous information was limited to a vehicle description </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number><em>and the general direction it was traveling. This limited information combined with the lack of corroboration on the part of the police including the fact that the make of the truck differed from that contained within the anonymous tip, </em>did not provide the reliability necessary to raise a reasonable suspicion. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Court of Appeals agreed with the district court and the circuit court that the anonymous caller only predicted two facts, namely: \"(1) that the defendant was driving a blue pickup truck and (2) that defendant\u2019s vehicle was traveling toward town by way of Hobbs Drive and possibly Grant Street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Although a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence is entitled to deference and is not to be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous, <em>Burrell, supra </em>at 448,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we find that the court\u2019s characterization of the anonymous call is not supported by the record. We read the record as indicating that the tipster identified defendant, knew that at the time of the call defendant was on the road, specified the route to be traveled, and described the pickup truck with substantial accuracy. Clearly none of these facts, standing alone, would support a finding of reasonable suspicion, however, it was error to disregard them in light of the totality of the circumstances analysis required by <em>White. </em>See <em>Burrell, supra. </em>Furthermore, a significant distinction between the facts in <em>White </em>and in this case is the timing of the anonymous phone call. In <em>White, </em>the Montgomery police had time to establish a surveillance. In this case, the phone call came after defendant had left with the narcot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ics. Officer Roy corroborated all information possible, namely, defendant\u2019s identity, vehicle, and travel route, before stopping him. We are persuaded that this timing made the informant\u2019s failure to reveal defendant\u2019s point of departure irrelevant. Furthermore, we believe that the timing of the phone call heightened the exigency of the situation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude that it was error to disregard these facts in assessing whether a reasonable suspicion existed under the totality of the circumstances. See <em>Burrell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Moreover, we take issue with certain characterizations of the facts made by all three courts. For example, the described travel route was more than a \"general description\u201d on the basis of the degree of its detail. In addition, the caller described the vehicle as a \"newer model blue pickup, possibly a Datsun.\u201d We believe that this described the vehicle with sufficient certainty. That the pickup truck turned out to be a Mazda does not substantially affect the accuracy of the statement, particularly in light of the caller\u2019s qualification of the vehicle\u2019s manufacturer by use of the word \"possibly.\u201d Furthermore, the circuit court\u2019s and the Court of Appeals apparent disregard of the police officer\u2019s identification of defendant and of the tipster\u2019s knowledge that defendant was en route runs afoul of the <em>Cortez </em>and <em>White </em>requirement that all facts must be considered in their totality. Even probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>facts not directly indicating ongoing criminal activity have some probative significance that may amount to a reasonable suspicion when considered in their totality. <em>Sokolow, supra </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Despite certain factual weaknesses in the <em>White </em>case, such as the failure to verify White\u2019s destination, the Supreme Court, applying the totality of the circumstances test, held that the quantum of evidence supported a finding of reasonable suspicion on the basis of an anonymous tip made reliable by a degree of independent police corroboration. We are persuaded that application of the <em>White </em>analysis to the facts of this case supports the conclusion that there was a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify an investigative stop.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The government\u2019s interest in the prevention of drug trafficking is a strong one. In contrast, a brief traffic stop on suspicion of a serious crime is not so intrusive as to persuade this Court that the stop was unreasonable. See <em>Terry </em>and <em>Brignoni-Ponce, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">We conclude that the tipster\u2019s information carried with it sufficient indicia of reliability under the totality of the circumstances to support a finding that Officer Roy had a reasonable suspicion to make the investigative stop. Because the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>below resolved this controversy at the investigative stop stage, they did not address other important issues. Specifically, the act of placing defendant in the patrol vehicle may have been a de facto arrest that would require probable cause.

Because police never saw the attach\u00e9 case until after the stop and consensual search of the vehicle, it cannot properly be included in the \"indicia of reliability\u201d test in support of a reasonable suspicion. See <em>Williams, </em>n 1 <em>supra </em>at 619, n 2 (\"[fjacts not known at the time of the seizure cannot be used to validate the actions of the police\u201d); <em>Terry, supra </em>at 22. It is clear, however, that the <em>White </em>majority weighed a related fact in its decision that would militate against a finding of reasonable suspicion by noting that White was \"carrying nothing in her hands\u201d when she entered her vehicle. <em>White, supra </em>at 327. We also note that the caller incorrectly described the contents of the attach\u00e9 case as cocaine rather than marijuana. This fact is also not appropriately considered in the decision whether the Montgomery police had a reasonable suspicion for the same reason. The relevant inquiry focuses upon the information known to the police officer at the time of the stop and whether it makes the related inference of criminality a reasonable one. See <em>Gates, supra </em>at 245, n 14 (\"[the Supreme Court] ha[s] never required that informants used by the police be infallible\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> We perceive a degree of confusion manifested in the preliminary transcript between the standard for an investigative stop, which requires a reasonable suspicion, and for a vehicle search conducted without a warrant, which requires probable cause. At one point, the district court narrowed what it perceived to be the sole issue to whether \"an anonymous tip from an undisclosed source ... is <em>sufficient probable cause </em>for the police officers <em>to make the stop </em>and the subsequent search.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, the district court applied the reasonable suspicion standard to the investigative stop and concluded that suppression was appropriate on this basis alone. Having stated the proper standard in its order, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred on this basis. See <em>Burrell, supra </em>at 448.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> See also <em>Cortez, supra </em>at 416 (citing with approval the ninth circuit\u2019s use of the clearly erroneous standard for review of a federal district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence for Fourth Amendment reasons).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> Searches of automobiles have been excepted from the general prohibition against searches without warrants as exigent circumstances.

In such cases, the automobile\u2019s mobility increases the risk of losing evidence if police officers must take the time to secure a warrant. Reasoning by analogy, we believe that there is a certain exigency in this case. Specifically, the timing of the phone call did not permit any time to establish surveillance of defendant, as was the case in <em>White. </em>We conclude that Officer Roy was permitted to take into account the possibility of losing defendant and any evidence in the pickup truck if he ended pursuit at the limits of his jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> We agree with the dissent that the degree to which an anonymous tip predicts future behavior is an important factor in the analysis of cases involving the issues addressed today.

The factual situations that courts face in these matters vary to the extent that it would be unrealistic to require facts substantially similar to <em>White </em>before a court could hold that an anonymous tip contains the requisite indicia of reliability. See, e.g., <em>United States v Walker, </em>805 F Supp 1112, 1117 (SD NY, 1992) (noting an inherent difference in types of crimes and the flexibility provided by the totality of the circumstances test for assessing the indicia of reliability of anonymous tips).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAH\">(dissenting).

I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The Alpena Police received an anonymous telephone call advising that Faucett was then transporting a quarter of a pound of either marijuana or cocaine in a \"newer model blue pickup, possibly a Datsun,\u201d and that he was traveling into Alpena on Werth Road and would turn onto Hobbs Drive and then onto either Third or Grant. The tipster also advised that the drugs would be concealed in a carrying case behind the front seat of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The circuit court suppressed evidence of drugs found during a subsequent stop, finding that the anonymous tip did not justify a reasonable suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>cion of criminal activity sufficient to support an investigative stop of Faucett\u2019s vehicle because it \"did not contain the necessary range of details concerning the Defendant\u2019s present and future actions.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We all appear to agree concerning the law. The minimum constitutional standard that the police and the anonymous tip must meet is established under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Alabama v White, </em>496 US 325; 110 S Ct 2412; 110 L Ed 2d 301 (1990), is controlling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The focus in <em>White </em>was whether the anonymous tip sufficiently <em>predicts future behavior </em>of the defendant, verified by the police, to justify the police in concluding that the tipster has special familiarity with the affairs of the defendant, and thus there is sufficient indicia of reliability of the tip to justify a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In <em>White, </em>Corporal Davis of the Montgomery Police Department received an anonymous telephone call informing him that Vanessa White (1) would be leaving apartment 235-C of the Lynwood Terrace Apartments at a particular time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>later that day, (2) would enter a brown Plymouth station wagon with a broken right taillight lens, (3) would drive to Dobey\u2019s Motel, and (4) would be in possession of an ounce of cocaine in a brown attach\u00e9 case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Davis and his partner watched the Lynwood Terrace Apartments and observed a woman leave building 235 in the time frame designated by the caller, enter the brown station wagon, and proceed in the most direct route possible to Dobey\u2019s Motel. White was stopped by another squad car at Davis\u2019 direction before actually reaching the motel. Before stopping White, the Montgomery Police Officers had corroborated the following predictions made by the anonymous tipster: (1) a woman would leave building 235 of the Lynwood Terrace Apartments during a designated time frame, (2) she would enter a specifically described vehicle, and (3) would drive to a specific destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In deciding on the sufficiency of the tip in <em>White, </em>the Court emphasized the caller\u2019s ability to predict White\u2019s <em>future behavior. </em>As the Court observed (quoting its prior opinion in <em>Illinois v Gates, </em>462 US 213; 103 S Ct 2317; 76 L Ed 2d 527 [1983]), \"the anonymous [tip] contained a range of details relating <em>not just to easily obtained facts and conditions existing at the time of the tip, but to future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted\u201d</em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">The fact that the officers found a car precisely matching the caller\u2019s description in front of the 235 building is an example of the former. Anyone could have \"predicted\u201d that fact because it was a condition presumably existing at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>call. <em>What was important was the caller\u2019s ability to predict respondent\u2019s future behavior, because it demonstrated inside information </em>\u2014 a <em>special familiarity with respondent\u2019s affairs. </em>The general public would have had no way of knowing that respondent would shortly leave the building, get in the described car, and drive the most direct route to Dobey\u2019s Motel.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In finding the tip sufficient to support the investigative stop under the totality of the circumstances \u2014 and the Court said that <em>White </em>was a \"close case\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 the Court focused on the tipster\u2019s prediction of White\u2019s future behavior that was verified by the police, and concluded that there was sufficient indicia of reliability to establish reasonable suspicion justifying the stop of her vehicle. It was the <em>veri\u00f1cation of the prediction of future behavior </em>that provided indicia of reliability and the police in <em>White </em>with reasonable suspicion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Because only a small number of people are generally privy to an individual\u2019s itinerary, it is reasonable for police to believe that a person with access to such information is likely to also have access to reliable information about that individual\u2019s illegal activities. <em>When significant aspects of the caller\u2019s predictions were veri\u00f1ed, there was reason to believe not only that the caller was honest but also that he was well informed, </em>at least well enough to justify the stop.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">To provide sufficient indicia of reliability to justify an investigative stop, the tip must indicate that the caller has special familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>defendant\u2019s affairs. Under <em>White, </em>such indicia arises from the tipster\u2019s ability to accurately predict the defendant\u2019s future behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The anonymous tip in this case did not contain the same level of indicia of reliability, arising from the verification of prediction of future behavior, as did the tip in <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The tip to the Alpena Police Department was made while Faucett was already driving into Alpena on Werth Road in his \"newer model blue pickup, possibly a Datsun.\u201d Thus, the only prediction of future behavior contained in the tip that could possibly have been verified by the police was that Faucett would turn onto Hobbs Road, and then onto either Grant or Third. The only prediction actually verified by the police was that Faucett would turn from Hobbs \u2014 where he was first observed \u2014 onto either Grant or Third.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The majority relies on the following as critical to its conclusion that the anonymous tip to the Alpena Police was sufficient to justify the stop in this case: \"(1) the anonymous caller identified defendant, (2) the caller knew at the time of the call that defendant was en route, (3) the caller described the pickup truck with substantial accuracy, and (4) defendant\u2019s travel route was described in significant detail.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Evaluating the majority\u2019s four \"critical facts,\u201d there was not sufficient indicia of reliability to justify a stop in this case. Although the officers verified that it was Faucett in the truck and that the truck appeared to have been traveling along Werth Road,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this part of the tip, the first three of the four \"critical facts\u201d relied on by the majority, did not provide indicia of reliability under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>principles set forth in <em>White.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The tipster\u2019s statement that Faucett was traveling in his blue pickup into Alpena on Werth Road did not indicate that the caller had inside information, and is more properly characterized as a condition existing at the time of the tip, observable by any member of the general public.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">This leaves what is left of the fourth \"critical fact,\u201d namely, that Faucett would turn from Hobbs Drive onto either Third or Grant. And thus the majority concludes that the Alpena police had reasonable suspicion to make an investigative stop of Faucett\u2019s truck simply because the police had verified that Faucett would turn from Hobbs Drive \u2014where Faucett was first observed by the Alpena Police \u2014 onto either Third or Grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Under the principles set forth in <em>White, </em>this was not sufficient indicia of the reliability of the tip.
