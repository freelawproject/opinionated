The referent\u2019s first contact with the nss, in November 1990, reported \"soft signs\u201d of possible sexual abuse: complaints by the older child that her private areas hurt,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> blood on her sheets, and the referent\u2019s observations that \u2022the child\u2019s vagina was red and swollen. Because some of the instances described occurred well before the report and because they were not conclusive signs of child abuse, the referent was instructed to contact the nss if further indications of abuse arose. Shortly thereafter, the referent notified a social worker to report additional concerns. And in January 1991, during an interview with the dss regarding her concerns, the referent indicated that the child had spontaneously declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\"Daddy put his finger in my pookey.\u201d The dss, working with the Family Advocacy Office of the K.L Sawyer Air Force Base, then scheduled a physical examination of the children and notified the respondents. Following a problematic examination indicating recurrent manipulation of the child\u2019s rectum,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the children were placed in foster care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The probate court acquired jurisdiction over both children following a jury finding in an adjudicative proceeding. The foster care of the children was continued in the subsequent dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Respondents appealed the finding of jurisdiction on various grounds. The Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the probate court and remanded for a new trial. 193 Mich App 652; 485 NW2d 110 (1992). In an order entered July 28, 1992, this Court granted the application for leave to appeal limited to the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(1) whether the respondents had a right to confront their daughter at the adjudication stage of these proceedings and, if so, whether that right was violated by the special arrangements approved by the court, and (2) whether the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of respondent Carol Brock\u2019s psychologist and physician.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Respondents first contend that their constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tional rights were violated when video depositions of their older child, then almost four years old, were shown to the jury in lieu of live testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Respondents maintain that their right of confrontation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was violated because they were denied the right to cross-examine the child during the video deposition, as well as to confront her face to face.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">At the hearing regarding special arrangements for testimony of the older child, Lieutenant Robin Presley, a clinical social worker with the Air Force, testified that the child would not be capable of responding to questions asked by attorneys or by the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lieutenant Presley also testified that the child would be unable to testify in the courtroom because of trauma stemming from her lack of understanding of the physical aspects of the courtroom, the various people in the courtroom, the consequences of what she would be saying, and the courtroom vocabulary. She further testified that it would be traumatic for the child to be confronted with the alleged perpetrators, her parents, and that this trauma of a courtroom appearance would impair later treatment. Moreover, Lieutenant Presley indicated that she believed that the presence of attorneys during an interview and any cross-examination would also be traumatic and impair further treatment. She opined that questioning by a person skilled in interviewing children would elicit the most complete response_</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Finding Lieutenant Presley\u2019s testimony sufficient to establish that the child would suffer psychological harm that might also impair future treatment were she ordered either to testify in court with the parties present or to testify in the courtroom with the jury present but the parents absent, the court, pursuant to MCL 712A.17b(9); MSA 27.3178(598.17b)(9),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ordered the child\u2019s testimony to be taken by videotape deposition. Pursuant to MCR 5.923(E),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court also found that in order to present the most complete testimony to the finder of fact, an impartial examiner would conduct the deposition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The Court of Appeals held that in the absence of cross-examination, as well as a face-to-face confrontation, respondents\u2019 federal and state due process rights were violated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Child protective proceedings are not criminal proceedings. MCL 712A. 1(1); MSA 27.3178(598.1X1). The purpose of child protective proceedings is the protection of the child, while criminal cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>focus on the determination of the guilt or innocence of the defendant. <em>People v Gates, </em>434 Mich 146, 161; 452 NW2d 627 (1990). The juvenile code is intended to protect children from unfit homes rather than to punish their parents. <em>In re Jacobs, </em>433 Mich 24, 41; 444 NW2d 789 (1989). Furthermore, the rules applicable in child protective proceedings also differ from those applicable in criminal cases. <em>Gates, supra </em>at 157.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, \"[i]n all <em>criminal prosecutions, </em>the accused shall enjoy the right to ... be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d because the present case is not a criminal case, we conclude that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Child protective proceedings are generally divided into two phases: the adjudicative and the dispositional. The adjudicative phase determines whether the probate court may exercise jurisdiction over the child. If the court acquires jurisdiction, the dispositional phase determines what action, if any, will be taken on behalf of the child. Substantial effort is expended to improve the home situation in order to return children to the custody of their parents if at all possible. See <em>Jacobs, supra </em>at 38. Respondents may demand a jury determination of the facts in the adjudicative phase, but no jury is allowed at the dispositional hearings. MCR 5.911. To acquire jurisdiction, the factfinder must determine by a preponderance of the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the child comes within the statutory requirements of MCL 712A.2; MSA 27.3178(598.2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> MCR 5.972(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">It is well established that parents have a significant interest in the companionship, care, custody, and management of their children. This interest has been characterized as an element of \"liberty\u201d to be protected by due process. <em>Reist v Bay Circuit Judge, </em>396 Mich 326, 342; 241 NW2d 55 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Clearly any legal adjustment of their mutual rights and obligations affects a fundamental human relationship. The rights at stake are \"protected\u201d and encompassed within the meaning of the term \"liberty\u201d as used in the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Hence, the question at issue is what procedural due process requirements are implicated in the adjudicative phase of a child protective proceeding wherein a court may acquire jurisdiction over a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Although due process often requires confrontation and cross-examination, these are not absolute requirements, <em>Willner v Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, </em>373 US 96, 103-104; 83 S Ct 1175; 10 L Ed 2d 224 (1963) (Goldberg, J., concurring at 106), even in Sixth Amendment analysis. <em>Coy v Iowa, </em>487 US 1012, 1020; 108 S Ct 2798; 101 L Ed 2d 857 (1988) (\"rights conferred by the Confrontation Clause are not absolute, and may give way to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>other important interests\u201d); <em>People v Kasben, </em>158 Mich App 252, 255; 404 NW2d 723 (1987) (the right of confrontation may yield to other compelling interests). <em>Maryland v Craig, </em>497 US 836; 110 S Ct 3157; 111 L Ed 2d 666 (1990), establishes that where there are particularized findings of necessity, face-to-face confrontation is not necessary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, the narrow issue presented in this appeal is whether in the absence of face-to-face confrontation due process requires an opportunity to cross-examine during an adjudicative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Respondents contend that their right of due process<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> includes the right to confront the witnesses against them in an adjudicative proceeding. Although we do not hold that such confrontation is unnecessary in every case, we are persuaded that the present factual circumstances support the probate court\u2019s determination that the videotape deposition of the older child by an impartial examiner did not deprive respondents of their constitutional right of confrontation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\"Due process applies to any adjudication of important rights.\u201d <em>In re LaFlure, </em>48 Mich App 377, 385; 210 NW2d 482 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Procedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \"liberty\u201d or \"property\u201d interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\"[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>[Mathews v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 332, 334; 96 S Ct 893; 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Due process requires fundamental fairness, which is determined in a particular situation first by \"considering any relevant precedents and then by assessing the several interests that are at stake.\u201d <em>Lassiter v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>452 US 18, 25; 101 S Ct 2153; 68 L Ed 2d 640 (1981). Generally, three factors will be considered to determine what is required by due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. <em>[Mathews, supra </em>at 335.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">An adjudicative proceeding determines whether the probate court may acquire jurisdiction over a child. Hence, the liberty interest at stake is the parents\u2019 interest in the management of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The procedures used in adjudicative hearings protect the parents from the risk of erroneous deprivation of this interest. Upon a finding of jurisdiction, the probate court has several options, one of which is to return the children to their parents. Not every adjudicative hearing results in removal of custody. <em>In re Perry, </em>148 Mich App 601; 385 NW2d 287 (1986). Moreover, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>permanently terminate respondents\u2019 parental rights, further hearings would be required, and the statutory elements for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. MCL 712A.19b(3); MSA 27.3178(598.19b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the added procedural safeguard, here the opportunity to cross-examine the child, would aid in the truth-seeking goal of the adjudicative hearing. Lieutenant Presley testified that the older child would be incapable of communicating if attorneys questioned her and that she might be traumatized presently and in her future treatment if forced to participate in cross-examination. The probate judge assessed these factors and determined that in the interest of receiving the most complete testimony, the child would not be cross-examined. During the video depositions, respondents\u2019 counsel were able to observe the child through a one-way window. Moreover, counsel were allowed to submit questions to the examiner before and during the deposition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although face-to-face confrontation and cross-examination ensure the integrity of the factfinding process by \"subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact,\u201d <em>Craig, supra </em>at 845, where confrontation causes the child \"significant emotional distress,\u201d the truth-seeking goal of the Confrontation Clause may be thwarted. <em>Id. </em>at 857.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Finally, the interest of the state as <em>parens pa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>triae </em>is for the welfare of the child.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the fiscal or administrative burden of allowing respondents\u2019 counsel to cross-examine the child may be slight, the governmental interest in protecting her from trauma is significant. Furthermore, the state\u2019s interest in protecting the child is impeded by error in the factfinding process. Therefore, the procedure designed by the probate court to secure the most accurate testimony furthers the governmental interest in protecting the welfare of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Supreme Court of Rhode Island has similarly addressed due process requirements in the context of a child dependency hearing. <em>In re James A, </em>505 A2d 1386 (RI, 1986). In <em>James A, </em>the respondent father was accused of sexually molesting his two minor sons. The elder son, then age five, was found to be a competent witness, but began crying when the judge began asking him questions in the presence of counsel. The judge cleared the chambers and continued questioning in counsel\u2019s absence. Counsel were permitted the opportunity to submit questions for cross-examination after the transcript of the child\u2019s interview with the judge was read back to them. The father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>asserted on appeal that the court-prescribed procedure of interviewing the child without affording the respondent the right of confrontation denied him due process of law. The court disagreed. It first recognized that the Sixth Amendment did not guarantee the respondent the right of confrontation or cross-examination in this noncriminal proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 1390. Moreover, whether due process necessitates the opportunity of cross-examination is determined in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>The court noted that in child abuse proceedings, \"the rights of parents are a most essential consideration, but we further recognize that the best interests and welfare of the child outweigh all other considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The son\u2019s testimony was invaluable because of his direct knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">However, owing to his tender years [five] and the nature of the acts to which he was subjected, the trial justice decided that a routine, in-court examination of the child could result in severe psychological trauma. <em>[Id. </em>at 1391.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The court then found that balancing the best interests of the child with the interests of the parents and the state supports the judge\u2019s action. Id.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Respondents have an important liberty interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>in the management of their children that is protected by due process. However, the child\u2019s welfare is primary in child protective proceedings. The probate court specifically found that the child in this case would be traumatized if forced to testify with counsel present. Moreover, she would be incapable of testifying because of that trauma. The probate court established arrangements for the child\u2019s testimony designed to permit her to testify as completely as possible. Therefore, prohibiting respondents\u2019 counsel from cross-examining her did not significantly increase the risk of an erroneous deprivation of respondents\u2019 liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Because the spirit of confrontation and cross-examination could only be achieved by alternative, nontraditional procedures, deviation from traditional practices should be allowed. In this initial phase wherein the court acquires jurisdiction in order to attempt to alleviate the problems in the home so that the children and the parents can be reunited, we find no abuse of discretion where the probate judge makes particularized findings of necessity requiring testimony of the child victim outside the presence of her parents and their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Respondent Carol Brock next contends that the probate court erred in denying her motion to exclude the testimony of her treating psychologist and psychiatrist. Mrs. Brock asserted her physician-psychologist/ patient privilege pursuant to MCL 600.2157; MSA 27A.2157 and MCL 330.1750; MSA 14.800(750). The privilege would generally protect information regarding her treatment for emotional difficulties. The probate judge indicated that although respondent initially authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>release to the guardian ad litem, the information was. intended for the limited purpose of aiding the guardian in his determination whether to return the younger child to Mrs. Brock\u2019s care. The court therefore refused to allow the testimony of the treating doctors on the basis of waiver of the physician-psychologist/patient privilege.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The trial court found, however, that the privilege was abrogated by \u00a7 11 of the Child Protection Law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">Any legally recognized privileged communication except that between attorney and client is abrogated and shall neither constitute grounds for excusing a report otherwise required to be made nor for excluding evidence in <em>a </em>civil child protective proceeding resulting from a report made pursuant to this act. [MCL 722.631; MSA 25.248(11).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, finding that the privilege was not abrogated by \u00a7 11. 193 Mich App 666. The Court held the testimony inadmissible because the report of suspected abuse was not made by a person required to make such a report under \u00a7 3 of the Child Protection Law, MCL 722.623; MSA 25.248(3). Furthermore, the testimony was not evidence of neglect or abuse, but rather merely indicated the emotional difficulties suffered by Mrs. Brock. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Prior analyses of \u00a7 11 of the Child Protection Law, MCL 722.631; MSA 25.248(11), can be construed as supportive of the Court of Appeals decision.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has found that \u00a7 11 does not abrogate the physician-patient privilege where there is no indication that the physician met with respondent as a result of any action taken pursuant to the Child Protection Law. <em>In re Atkins, </em>112 Mich App 528, 543; 316 NW2d 477 (1982). The Court has also delineated two circumstances where \u00a7 11 would apply. <em>In re Tedder, </em>150 Mich App 688, 702; 389 NW2d 149 (1986).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">[Section] 11 abrogates a privilege only where a report is required under the act or where the communications subject to a privilege are offered as evidence of neglect or abuse in a child protective proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">However, the Court of Appeals has also opined that where a child protective proceeding results from a report of suspected child abuse, the privilege is abrogated because the case was a proceeding under the Child Protection Law resulting from a report under MCL 722.621 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.248(1) <em>et seq. In re Rogers, </em>160 Mich App 500; 409 NW2d 486 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">We disagree with the Court of Appeals reasoning in the present case that the identity of the person initiating the child protective proceeding is determinative of whether \u00a7 11 applies. We also disagree with the Court of Appeals reliance on <em>Tedder, supra, </em>to conclude that the testimony of respondent\u2019s physician and psychologist was inadmissible because it indicated only emotional difficulties rather than evidence of abuse or neglect. 193 Mich App 666.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARy\">According to the plain language of \u00a7 11, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>physician-patient privilege is abrogated in two instances. The first clearly does not apply in the present case: where a report is otherwise required to be made. Respondents\u2019 neighbor was not required to report her suspicions of child abuse pursuant to \u00a7 3 of the Child Protection Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The second involves evidence in a civil child protection proceeding resulting from a report made pursuant to this act. We disagree with the Court of Appeals finding that this provision does not apply because the child protective proceeding did not result from a report required to be made pursuant to the Child Protection Law. 193 Mich App 666. The Court of Appeals does not recognize that \"a report made pursuant to this act\u201d also includes a report made under \u00a7 4 of the Child Protection Law, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">In addition to those persons required to report child abuse or neglect under section 3, any person, including a child, who has reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or neglect may report the matter to the department or a law enforcement agency. [MCL 722.624; MSA 25.248(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Therefore, the report by respondents\u2019 neighbor falls within \u00a7 4 and is considered \"a report made pursuant to this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">However, this second phrase is open to two distinct interpretations. If the phrase \"in a civil child protection proceeding\u201d is considered merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>qualifier of \"evidence,\u201d the privilege shall be abrogated where the evidence results from a report made pursuant to this act. The evidence in the present case would therefore be inadmissible because the treatment of respondent, and therefore the testimony of her doctors, did not result from any action taken pursuant to the Child Protection Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">If, on the other hand, the entire phrase, \"in a civil child protection proceeding resulting from a report made pursuant to this act,\u201d qualifies \"evidence,\u201d then the privilege shall be abrogated where the civil child protection proceeding results from a report made pursuant to this act. The testimony would therefore be admissible because, as explained above, the report initiating the dss investigation falls under \u00a7 4 of the Child Protection Law, and therefore the child protection proceeding resulted from a report made \"pursuant to this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We are persuaded by this latter interpretation of \u00a711. The physician-patient privilege is a statutory creation in derogation of common law, and hence will be narrowly construed. <em>La Count v Von Platen-Fox Co, </em>243 Mich 250; 220 NW 697 (1928); <em>Yount v Nat\u2019l Bank of Jackson, </em>327 Mich 342, 347; 42 NW2d 110 (1950). Exceptions to statutory privileges should be broadly construed. <em>People v Love, </em>425 Mich 691, 700; 391 NW2d 738 (1986). Moreover, the purpose of a child protective proceeding is to protect the welfare of the child. <em>Gates, supra </em>at 161; <em>In re Baby X, </em>97 Mich App 111, 120; 293 NW2d 736 (1980). It is in the best interests of all parties for the factfinder to be in possession of all relevant information regarding the welfare of the child. The trial court determined that the medical information relevant to the petition for jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tion would be admissible. We find no error in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In summary, we reverse the Court of Appeals decision and uphold the orders, of the probate court. The special arrangements established by the probate court to elicit the most complete response by the older child did not violate her parents\u2019 procedural due process rights. Where the probate court makes particularized findings that indicate that a child would suffer psychological trauma if forced to testify in court or if cross-examined by attorneys, the court may allow an impartial examiner to conduct a video interview in order to gather the most accurate and complete information.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Furthermore, the probate court did not err in allowing Mrs. Brock\u2019s physician and psychologist to testify regarding her history of emotional difficulties.

The \"initial phase wherein the [probate] court acquires jurisdiction\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of a child is critical.

The Court has observed that it has been \"zealous to protect these rights from erosion. It has spoken out <em>not only in criminal cases, . . </em>. but also in <em>all types of cases </em>where administrative . . . actions were under scrutiny.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)_</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>After noting that both confrontation and cross-examination assure the integrity of the fact-finding process, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Coy v </em>Iowa, 487 US 1012, 1020; 108 S Ct 2798; 101 L Ed 2d 857 (1988),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">[F]ace-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset the truthful rape victim or abused child; but by the same token it may confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult. It is a truism that constitutional protections have costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Although <em>Coy </em>was a criminal prosecution, the rationale underlying the foregoing statement applies as well to the right of cross-examination in this case where the child made inconsistent statements at various times, including during the two video depositions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">No case has been cited in which any court, in parental rights termination proceedings, has held that parents may be deprived of cross-examination on the basis of a <em>prediction </em>that the child will be traumatized by cross-examination, especially a prediction in the form of an opinion so clearly grounded in theory and not in experience. The Court of Appeals observed that \"Lieutenant Presley stated that although she had never seen a child witness testify, she based her conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>complainant would suffer psychologically on information she had accumulated <em>as a student.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Lt. Presley was not an independent expert, but one of the persons who first questioned the child after a report was made to the authorities that she had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Lt. Presley\u2019s testimony shows that her views were based on general assumptions about who is qualified to question a child alleged to have been sexually abused. Her assumptions are similar to the assumptions of the Iowa Legislature in enacting a statutory presumption that child victims of sexual abuse cannot endure in-court confrontation with their alleged abusers. That assumption was disapproved in <em>Coy v Iowa, supra, </em>where the United States Supreme Court said that there must be a showing of harm to the particular child by in-court confrontation before alternative out-of-court procedures may be employed to question the child. The requirement of a specific showing of harm was reiterated by the Court in <em>Maryland v Craig, </em>497 US 836; 110 S Ct 3157; 111 L Ed 2d 666 (1990). Carefully read, Lt. Presley\u2019s testimony is more general than it is specific respecting the child in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In the case, cited by the majority, claimed to be factually most in point, <em>In re James A, </em>505 A2d 1386, 1391 (RI, 1986), \"the attorneys were asked to leave <em>only when it was obvious </em>that the child had become emotional.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, the probate court ruled, before the child took the stand, that the parents\u2019 lawyers could not cross-examine her. Because the court ruled before the child testified, there was no evidence that she had in fact been traumatized by direct examination by a lawyer who was an advocate for the people or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>cross-examination by a lawyer who is an advocate for the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In this regard, it is noteworthy that, in the instant case, the child, at the first interview, \"denied that anyone had ever touched or hurt her pookey.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After the child had begun \"therapy,\u201d the probate court ordered a second interview, during which, the Court of Appeals said, there was \"prodding.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of that pretrial history, the state cannot properly be heard to express concern, absent evidence other than an opinion grounded in theory, that lawyers<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> would necessarily traumatize the child by questioning her.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The parents are entitled, as an aspect of due process, to cross-examination by their lawyer, an advocate, not by an \"impartial\u201d \"trained\u201d examiner, unless possibly if there were evidence that cross-examination by a lawyer had <em>in fact </em>resulted in the child being traumatized or unable to go on. And even then, the \"trained\u201d examiner should be one selected by the parents, not a \"trained\u201d examiner selected by the court. And, of course, paid for by the state when the parents are indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The parents are entitled at least to cross-examination by a \"trained\u201d examiner who is an advocate for the parents, no less an advocate for the parents than the trained persons who before the trial \"examined\u201d the child for the state, who testified at the trial as advocates for the state. Cross-examination by an \"impartial\u201d person, a person who is not supposed to be an advocate, does not comport with the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Finally, for the reasons set forth in the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I would affirm its decision that the child protection law<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> does not abrogate the physician-patient privilege other than where a report of child abuse has been made pursuant to that law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> <em>In re Cornet, </em>422 Mich 274; 373 NW2d 536 (1985), adopting the clearly erroneous standard of appellate review for parental rights termination proceedings.

The Court concluded that a parent\u2019s interest in a child was \"fundamental\u201d and therefore protected by the Due Process Clause.
