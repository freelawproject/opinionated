On April 14, 1987, plaintiff Brown Plumbing and Heating, Inc., a properly licensed plumbing and heating contractor, entered a written contract with Primus Energy Homes, a general contractor in the business of building homes, to provide plumbing labor and materials on a residential construction job. Primus fraudulently informed plaintiff that it was licensed and provided a license number belonging to a licensed, but unrelated, construction company, Mayflower Construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff never asked to see the license or an identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">When Primus became insolvent and failed to pay the subcontractors for the work completed, claims of lien were filed and foreclosure proceedings were begun on the property. The Homeowner Construction Lien Recovery Fund was named as a party. MCL 570.1203(4); MSA 26.316(203X4). The homeowners filed an affidavit stating that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>paid Primus for the work completed, and thereby relieved themselves of liability. MCL 570.1203(l)(a); MSA 26.316(203)(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Plaintiff then resorted to seek payment through the Recovery Fund. MCL 570.1201 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 26.316(201) <em>et seq. </em>The fund refused to pay plaintiff because of plaintiff\u2019s failure to show compliance with the prerequisites for recovery under the act, namely, that Primus was a licensed residential contractor as required under Michigan law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Both the plaintiff and the fund filed motions for summary disposition. The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion, holding that the plaintiff had substantially complied with the act and, therefore, was entitled to recover from the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The fund appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Noting that one of the dual purposes of the Construction Lien Act is to protect the rights of those who perform labor or provide materials for the improvement of real property, the Court of Appeals affirmed. The Court stated that because the act is remedial in nature, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>should be liberally interpreted in favor of lien claimants. As a result, the court held that substantial compliance with \u00a7 203(3)(h) is sufficient to permit recovery from the fund. 190 Mich App 709, 714; 476 NW2d 657 (1991). We granted leave to appeal, 440 Mich 889 (1992), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Section 302 of the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">This act is declared to be a remedial statute, and shall be liberally construed to secure the beneficial results, intents, and purposes of this act. Substantial compliance with the provisions of this act shall be sufficient <em>for the validity of the construction liens </em>provided for in this act, and to give jurisdiction to the court to enforce them. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We find this provision to be clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The express language provides that substantial compliance is only applicable in two aspects: 1) the perfection of the construction liens provided for in part 1, and 2) to give the court jurisdiction. Although the first sentence of the section states that the entire act is to be construed liberally, the language of the second sentence is qualified to apply in only the two instances described above and in no way suggests that substantial compliance is sufficient to collect from the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We find it persuasive that the Legislature provided express language demonstrating its intention that the substantial compliance language should apply only to part 1 of the act. Part 1 of the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>establishes the procedures to acquire an enforceable construction lien on a particular piece of property; in other words, part 1 establishes the procedures to acquire a \"valid construction lien.\u201d Part 2 creates the Homeowner Construction Lien Recovery Fund and enumerates the requirements that must be established to collect from the fund. Therefore, by not referring to the fund or recovery from the fund, and only referencing \"the validity of the construction liens,\u201d the actual language of \u00a7 302 expressly limits its application to part 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The plaintiff argues that the placement of \u00a7 302 in part 3 is evidence that the Legislature intended that \u00a7 302 apply to the entire act. It is also possible that the Legislature, with the addition of the recovery fund and the repositioning of the sections that made up the previous act, did not consider the application of current \u00a7 302.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where the Legislature placed \u00a7 302 may have been more a matter of utility. For example, in arranging the various provisions of a statute, particularly, as in this case, where former provisions become part of a greater statutory scheme, it is reasonable to put the substance of the statute in the beginning and place the interpretive provisions at the end.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">If \u00a7 302 would have appeared in part 1, it would be beyond the pale of argument to which part it applies. The fact that \u00a7 302 is not found in part 1 should not defeat the unambiguous language. We think that in this case, where it is a question of the actual language versus where the language appears, the actual language is paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The dissent indicates that parts 1 and 3 of the act borrow substantially from the former mechanics\u2019 lien act. In fact, \"[virtually all of the sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>of the former mechanics\u2019 lien act are now contained within parts 1 and 3 of the Construction Lien Act.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 190. Part 2 was a new creation with the enactment of this statute. The dissent quotes the original version of the current \u00a7 302 from the mechanics\u2019 lien act of 1897. <em>Post </em>at 193. The fact that that section has remained essentially the same for almost a century demonstrates that its meaning has not changed. Because parts 1 and 3 are taken from the former mechanics\u2019 lien act, it is obvious that \u00a7 302 applies to those parts. The question is whether \u00a7 302 applies to part 2, which enumerates specific criteria for recovering from the fund. We think it can be argued with equal force that if the Legislature had intended to apply \u00a7 302 to the newly created part 2, it would have amended the language that has existed for nearly one hundred years to expressly provide for its new application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the Legislature did not amend the language confirms that its meaning and application have not changed, and, therefore, \u00a7 302 only applies to parts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Because of our conclusion that the substantial compliance provision of \u00a7 302 does not apply to part 2, the question now becomes whether the decision by the Court of Appeals can be based on the first sentence of \u00a7 302. While we acknowledge that the liberal construction language of the first sentence applies to the entire act, we nonetheless find that liberality cannot and should not nullify a clear and unambiguous requirement._</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>We take notice of the actual language of \u00a7 203(3)(h):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">A person who seeks recovery from the fund <em>shall </em>establish <em>all </em>of the following: . . . That the contractor or the subcontractor, with whom the person claiming the construction lien contracted with, is licensed if required by law to be licensed. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">One cannot liberally construe this provision to provide relief to this particular plaintiff without destroying the meaning of the statute. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the general contractor was licensed at any time during the relationship between the parties. The provision does not say that the claimant shall take steps to determine if, or that he subjectively believe that, the other party is licensed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that a liberal construction of \u00a7 203(3)(h) does not save the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In conclusion, because part 2 of the act does not deal with the validity of construction liens, its provisions cannot be tested by a substantial compliance standard. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-8\">Levin, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\"> Cruz Ortiz, a co-owner of Primus, misrepresented to the homeowners that he had a builder\u2019s license and used the license number belonging to Mayflower Construction to obtain building permits for the job.

The following sections provide an example: \u00a7 203(l)(c) (cooperating in the defense of the fund), \u00a7 203(3)(a) (entitled to a construction lien), \u00a7 203(3)(e) (not colluding to obtain payment from the fund), and \u00a7203(3)(g) (making a reasonable effort to obtain payment from the contractor or subcontractor).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b306-9\">Mallett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">We dissent from the majority opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ion and would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals. The majority holds that the substantial compliance language of \u00a7302 applies only to the details for perfecting a construction lien under part 1 of the act and not to claims against the fund under part 2. As a result, complete adherence to the requirements set forth in \u00a7 203(3) is a condition precedent to recovery from the fund. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Enacted in 1980, the Construction Lien Act seeks to achieve a dual protective purpose. It aspires to protect not only a lien claimant\u2019s right to payment for wages or materials, but also the landowner from multiple payments for the same services. <em>Fischer-Flack, Inc v Churchfield, </em>180 Mich App 606; 447 NW2d 813 (1989). The preamble to the act sets forth its broadly defined purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">An act to establish, protect, and enforce by lien the rights of persons performing labor or providing material or equipment for the improvement of real property; to provide for certain defenses with respect thereto; to establish a homeowner construction lien recovery fund within the department of licensing and regulation; to provide for the powers and duties of certain state oflicers; to provide for the assessments of certain occupations; to prescribe penalties; and to repeal certain acts and parts of acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Although a preamble is not to be considered authority for construing an act, it is useful for interpreting its purpose and scope. <em>Malcolm v East Detroit, </em>437 Mich 132, 143; 468 NW2d 479 (1991); 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 47.04, pp 145-150.</p>\n<p id=\"AtJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The fundamental rules of statutory construction are instructive in determining the applicability of \u00a7 302. On several occasions, this Court has held that where the provisions of a statute are clear and unambiguous, they are to be applied as written. <em>Gilroy v General Motors Corp (After Remand), </em>438 Mich 330, 341; 475 NW2d 271 (1991); <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Products, </em>419 Mich 1, 9; 345 NW2d 184 (1984). When construing statutory provisions, the court\u2019s task is to discover and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. The legislative intent is to be derived from the actual language of a statute, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary. <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368; 429 NW2d 169 (1988). Where ambiguity exists, a court must give the statute a valid and reasonable construction that will reconcile any inconsistencies and give effect to all of its parts. <em>Girard v Wagenmaker, </em>437 Mich 231, 238; 470 NW2d 372 (1991); <em>Aikens v Dep\u2019t of Conservation, </em>387 Mich 495, 499; 198 NW2d 304 (1972). A court must also ascertain \"the evil or mischief which it is designed to remedy, and will apply a reasonable construction which best accomplishes the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Pittsfield Charter Twp v Saline, </em>103 Mich App 99, 105; 302 NW2d 608 (1981). Remedial statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the persons intended to be benefitted by the statute. <em>Bierbusse v Farmers Ins Group, </em>84 Mich App 34, 37; 269 NW2d 297 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">With these precepts of statutory construction in mind, under the Construction Lien Act, a lien claimant such as plaintiff Brown Plumbing must establish several elements before recovering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>defendant fund.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among the requirements is \u00a7 203(3)(h),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">Subject to section 204,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] a person who has recorded a claim of lien and who is precluded from recovering a construction lien under subsection (1) may recover from the fund the amount for which the lien is established. A person who seeks recovery from the fund shall establish all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(h) That the contractor or subcontractor, with whom the person claiming the construction lien contracted with, is licensed if required by law to be licensed.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Section 302 of the act provides a self-contained construction directive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">This act is declared to be a remedial statute, and shall be liberally construed to secure the beneficial results, intents, and purposes of this act. <em>Substantial compliance with the provisions of this act shall be sufficient for the validity of the construction liens provided for in this act, </em>and to give jurisdiction to the court to enforce them. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We are asked to ascertain whether the substantial compliance language of \u00a7 302 applies to \u00a7 203(3)(h) of the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The Construction Lien Act is separated into three parts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Parts 1 and 3 of the act borrow substantially from the former mechanics\u2019 lien act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, following the repeal of the mechanics\u2019 lien act, the Legislature provided a \"disposition table\u201d that indicates the corresponding sections in the Construction Lien Act. Virtually all of the sections of the former mechanics\u2019 lien act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are now contained within parts 1 and 3 of the Construction Lien Act. Thus, part 3 of the Construction Lien Act, including \u00a7 302, was a substantial part of the original mechanics\u2019 lien laws, which consisted of particularized procedures and qualifications for recovery of a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Part 2 of the act was an entirely new set of provisions at the time of the act\u2019s adoption in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>1982. Part 2 established the defendant homeowner lien recovery fund and promulgated rules and procedures for its administration. The fund, financed by periodic assessments on various residential licensees, was created within the Department of Licensing and Regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fund created defenses against an action to foreclose a residential construction lien. Thus, while a construction lien may be entirely valid, homeowners may protect themselves from multiple payments by filing an affidavit indicating that they paid the contractor and cooperated with the department in the defense of the fund, and have not colluded with any other person to obtain payment from the fund.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More importantly for present purposes, defendant fund also provides a remedy for lien claimants who would otherwise be precluded from recovering a construction lien because of the homeowner\u2019s protection under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Given the imprecise language of \u00a7 302 and the unique statutory history of the act, it becomes quite difficult to discern the Legislature\u2019s intention from the plain language of the statute. Clearly, \u00a7 203(3)(h) was designed to protect the conscientious tradesmen from fraudulent contractors. In an attempt to achieve this purpose, this Court should apply a liberal construction to \u00a7 302 and find that it is applicable to part 2 of the act. If the Legislature intended that \u00a7302 only apply to the procedures for perfecting a construction lien under part 1, then it would have placed \u00a7 302 in part 1 of the act or provided language expressly limiting the application of \u00a7 302 to part 1. We believe that the placement of \u00a7 302 in part 3 of the act was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>than \"a matter of utility\u201d;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it was a deliberate, affirmative decision on the part of the Legislature, evidencing its intention that \u00a7 302 be applicable throughout the act, including part 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">A statutory provision should be read in its entirety and in connection with the rest of the statute, and each provision of an act is to be read with reference to every other provision so as to produce an harmonious whole. <em>In re Forfeiture of $5,264, </em>432 Mich 242, 251; 439 NW2d 246 (1989); <em>Detroit v Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n, </em>408 Mich 410, 481; 294 NW2d 68 (1980). In other words, due consideration must be given to all sections to produce an harmonious and consistent enactment of the entire statute. <em>Preston v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>190 Mich App 491; 476 NW2d 455 (1991). Reading the Construction Lien Act in its entirety, it is clear that \u00a7 302 should be made applicable to. the requirements for collection from the fund, including \u00a7 203(3)(h).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant urges this Court to consider a line of cases that illustrate the development of the substantial compliance doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, substantial compliance is not a judicially created doctrine. In the mechanics\u2019 lien act of 1897,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the original version of the current \u00a7 302 appears in \u00a7 27._</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>This act is hereby declared to be a remedial statute and to be construed liberally to secure the beneficial results, intents and purposes thereof; and a substantial compliance with its several provisions shall be sufficient for the validity of the lien or liens hereinbefore provided for, and to give jurisdiction to the courts to enforce the same. [1897 PA 143.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Thus, the doctrine has existed in this state for nearly a century and has played an essential role in the development of property lien laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">We decline to follow the cases proffered by the defendant which involve the then-existent residential builders act,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> not the Construction Lien Act or its predecessor. The theory behind a .licensure requirement is deterrence. In those cases, recovery was being sought by an unlicensed contractor. By denying a claim to an unlicensed contractor, the Legislature sought to discourage unlicensed entities from engaging in residential construction. Deterrence would not be achieved by denying plaintiff Brown Plumbing recovery from the fund pursuant to the Construction Lien Act. Brown Plumbing was fully licensed and contributed to the fund, but was denied recovery because of Primus Energy Homes\u2019 lack of licensure. Should the Legislature determine that strict and not substantial compliance with \u00a7 203(3)(h) shall be required in the future, that change can be easily made.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Accordingly, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals that the trial court properly granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(9) and (10). On the basis of the rules of statutory construction, and the remedial nature of the Construction Lien Act, we believe it is sufficient for a lien claimant to sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>stantially comply with \u00a7 203(3)(h) in order to recover from the Homeowner Construction Lien Recovery Fund.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> See MCL 570.1203(3); MSA 26.316(203X3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> MCL 570.1203(3)(h); MSA 26.316(203)(3)(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-10\"> Section 204, MCL 570.1204; MSA 26.316(204), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">The department shall not pay out of the fund to subcontractors, suppliers, and laborers more than $75,000.00 per residential structure.
