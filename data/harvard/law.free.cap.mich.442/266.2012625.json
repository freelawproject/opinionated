We hold that the teacher certification requirement is an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to families whose religious convictions prohibit the use of certified instructors. Such families, therefore, are exempt from the dictates of the teacher certification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">Defendants Mark and Chris DeJonge taught <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>their two school-age children at home in accordance with their religious faith. The DeJonges utilized a program administered by the Church of Christian Liberty and Academy of Arlington Heights, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Because the DeJonges taught their children at home without the aid of certified teachers, the Ottawa Area Intermediate School District charged them with violating the compulsory education law, as codified in the School Code, MCL 380.1561(1), (3); MSA 15.41561(1), (3). This act requires parents of children from the age of six to sixteen to send their children to public schools or to state-approved nonpublic schools.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To qualify as a state-approved nonpublic school, students must be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>structed by certified teachers. MCL 388.553; MSA 15.1923.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">At time of trial, the prosecution never questioned the adequacy of the DeJonges\u2019 instruction or the education the children received. Michael McHugh, an employee of the Church of Christian Liberty and Academy, testified that his organization provided the DeJonges with \"testing, individualized curriculum, and monitoring of the home school.\u201d Unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals, decided August 8, 1989 (Docket No. 106149), p 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">McHugh testified further that this educational program, in use since 1968, had been employed by \"many of thousands of youngsters who have attended and successfully graduated from major colleges and universities throughout the United States . . . .\u201d Indeed, with respect to the DeJonge children, the trial judge noted that he was \"very impressed with the support that they have, the credentials of the witnesses that have testified and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the reports that apparently are very, very favorable report on the education of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The DeJonges testified that they began teaching their children at home in August of 1984 because they wished to provide them a \"Christ centered education.\u201d The DeJonges believe that \"the major purpose of education is to show a student how to face God, not just show him how to face the world.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">That the DeJonges\u2019 opposition to the certification requirement was religiously motivated was beyond question. At the close of the proceedings, the trial judge concluded that he had no \"question about the conviction or the sincerity of the De-Jonges on this position,\u201d and that the teacher certification requirement conflicted with a \"very, very honest and sincere religious conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb\">Nevertheless, the DeJonges were convicted and sentenced to two years probation for instructing their children without state certified teachers. They were each fined $200, required to test their children for academic achievement, and ordered to arrange for certified instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Ottawa Circuit Court affirmed their convictions, and the DeJonges appealed in the Court of Appeals, where their case was consolidated with <em>People v Bennett.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court affirmed both trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>court decisions, and reaffirmed their convictions on rehearing. 179 Mich App 225; 449 NW2d 899 (1989) <em>(DeJonge II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In so ruling, the Court recognized that with respect to the DeJonges the \"burden of the state certification law on the belief is high, and there appears to be no room for compromise,\u201d <em>DeJonge II, supra </em>at 235. Nevertheless, the Court ruled that the certification requirement was constitutional as the least restrictive means to meet the state\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">On October 17, 1990, this Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of recent case precedent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 436 Mich 875 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"AiH\">Following remand, the Court of Appeals again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions. 188 Mich App 447; 470 NW2d 433 (1991) <em>(DeJonge III). </em>The Court reiterated its prior findings, and added that \"since Mr. DeJonge opposes all state involvement in the education of his children, this alternative [individual examinations] would impose just as great a burden on his religious beliefs. Accordingly, we reaffirm the DeJonges\u2019 convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On appeal before this Court, the DeJonges contend that the certification requirement violates their First Amendment right of free exercise of religion, and submit that the Court of Appeals misapplied the compelling interest test by not requiring the state to establish that the certification requirement is essential to and the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">At issue then is whether Michigan\u2019s teacher certification requirement for home schools violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as applied to the State of Michigan by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Free Exercise Clause proclaims: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Thus, we begin our analysis by considering the historical underpinnings of the First Amendment. This Court has long held that the constitution must be interpreted in light of the original intent and understanding of its drafters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The framers\u2019 intent must be understood in conjunction with the intentions and understanding of the constitution held by its ratifiers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">The intent of the framers, however, must be used as part of the primary rule of \"common understanding\u201d described by Justice Cooley:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\" 'A constitution is made for the people and by the people. The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u2019 <em>\u201d[</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">A necessary corollary of these principles is that the constitution can only properly be understood by studying its common meaning as well as \" 'the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision and the purpose sought to be accomplished . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">These rules of constitutional construction are indispensable because \"[t]he literal construction of the words, without regard to their obvious purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of protection, is to make the constitutional safeguard no more than a shabby hoax, a barrier of words, easily destroyed by other words. ... A constitutional limitation must be construed to effectuate, not to abolish, the protection sought by it to be afforded.\u201d <em>Lockwood v Comm\u2019r of Revenue, 357 </em>Mich 517, 556-557; 98 NW2d 753 (1959).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Hence, a thorough examination of the historical origins of the Free Exercise Clause is essential to the proper disposition of the case at issue, and more important, to the preservation of religious freedom.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This American experiment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> includes an unprecedented protection of religious liberty from tyrannical government action. Springing forth from this nation\u2019s founding principle that government is \"instituted for [the] protection of the rights of mankind,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Free Exercise of Religion Clause ensured protection from government interference as the first freedom in the Bill of Rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The prominence of religious liberty\u2019s protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>in the Bill of Rights is no historical anomaly, but the consequence of America\u2019s vigorous clashes regarding religious freedom. The First Amendment\u2019s protection of religious liberty was born from the fires of persecution, forged by the minds of the Founding Fathers, and tempered in the struggle for freedom in America.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">As our history forcefully attests, the Founding Fathers envisioned the protection of the free exercise of religion as an affirmative duty of the government mandated by the inherent nature of religious liberty, not one of mere \"toleration\u201d by government.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Most significant in this history was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the dramatic confrontation regarding the proposed renewal of Virginia\u2019s tax levy for the support of the established church.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This embroilment bore James Madison\u2019s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> delivered in the Virginia House of Burgess in opposition to the levy, as well as Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Virginia Bill of Religious Liberty, enacted in the levy\u2019s stead.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Madison\u2019s Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments explained as \"a fundamental and undeniable truth\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that religious liberty is a deeply private, fundamental, and inalienable right by which a citizen\u2019s religious beliefs and practices are shielded from the hostile intolerance of society,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> while Jefferson\u2019s Virginia Bill for Reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>gious Liberty protected the right of the free exercise of religion, as well as barred state established churches. The Founders understood that this zealous protection of religious liberty was essential to the \"preservation of a free government.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">The Founding Fathers then reserved special protection for religious liberty as a fundamental freedom,in the First Amendment of the constitution. This fortification of the right to the free exercise of religion was heralded as one of the Bill of Rights\u2019 most important achievements. Indeed, Jefferson proclaimed that \"[n]o provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In <em>Employment Div, Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v Smith, </em>494 US 872, 881; 110 S Ct 1595; 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990), the Court ruled that the \"Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as . . . the right of parents, acknowledged in <em>Pierce [v Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925)], to direct the education of their children, see <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205 [92 S Ct 1526; 32 L Ed 2d 15] (1972),\u201d demands the application of strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Hence, Michigan\u2019s teacher certification re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>quirement must undergo strict scrutiny to survive a free exercise challenge.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">This strict scrutiny is manifested in the \"compelling interest\u201d test, which is composed of five elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(1) whether a defendant\u2019s belief, or conduct motivated by belief, is sincerely held;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(2) whether a defendant\u2019s belief, or conduct motivated by belief, is religious in nature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(3) whether a state regulation imposes a burden on the exercise of such belief or conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(4) whether a compelling state interest justifies the burden imposed upon a defendant\u2019s belief or conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(5) whether there is a less obtrusive form of regulation available to the state. <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 214-230; <em>Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, </em>434 Mich 380, 391-396; 455 NW2d 1 (1990) (Cavanagh, J., concurring), 430 (Griffin, J., concurring).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The first element of the compelling interest test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>is met by the DeJonges because their belief is sincerely held. \"[W]hile the 'truth\u2019 of a belief is not open to question, there remains the significant question whether it is 'truly held.\u2019 This is the threshold question of sincerity which must be resolved in every case. It is, of course, a question of fact . . . .\u201d <em>United States v Seeger, </em>380 US 163, 185; 85 S Ct 850; 13 L Ed 2d 733 (1965). As noted, after extensive trial testimony, the trial judge concluded that \"[t]he Court does not have any question about the conviction or the sincerity of the DeJonges on this position.\u201d Furthermore, the state does not contest the sincerity of the De-Jonges\u2019 beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Similarly, because the DeJonges\u2019 belief is religiously based, the second element of the compelling interest test is met. To be afforded the protection of the Free Exercise Clause, an individual\u2019s behavior must be religiously motivated, as the Court in <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 215-216, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">A way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations; to have the protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in religious belief. . . . Thus, if the Amish asserted their claims because of their subjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority, much as Thoreau rejected the social values of his time and isolated himself at Walden Pond, their claims would not rest on a religious basis. Thoreau\u2019s choice was philosophical and personal rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>religious, and such belief does not rise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Thus, this Court must determine whether a religious belief is sincerely held, not whether such beliefs are true or reasonable. <em>United States v Ballard, </em>322 US 78, 86; 64 S Ct 882; 88 L Ed 1148 (1944). This Court must accept a worshiper\u2019s good-faith characterization that its activity is grounded in religious belief because \"[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants\u2019 interpretations of those creeds.\u201d <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>490 US 680, 699; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766 (1989).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This must be so because \"[m]en may believe what they cannot prove. They may not be put to the proof of their religious doctrines or beliefs. Religious experiences which are as real as life to some may be incomprehensible to others.\u201d <em>Ballard, supra </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Nor is religious orthodoxy necessary to obtain the protection of the Free Exercise Clause. Religious belief and conduct need not be endorsed or mandated by a religious organization to be protected. <em>Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, supra </em>at 392 (Cavanagh, J., concurring). Indeed, because popular religious beliefs are rarely threatened by elected legislators, the Free Exercise Clause\u2019s major benefactors are religious minorities or dissidents whose beliefs and worship are suppressed or shunned by the majority. To hold otherwise would be to deny that \"Religion . . . must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The DeJonges testified that they taught their children at home without complying with the certification requirement because they wished to provide for their children a \"Christ-centered education.\u201d Because the DeJonges\u2019 faith professes \"that parents are the ones that are responsible to God for the education of their children,\u201d they passionately believe that utilizing a state-certified teacher is sinful. Their faith, although unusual, may not be challenged or ignored.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The third element of the test is also met because the certification requirement clearly imposes a burden on the exercise of the DeJonges\u2019 religious freedom. A burden may be shown if the \"affected individuals [would] be coerced by the Government\u2019s action into violating their religious beliefs [or whether] governmental action [would] penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.\u201d <em>Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n, </em>485 US 439, 449; 108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988). Hence, \"[a] claimed burden on religious beliefs may be deemed constitutionally insignificant, but only (1) if the claimant\u2019s beliefs do not create an irreconcilable conflict between the mandates of law and religious duty, or (2) if the legal requirement does not directly coerce the claimant to act contrary to religious belief . . . .\u201d <em>Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, supra </em>at 393 (Cavanagh, J., concurring). Put simply, the petitioner must prove that he has been \"enforced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>restrained, molested, or burdened . . . [or] otherwise suffered], on account of his religious opinions or beliefs . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The burden on religious liberty, however, need not be overwhelming, because \"[e]ven subtle pressure diminishes the right of each individual to choose voluntarily what to believe.\u201d <em>Lee v Weisman, </em>505 US \u2014; 112 S Ct 2649, 2665; 120 L Ed 2d 467 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In the instant case, the findings of the trial court, to which this Court grants due deference, amply reveal that the teacher certification requirement directly and heavily burdens the DeJonges\u2019 exercise of their religion. As noted, the DeJonges believe that the word of God commands them to educate their children without state certification. Any regulation interfering with that commandment is state regulation of religion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The certification requirement imposes upon the DeJonges a loathsome dilemma: they must either violate the law of God to abide by the law of man, or commit a crime under the law of man to remain faithful to God. The requirement presents an \"irreconcilable conflict between the mandates of law and religious duty . . . .\u201d <em>Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, supra </em>at 393 (Cavanagh, J., concurring)._</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Moreover, this is not a case in which the De-Jonges must forgo a government benefit or privilege in lieu of their religious beliefs,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> because the state compels through criminal sanction both mandatory education and the certification requirement. In <em>Yoder, </em>the Court found that compulsory education for Amish children past the eighth grade violated the Free Exercise Clause because the criminal sanctions imposed compelled the Amish to violate their religious faith: \"The impact of the compulsory-attendance law on respondents\u2019 practice of the Amish religion is not only severe, but inescapable, for the Wisconsin law affirmatively compels them, under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218. Similarly, the state\u2019s enforcement of the teacher certification requirement compels the De-Jonges to sin, as they have been coerced by the state to educate their children in direct violation of their religious faith. In other words, as applied to the DeJonges, the certification requirement \"inescapably compels conduct that [plaintiffs] find objectionable for religious reasons.\u201d <em>Bowen v Roy, </em>476 US 693, 706; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Indeed,. perhaps the most striking state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>burden upon religious liberty imaginable, criminal prosecution, was imposed upon the DeJonges for following their interpretation of the word of God.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Finally, the certification requirement is unconstitutional because it fails to meet the remaining two prongs of the compelling interest test, which presume that a state\u2019s burden of the free exercise of religion is invalid unless the burden is essential to the fulfillment of a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Hence, strict scrutiny demands that (1) a state regulation be justified by a compelling state interest, and (2) the means chosen be essential to further that interest.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Furthermore, a compelling state interest must be truly compelling, threatening the safety or welfare of the state in a clear and present manner.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The state asserts that it has a compelling state interest in ensuring the adequate education of all children. Indeed, \"[tjhere is no doubt as to the power of a State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to impose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education. Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State.\u201d <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 213 (citations omitted). The importance of compulsory education has been recognized because \"some degree of education is necessary to prepare citizens to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system if we are to preserve freedom and independence. Further, education prepares individuals to be self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. Our commitment to education is deeply rooted in our history: \"[t]he American people have always regarded education and acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance which should be diligently promoted.\u201d <em>Meyer v Nebraska, </em>262 US 390, 400; 43 S Ct 625; 67 L Ed 1042 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Michigan has an equally deeply rooted commitment to education. Article 8, \u00a7 1 of our constitution, paralleling the language of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, proclaims the vital nature of education in Michigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Nevertheless, our rights are meaningless if they do not permit an individual to challenge and be free from those abridgments of liberty that are otherwise vital to society:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">[F]reedom of worship ... is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. [West <em>Virginia Bd of Ed v Barnette, </em>319 US 624, 638, 642; 63 S Ct 1178; 87 L Ed 2d 1628 (1943).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Hence, Michigan\u2019s interest in compulsory education is not absolute and must yield to the constitutional liberties protected by the First Amendment. The United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">Thus, a State\u2019s interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children so long as they, in the words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Pierce [supra </em>at 535], \"prepare [them] for additional obligations.\u201d <em>[Yoder, supra </em>at 214.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Although the state asserts that \"its interest in its system of compulsory education is so compelling that\u201d the DeJonges\u2019 religious practices must give way, \"[w]here fundamental claims of religious freedom are at stake, ... we cannot accept such a sweeping claim ... we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote . . . and the impediment of those objectives that would flow from recognizing the claimed [religious] exemption.\u201d <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Indeed, such a searching examination in the instant case is enlightening because it reveals that the state has focused upon the incorrect governmental interest. The state\u2019s interest is not ensuring that the goals of compulsory education are met, because the state does not contest that the DeJonges are succeeding at fulfilling such aims. Rather, the state\u2019s interest is simply the certification requirement of the private school act, not the general objectives of compulsory education. The interest the state pursues is the manner of education, not its goals.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Hence, the state\u2019s narrow interest in maintaining the certification requirement must be weighed against the DeJonges\u2019 fundamental right of the free exercise of religion. Because exemptions are the remedy provided in cases in which a general law abridges religious liberty,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> this Court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>focus on the effect granting such religious exemptions would have on the purported state interest.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> If this Court does not find a substantial effect on the asserted interest, an exemption is warranted because no compelling interest is affected. <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 237; <em>Sherbert, supra </em>at 407.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In the case at issue, if the state fails to prove that exemptions from the teacher certification requirement impair the state\u2019s asserted interest, then no balancing is necessary. The state, therefore, must establish that enforcing the certification requirement, without exception, is essential to ensure the education required by the compulsory education law. <em>United States v Lee, </em>455 US 252, 257-258; 102 S Ct 1051; 71 L Ed 2d 127 (1982). If less intrusive means fulfill the government\u2019s purported interest, then an exemption must be granted and the alternative implemented.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Nevertheless, the state in the instant case has failed to provide evidence or testimony that supports the argument that the certification requirement is essential to the preservation of its asserted interest. Conversely, while the record is barren of evidence supporting the state\u2019s claim, it clearly indicates that the DeJonge children are receiving more than an adequate education: they are fulfilling the academic and socialization goals of compulsory education without certified teachers or the state\u2019s interference. Nor has the state suggested that the DeJonges have jeopardized the health or safety of their children, or have a potential for significant social burdens. In sum, the state has failed to provide one scintilla of evidence that the DeJonge children have suffered for the want of certified teachers; it has failed to prove a \"clear and present\u201d or \"grave and immediate\u201d danger to the welfare of the children that justifies the onerous burden placed upon the DeJonges\u2019 exercise of their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Furthermore, the experience of our sister states provides irrefutable evidence that the certification requirement is not an interest worthy of being deemed \"compelling.\u201d The nearly universal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>sensus of our sister states is to permit home schooling without demanding teacher certified instruction.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Indeed, many states have recently rejected the archaic notion that certified instruction is necessary for home schools. Within the last decade, over twenty states have repealed teacher certification requirements for home schools.

A study by Dr. Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute found that \"there was no [statistically significant] difference in students\u2019 total reading, total math, or total language scores based on the teacher certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>cation status (i.e., neither parent had been certified, one had been, or both had been) of their parents.\u201d National Home Education Research Institute, <em>A Nationwide Study of Home Education: Family Characteristics, Legal Matters, and Student Achievement </em>(Salem, Oregon: National Home Education Research Institute, 1990), p 12.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The compelling nature of the teacher certification requirement is not extant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In any event, even if the state possessed a compelling state interest, it has failed to prove that the certification requirement is essential to that interest.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals asserted that \"[t]he teacher certification requirement is a backbone in the protection of\u201d state education, and that the DeJonges did not \"propose[] an alternative\u201d to teacher certification. <em>DeJonge II, supra </em>at 236; <em>DeJonge III, supra. </em>But, the record fails to support this assertion. In <em>Sherbert, supra </em>at 407, the Court held that because the plaintiff had \"no proof whatever to warrant\u201d fears that its compelling interest would be endangered by alternative means, the state had failed to meet its burden. Similarly, in the instant case, the state\u2019s sweeping assertion must be turned aside when it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>supported by evidence.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The state\u2019s contention is particularly suspect when no other state has such \"a backbone.\u201d To find that of all the states in the Union only Michigan meets the aims of compulsory education is untenable and flies in the face of the aforementioned studies.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moreover, in <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 222-223, the Supreme Court held that the success of Amish teaching methods proved that the state\u2019s compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>education system did \"little to serve\u201d the state\u2019s interest. The Court ruled that because \"[t]his case, of course, is not one in which any harm to the physical or mental health of the child or to the public safety, peace, order, or welfare has been demonstrated or may be properly inferred,\u201d the state\u2019s argument that its power as <em>parens patriae </em>permitted it to extend secondary education to children regardless of the religious wishes of their parents, must fail. <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 230. Similarly, in the instant case, the success of the Church of Christian Liberty and Academy and the DeJonges repudiates the state\u2019s argument that the certification requirement is essential to the goals of compulsory education.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Indeed, the State of Michigan itself now permits noncertified teachers possessing a bachelor\u2019s degree to teach in nonpublic schools;<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> nor is the certification requirement enforced with regard to substitute teachers in public schools.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Even Michigan, then, does not command a certification requirement for the great majority of its students, but only for those taught by their parents at home.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The state, however, argues that the proposed alternative means are more intrusive upon the religious beliefs of the DeJonges than the current certification requirement. We, however, do not presume to make that judgment. We believe that the DeJonges are the best judges of which regulations are the most burdensome or least intrusive upon their religion. To entertain the notion that either this Court or the state has the insight to interpret the DeJonges\u2019 religion more correctly than they is simply \"an arrogant pretension.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Similarly, the Court of Appeals assertion that because Mark DeJonge\u2019s beliefs would bar all state interference, the certification requirement is therefore constitutional is incredulous. First, the assertion that the DeJonges\u2019 beliefs prohibit any and all types of state monitoring or guidance is erroneous; the DeJonges have administered standardized tests and emphasized at oral argument that they do not object to such testing.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> More important, the constitution forbids the state to impose any regulation that burdens religion and is not essential to the fulfillment of a compelling state interest. Because teacher certification does not meet that constitutional burden, the DeJonges must be exempt from it regardless of their other religious views if a less burdensome regulation may be enacted. To hold otherwise would be to sanction the most intrusive and egregious infringement of religious beliefs because another intrusion, although much less burdensome, also burdens a religious belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals erroneously placed the burden of proof upon the DeJonges. The Court of Appeals, by requiring that the individual burdened by governmental regulation prove that alternatives exist, while at the same time accepting at face value unsubstantiated assertions by the state, has turned constitutional jurisprudence on its head. Our citizens need not \"propose an alternative\u201d to be afforded their constitutional liberties. <em>Lee, supra </em>at 257-258; <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 233-234. We are persuaded that the burden of proof correctly placed in the instant case is fatal to the state\u2019s certification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00cdV</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">In sum we conclude that the historical under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>pinnings of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the case law in support of it compels the conclusion that the imposition of the certification requirement upon the DeJonges violates the Free Exercise Clause. We so conclude because we find that the certification requirement is not essential to nor is it the least restrictive means of achieving the state\u2019s claimed interest. Thus, we reaffirm \"that sphere of inviolable conscience and belief which is the mark of a free people.\u201d <em>Weisman, </em>112 S Ct 2658. We hold that the teacher certification requirement is an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment as applied to families whose religious convictions prohibit the use of certified instructors. Such families, therefore, are exempt from the dictates of the teacher certification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the DeJonge convictions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\"> MCL 380.1561(1); MSA 15.41561(1) mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), every parent, guardian, or other person in this state having control and charge of a child from the age of 6 to the child\u2019s sixteenth birthday, shall send that child to the public schools during the entire school year.

The. majority\u2019s conclusion, while not defensible under a <em>Smith </em>analysis, does not withstand careful examination even if one accepts the existence of a hybrid situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The claimants rely on <em>Pierce, supra, </em>and <em>Meyer v Nebraska, </em>262 US 390; 43 S Ct 625; 67 L Ed 1042 (1923), as support for a fundamental right to direct the education of their children completely free of state regulation. However, <em>Pierce </em>and <em>Meyer </em>addressed the elimination of parental choice, while the present case deals with the regulation of it. In <em>Murphy v Arkansas, </em>852 F2d 1039, 1043 (CA 8, 1988), the court concluded that \"recognition of such a right would fly directly in the face of those cases in which the Supreme Court has recognized the broad power of the state to compel school attendance and regulate curriculum and teacher certification.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>It is true that at trial, the DeJonges\u2019 minister testified that his church teaches that children are given by God to parents, and that Scripture clearly teaches that the responsibility of educating children belongs to the parents. Michael McHugh, from the Church of Christian Liberty and Academy, testified that the curriculum prescribed by his organization to the DeJonge children included a heavy emphasis on character development through Bible study, which also permeates into the traditional subject-matter areas. It is true that Mark DeJonge testified that in contravention of their faith, the certification requirement makes the DeJonges responsible to the state, and not God, for their children\u2019s education. This testimony, the majority argues, sufficiently establishes that the teacher certification requirement implicates directly the DeJonges\u2019 right to direct the secular education of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Pursuant to this finding, an examination of the DeJonges\u2019 free exercise claim requires this Court to balance the respective interests of the parties. In <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398, 403; 83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965 (1963), the Court stated that in order for a state regulation that infringes on free exercise rights to remain valid, the regulation must be justified by a compelling state interest. The appropriate free exercise inquiry is whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a religious belief or practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and, if so, whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the burden. <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>490 US 680; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766 (1989); <em>Hobbie v Unemployment Appeals Comm of Florida, </em>480 US 136; 107 S Ct 1046; 94 L Ed 2d 190 (1987); <em>Thomas v Review Bd, </em>450 US 707; 101 S Ct 1425; 67 L Ed 2d 624 (1981); <em>Yoder </em>and <em>Sherbert, supra; Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, </em>434 Mich 380; 455 NW2d 1 (1990); <em>Sheridan Rd Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462; 396 NW2d 373 (1986), cert den 481 US 1050 (1987). Under the \"compelling interest test,\u201d the court is required to conduct a four-part inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, the defendants must prove that they possess a sincerely held religious belief. <em>Yoder, </em>406 US 215; <em>Emmanuel Baptist, </em>434 Mich 392. Second, the defendants must prove that the state regulation imposes a burden on the free exercise of their belief. <em>Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Foundation v Secretary of Labor, </em>471 US 290, 303; 105 S Ct 1953; 85 L Ed 2d 278 (1985); <em>United States v Lee, </em>455 US 252, 256-257; 102 S Ct 1051; 71 L Ed 2d 127 (1982); <em>Emmanuel Baptist, </em>434 Mich 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Once the defendants successfully establish the first two parts of the test, the court will inquire whether the state possesses a compelling interest that justifies the burden imposed upon the defendants\u2019 beliefs. <em>Hobbie, </em>480 US 141-142; <em>Emmanuel Baptist, </em>434 Mich 395. Once a compelling interest is clearly established, the majority would require the state to prove that the teacher certification requirement is the least restrictive means of regulation.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. In <em>United States v Lee, supra, </em>the Court departed from the \"least restrictive means\u201d requirement. After concluding that the government\u2019s interest in assuring mandatory and continuous participation in the social security system is \"very high,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court stated that the \"remaining inquiry is whether accommodating the Amish belief will <em>unduly interfere </em>with fulfillment of the governmental interest.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the Court declined to further define \"undue interference,\u201d surely it is a less burdensome standard than the \"least restrictive means\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, in the present case, this Court should inquire whether accommodation of the DeJonges\u2019 beliefs would unduly interfere with the fulfillment of the state\u2019s interest in education.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The majority would apparently further require the regulation to be the least restrictive when compared with the other forty-nine states. Undoubtedly, we can survey similar regulations utilized in our sister states in order to determine the relative obtrusiveness of our requirements. Yet, the mere existence of less restrictive regulation in other states tells us little about that state\u2019s success at achieving the compelling interest in universal education. Indeed, some states may have quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>objectives that differ from those of Michigan. Regardless, we do not believe it is necessary for the state to establish that the certification requirement is the least restrictive means of achieving its compelling interest in education.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The majority would also require the state prove that \"the means chosen be essential to further th[e] interest.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree. In equal protection cases involving race discrimination, the regulation in question is presumed invalid and the court employs strict scrutiny, in which the court asks if the state has a compelling interest and if the means chosen are essential to further that interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause, this equal protection inquiry is not a part of the compelling interest test adopted by this Court. Unlike the equal protection inquiry, there is no presumption of invalidity and the claimant bears the initial burden. By imposing such a substantial burden on the state, the majority\u2019s compelling interest test is specifically designed to cause the state to fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Applying the compelling interest test to the present case, we reach several conclusions different from those of the majority. We agree with the majority that the DeJonges possess a sincerely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>held religious belief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is sufficient evidence on the record for the trial judge to conclude that the DeJonges\u2019 convictions and sincerity were beyond dispute. In order to meet the second part of the inquiry, the DeJonges must prove that the state regulation imposes a burden on the exercise of their belief. A burden may be found where a state \"put[s] substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs . . . .\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>450 US 718. Stated in another manner, ''[t]he question is whether the 'affected individuals [would] be coerced by the Government\u2019s action into violating their religious beliefs [or whether] governmental action [would] penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Emmanuel Baptist, </em>434 Mich 393, quoting <em>Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>485 US 439, 449; 108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Because the DeJonges met their burden regarding the first two parts of the compelling interest test, the reviewing court must be satisfied that the state possesses a compelling interest that justifies the burden imposed upon the DeJonges\u2019 religious beliefs. In <em>Prince v Massachusetts, </em>321 US 158, 166; 64 S Ct 438; 88 L Ed 645 (1944), the Court indicated the relative importance of the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of children.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">[T]he family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as against a claim of religious liberty. <em>Reynolds v United States, </em>98 US 145 [25 L Ed 244 (1878)]; <em>Davis v Beason, </em>133 US 333 [33 L <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Ed 637 (1890)]. And neither rights of religion nor rights of parenthood are beyond limitation. Acting to guard the general interest in youth\u2019s well being, the state as <em>parens patriae </em>may restrict the parent\u2019s control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child\u2019s labor and in many other ways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The majority concludes that \"the state\u2019s interest is simply the certification requirement of the private school act, not the general objectives of compulsory education. The interest the state pursues is the manner of education, not its goals.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We believe that the state possesses a compelling interest in education. The majority properly notes the importance of education to the vitality of our state and nation, and it is unnecessary to reiterate those sentiments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statements expressed by the majority lead an objective reader to conclude that the state\u2019s interest in this case is the universal education of school-age children, and not the certification requirement. The certification requirement is an effective means, chosen by the state to achieve its interest in the education of school-age children. In fact, the certification requirement ensures that educators possess a minimal level of .competency before they may take on the task of preparing our children for their future endeavors. As Justice Boyle noted in <em>Sheridan Rd, </em>426 Mich 509-510:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">The teacher certification requirements are essentially prophylactic in nature. Certification does not guarantee that a person will be an effective teacher, but it increases the probability that a teacher will be competent. Therefore, the certific\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tion requirements help prevent children from being exposed to unqualified teachers. [Boyle, J., concurring.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Furthermore, although correctly observing that the Court may not recharacterize the defendants\u2019 beliefs, the majority offers no support for what is actually the crux of its argument \u2014 that is, that this Court has the authority to recharacterize the nature of the state\u2019s interest as the \"manner of education.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nor, of course, is there any support in decisions from the United States Supreme Court for the even more remarkable proposition that the state\u2019s interest is not in \"ensuring that the goals of compulsory education are met, because the state does not contest that the DeJonges are succeeding at fulfilling such aims.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To conclude that the state is without authority to protect all of the children within its boundaries unless it can prove that a given parent is not satisfying the state\u2019s interest is to radically alter the relationship between the Legislature and the Court. Such a result, it might be noted, would assuredly offend the Founding Fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The majority, would require the state to prove that its compelling interest is \"truly compelling, threatening the safety or welfare of the state in a clear or present manner.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, such a requirement is untenable. <em>West Virginia Bd of Ed v Barnette, </em>319 US 624; 63 S Ct 1178; 87 L Ed 1628 (1943), is not authority for holding that the Free Exercise Clause requires the state to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the parent\u2019s right threatens the state in a clear and present manner.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 403, the Court utilized the \"clear and present manner\u201d language in an effort to categorize its prior decisions in which it rejected free exercise challenges to government regulation. \"The conduct or actions so regulated have invariably posed some substantial threat to public safety, peace or order.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Simply because the Court in <em>Sherbert </em>used this language to categorize those decisions in which state regulation was upheld, it does not necessarily follow that in all cases thereafter a threat to the safety or welfare of the state is required in order for a free exercise challenge to be rejected. Most importantly, this Court has not expressly adopted a \"clear and present manner\u201d requirement in association with the compelling interest test, and such an expansion is unwarranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"AlU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Finally, this Court must inquire whether accommodating the DeJonges\u2019 religious beliefs would unduly interfere with fulfillment of the state\u2019s interest in education. The private, denominational, and parochial schools act<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> provides a basic pronouncement regarding teachers\u2019 qualifications. Pursuant to the act, a teacher must hold a \"certificate such as would qualify him or her to teach in like grades of the public schools of the state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The express intent of the act is to institute qualifications for teachers that employ the same standard as that provided by the general school laws of the state.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, in order to ascertain the minimum qualifications for certification in nonpublic schools, it is essential to examine the requirements for certification in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The Legislature charged the State Board of Education with the duty of determining the requirements and issuing all licenses and certificates for teachers.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The majority asserts that Michigan \"does not command a certification requirement for the great majority of its students, but only for those taught by their parents at home.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Legislature has issued a directive to the various local school boards of the state. Because this directive implicates the qualifications for teachers in the public schools, it is applicable to the qualifications for teachers in nonpublic schools. See MCL 388.553; MSA 15.1923. The Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>has expressly stated that local school boards shall not permit instruction by a teacher who does not possess a valid teaching certificate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If, in fact, such an individual is teaching within the district, the state board must be immediately notified.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the certification requirement is not \"absolute.\u201d Subject to the availability of a certified teacher,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> a local school board may engage a noncertified instructor to teach computer science, a foreign language, mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, or robotics to students in grades nine through twelve.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The noncertified teacher must possess a bachelor\u2019s degree, major in or possess a graduate degree in the field of specialization to be taught, and have two years of occupational experience in the field to be taught. If the instructor intends to teach for more than one year, then the instructor must pass a basic skills examination and a subject area examination. Thus, the certification requirement has not been abandoned for the majority of teachers, and the Legislature has added an element of flexibility to the requirement in order to attract qualified individuals to teach high school students specialized fields of study.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The State Board of Education also established a set of exceptions within which a person may be qualified to teach without a valid teacher\u2019s certificate. Under the State Board of Education\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Teacher Certification Code,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> in addition to possessing a teaching certificate,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> a person with \"vocational authorization\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> or a \"special permit\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is authorized to teach in the public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The state board issues three types of special permits: full-year special permits,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> substitute permits,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and emergency permits. Emergency permits are issued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In emergency situations and on recommendation of the superintendent of a local or intermediate school district, the state board may issue a permit for a candidate with reasonable qualifications if a candidate who meets the requirements for obtaining a substitute permit or a full-year permit is not available and if failure to authorize this emergency permit will deprive children of an education. The permit shall be issued for a specific period of time under emergency circumstanc\u00e9s. A labor dispute is not an emergency circumstance. [1989 AACS, R 390.1145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Amicus curiae State Board of Education submits that since January of 1987, it has adopted a uniform policy regarding emergency permits. Pursuant to this policy, candidates for a permit have \"reasonable qualifications\u201d if they possess a bachelor\u2019s degree. Thus, upon a finding by the local school board that another instructor is \"unavailable\u201d and that failure to authorize the permit will result in the deprivation of education, any person who has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree may obtain an emergency permit to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Clearly, an element of flexibility and accommodation already exists within this statutory and administrative framework for teacher certification. Certification is required of teachers in the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of circumstances. However, pursuant to statutory authority and the Teacher Certification Code, several exceptions exist in which uncertified persons may nonetheless be qualified as instructors. The requirements under these exceptions, while not particularly stringent, operate as the minimum qualifications a person must possess in order to teach. Any attempt to further reduce these minimum qualifications, or to allow parents without them nonetheless to teach their children, will increase the possibility that students will not be properly taught and thus not properly learn as much as they should, thereby causing the state to fail to achieve its compelling interest to educate.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Similarly, any alternative to the certification requirement, such as standardized testing, would fail to adequately ensure that the state\u2019s interest is being pursued vigorously. In <em>Sheridan Rd, </em>426 Mich 484, Chief Justice Williams concluded that standardized testing is not an acceptable alternative to teacher certification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">[Standardized testing] is an inadequate substitute because deficiencies in teaching would be discovered only after the damage has occurred. <em>State v Shaver, </em>294 NW2d 883 (ND, 1980). Further, we are not persuaded that testing would guarantee less intrusion by the state into the functioning of the private schools.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Although the majority of our sister states have statutory authority permitting home schools, Michigan is not alone in requiring teacher certification. Alabama exempts a child from compulsory attendance if the child receives \"instruct[ion] by a competent private tutor for the entire length of the school term in every scholastic year . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>However, a competent private tutor is a person who is certified.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> California also grants an exemption from compulsory attendance where the child is engaged in a structured tutoring program.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Once again, the tutor must possess valid state certification. Finally, Kansas only exempts a child from compulsory attendance where the child attends a \"private, denominational or parochial school.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In <em>State v Lowry, </em>191 Kan 701; 383 P2d 962 (1963), the Kansas Supreme Court held that a home school is not the equivalent of a private, denominational, or parochial school. The court also held that home instruction does not meet the requirements of the compulsory school attendance laws. <em>In re Sawyer, </em>234 Kan 436; 672 P2d 1093 (1983); <em>State v Garber, </em>197 Kan 567; 419 P2d 896 (1966), app dis 389 US 51 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We have examined the claims of the DeJonges and the state pursuant to the compelling interest test. After careful review and balancing of the respective interests, we have determined that the state possesses a compelling interest in the universal education of its children and that the certification requirement is an effective means of achieving this interest. Further, accommodation of the DeJonges\u2019 religious beliefs would unduly interfere with the state\u2019s fulfillment of its interest in education. Accordingly, the DeJonges\u2019 convictions and the Court of Appeals decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-7\">Brickley and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> The majority\u2019s assertion that this Court has long held that the constitution must be interpreted in light of the intent and understanding of its drafters seems to inject needlessly, and therefore gratuitously, the original intent debate into the present controversy.
