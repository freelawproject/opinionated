In addition to its campus program based in Ann Arbor, Clonlara offers curriculum and administrative assistance through its home based education program to parents who have chosen to educate their children at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Approximately five hundred families, including McConnell\u2019s family, have contracted for Clonlara\u2019s home school services. Since September, 1984, McConnell has educated her three school-age children at home with the aid of Clonlara.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The McConnell children receive substantially all their educational instruction from their mother at home, occasionally attending classes at the Clonlara campus. McConnell has a high school education, but does not have a teaching certificate or permit to teach either in elementary or secondary school.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">During the six-month period preceding the February, 1989, hearing in the circuit court, the McConnell children attended approximately twelve hours of classes with certified teachers during eight visits to Clonlara. McConnell estimated that her children were in communication with certified teachers an average of 1.5 hours per day. This included telephone conversations with certified teachers at Clonlara and telephone and personal communication with three certified teachers who taught their children at home.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The compliance procedures were not promulgated in accordance with the apa rule-making requirements. The compliance procedures concern the collection and processing of information respecting the exercise of the department\u2019s supervisory authority under the nonpublic school act. The circumstances in which the department may insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>tute enforcement proceedings for noncompliance with the provisions of the nonpublic school act are stated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The compliance procedures also state that a home school shall provide instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u2014by a certified teacher;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u2014in social studies and science classes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u2014during a school year lasting at least 180 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The circuit judge issued a preliminary injunction that required the department to modify its information-gathering membership report form, but did not enjoin use of the compliance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">After a hearing, the judge ruled that the compliance procedures were vague and arbitrary and \"so shot through with problems\u201d that it was impossible to separate those procedures that met legal requirements and standards set forth by law, and those that did not. He said that instruction of home school pupils must be provided by certified teachers, but concluded that (1) home school pupils need not receive 180 days of instruction each school year, (2) the course of study to be taught in home schools need not include social studies and science, and (3) the department could not interpret the term \"instruction\u201d as used in the nonpublic school act, because the Legislature did not define it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The Court of Appeals affirmed on different grounds.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court held that the compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>procedures were rules that had not been promulgated in accordance with the apa and were therefore void. The Court said that the compliance procedures were rules because they \"prescribe the procedures involved in applying the law enforced or administered by the school agency.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">It has been said that \"[a]n agency\u2019s authority to adopt rules is typically provided for in the statute creating the agency and vesting it with certain powers,\u201d and that \"[r]ulemaking authority may also be inferred from other statutory authority granted to an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Bienenfeld, Michigan Administrative Law (2d ed), ch 4, pp 18, 19. This Court has said that \"what is essential to a valid . . .

He observed that there is no express grant of rule-making authority in the act. He said that in the sixty-five years since its enactment, the department had not promulgated any rules pursuant to the nonpublic school act. He concluded that the department does not have the authority to promulgate rules regulating home schools pursuant to the nonpublic school act._</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In contrast with the nonpublic school act, the School Code authorizes the State Board of Education to promulgate rules in a number of areas.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Rules adopted by an agency in accordance with the apa have the force and effect of law. They must be promulgated in accordance with' the procedures set forth in the apa, and are not valid if those procedures are not followed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where, however, the agency has not been empowered to promulgate rules, policy statements issued by it need not be promulgated in accordance with apa procedures and do not have the force of law. Such statements are so-called \"interpretive rules.\u201d As expressed by Professor Davis, \"An interpretive rule is any rule an agency issues without exercising delegated legislative power to make law through rules.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The apa provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\"Rule\u201d means an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability that implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or that prescribes the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension, or recision thereof. . . .[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Specifically excluded from the definition of \"rule\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">(g) An intergovernmental, interagency, or intra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>agency memorandum, directive, or communication that does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(h) A form with instructions, an interpretive statement, a guideline, an informational pamphlet, or other material that in itself does not have the force and effect of law but is merely explanatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">(j) A decision by an agency to exercise or not to exercise a permissive statutory power, although private rights or interests are affected.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Agencies have the authority to interpret the statutes they are bound to administer and enforce.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Legislative rules have the force of law. Interpretive \"rules\u201d state an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. Legislative rules are enforceable in and of themselves. But an agency must rely on the underlying statute to support its reading of a statute set forth in an interpretive \"rule.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">Legislative rules are substantive rules that have the force and effect of law. These rules fill in the interstices of the statute and presumably carry out its intent in greater detail. A court may not substitute its judgment of the content of a legislative rule, but may only strike the rule if the agency lacked statutory authority to adopt it, the agency failed to follow proper procedure, or the rule is unreasonable. [Bienenfeld, <em>supra, </em>ch 4, p 18.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">[IJnterpretive rules are, basically, those that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>interpret and apply the provisions of the statute under which the agency operates. No sanction attaches to the violation of an interpretive rule as such; the sanction attaches to the violation of the statute, which the rule merely interprets. . . . They state the interpretation of ambiguous or doubtful statutory language which will be followed by the agency unless and until the statute is otherwise authoritatively interpreted by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">If the rule represents something more than the agency\u2019s opinion as to what the statute requires\u2014 if the legislature has delegated a measure of legislative power to the agency, and has provided a statutory sanction for violation of such rules as the agency may adopt \u2014 then the rule may properly be described as legislative. [1 Cooper, State Administrative Law, pp 174-175.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The compliance procedures state in what circumstances the Department of Education will consider a home school to be violative of the nonpublic school act. The department is obliged to hold a hearing when it contends that a home school is in violation of the act\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The process of deciding when a violation has occurred necessarily involves interpretation of the nonpublic school act. Thus, setting guidelines concerning when the department will seek to enforce the act is not the same as promulgating legislative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"AjR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the board erred in construing the nonpublic school act as requiring a 180-day school year, although for reasons other than those stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. We disagree with the Court of Appeals, however, concerning the \"social studies and science\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> course requirements. Those course requirements are valid. In <em>DeJonge,</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court holds that the teacher certification requirement is violative of the First Amendment when it interferes with a parent\u2019s Free Exercise rights. In <em>Bennett,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a majority of the Court decides that the teacher certification requirement is not violative of substantive due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Clonlara and McConnell make a number of arguments that the compliance procedures are in fact legislative rules, despite the absence of statutorily delegated power to promulgate rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Clonlara and McConnell observe that the compliance procedures include a form that parents are required to fill out and return to their local school districts. The form is not in issue in this appeal. It is authorized by \u00a7 5 of the nonpublic school act, and was approved by this Court in <em>Sheridan Rd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462, 472, n 5; 396 NW2d 373 (1986), cert den 481 US 1050 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Clonlara and McConnell contend that the procedures go beyond the scope of the law and therefore are not interpretive statements under an exception set forth in \u00a7 7(g) of the apa. An interpretive statement that goes beyond the scope of the law may be challenged when it is in issue in a judicial proceeding. An interpretation not supported by the enabling act is an invalid interpretation, not a rule. Otherwise, \"wrong\u201d interpretive statements might become rules with the force of law on the false premise that they were promulgated in accordance with the apa procedures. \"[B]ecause a reviewing court disagrees with an agency interpretation does not render it legislative.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Clonlara and McConnell contend that the compliance procedures are not an intergovernmental, interagency, or intra-agency memorandum under exception \u00a7 7(g) because they were distributed to the public. Communication to the public does not convert an interpretive statement into an independently enforceable rule. Rather, informing the public is one of the purposes of interpretive \"rules.\u201d \"Interpretive rules are statements as to what the agency thinks a statute or regulation means; they are statements issued to <em>advise </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>public of the agency\u2019s construction of the law it administers.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Further, the fact that persons may conform their behavior to the interpretations does not mean that the interpretations are legislative rules. The \"pragmatic consequences\u201d of interpretive \"rules\u201d is that they are published as \"declaration^] of the proper interpretation of the law, and those affected will normally conform, since the regulation provides a practical guide as to how the office representing the public interest in enforcing the law will apply it.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Underlying many of the arguments of Clonlara and McConnell is the sense that these procedures must be legislative rules rather than interpretive statements because they have a substantial effect. The dissent adopts this argument, and on that basis would hold that the 180-day school year requirement is invalid. The argument that substantive statements are enforceable rules when the agency has not been granted legislative authority to promulgate rules has not been followed in Michigan, and has been rejected by the federal courts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The compliance procedures do not create or destroy rights. A home school parent may ignore the compliance procedures at the risk of having the department seek a hearing under \u00a7 4 of the nonpublic school act. At such a hearing, it is the underlying statute that would control whether the home school parent violated the law, not the department\u2019s interpretation. At such a proceeding, the department would seek to convince a court that its interpretation of the statute is correct and that in fact the parents had violated the statute. The department must show violation of the statute, not violation of an interpretive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The dissent would hold that because the 180-day school year requirement has the effect of a rule, it is an invalid rule rather than an invalid interpretation. An invalid interpretation cannot, however, become an invalid rule unless the agency is empowered to promulgate rules.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>On the same principle that a person cannot be prosecuted for violating a law that he is not obliged to obey, an agency that has not been granted rule-making authority is not obliged to follow rule-making procedures. The Legislature may require an agency to follow apa rule-making procedures by empowering the agency to make rules. When it fails to so empower an agency, the agency need not follow the apa rule-making procedures.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Reliance in the dissent on Michigan and federal precedent is misplaced. In all the Michigan cases relied on by the dissent, the issue was whether an agency that had been granted rule-making authority was required to comply with apa procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Courts look at the substance or effect of agency action when an agency has been empowered to make rules because of the need to prevent the agency from seeking to accomplish the goals of rule making without observing the apa procedural requirements for rule making. None of the cases relied on by the dissent holds that an agency, not empowered to make rules, had promulgated an invalid rule because it had failed to follow the apa procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In <em>Detroit Base Coalition for Human Rights of Handicapped v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>431 Mich 172; 428 NW2d 355 (1988) the dss was required<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> to promulgate rules providing procedures for hearings where a person contests the denial or reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tion of public assistance. At issue was whether the dss could change such hearing procedures through the issuance of what it labeled a policy bulletin and thereby avoid the rule-making requirements of the apa. This Court, in holding that the agency was required to observe the apa, wrote that \"[t]he only relevant statutory provision <em>mandates </em>that the department conduct hearings pursuant to promulgated rules.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Similarly, in <em>Farm Bureau, </em>petitioners challenged letters of the Director of the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, establishing new rate schedules as rules on the basis that the changes should have been promulgated under the apa. The Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act provided that the director, in accordance with the apa, \" 'may make rules not inconsistent with this act for carrying out the provisions of the act. . . .\u2019\"<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It may, indeed, be sound policy and a sound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>construction of the apa, to hold that substance and effect are determinative and that an agency must act through apa rule-making procedures when it has been authorized by the Legislature to promulgate rules. But, as Professor Davis stated in a section of his treatise entitled \"Can Substantial Impact of Rules Give Them Force of Law if Congress Has Delegated to the Agency No Power to Make Rules Having Force of Law?\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">The idea that substantial impact of rules may give them force of law seems on its face totally without merit. Full examination of the idea confirms that it is totally without merit. [2 Davis Administrative Law (2d ed), \u00a7 7:16, p 76.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The Department of Education is not authorized, explicitly or implicitly, to promulgate rules relating to the nonpublic school act. Consequently, action taken by the department cannot be an invalid rule. The negative implication of Davis\u2019 statement is that if substantial effect cannot give rules the force of law \u2014 and thus constitute them valid legislative rules \u2014 then substantial effect similarly cannot make them invalid rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">We now consider whether the compliance procedures are valid interpretations of the law. This Court has said that the subsection 7(h) exception for interpretive statements must be narrowly construed \"and requires that the interpretative state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ment at issue be merely explanatory.\u201d <em>Coalition for Human Rights, supra, </em>p 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The Court of Appeals found that three of the compliance procedures were not interpretive statements under subsection 7(h) because they exceeded the scope of the nonpublic school act or were not otherwise statutorily supported.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The compliance procedures state that an instructor must have a valid teaching certificate recorded with the intermediate school district office.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Section 2 of the nonpublic schools act<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> defines a private, denominational or parochial school as \"any school other than a public school giving instruction to children below the age of 16 . . . .\u201d Home schools are covered by the act because they are \"any school other than a public school.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Section 1<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> states that \"[i]t is the intent of this act that the sanitary conditions of such schools, the courses of study therein, <em>and the quali\u00f1cations of the teachers thereof </em>shall be of the same standard as provided by the general school laws of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This section, then, requires that nonpublic schools provide comparable education, including teacher qualifications, as public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Section 3<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">No person shall teach or give instruction in any of the regular or elementary grade studies in any private, denominational or parochial school within this state who does not hold a <em>certi\u00f1cate such as would qualify him or her to teach in like grades of the public schools of the state </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">School Code \u00a7 1233<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> provides, with a few exceptions, that \"the board of a school district or intermediate school district shall not permit a teacher who does not hold a valid teaching certificate to teach in a grade or department of the school . . . .\u201d Under this provision, all instruction in public schools is conducted by certified teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Reading these four provisions in conjunction leads to the conclusions that 1) home schools are covered by the nonpublic school act because they are schools \"other than a public school\u201d;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> 2) as a school, \"other than a public school\u201d home schools are required to provide instruction by a teacher who would otherwise be qualified to teach in the public schools; 3) all hours of instruction in home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>schools must be conducted by certified teachers, because School Code \u00a7 1233<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> requires that all teaching in public schools be done by certified teachers and the nonpublic school act<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> mandates that nonpublic schools meet the same standards as public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Today, in <em>People v DeJonge (After Remand), </em>442 Mich 266; 501 NW2d 127 (1993), this Court holds that the teacher certification requirement is unconstitutional when it infringes on a parent\u2019s First Amendment free exercise rights. And, in <em>People v Bennett (After Remand), </em>442 Mich 316; 501 NW2d 106 (1993), a majority of the Court sustains the constitutionality of the teacher certification requirement against a challenge claiming that the requirement is violative of substantive due process.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">There is no statutory basis for the department to require that home schools have school years that last a minimum of 180 days. The 180-day requirement goes beyond the scope of the enabling statutes and is therefore an invalid interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">This Court, in <em>State Bd of Ed v Houghton Lake Community Schools, </em>430 Mich 658; 425 NW2d 80 (1988), considered whether the State Board of Education could compel a local board of education to provide 180 days of instruction in a school year. It construed \u00a7 1284(1)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> of the School Code and State School Aid Act, \u00a7 101,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> which both provide that the minimum number of days for student instruction shall be 180 days. The Court held that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>provisions do not contain an absolute mandate of 180 days. Rather, they state that if a district does not hold school for 180 days, the district will forfeit some of its state aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">There is thus no requirement that public schools be in session 180 days. As a result, the board cannot base the 180-day school year requirement for home schools on an analogy to or comparability of public school requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Nothing in the nonpublic school act indicates that nonpublic schools must be in session for 180 days.

Acknowledging the vital importance of maintaining public control over administrative agencies and the underlying purpose of the apa, Michigan courts \"have shown a strong tendency to require agencies to act pursuant to formal rules rather than through informal policies.\u201d <em>Spruytte v Walters, </em>753 F2d 498, 505 (CA 6, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Defendant maintains that because it has no rule-making authority, even though the guidelines may have substantially affected plaintiffs, at worst it misinterpreted the law and did not violate the apa. The majority agrees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Contrary to the conclusions of the majority, I find that the guideline mandating 180 days of school is an invalid rule promulgated in violation of the apa. When an agency \"does not merely interpret, but sets forth onto new substantive ground through rules that it will make binding, the agency must observe the legislative processes laid down by\u201d the Legislature. Anthony, <em>Interpretive rules, policy statements, guidances, manuals, and the like </em>\u2014 Should <em>federal agencies use them to bind the public? </em>41 Duke L J 1311, 1314 (1992).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Professor Anthony cautions that while guidelines like the one at issue \"by definition cannot <em>legally </em>bind, agencies often inappropriately issue them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>with the intent or effect of imposing a <em>practical </em>binding norm upon the regulated or benefited public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. See <em>Farm Bureau, supra </em>at 162-163 (Levin, J.); <em>Jordan v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>165 Mich App 20, 29; 418 NW2d 914 (1987). Hence, if an agency policy was adopted without complying with apa procedures and has the effect of a rule, it is an invalidly promulgated rule. <em>Coalition for Human Rights, supra </em>at 188, quoting <em>Schinzel v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>124 Mich App 217, 219; 333 NW2d 519 (1983).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Nevertheless, the majority holds that policies that clearly contradict or extend beyond their statutory foundations are merely misinterpretations of the statute, even if they possess the effect of law. Such reasoning eviscerates the dictates of the apa. The majority incorrectly dismisses the real-world possibility that an agency without statutory authorization to promulgate rules may still attempt to issue a rule with the force of law without conforming to the apa.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority permits the apa to be easily circumvented by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>agency that enacts policies that are in effect binding and later claims that because it was not vested with rule-making power, its policy was valid as a proper interpretation of the law or, at most, a misinterpretation of the law. Meanwhile, the lives of thousands, if not millions, of citizens would have been dictated by purported nonrules promulgated by agencies without public participation and in contradiction to the will of the Legislature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such unauthorized lawmaking not only violates the apa, but threatens the principles of republican government. Administrative agencies\u2019 policies have a substantial effect on the everyday lives of Michigan\u2019s citizens, and simply because an agency declares that it has no rule-making authority, or is not exercising that authority, should not enable it to act with impunity in violation of the law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Furthermore, the majority fails to inquire into the effect of the procedures at issue, and mistakenly asks only whether the 180-day requirement was legally binding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The correct inquiry should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>have been whether the agency\u2019s actions were intended or had the effect of binding those affected by the policy. <em>Coalition for Human Rights, supra </em>at 188.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\"In general, a nonlegislative document is binding as a practical matter if the agency treats it the same way it treats a legislative rule \u2014 that is, as dispositive of the issues that it addresses \u2014 or leads the affected public to believe it will treat the document that way.\u201d Anthony, <em>Interpretive rules, supra </em>at 1328. See also <em>Community Nutrition Institute v Young, </em>260 US App DC 294, 298-300; 818 F2d 943 (1987). \"Certain indicia that nonlegislative documents are binding in this practical sense are clearly identifiable.\u201d Anthony, <em>Interpretive rules, supra </em>at 1328. For example, \"agency <em>enforcement action </em>based upon nonobservance of the nonlegislative document, or the threat of such action, bespeaks a clear intent to bind and indeed puts it into execution. Here the eating is the proof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pudding.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, although an agency may state that it did not intend its policies to be binding, the court must examine whether the agency acted as if it were binding or had such an effect. <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc v United States, </em>316 US 407, 416; 62 S Ct 1194; 86 L Ed 1563 (1942) (\"[t]he particular label placed upon [a regulation] is not necessarily conclusive, for it is the substance of what the Commission has purported to do and has done which is decisive\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Furthermore, whether \"private parties are reasonably <em>led to believe </em>that failure to conform will bring adverse consequences, such as enforcement action or denial of an application,\u201d is vital to this determination. Anthony, <em>Interpretive rules, supra </em>at 1328. Other factors include whether the private parties participated in the formulation of the policy, and the ease by which to challenge the documents. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Moreover, when a policy affects the rights of those it binds or creates substantial changes in substantive law, the procedure is a rule. <em>Coalition for Human Rights, supra </em>at 188-189.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Similarly, if the procedure contradicts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>law, it is an invalidly promulgated rule in violation of the apa. Id.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In the instant case, the 180-day procedure meets the basic definition of a rule as defined in \u00a7 7 of the apa and possesses the indicia of a binding policy. The 180-day procedure is clearly \"an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability, that implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or that prescribes the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the procedure has a binding effect. First, defendant acted as if the procedure were binding. The procedures were mailed to all known home schools and directed recipients to return an information form that required adherence to the procedures. Defendant enforced the procedure as it enforced all statutory mandates, and instructed intermediate school districts to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>force the procedure as law. Second, parents who received the procedure undoubtedly understood it to be binding because it declared that it was authorized and defined by the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, as found by the majority, the 180-day requirement does not meet the apa\u2019s exceptions because it contradicts the nonpublic school act; that act does not mandate 180 days of school for nonpublic schools.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although defendant recognized that the procedure was not legally binding, its actions practically bound home schools in violation of the apa. The majority is correct in its conclusion that the 180-day requirement cannot legally bind, but ignores the practical and substantial effect of the guidelines. Regardless of the labels defendant attempts to place on the procedure, it possessed no power to dictate a 180-day requirement; that procedure, therefore, was an invalidly promulgated rule in violation of the apa.</p>\n<judges id=\"b385-5\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, J._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-13\"> I agree with the majority that the other procedures at issue were valid interpretative statements pursuant to the apa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> The procedures explicitly refer to MCL 388.551-388.558; MSA 15.1921-15.1928, MCL 380.1561 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.41561 <em>et seq., </em>MCL 380.653; MSA 15.4653, as well as unpublished opinion of the Attorney General, 1961-1962, M-576 (May 18, 1961); OAG, 1979-1980, No 5579, p 416 (September 27, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> 188 Mich App 332, 341; 469 NW2d 66 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 245-248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b375-7\"> The pervasiveness of administrative agencies cannot be denied: administrative agencies grant or deny licenses to practice professions, operate businesses, drive automobiles, construct buildings, utilize natural resources, and determine the use of land.
