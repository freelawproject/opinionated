The case presents a number of issues, not all of which are sufficiently developed for decision by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Essentially, plaintiff\u2019s recovery of personal injury protection no-fault benefits and uninsured motorist benefits is dependent on an interpretation of the term \"occupant\u201d as it appears in the no-fault statute, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq., </em>and \"occupying\u201d as it is defined in the insurance policy issued by the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is required because pip benefits are mandated by the statute, but uninsured motorist coverage is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>We conclude that the term occupant in the no-fault statute is to be construed as we indicated in <em>Royal Globe Ins Co v Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co, </em>419 Mich 565; 357 NW2d 652 (1984), and that under that literal interpretation, the plaintiff in this case was not an occupant of the automobile at the time of the accident for purposes of awarding pip benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Because there is evidence that the plaintiff was in physical contact with the trailer at the time of the accident, that issue, along with a peripheral issue whether the trailer was a covered vehicle for purposes of the uninsured motorist insurance, present a closer question that can only be resolved with fuller development on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">On August 5, 1985, the plaintiff, Frederick Rohlman, was a passenger in a minivan owned by Vicki Stevens, who is not a relative, registered in Michigan, and insured by defendant HawkeyeSecurity Insurance Company. Ms. Stevens was driving the van through Ohio, pulling a small two-wheeled trailer that became unhitched, apparently after crossing some railroad tracks. The trailer overturned and came to rest in the center lane of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Ms. Stevens turned the van around and parked behind the trailer, and the plaintiff then got out of the van and walked ten to twenty feet toward the trailer intending to turn it over on its wheels. After approximately two minutes had passed, while the plaintiff was attempting to right the trailer, an unidentified vehicle struck the trailer and the plaintiff, injuring him severely.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The plaintiff, having no insurance of his own, sought to recover personal injury protection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>uninsured motorist benefits from the defendant insurer, but was denied coverage. Plaintiff filed this declaratory action against Hawkeye on October 21, 1986, and Hawkeye moved for a summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), arguing that the plaintiff was not related to the insured, and that he was not an occupant of either the insured vehicle or the trailer. The trial court denied the motion and, by broadly interpreting the term \"occupant,\u201d held that the plaintiff was an occupant of the insured van and awarded pip and uninsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, distinguishing the two key cases in this area, <em>Nickerson v Citizens Mutual Ins Co, </em>393 Mich 324; 224 NW2d 896 (1975), and <em>Royal Globe, supra. </em>The Court stated that \"the former construed the term 'occupying\u2019 as used in a private insurance contract, while the latter construed the term 'occupant\u2019 as used in the no-fault act. . . . [L]anguage in an insurance policy is to be strictly construed against the insurer. Since policy language is at issue in the instant case, we are bound to follow the holding in <em>Nicker</em>son.\u201d 190 Mich App 540, 547, 550; 476 NW2d 461 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In addition to the general issue of the definition of occupant, because of the involvement of the van and the trailer, and because the insurance policy provided uninsured motorist benefits as well as pip benefits, this case presents a number of more complicated issues that neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals addressed. Pip benefits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>mandated by statute under the no-fault act, MCL 500.3105; MSA 24.13105, and, therefore, the statute is the \"rule book\u201d for deciding the issues involved in questions regarding awarding those benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, the insurance policy itself, which is the contract between the insurer and the insured, controls the interpretation of its own provisions providing benefits not required by statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, because uninsured motorist benefits are not required by statute, interpretation of the policy dictates under what circumstances those benefits will be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">That being the case, and in light of our conclusion related to the occupancy of the van, a complete analysis of these facts requires consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>of pip benefits with respect to the van and the trailer, and then of uninsured motorist benefits also with respect to the van and the trailer. The trial court and the Court of Appeals failed to reach the trailer issue or the uninsured motorist benefits issue, presumably because both courts found the plaintiff to be an occupant of the van at least for purposes of pip benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">a. pip benefits: the van</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The defendant argues at length that \u00a7 3111 of the no-fault act applies to the current situation because it concerns accidents occurring out of state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Personal protection insurance benefits are payable for accidental bodily injury suffered in <em>an accident occurring out of this state, </em>if the accident occurs within the United States, its territories and possessions or in Canada, and the person whose injury is the basis of the claim was at the time of the accident a named insured under a personal protection insurance policy, his spouse, a relative of either domiciled in the same household <em>or an occupant of a vehicle involved in the accident </em>whose owner or registrant was insured under a personal protection insurance policy or has provided security approved by the secretary of state under, subsection (4) of section 3101. [MCL 500.3111; MSA 24.13111. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor the trial court discussed this section in resolving the present case. The plaintiff\u2019s brief, without explanation, simply states: \"The Court of Appeals was correct in not discussing MCL 500.3111 [MSA 24.13111]. It was not applicable to this lawsuit.\u201d We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The basic facts of this case are not in dispute, and it is clear the accident occurred in Ohio. Therefore, \u00a7 3111 directly applies, placing its inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>pretation at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A careful reading of \u00a7 3111 demonstrates that, in order to recover the plaintiff must establish a number of criteria, only two of which are at issue. The plaintiff must show that he is 1) an occupant 2) of a vehicle involved in the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A negative answer to either question would dispose of the issue; however, because the definition of occupant has been the source of many disputes and has caused as many courts to agonize over what that definition should be, we are determined to resolve the confusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In <em>Nickerson, supra, a </em>pre-no-fault case, the plaintiff was a passenger in an insured automobile operated in Davison, Michigan. The car became disabled, and the occupants, while waiting for assistance, were standing outside of the vehicle. An uninsured vehicle struck the disabled vehicle from behind, pushing it into the plaintiff and causing serious injury. <em>Id. </em>at 326. The terms of the disabled vehicle\u2019s insurance policy provided the plaintiff with uninsured motorist benefits only if he was \"occupying the insured automobile.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>328. In interpreting the policy\u2019s definition of \"occupying\u201d: \"in or upon or entering into or alighting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>from,\u201d this Court held that the plaintiff, because he was \"occupying\u201d the insured vehicle immediately before the accident and because his subsequent injury arose out of its use or repair, was entitled to uninsured motorist protection. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 331-332.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">While <em>Nickerson </em>was based on pre-no-fault law, the occupant issue was raised again in the context of the no-fault act in <em>Royal Globe, supra. </em>In that case, the driver stopped in the driveway while his spouse got out of the vehicle and proceeded to walk through the garage to enter the house. When the driver began backing the vehicle into the garage it accidentally accelerated, striking the driver\u2019s spouse. The dispute was between two insurance companies to determine which was responsible for paying no-fault benefits. Resolution of the case turned on whether the injured party was an occupant of the vehicle involved in the accident as that term is used in the no-fault act. <em>Royal Globe </em>at 567-569.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In holding that <em>Nickerson </em>did not control the <em>Royal Globe </em>decision, this Court distinguished <em>Nickerson </em>in a number of ways \u2014 the most significant of which was the simple fact that <em>Nickerson </em>was a pre-no-fault act case and, thus, only required an interpretation of the insurance policy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 572-573. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">It is a familiar and fundamental rule of construction of a private automobile insurance policy that the court\u2019s first duty is to determine, from the language used, the apparent intention of the contracting parties, and then to construe doubtful or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ambiguous terms favorably to the insured and against the insurer as the contract drafter. The language of a statute, on the other hand, is required to be construed by assigning to the words used their primary and generally understood meaning consistent with the apparent intention of the Legislature in enacting the law. <em>[Id. </em>at 573. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Furthermore, we opined that \"if this Court had not found Nickerson to be an occupant of the Parvin vehicle, Nickerson would have had no recovery for his injuries under the insurance policy since the vehicle which caused his injuries was uninsured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In deciding to follow <em>Nickerson </em>in this case, the Court of Appeals failed to acknowledge the significance of the adoption of the no-fault act, which was passed in the time between the <em>Nickerson </em>and <em>Royal Globe </em>decisions. It also overlooked that by the terms of the no-fault act, essentially all accidents are now covered by personal injury protection benefits or the assigned claims plan. Therefore, the repeal of the uninsured motorist statute and passage of the no-fault act largely eliminated the motivating factors underlying the <em>Nickerson </em>decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Bradley v Mid-Century Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 1, 52-54; 294 NW2d 141 (1980) (Justice Levin writing for the Court), and <em>Lankford v Citizens Ins Co, </em>171 Mich App 413, 420; 431 NW2d 59 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Furthermore, we determined in <em>Royal Globe </em>that the purposes of the no-fault act would be better served \"by the certainty and predictability that a literal construction of the word 'occupant\u2019 will yield, when it is assigned its primary and generally understood meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. Therefore, we reaffirm our decision in <em>Royal Globe </em>that our task is to interpret the statute and not the policy. Where insurance policy coverage is directed by the no-fault act and the language in the policy is intended to be consistent with that act, the language should be interpreted in a consistent fashion, which can only be accomplished by interpreting the statute, rather than individual policies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The question is whether, for purposes of pip benefits, the plaintiff was an occupant of the van, as that term is used in \u00a7 3111, when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">At the time of the accident the plaintiff was attempting to right the overturned and disconnected trailer some ten to twenty feet away from the van from which he had departed. As we said in <em>Royal Globe, </em>\"Whatever her status was after she left the motor vehicle in the street and walked some 60 feet to the rear of the garage where the Pontiac struck her, [she] was 'not an occupant\u2019 of the vehicle when she was injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Although the no-fault act does not define the terms occupant or occupying, other sections of the act provide guidance in determining its meaning. Subsection 3106(l)(c) of the act states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">Accidental bodily injury does not arise out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a parked vehicle as a motor vehicle unless . . . the injury was sustained by a person while <em>occupying, entering into, </em>or <em>alighting from </em>the vehicle. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Legislature expressly recognized that \"entering into\u201d and \"alighting from\u201d are acts separate from \"occupying\u201d a vehicle. See <em>Royal Globe, supra </em>at 574, n 5. Section 3111 does not include \"entering into\u201d or \"alighting from\u201d the vehicle as acts that would trigger personal protection benefits for an out-of-state accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">By giving the term occupant its primary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>generally understood meaning coupled with the above statutory reference, we conclude that the plaintiff was not an occupant of the van because he was not physically inside the van when the accident occurred. We find this interpretation consistent with our <em>Royal Globe </em>decision and the intent of the no-fault act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">b. pip benefits: the trailer</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">While the parties mainly base their respective claims on the question whether the plaintiff was an occupant of the van, the plaintiff, albeit briefly, also contends that he was an occupant of the trailer and that the trailer was a \"covered vehicle\u201d under the Hawkeye policy covering the van. The trial court and the Court of Appeals did not find it necessary to make a determination whether the plaintiff was an occupant of the trailer because they concluded that he was an occupant of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">As far as pip benefits are concerned, the analysis of whether plaintiff was an occupant of the trailer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>is similar to that discussed above with respect to the van. We acknowledge that occupying the trailer is a closer question than occupying the van. However, in addition to the fact that the lower courts did not address this issue, the record is inadequate for its resolution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In the trial court, Hawkeye argued that the plaintiff should seek recovery from the insurer of the trailer, acia. MCL 500.3114(4)(a); MSA 24.13114(4)(a). The trial court held that the trailer was a \"covered auto\u201d under Hawkeye\u2019s policy for purposes of priority, while also holding that the plaintiff was an occupant of the van. A careful reading of the statute and policy show that this holding was reached without a complete analysis. As we stated above, the statute controls the awarding of pip benefits, while the insurance policy controls the uninsured motorist benefits. And, just as it is necessary to determine whether plaintiff was an occupant of the van or trailer for purposes of pip, as well as for uninsured motorist benefits, it is also necessary to provide the same type of analysis regarding the question of \"covered vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Agay\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>C. UNINSURED MOTORIST BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The trial court also awarded uninsured motorist benefits. Any claim for these benefits must be based on the policy, which requires that the injury have occurred by accident and have been sustained by a \"covered person.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To be considered a \"covered person\u201d the injured party must be the insured, a family member of the insured, or any other person <em>occupying </em>the <em>covered auto. </em>These questions must be asked with respect to the van and the trailer, and, because we are dealing with uninsured motorist benefits, the policy definitions control.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">1. THE VAN</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">As far as the van is concerned, it is obvious that it is a covered auto under the policy; however, because the Court of Appeals did not address this issue, we are left without the benefit of its analysis, and therefore we refrain from deciding the issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>2. THE TRAILER</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">With respect to the trailer, Hawkeye concedes that it is a covered auto under the policy with respect to uninsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> What is at issue, and what was not discussed by the courts below, is whether the plaintiff was occupying the trailer as the term is defined in the insurance policy. Some of the same concerns that arise here were discussed above, regarding the applicability of the statutory definition of occupant to the trailer for purposes of pip benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the matter is remanded to that Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, the Court of Appeals is ordered to consider:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">1) For purposes of pip benefits, whether Rohlman was an occupant of the trailer and, if so, whether the trailer was a covered vehicle;</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">2) For purposes of uninsured motorist benefits, whether Rohlman was occupying either the van or the trailer, as it is defined in the Hawkeye policy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-9\">Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\"> While the statute uses the term \"occupant\u201d and the insurance policy uses the term \"occupying,\u201d we do not perceive any intended difference in meaning on the basis of different forms of the word.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\"> In determining the question of occupancy, the trial court relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nickerson v Citizens Mutual Ins Co, </em>393 Mich 324; 224 NW2d 896 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-5\"> The policy and the statutes relating thereto must be read and construed together as though the statutes were a part of the contract, for it is to be presumed that the parties contracted with the intention of executing a policy satisfying the statutory requirements, and intended to make the contract to carry out its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">A policy of insurance must be construed to satisfy the provisions of the law by which it was required, particularly when the policy specifies that it was issued to conform to the statutory requirement; and where an insurance policy has been issued in pursuance of the requirement of a statute which forbids the operation of a motor vehicle until good and sufficient security has been given, the court should construe this statute and the policy together in the light of the legislative purpose. [12A Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a745:694, pp 331-332.]</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The definition[s] in an automobile liability insurance policy required by statute, of the motor vehicles covered by it, [are] to be construed with reference to statutes with which it was intended to comply ....

We do not agree. The Legislature has enacted a specific section of the no-fault act that applies to accidents occurring out of state, and it seems evident that this section ought to take priority over other sections that may arguably apply in a collateral manner to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\"> The plaintiff was not the named insured, nor was he the spouse of, or related to, the named insured. Thus, the only way the plaintiff can recover under \u00a73111 is to establish himself as \"an occupant of a vehicle involved in the accident . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Section 3111 also requires that the vehicle involved in the accident be insured under a personal protection insurance policy or other approved security. In this case, the van was insured by defendant Hawkeye, and the trailer was insured by defendant Automobile Club of Michigan (acia).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> Because of our resolution of the occupant issue it is unnecessary to decide whether the van was a vehicle involved in the accident under \u00a7 3111.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> While the act does not define \"occupant\u201d as used in \u00a7 3111, the policies in question in <em>Nickerson </em>and <em>Royal Globe </em>both had definitions of the term materially indistinguishable from the definition given in the Hawkeye policy in the instant case, which is: \"in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\"> In this case it is true that the plaintiff is also without insurance of his own; however, the result is unique and would only apply in very isolated instances. The plaintiff was out of state when the accident occurred. If the accident occurred in-state he would have been covered by the assigned claims plan of the no-fault act. MCL 500.3172(1); MSA 24.13172(1). Also, the case takes on added importance because, while the factual situation is fairly unique and isolated, the Court of Appeals interpretation of occupant would extend to other provisions of the no-fault act. Affording solicitude to an insured in a private-party contract setting is far different from interpreting a statutory provision that would have ramifications throughout the no-fault act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> In this case, as in <em>Royal Globe, </em>we have a situation in which the policy language provides a definition of occupant different from, and possibly broader than; the no-fault act. However, the issue was not argued by the litigants in <em>Royal Globe, </em>nor has it been presented by the parties in this case. In arguing that the policy definition of occupying controls, the plaintiff merely asks us to limit our <em>Royal Globe </em>decision to priority disputes between insurance companies and to apply <em>Nickerson </em>in those fact-sensitive cases where the plaintiff otherwise would not be entitled to a recovery as proposed by the dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We emphasize that under the facts of this case and according to the arguments presented by the parties, the statute controls, and we do not deal with the question whether the policy can and, if so, did provide coverage broader than that required by the no-fault act. Although we reserve the issue for a case in which the issue is properly before us, we note the following from Couch, n 3 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 45:697, p 334.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">A compulsory insurance statute in effect declares a minimum standard which must be observed, and a policy cannot be written with a more restrictive coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">The statute is manifestly superior to and controls the policy, and its provisions supersede any conflicting provisions of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">[although an insurer may not by its contract restrict its coverage to less than that required by statute, it may contract for a broader coverage than the statutory liability, as, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>instance, with respect to territory, amount, circumstances of operation, etc., and in such case recovery is measured solely by the policy. The fact that the coverage of the policy may be broader than that required by statute is immaterial, for the contract of the parties may be enforced as written. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 45:699, p 336.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b652-9\"> The dissent would hold that plaintiff was an occupant of and was occupying the van. Justice Levin states that he \"would adopt the same approach [reading the policy definition of occupant into the no-fault act] in construing the term 'occupant\u2019 as used in \u00a7 3111.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Interestingly, in <em>Heard v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 139; 324 NW2d 1 (1982), Justice Levin used the same type of analysis to hold that a person who was pumping gasoline at a self-service gas station was not an occupant of his vehicle when it was struck by another vehicle. Mr. Heard had not purchased no-fault insurance, and, as a result, he would not have been entitled to pip benefits under the no-fault act if his vehicle was involved in an accident while he was occupying it. Justice Levin held that \"[b]ecause Heard\u2019s uninsured vehicle was not involved in the accident and he was a pedestrian and not a motorist or occupant of a motor vehicle (or, if one prefers, he was more like a pedestrian than a motorist or occupant), he is as much entitled \u2014 under the terms and policies of the no-fault act \u2014 to recover from the insurer of the vehicle that struck him as is a pedestrian . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146 (parenthetical in the original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b653-5\"> The record is sparse regarding whether the trailer had the capacity to be occupied. Plaintiff was never in, nor was he attempting to get into, the trailer. Nobody was riding in the trailer, and presumably it was filled with drums, sound and lighting equipment, and dance costumes. Furthermore, the witnesses were inconsistent with respect to the dimensions of the trailer \u2014 testimony revealed it was four feet wide, five to eight feet long, and two and one-half to five feet tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Additionally, the record is inconsistent with respect to exactly where the plaintiff was when the accident occurred. The medical records state: \"This is a twenty-eight year old white male was [sic] brought in by rescue squad. The patient states that he was walking when a car crossed the mid-line. The patient tried to jump out of the way but was hit in the left leg.\u201d The plaintiff also told his treating physician that \"he was a pedestrian struck by a car.\u201d Although the trial court found differently, we note the inconsistencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> As far as pip benefits are concerned, \u00a7 3111 controls, and it requires that the <em>vehicle </em>involved in the accident be <em>covered </em>by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>personal protection insurance policy. See n 6 and accompanying text. It is evident that the van was a <em>vehicle covered </em>under Hawkeye\u2019s policy. For the trailer, however, the issue is more complex. The statute defines \"[mjotor vehicle\u201d as \"a vehicle, including a trailer, operated or designed for operation upon a public highway by power other than muscular power which has more than 2 wheels.\u201d MCL 500.3101(2)(e); MSA 24.13101(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"A8Am\">However, the insurance policy contains a different definition of \"covered auto.\u201d Hawkeye contends that the statute controls for purposes of pip benefits; however, it does not contest the applicability of the policy definition for purposes of 'uninsured motorist benefits, which makes the trailer a covered auto for those benefits. The plaintiff argues that the policy definition controls exclusively. The Court of Appeals did not have to deal with this issue because it ended its analysis with the van. We think the parties are entitled to have this issue resolved.

Nickerson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>injured when the vehicle he was standing next to was struck by an uninsured motorist. He, like Rohlman, had left the vehicle because of a vehicle-oriented incident during the journey. Rohlman was injured within two minutes of the time that the trailer became detached from the van, and within ten to twenty feet of the van. His hands and body were literally \"on\u201d and \"upon\u201d the trailer, which, until it became detached, had been hitched to the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Courts generally construe the \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d language to include a person who leaves a vehicle before the termination of the journey, intending to resume occupancy of the vehicle, and who is injured, within a reasonable geographic perimeter of the vehicle, while servicing the vehicle or engaging in other \"vehicle-oriented\u201d conduct. See part n.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The analysis in the post-no-fault case, <em>Royal Globe Ins Co v Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co, </em>419 Mich 565; 357 NW2d 652 (1984), concerning the meaning of the term \"occupant\u201d as used in the no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>fault act, is not applicable in the instant case because the policy of insurance provides greater coverage to a person \"occupying\u201d a vehicle than is provided to an \"occupant\u201d under \u00a7 3111, as that term is being construed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Courts generally hold that a policy of insurance may provide greater coverage than is statutorily mandated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority concludes that the question whether the policy definition of \"occupying\u201d was broader than the term \"occupant\u201d as used in \u00a7 3111 of the no-fault act was not \"presented by the parties, the statute controls, and we do not deal with the question whether the policy can and, if so, did provide coverage broader than that required by the no-fault act.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We would not read the presentations of the parties so .narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The majority is quite insistent on a literal reading of the term \"occupant\u201d as used in \u00a7 3111. It avoids deciding whether the Hawk eye policy provides coverage broader than is required by the no-fault act, and thus need not decide whether to follow the same literal construction approach to provide no-fault coverage for Rohlman under the circumstances that (i) the <em>no-fault endorsement </em>in the policy of insurance specifically provides no-fault coverage to a person who is \"occupying an auto if the accident takes place outside Michigan,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (ii) the \"definitions\u201d of the policy, including the definition of \"occupying,\u201d apply to the no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>endorsement, (iii) \"occupying\u201d is defined to provide \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d coverage; (iv) this Court in <em>Nicker-son, </em>a factually similar case, ruled that there was coverage under the \"upon\u201d language.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The question whether Rohlman can recover under the uninsured motorist coverage should not be affected by the majority\u2019s decision not to decide the question whether Rohlman can recover no-fault benefits under the no-fault endorsement of the policy defining \"occupying\u201d to include an injury suffered \"upon\u201d the vehicle. Resolution of the question whether Rohlman can recover under the uninsured motorist coverage depends solely on whether he was \"occupying\u201d the minivan <em>or </em>trailer within the meaning of the policy. The answer to that question does not turn at all on legislative intent, but rather on a construction of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">This Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Nickerson, </em>construing the \"upon\u201d language in a similar insurance policy, surely requires affirmance of at least the $20,000 uninsured motorist award to Rohlman. In <em>Nicker-son, </em>the vehicle in which Nickerson was riding stalled on the highway, and he helped push it to the side of the road before reentering it. A passing motorist stopped, and Nickerson again left the vehicle and walked to the front of the vehicle. An uninsured vehicle then struck the insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In the instant case, an uninsured vehicle struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>the trailer that Rohlman was attempting to right. The factual circumstances are almost identical to Nickerson. Hawkeye has conceded that the trailer was a \"covered auto\u201d for uninsured motorist purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">There is no need or justification for remand to the Court of Appeals concerning the applicability of the uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We would thus affirm the $20,000 uninsured motorist award on the authority of <em>Nickerson. </em>We would also affirm the $24,770 no-fault award on the authority of <em>Nickerson </em>and the language of the policy enlarging the no-fault coverage to include a person \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d the insured vehicle in the very situation covered by \u00a7 3111, an out-of-state accident. Rohlman\u2019s conduct was vehicle oriented; he was \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d the van within the meaning of those words as construed by this Court in <em>Nickerson </em>and by courts in at least eighteen other jurisdictions, even though he was ten to twenty feet from the van when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">The majority\u2019s bright-line approach, building on <em>Royal Globe </em>and concluding that the term \"occupant\u201d requires that the injured person have been \"physically inside\u201d the vehicle, will tend to eliminate priority disputes between insurers under \u00a7\u00a7 3114<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 3115<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">A number of courts have assimilated the jurisprudence developed in the construction of \"on\u201d and \"upon\u201d in the medical expense and uninsured motorist endorsements (see part n) when Constru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>ing the term \"occupant\u201d or \"occupying\u201d as used in their no-fault laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We would adopt the same approach in construing the term \"occupant\u201d as used in \u00a7 3111. The failure to do so may transfer to Michigan taxpayers the cost of providing medical and long-term care for Michigan residents seriously injured in vehicle-oriented out-of-state accidents; this the Legislature did not intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The automobile insurance policy language, providing that \"occupying\u201d means \"in, upon, getting in, on, out or off,\u201d has been a feature of automobile policies before the enactment of no-fault laws. The language precedes the uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This language generally has been construed to provide medical expense<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and uninsured motorist coverage<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to persons who are not physically in a vehicle when an accident occurs where, as in the instant case, the injured person physically occupied the insured vehicle before the accident, the accident occurred shortly after the injured person ceased physically to occupy the vehicle, the egr\u00e9ss of the injured person from the vehicle occurred during a journey, not at the termination of the journey, the injured person left the vehicle because of an emergency necessitating servicing or other \"clearly vehicle-oriented\u201d conduct, and the injured person intended to resume occupancy as soon as possible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">At least eighteen jurisdictions have so construed the words \"on\u201d or \"upon.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d language appears to have been first construed by courts in deciding whether medical expense payments coverage was applicable. About forty-five years ago, in <em>Madden v Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>82 Ohio App 111; 37 Ohio Op 456; 79 NE2d 586 (1948), the insured had <em>changed a tire </em>and was injured when struck by another vehicle while he was placing the removed tire in the trunk. The Ohio Court of Appeals rejected the insurer\u2019s argument that the injured person was not \"in\u201d or \"upon\u201d or \"alighting\u201d or \"entering\u201d the vehicle when he was injured, and awarded medical expense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Soon thereafter, in <em>Lokos v New Amsterdam Casualty Co, </em>197 Misc 40, 41; 93 NYS2d 825 (1949), the injured person recovered medical expense where the bumper of his automobile had fallen to the pavement and was hanging on one side.

He never turned aside from this mission and was in fact in the process of resuming his physical contact with the vehicle when injured. <em>[Id., </em>p 1318.][<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In <em>DeStefano v Oregon Mutual Ins Co, </em>762 P2d 1123 (Utah App, 1988), the Utah Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>allowed a driver to recover uninsured motorists benefits for injuries suffered as he <em>poured gasoline </em>into his disabled vehicle on the side of the highway.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Most recently, the Supreme Court of Tennessee allowed uninsured motorist recovery for a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>who stopped to assist a disabled motorist </em>and was crushed between his own automobile and the disabled vehicle when a third vehicle struck the disabled vehicle. <em>Tata v Nichols, </em>848 SW2d 649 (Tenn, 1993). After reviewing numerous authorities, the court said that the \"cases indicate the relationship contemplated, but they also demonstrate that 'upon\u2019 has no precise meaning except in the context of particular facts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">In <em>Estate of Cepeda v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>37 AD2d 454; 326 NYS2d 864 (1971), New York\u2019s intermediate appellate court determined that stepping out of an automobile is not, alone, determinative of occupant status. The decedents were passengers in an automobile that became involved in an accident on the highway. They left the vehicle, and were <em>walking to the rear of the vehicle to look for damage </em>when they were struck by an oncoming motorist. The New York court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">Not every physical departure from the vehicle results in termination of status as a passenger. Where the departure is incident to some temporary interruption in the journey of the vehicle, as when there is a mechanical failure and the passenger gets out to help or even to observe the work of the driver, he does not cease to be a passenger. The situation here is indistinguishable. Where the passenger alights following some temporary interruption at a place other than his destination, <em>remains in the immediate vicinity </em>of the vehicle and there is every reason to believe that, had it not been for the accident, he would shortly have resumed his place in the vehicle, his status as a passenger has not changed. <em>[Id., </em>pp 455-456. Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The focus on the relationship between the vehicle and the claimant supports the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>leaving a vehicle does not automatically terminate one\u2019s status as an occupant or passenger. In <em>Asnip v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co, </em>446 So 2d 1121 (Fla App, 1984), the Florida District Court of Appeals allowed recovery of both no-fault and uninsured motorists benefits to a driver injured while conversing with his friend on the side of the road. Asnip had been following a friend when the friend\u2019s <em>vehicle broke down. </em>He pulled over to the shoulder after his friend, and the two were discussing the breakdown when a third vehicle struck them. The court determined, as a matter of law, that the injured motorist was an occupant of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Courts have denied recovery when the injured party\u2019s connection to the vehicle was merely coincidental.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The approach adopted by this Court in <em>Nicker-son, </em>and by the courts in other jurisdictions in construing the \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d policy language in the context of medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage, has also been adopted by a number of courts in construing their no-fault acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">No-fault benefits were denied by the Florida Court of Appeals in <em>Industrial Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance Co v Collier, </em>334 So 2d 148, 149 (Fla App, 1976), because the injured person, who was struck while standing outside the vehicle with it jacked up, removing the spare tire, had not insured the vehicle, and no-fault benefits were not payable under Florida law to an owner while \"occupying\u201d \u2014 defined to mean \"in or upon, or entering into, or alighting\u201d \u2014 an uninsured owned vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">No-fault benefits were payable to persons injured in a service station when the radiator blew up when the attendant added water. The New Jersey Superior Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Important to the determination of this problem is the fact that Fountain <em>had not reached his destination at the time of the accident. </em>The stop at the gas station was incidental to the purpose of the trip. After the attendant serviced the car Fountain <em>would have returned </em>to the vehicle interior. To hold the status of Fountain as \"occupant\u201d changed because he exited for a brief moment would be to defeat the intent of the statute. Fountain at the time of the accident enjoyed the <em>status of \u2019\u2019occupant\u201d and is entitled to no fault bene\u00f1ts.

In awarding no-fault benefits, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">In general, it can be said that a person who is alighting from a vehicle is still an occupant thereof. He continues to \"occupy\u201d the motor vehicle until he severs all connection with it. <em>That point of severance is reached when he becomes highway oriented as opposed to being vehicle oriented. Until then, the alighting passenger continues to be an occupant of the bus. </em>Until such a person is on his or her own without reference to the bus, the person has not ceased to be a passenger or occupant. <em>[Id., </em>p 31.

The taxicab driver had been sitting in his parked vehicle for approximately twenty minutes. He left his vehicle and stopped at the cab in front of his to \"bum\u201d a cigarette. He testified that he intended to ask a friend if he wanted coffee, to go to a newsstand, and then meet his partner and exchange the cab for his partner\u2019s vehicle. The court determined that McGilley was not vehicle oriented, but rather was highway oriented at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In <em>Heard v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 139; 324 NW2d 1 (1982), the injured person sought to recover no-fault benefits for injuries suffered when he was struck by an automobile while he was pumping gasoline into a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>owned by him. The question presented was whether he should be denied no-fault benefits because he was the owner of an uninsured \"motor vehicle <em>involved </em>in the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">This Court held that Heard was entitled to no-fault benefits and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">[A] parked vehicle is not \"involved in the accident\u201d unless one of the exceptions to the parked vehicle provision (\u00a7 3106) is applicable. Those exceptions spell out when a parked vehicle is deemed to be in use as a motor vehicle; \"[e]ach exception pertains to injuries related to the character of a parked vehicle <em>as a motor vehicle </em>\u2014 characteristics which make it unlike other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents.\u201d <em>Miller v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>411 Mich 633, 640; 309 NW2d 544 (1981). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">At the time of the accident, Heard\u2019s vehicle was not in use as a motor vehicle; rather, it was like \"other stationary roadside objects that can be involved in vehicle accidents.\u201d Heard was entitled to pip benefits from State Farm. \u00a7 3115(l)(a). <em>[Id., </em>pp 144-145.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In the opinion, this Court used the term \"occupant\u201d in the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Because Heard\u2019s uninsured vehicle was not involved in the accident and he was a pedestrian and not a motorist or occupant of a motor vehicle (or, if one prefers, he was more like a pedestrian than a motorist or occupant), he is as much entitled \u2014 under the terms and policies of the no-fault act \u2014 to recover from the insurer of the vehicle that struck him as is a pedestrian or motorcyclist who does not own an automobile (or a pedestrian or motorcyclist who does own an automobile but who, like Heard, has not purchased no-fault insurance) and who also has not contributed \"to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>fund from which benefits are to be paid.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>p 146.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The issue in <em>Heard </em>was the meaning of \"involved,\u201d not \"occupant.\u201d The meaning of a word depends on context. Dictionary definitions of a word often contain a number of different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We acknowledge that \"occupant,\u201d when used in respect to the operation of a motor vehicle, generally means a person physically inside a vehicle. But the meaning of the terms \"occupant\u201d and \"occupying\u201d for purposes of insurance coverage, mandatory or not, is, as the foregoing review of authority in at least eighteen jurisdictions shows, broader and includes injuries suffered when an automobile journey is interrupted by an incident, such as a breakdown or need to service the insured vehicle or another vehicle, and the conduct of the injured person, within a reasonable geographic perimeter, is vehicle oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The insurance industry appears to have generally accepted the judicial construction of \"on\u201d or \"upon,\u201d and thus that injuries suffered after a breakdown, within a reasonable geographic perimeter, are within the insured risk if the conduct of the injured person is vehicle oriented. Automobile insurance policies generally continue to be written defining \"occupying\u201d as including injuries suffered \"on\u201d or \"upon\u201d the vehicle. The Legislature, in drafting and enacting the no-fault law, did not write on a clean slate, but in that context.

(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Courts have also allowed recovery in circumstances where the connection to the vehicle is not related to transportation purposes. The California Court of Appeals held that a person <em>standing in the street, next to a parked car and in conversation with its driver, was an occupant of his own vehicle, two parking spaces away </em>when he was hit by an uninsured motorist. <em>Utah Home Fire Ins Co v Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins Co, </em>14 Cal App 3d 50; 91 Cal Rptr 781 (1970). The New Jersey Supreme Court allowed recovery under the uninsured motorist provision of two insurance policies for injuries suffered by a person leaning on the roof and door of a vehicle while conversing with the vehicle\u2019s driver. <em>Mondelli v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>102 NJ 167; 506 A2d 728 (1986). The court determined that the injured party\u2019s connection to the insured vehicle was not coincidental, because he had repaired the vehicle earlier in the day and the conversation at the time of the collision concerned, in part, the owner\u2019s reaction to the sound of the repaired engine. The court expressed concern over the potentially narrow construction of policy language that could severely abridge the purposes of uninsured motorists coverage. It quoted the following passage from the opinion of a dissenting appellate division judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\"Many situations could arise where a person might be 'upon\u2019 the vehicle lawfully, although not 'immediately\u2019 using it or intending to use it for transportation, for example, repairing it, lashing baggage to the top of the vehicle even though it was not intended to be used that particular day or perhaps by that person as a means of transportation. Someone could even be sleeping in an automobile (an occupant in that car) in a parking lot, rest area or campground and an uninsured motorist could collide with the vehicle injuring its occupant. Although the insured in such a case would be 'in\u2019 the automobile, under the majority opinion it could be argued by a disclaiming insurer where another policy\u2019s [uninsured motorist] provision might be implicated that the automobile was not being or about to be immediately used as a means of transportation.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>p 172.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> In <em>Ferguson v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>369 SW2d 844 (Tex Civ App, 1963), a Texas appellate court denied recovery to a woman \u2022 who was injured when she <em>slipped in the mud </em>as she attempted to traverse a parking area, although she had grabbed the door handles of a nearby automobile. The claimant\u2019s only connection with the vehicle was her attempt to use it as a support along the treacherous pathway.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Courts have also denied recovery when the journey in which the injured passenger had participated had come to an end before the injury. In <em>Government Employees Ins Co v Keystone Ins Co, </em>442 F Supp 1130 (ED Pa, 1977), an automobile passenger left the vehicle in which he was riding, approached a second (uninsured) vehicle, jumped on its hood for the purpose of starting a fight, and was injured when the driver of the second vehicle accelerated suddenly. The court concluded that \"the only connection between [the passenger] and the Murray vehicle at the time of the injury was that [the passenger] had been riding in that vehicle when he decided to assault the person who subsequently injured him.\u201d In <em>Colonial Penn Ins Co v Curry, </em>157 Misc 2d 282; 596 NYS2d 317 (1993), the court denied recovery to a person who sought to be covered solely because he was leaning on a truck with one foot resting on its running board when the truck was struck by another vehicle. Curry had no other connection to the vehicle \u2014 he had not been a passenger in the vehicle, he was not about to become a passenger in the vehicle, he was not entering or alighting from the vehicle.
