We hold the ordinance to be unreasonable and beyond the authority of the city to exercise the power of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">In April 1974, the City of Lansing entered into a franchise agreement with Continental Cablevision, Inc., providing Continental with the nonexclusive right to operate its cable system in the City of Lansing. This agreement was amended several times and is currently in effect until the year 2004. Among other requirements, Continental agreed to provide nine designated access channels, an emergency override system, universal service, and to pay three percent of its gross revenues as a franchise fee to the city, retaining 0.35 percent of its gross revenues for funding of community cable services.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Defendants Rose own two apartment complexes, Trappers Cove and Waverly Park. In August 1980, Rose\u2019s predecessors in interest entered into a private agreement with Continental providing Continental with the exclusive right to install and operate its cable system for the properties. The agreement provided for amendment, modification, or cancellation if agreed to in writing by both parties, and established the fights and obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>of the parties upon termination. On December 23, 1986, Rose gave Continental notice of an intention not to renew the contract upon its expiration on June 30, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rose also informed Continental of an intention to install a private cable system, a \"satellite master antenna television system\u201d (smatv), which would provide comparable cable service to the tenants of the apartment complexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In March 1987, Continental submitted a proposed ordinance to the city that would prohibit an owner of a multiple-unit residential dwelling from interfering with a tenant\u2019s choice to receive cable service from the city\u2019s franchisee. On June 1, 1987, the city adopted ordinance 753, providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">No owner, agent or representative of the owner of any dwelling shall directly or indirectly prohibit any resident of such dwelling from receiving cable communication installation, maintenance and services from a Grantee operating under a valid franchise issued by the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">If an owner refused access by the franchised cable service, upon request of the franchisee the city could commence condemnation proceedings. The franchisee was responsible for indemnification of all expenses and costs incurred by the city. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Rose indicated that it would refuse access to Continental upon expiration of their agreement, and on June 11, 1987, Continental requested that the city commence condemnation proceedings. On August 31, 1987, the city council passed resolution no. 446, providing that the city council deemed \"multi-channel catv service to Trappers Cover [sic] and Waverly Park to be in the public interest, and to constitute both a public use and a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>purpose.\u201d Pursuant to the authority of ordinance 753, the city resolved to retain an appraiser to determine the fair-market value of Rose\u2019s property occupied by Continental, to make an offer to purchase the property, and to take steps necessary to acquire the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 9, 1987, the city council passed resolution no. 557, confirming \"its finding in Resolution 446 that the service provided by Continental Cablevision, as a licensed franchisee, to residents of Trappers Cove and Waverly Park, is in the public interest, and constitutes a public use, a public purpose, and a public necessity.\u201d Resolution 557 also authorized the city attorney to take steps to acquire Rose\u2019s property pursuant to the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, MCL 213.51 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 8.265(1) <em>et seq., </em>including offering to purchase the property from Rose or, failing an agreement regarding the purchase, filing a complaint asking the court to \"ascertain and determine just compensation to be paid for the acquisition of the Property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Following the inability of the parties to agree to the purchase, on March 3, 1988, the city filed two complaints for condemnation. Rose filed its answers and affirmative defenses, as well as motions to review necessity pursuant to MCL 213.56(1); MSA 8.265(6)(1). The two cases were consolidated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and a bench trial proceeded considering the necessity of the proposed taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The trial court denied Rose\u2019s motions to review necessity and upheld the validity of the condemnation proceedings. After the jury was impaneled to determine just compensation, Rose\u2019s application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals was granted and all proceedings in the trial court were stayed. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding the proposed condemnation exceeded the city\u2019s authority to take private property through eminent domain. The Court concluded that \"the primary beneficiary of the taking is not the public, but rather Continental Cablevision.\u201d 192 Mich App 551, 557; 481 NW2d 795 (1992). Further, \"the proposed condemnation is an attempt by a private entity to use the city\u2019s taking powers to acquire what it could not get through arm\u2019s length negotiations with defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The city\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court was granted on November 4, 1992.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Resolution of the question posed in this case requires that we turn first to our state and federal constitutions, mandating that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. Const 1963, art 10, \u00a7 2; US Const, Am V. Because a municipality has no inherent power to condemn property even for public benefit or use,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the power of eminent domain must be specifically conferred upon the municipality by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>statute or the constitution, or by necessary implication from delegated authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The city commenced this action for condemnation pursuant to the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, MCL 213.56; MSA 8.265(6), to secure for use by Continental that portion of Rose\u2019s property required for operation of Continental Cable services. However, the ucpa does not confer upon a city the power of eminent domain, but rather \"provides standards for the acquisition of property by an agency, the conduct of condemnation actions, and the determination of just compensation.\u201d MCL 213.52(1); MSA 8.265(2X1). Hence in order to employ the procedures of the ucpa, a city must be authorized to exercise its power of eminent domain by a statutory or constitutional delegation of such power. In the instant case, the city asserts authority to condemn Rose\u2019s property pursuant to a general statute applicable to acquisitions by state agencies and public corporations and the home rule cities act. MCL 117.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2071 <em>et seq. </em>MCL 213.23; MSA 8.13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">Any public corporation . or state , agency is authorized to take private property necessary for a public improvement or for the purposes of its incorporation or for public purposes within the scope of its power for the use or benefit of the public and to institute and prosecute proceedings for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">A public corporation or state agency<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>menee condemnation proceedings when it has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">declared . . . public purposes within the scope of its powers make it necessary, and . . . that it deems it necessary to take private property for such . . . public purposes within the scope of its powers, designating the same, and that the improvement is for the use or benefit of the public. [MCL 213.24; MSA 8.14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In addition, the home rule cities act, MCL 117.4e; MSA 5.2078 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Each city may in its charter[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">(2) For the acquisition by . . . condemnation ... of private property ... for any public use or purpose within the scope of its powers, whether herein specifically mentioned or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">The home rule act is to be liberally construed. Const 1963, art 7, \u00a734.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although not a grant of authority, the home rule act provides a framework within which this Court reviews actions by a municipal corporation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The city is authorized to condemn private property for any public use within the scope of its powers. The cited enabling statutes, however, do not specifically authorize the takings in the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ent case. There is no state statute identifying as a public use or purpose the mandatory access onto private property by a city-franchised cable television provider. Ordinances passed under such general authority are open to inquiry by the courts and, in order to be held valid, must be reasonable and not oppressive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Powers implied by general delegations of authority must be \"essential or indispensable to the accomplishment of the objects and purposes of the municipality.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">We are therefore required to determine whether ordinance 753 is reasonable and serves a public purpose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Ordinances are presumed to have a reasonable relation to a permissible governmental purpose. <em>Horton v Kalamazoo, </em>81 Mich App 78, 81; 264 NW2d 128 (1978). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the city\u2019s officials, but rather will determine whether the city\u2019s proposed conduct is \"within the range of conferred discretionary powers and then determine if it is reasonable.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Square Lake Hills Condominium Ass\u2019n v Bloomfield Twp, </em>437 Mich 310, 317; 471 NW2d 321 (1991). Although we assume the validity of the public interest advanced by the city, we find that the private interest to be benefited predominates over the asserted public interest. The asserted public interest therefore does not justify the proposed taking of private property by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">While this is an issue of first impression in Michigan, several states have enacted legislation requiring some type of mandatory access to rental properties by franchised cable services. Some statutes have been held to be invalid because they failed to provide just compensation for the property taken to install and operate the cable systems.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Other statutes would preclude the city\u2019s action in the present case if Rose\u2019s smatv service is considered comparable to the catv provided by Continental.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Still others are distinguishable from the city\u2019s ordinance in the present case because they require a tenant request for cable services before a cable operator must be provided access to residential property.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Other out-of-state statutes if in effect in Michigan would appear to prohibit Rose from refusing Continental access to the property.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not persuaded, however, that the judicial interpretation of those statutes is applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The New Jersey Court of Chancery determined that the purpose of the state law mandating access to multiple-dwelling units was to prevent landowners from excessively charging tenants who desire franchised cable services. <em>Princeton Cablevision, Inc v Union Valley Corp, </em>195 NJ Super 257; 478 A2d 1234 (1983). In the present case, the city does not assert that a purpose .of its proposed conduct was to protect Rose\u2019s tenants from discriminatory rates by Rose or that Rose was gouging the tenants with regard to previous franchised cable services or its current smatv services.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">In New York, the supreme court, again confronted with a state legislative enactment, reviewed the state statute articulating the public purposes to be furthered by cable television. <em>Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp, </em>53 NY2d 124, 139-140; 440 NYS2d 843; 423 NE2d 320 (1981).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court determined that the tenant\u2019s right to receive communications, the educational and community aspects of catv, the assurance of maximum penetration by cable systems, and the promotion of its rapid development, supported the mandatory access statute in light of previous \"onerous fees and conditions\u201d imposed by landlords on franchised cable systems that inhibited the franchised systems. <em>Id. </em>at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"AtM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The Michigan Legislature has not enunciated as a general public purpose that city-franchised cable operators have mandatory access to all rental properties. There is no extensive regulation of the industry or any legislative pronouncement of the public benefits of franchised cable services as in New York and New Jersey.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the city passed ordinance 753 without an express delegation of authority by the state, we may review the city\u2019s asserted public purpose. Judicial deference granted state legislative determinations of public use<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is not similarly employed when reviewing determinations of public purpose made by a municipality pursuant to broad, general enabling statutes. Thus, we scrutinize the city\u2019s actions bearing in mind that a state statute would affect all municipalities in Michigan and several cable companies, while ordinance 753 is directed toward and would benefit a single private entity, Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616, 629; 304 NW2d 455 (1981), this Court addressed a proposed taking that benefited a private entity. The precise issue considered was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">Can a municipality use the power of eminent domain granted to it by the Economic Development Corporations Act, MCL 125.1601 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3520(1) <em>et seq., </em>to condemn property for transfer to a private corporation . . . ?_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The \"heart\u201d of the dispute was \"whether the proposed condemnation [was] for the primary benefit of the public or the private user.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. The role of this Court to review whether the project was for the primary benefit of the public was limited, mainly because of three circumstances: 1) the Legislature had determined that the government conduct proposed by the city served \"an essential public purpose,\u201d 2) the Legislature expressly delegated to municipalities the authority to determine if a proposed project constituted a public purpose,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 3) the city followed all procedures established in the legislative enabling statute. <em>Id. </em>at 632-633. The Court then held that the proposed project was a valid exercise of the city\u2019s power of eminent domain, finding: 1) the benefit to the municipality was clear and significant, 2) the project was an intended and legitimate object of the Legislature, 3) the power to undertake the proposed action was expressly delegated the municipality, and 4) the public benefit predominated over the benefit received by the private party. <em>Id. </em>at 634. Because a private party would benefit from the city\u2019s proposed project, eminent domain would not be proper without substantial proof that the public would be the primary beneficiary of the project. <em>Id. </em>Where the project \"benefits specific and identifiable private interests,\u201d the assertion of a predominant public interest will be examined by the Court with \"heightened scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634-635.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">Such public benefit cannot be speculative or marginal but must be clear and significant if it is to be within the legitimate purpose as stated by the Legislature. <em>[Id. </em>at 635.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Hence, where a proposed government action confers a benefit on a private interest, unless that benefit is merely incidental, a reviewing court will inspect with heightened scrutiny the assertion by the governmental entity of a public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In the present case, as discussed above, there is no determination by the Legislature that the city\u2019s proposed action serves an essential public purpose. The Legislature did not delegate to the city the power to condemn private property for the purpose of providing mandatory access by a city-franchised cable system. Although the city will retain ownership of the easement it proposed to obtain through condemnation, Continental will receive more than an incidental benefit. The easement will not merely provide access for public, education, and government (peg) channels or an emergency override, but will allow Continental to offer its full panoply of services to the tenants of Rose\u2019s apartments.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Continental could receive substantial revenue through subscription payments and increased market value of its overall system. We therefore apply heightened scrutiny to the city\u2019s assertion that a public interest is predominant because a \"specific and identifiable\u201d interest will be benefited by the city\u2019s proposed action. Finally, as explained below, the asserted benefit to the public is not clear and significant, and does not predominate over the specific and identifiable private interest of Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The city asserts that the requirements of peg channels, universal service, and emergency over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ride support its determination of public use.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with the conclusion by the Court of Appeals that the requirement of universal service is not, in and of itself, a public purpose. 192 Mich App 556. If the service does not further a public purpose, then universal provision of that service does not advance a public purpose. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the universal service requirement is primarily a restraint on the franchised cable operator, precluding the company from refusing service to poorer communities. <em>Id. </em>It is not an enabling provision authorizing the cable operator to demand access to every dwelling despite the owner\u2019s desire for such service. We also agree with the conclusion by the Court of Appeals that the emergency override capacity of catv is largely duplicative of commercial stations and does not support invasion of an owner\u2019s private property. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We do not dispute that peg channels can provide the public with political and educational benefits. In fact, Congress has declared that government has a substantial interest in ensuring the continuation and availability of both local origination programming and local noncommercial educational stations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Despite these clear statements of policy recognizing the benefits to the public pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>vided by the availability of peg channels,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in light of the countervailing private benefits conferred by the mandatory access ordinance, we find that the primary beneficiary of this ordinance is Continental, a private user, not the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Ordinance 753 presents no definition of the public purpose allegedly served by requiring access by its franchised cable operator. Resolution 446 includes three asserted purposes: to encourage growth, development, and responsiveness of Continental; to encourage provision by Continental of the widest possible diversity of information; and to promote competition and minimize unnecessary regulation that might impose undue economic burdens on the cable system.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In light of Continental\u2019s extensive private interest, we find these asserted rationales for mandatory access to Rose\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>properties to be insufficient to overcome Rose\u2019s right to exclude others from its private property.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">There is no explanation regarding how mandatory access to Rose\u2019s two apartment complexes encourages growth, development, and responsiveness of Continental, or how such access encourages Continental to provide the widest possible diversity of information. Mere statements that a proposed action furthers a public benefit are not conclusive. <em>Cincinnati v Vester, </em>281 US 439, 447; 50 S Ct 360; 74 L Ed 950 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The argument is persuasive that ordinance 753 will not increase competition in the cable industry. While allowing Continental to initiate condemnation proceedings to secure cable access to any dwelling in Lansing, no corollary rights are granted other cable systems. Continental will be guaranteed the ability to compete with private cable systems where it decides to compete, without an equivalent right of competition guaranteed to private systems. Access to private dwellings pursuant to ordinance 753 is enforceable only by the franchised cable operator.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Neither Rose, the city, nor tenants could initiate condemnation proceedings to ensure competition of cable systems. Moreover, Continental has entered into exclusive cable service contracts in ninety percent of its contracts in Lansing. Even if private systems were allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>to compete, ninety percent of the market is already secured by Continental.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Finally, the proposed action would regulate cable services beyond limits established by Michigan or the federal government. In the 1992 Cable Act, Congress amended several provisions regulating the cable industry. Although a mandatory access provision was contemplated, it was deleted before the Cable Act was enacted. Such a deletion is evidence of Congress\u2019 intent not to provide for mandatory access. <em>Cable Holdings of Georgia, Inc v McNeil Real Estate Fund VI, Ltd, </em>953 F2d 600, 607 (CA 11, 1992). In the provision as it was considered, if equivalent services were provided by an owner, access by franchised catv was not required. The owner had the choice either to provide comparable services or be subject to mandatory access by the franchised cable operator.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The city\u2019s proposed conduct to require mandatory access by its franchised cable operator, Continental, onto Rose\u2019s private property does not result from a state legislative pronouncement of public purpose, nor has the Legislature specifically delegated to municipalities the authority to undertake the actions proposed by the city. Rather, the city enacted resolutions 446 and 557 on the basis of its own general assertion that mandatory access by its only franchisee furthers a public purpose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The conduct by the city, however, benefits Continental, a specific and identifiable private interest. We are persuaded that this benefit to Continental predominates over the asserted public benefits. The ordinance and resolutions are therefore invalid as unreasonable because the public would not be the primary beneficiary. Hence, the proposed conduct is beyond the city\u2019s authority to exercise the power of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b764-6\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\"> The cable service agreement was extended until September 30, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Resolution no. 446 indicated that multichannel catv services to Waverly Park and Trappers Cove would:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">2. . . . encourage the growth and development of cable systems and assure that cable systems are responsive to the needs and interests of the City and its residents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">3. . . . assure that Continental Cable provides and is encouraged to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public including informing the public of the operation of local, state and federal government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhG\">4. . . . promote competition in cable communications and minimize unnecessary regulation that will or might impose an undue economic burden on cable systems ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> 441 Mich 880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\"><em> Sinas v City of Lansing, </em>382 Mich 407, 411; 170 NW2d 23 (1969); <em>Kalamazoo v Titus, </em>208 Mich 252; 175 NW 480 (1919).

It is instructive to note here that, although considered, a mandatory access provision was not included in the Cable Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">In 1984, Congress stated that one purpose of the Cable Communications Policy Act was to promote competition in the cable industry. See 47 USC 521(6). Because of continued high concentration in the cable industry, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 again addressed the need to encourage competition and alternative sources of programming. For instance, in \u00a7 2(a)(2) of the 1992 act, findings and policy, Congress states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">For a variety of reasons, including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable system faces no local competition. The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Therefore, one of the purposes of the 1992 act is to \"ensure that cable television operators do not have undue market power vis-\u00e1-vis video programmers and consumers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2(b)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> A component of a private owner\u2019s property rights is the right to exclude others. <em>Loretto, supra, </em>458 US 435; <em>Cable Holdings of Georgia, Inc v McNeil Real Estate Fund VI, Ltd, </em>953 F2d 600, 605 (CA 11, 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"> The landowner in <em>McNeil, </em>n 27 <em>supra, </em>asserted that mandatory access by the franchised cable company would be anticompetitive. Nonfranchised cable companies would be at a competitive disadvantage because the right of access was enforceable only by the franchised cable operators. <em>Id. </em>at 607. The court noted that although they would not reach that issue, even the federal Cable Act did not create such an \"unequal regime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, n 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> Furthermore, if ordinance 753 were held to be valid, all of Continental\u2019s contracts would violate the mandatory access provision. Assuming another cable system could enter the market because the city has granted a nonexclusive franchise to Continental, if such a system were granted a franchise, it would be entitled to mandatory access to all dwellings, even those in which Continental has exclusive contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> The Michigan Legislature has enacted no provisions regarding the regulation of access by the public to catv.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b764-7\">Mat.lf.tt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">(dissenting). The majority concludes that the private benefit to Continental \"predominates over the asserted public benefits,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the \"ordinance[s] and resolutions are therefore invalid as unreasonable because the public would not be the primary beneficiary.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">In <em>Poletown Neighborhood Council v Detroit, </em>410 Mich 616, 632; 304 NW2d 455 (1981), this Court succinctly stated the guidelines for determining whether a particular condemnation is within the scope of the city\u2019s power of eminent domain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACg\">All agree that condemnation for a public use or purpose is permitted. All agree that condemnation for a private use or purpose is forbidden. Similarly, condemnation for a private use cannot be authorized whatever its incidental public benefit and condemnation for a public purpose cannot be forbidden whatever the incidental private gain. The heart of this dispute is whether the proposed condemnation is for the primary benefit of the public or the private user.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The majority concludes that the public benefit of cable television service fails to outweigh the private benefit conferred upon Continental Cable-vision. However, when the benefits of cable service are considered in light of Continental\u2019s contractual obligations to the City of Lansing and the technological advances occurring rapidly in telecommunications, it becomes apparent that the public is the primary beneficiary of the condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The City of Lansing established that Continental provides a variety of services that Rose\u2019s satellite system \"does not, and cannot, provide.\u201d The majority fails to give due consideration to the breadth of services offered through the broadcast of public, educational, and governmental channels (peg channels). Continental currently offers nine peg channels. A government channel, broadcast from city hall, carries a host of political programs. Three channels offer telecourses from Michigan State University and Lansing Community College. These telecourses allow individuals with family and employment commitments to continue their education while at home. A designated public access channel provides a forum for citizens who traditionally have limited access to avenues for the dissemination of ideas. The franchise agreement requires Continental to provide equipment, training, and assistance to the public. Additionally, there are religious access, local origination, Lansing school district, and library peg channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The services and programming provided through the peg channels must be considered in accordance with Continental\u2019s contractual obligations and the ever-developing technology in order to ascertain the true public benefit. Continental has agreed, pursuant to the franchise agreement, to maintain state-of-the-art equipment and technology. This obligation is no small task, for even the casual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>observer of the evening news is aware of the almost daily advances being made in telecommunications. In an effort to meet this obligation, Continental is required to prepare periodically a report evaluating developments in technical programming service and the feasibility of implementation into its system. Some recent developments, including interactive two-way systems and on-screen home computer capabilities, indicate clearly that the vast potential of cable television service is coming to the fore.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Further, by agreeing to provide universal service, Continental has ensured that all residents, regardless of economic status, will have access to these services. The majority refers to the universal service requirement as a \"restraint on the franchised cable operator, precluding the company from refusing service to poorer communities.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I prefer to interpret the universal service requirement as a fundamental recognition by the franchised operator that the benefits of cable service should be realized by all segments of the community. In fact, there is evidence in the record suggesting that such a realization has already occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, when the peg channels, Continental\u2019s contractual obligations, and rapid technological advances are considered in the aggregate, I believe that the condemnation in the present case is for the primary benefit of the public user.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> <em>Ante </em>at 644.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\"> <em>Ante </em>at 640.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> The spring 1988 telecourse from Lansing Community College was received by eighteen students with a household income of less than $10,000, twelve students between $10,000 and $19,999, and thirty-three students between $20,000 and $29,999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b767-5\"> Because the majority does not reach the issues raised by the cross-appellant, I decline to do so as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
