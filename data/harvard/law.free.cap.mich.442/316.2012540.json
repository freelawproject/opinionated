The Bennetts, in challenging the requirements, are claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that their Fourteenth Amendment right to direct the education of their children should be classified as a \"fundamental right,\u201d thus making it impervious to the minimal scrutiny due process test. The state contends that the Court of Appeals properly applied the minimal scrutiny test and that the requirement was constitutionally justifiable. The defendants also claim that Michigan\u2019s compulsory education law, as applied, violated their statutory and due process rights because they were prosecuted without an administrative hearing to determine whether they were in compliance with the private and parochial schools act.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that a parent\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to direct a. child\u2019s education is not one of those rights described by the United States Supreme Court as fundamental, and, thus, the strict scrutiny test is unwarranted. We further hold that the defendants were entitled under the statute, as administrators of a private home school, to the hearing provided by the private and parochial schools act before they could be prosecuted as parents who failed to send their children to school in violation of the compulsory education laws. As a result, we vacate the defendants\u2019 convictions and order the state superintendent to conduct a hearing to determine if the defendants\u2019 home school satisfies Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">John and Sandra Bennett and their four children, Scott, Erika, Jason, and Krista, live in Wayne County. In 1986, the defendants were charged with four counts of failing to send their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>children to school during the 1985-86 school year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a trial before the 35th District Court, the defendants were found guilty and fined $50 for each count. The Wayne Circuit Court affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions. Although the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, their application was denied. Subsequently, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After considering the merits of the case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions. On a motion for rehearing, the Court of Appeals clarified part of its rationale, but again affirmed the convictions. 179 Mich App 225; 449 NW2d 899 (1989). Once again the defendants moved for leave to appeal to this Court, and again this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>time for reconsideration in light of <em>Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, </em>434 Mich 380; 455 NW2d 1 (1990). Again, the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions. 188 Mich App 447; 470 NW2d 433 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The crux of the defendants\u2019 convictions concerns their decision to withdraw their four children from public school. Dissatisfaction with the public school system was their stated reason for their action, not any religious belief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants believed that they could provide their children a better education than the local public school, even though neither defendant is a certified teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Defendants enrolled their children in the home based education program (hbep) sponsored by Clonlara, Inc., of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The hbep provides parents with a home instruction program, and allows parents to utilize the services of certified teachers and classrooms on the Ann Arbor campus. Defendants maintained that their children were often brought to the Ann Arbor campus and were instructed by certified teachers for a total of four to six hours per month.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even more frequent contact between the children and the Clonlara teachers was maintained through the use of conference telephone calls from the defendants\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Defendants stated that they held classes for their children approximately five hours per day, five days per week, for the entire school year and made monthly attendance reports to Clonlara. The children studied math, English, spelling, reading, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>writing, science, social studies, history, and art. At the beginning of the school year, defendants submitted proposals for four individualized curricula to the superintendent of the Plymouth-Cantori School District, the district in which the children had been attending school.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the end of the school year, standardized achievement test results indicated that three of the four children were either at or above their grade level.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Despite their attempts to teach their children at home, defendants were convicted of failing to send their children to school in violation of Michigan\u2019s compulsory education laws. The trial court found that the children were not being properly taught at home because the parents were not in compliance with Department of Education guidelines for educating children in the home.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>court found that 1) defendants failed to utilize the services of a certified teacher for at least a substantial portion of the school day, 2) there was no proof of use of a curriculum that was comparable to that used in the public school, 3) there was no evidence that the children were instructed for at least 180 days and 900 hours,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 4) there were no attendance records offered to substantiate the claims of the hours and days the children received instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The trial court paid particular attention to the defendants\u2019 claim that their children received instruction from certified teachers. Defendants asserted that two women. Pearl Wander and Julie Kuhar, provided instruction to the children. The court found, however, that the instruction provided by these women did not satisfy the state\u2019s requirements. Ms. Wander, for example, while certified to teach, was never shown to have actually visited the Bennett home. Instead, Ms. Wander had contact with the children through the occasional use of a speaker phone and the family\u2019s occasional visits to the Clonlara campus for a total of four to six hours per month. This contact, the court found, was not sufficient to meet the state\u2019s requirements. Rather, the court concluded, Ms. Wander\u2019s role with respect to the children was that of a supervisor, not a teacher.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Ms. Kuhar, the court noted that she was not in fact certified to teach at the time of her contact with the Bennett children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The fact that defendants were not substantially utilizing the services of a certified teacher and were not themselves certified to teach was sufficient for the trial court to find them guilty of failing to send their children to school. As a result, the trial court 1) required defendants to contact the local public school and arrange to have their children tested for the purposes of academic achievement and grade placement, 2) required defendants to immediately arrange for their children to be taught by certified teachers, and 3) fined each of the defendants $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">On appeal in the Court of Appeals, defendants raised five issues for review, two of which are now before this Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals first addressed the defendants\u2019 contention that the teacher certification requirement violated the Fourteenth Amendment right of parents to direct their children\u2019s education. It recognized the existence of the right and that the right was protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>under the personal substantive due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, it found that where the requirement was rationally related to some legitimate state purpose, the law would be upheld. The Court was satisfied that the state\u2019s purpose was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Court of Appeals then addressed the defendants\u2019 contention that the compulsory attendance law violated their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights. The right to notice and a hearing, defendants contended, was also required by the private and parochial school act, because their children could not be forced to attend a public or other approved private school until after a hearing established that defendants\u2019 \"home school\u201d did not comply with the act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The Court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>however, on the ground that defendants had no school to close. Recognizing that \"school\u201d was not defined in the private and parochial schools act, the Court stated that the Legislature could not have envisioned the type of home-based program defendants utilized when it enacted the law in 1921. On the contrary, citing an opinion of the Attorney General, the Court of Appeals stated that only under limited circumstances can a home-based program become a school. <em>People v Bennett, </em>unpublished opinion of the Court of Appeals, decided August 8, 1989 (Docket No. 109010) (citing OAG, 1979, No 5579 [September 27, 1979]). The Court noted that the Attorney General found that when a parent holds a Michigan teaching certificate and provides instruction and sanitary conditions comparable to the public schools, the parent is providing his child with an education from a private school. The Court pointed out again that neither defendant was certified to teach and that the school district made no finding of comparable curricula. As a result, the Court found that the defendants\u2019 home program was not a \"school\u201d within the meaning of the private and parochial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>schools act and that defendants were not entitled to any hearing before prosecution under the compulsory education laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Satisfied that the statutes at issue were consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive and due process guarantees, the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendants\u2019 convictions and denied their requested relief on all issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Defendants argue that there is state and federal case law in support of their contention that, as parents, they have a fundamental right to direct their children\u2019s education.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not, however, find that the cited cases should be so interpreted. Indeed, we have not found and defendants have not presented <em>any </em>case that finds the existence of a Fourteenth Amendment fundamental right of parents to direct their children\u2019s secular education free of reasonable regulation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that parents <em>do not </em>have such a constitutional right requiring a strict scrutiny standard. On the contrary, the state may reasonably regulate education, including the imposition of teacher certification and curricula requirements on home-school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>programs, in order to advance the legitimate interest of compulsory education.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Defendants contend that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees them the <em>fundamental </em>right to direct the education of their children, even when the desire to direct education does not stem from any religious belief. Defendants cite <em>Pierce v Society of </em>Sisters, 268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925), for the proposition that it is beyond a state\u2019s authority to interfere with parents\u2019 choice of private education for their children. Similarly, defendants argue, the State of Michigan is telling parents that their children may be taught only by state-certified teachers, the same type of teachers who teach in public schools. Without explicitly so stating, defendants infer that because the state requires the same type of teachers for both private<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and public schools, it is blurring the distinction between these schools and thus interfering with a parent\u2019s right to choose private schools for their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Defendants also quote at length from <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205; 92 S Ct 1526; 32 L Ed 2d 15 (1972), which held that parents have the right to take their children out of high school and give them informal vocational training in order to protect sincerely held religious beliefs. The defendants noted in <em>Yoder </em>that the Supreme Court emphasized the case involved the \"fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of the State, to guide the <em>religious </em>future and education of their children. The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of paren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>tal concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on most of the cases cited is misplaced because those cases deal with religious issues under the First Amendment. This case is specifically not about religion and must be so considered. For example, in a broad sense, <em>Pierce </em>stands for the proposition that parents have a right to choose either public or private education for their children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In a narrow sense, <em>Pierce </em>has been interpreted as providing parents the right to direct the religious education of their children.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In no sense, however, has <em>Pierce </em>been interpreted to mean that parents have a fundamental right to direct all of their children\u2019s education decisions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Pierce </em>does not, therefore, stand for the position that parents have a fundamental right to direct their children\u2019s education under all circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and so the defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Pierce </em>for this reason is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The defendants\u2019 misplaced reliance on <em>Yoder </em>is even more obvious. Hardly a page of that opinion can be read without seeing at least one reference to the parents\u2019 religious beliefs. Indeed, the Court discussed the case in terms of having to balance the state\u2019s interest in universal education with the First Amendment and \"the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children . . . .\u201d <em>Yoder, </em>406 US 214 (citing <em>Pierce, </em>268 US 535). In determining that the parents in <em>Yoder </em>could remove their children from school after the eighth grade in spite of the compulsory education laws, the Court specifically noted that it was dealing with a \"centuries-old religious society,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and not \"with a way of life and mode of education by a group claiming to have recently discovered some 'progressive\u2019 or more enlightened process for rearing children for modern life.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 argument that <em>Yoder </em>lends support to the claim that parents have <em>any </em>rights to remove their children from school for nonreligious reasons is completely without merit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In further support of their contention that the Fourteenth Amendment provides a fundamental right to direct the education of their children, defendants cite <em>Meyer v Nebraska, </em>262 US 390; 43 S Ct 625; 67 L Ed 1042 (1923), in which the state tried to prohibit private, denominational, parochial, or public schools from teaching in any language other than English to students who had not reached the eighth grade. Defendants contend that this case stands for the proposition that the state could not interfere in parental choices for children\u2019s education in this manner because it interfered \"with the power of parents to control the education of their own children.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Meyer, </em>262 US 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Meyer </em>is misplaced partially for the same reason that reliance upon <em>Pierce </em>is misplaced.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At issue in <em>Meyer </em>was whether a statute that prohibited teaching foreign languages denied the defendant teacher his liberty as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 262 US 399. The only reference to parental rights in the entire opinion consists of one sentence noting that the ban on languages had the effect of interfering with \"the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401. While <em>Meyer </em>may have made one general statement concerning parental rights to control their children\u2019s education, it certainly does not stand for the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees parents the fundamental right to di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>rect their children\u2019s education free from reasonable regulation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Defendants contend that the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent affirmation of this fundamental right is found in <em>Employment Div, Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v Smith, </em>494 US 872; 110 S Ct 1595; 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990). <em>Smith </em>recognizes this parental right as fundamental, defendants contend, because it held that strict scrutiny must be applied when evaluating state actions that interfere with the rights of parents to direct their children\u2019s education. In support of this contention, defendants quote <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\"><em>Yoder </em>said that \"the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pierce </em>stands as a charter of the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. And, when the interests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim . . . more than merely a \"reasonable relationship to some purpose within the competency of the State\u201d is required to sustain the validity of the State\u2019s requirement under the First Amendment. [Id. at 881, n 1 (quoting <em>Yoder, </em>406 US 233).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">This, defendants conclude, \"reaffirms the applicability of the compelling interest test to a claim of Fourteenth Amendment parental rights standing alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Perhaps the defendants\u2019 most creative interpretation is of the <em>Smith </em>decision. The quotation above explicitly states that it is only when the interests of parenthood are combined with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Free Exercise Clause (a claim defendants are not making) that parents are entitled to constitutional protection of a fundamental right. Nowhere in the opinion does the Court make as bald a statement as the defendants\u2019 reading of <em>Smith. </em>Rather, as the state pointed out, defendants ignored <em>Smith\u2019s </em>clear language and persistently maintain their position despite a directly contradictory holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">These cases, defendants are convinced, exemplify the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of a Fourteenth Amendment fundamental right in parents to direct the education of their children. When considered with other cases that defendants argue apply the fundamental rights of parents found in <em>Pierce </em>to home-school situations,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> they are convinced that the constitution guarantees them the fundamental right to educate their children at home. They may teach their children on their own, defendants conclude, because if the Fourteenth Amendment allows them to direct their children\u2019s education, they ought to be able to provide that education themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Clearly the Supreme Court cases to which defendants refer do not support their contentions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Similarly, the home-school cases do not support the defendants\u2019 claims. The parents in <em>Mazanec v North Judson-San Pierre School Corp, </em>614 F Supp 1152 (ND Ind, 1985), aff\u2019d 798 F2d 230 (CA 7, 1986), <em>Ellis v O\u2019Hara, </em>612 F Supp 379 (ED Mo, 1985) , rev\u2019d on other grounds 802 F2d 462 (CA 8, 1986) , and <em>Care and Protection of Charles, </em>399 Mass 324; 504 NE2d 592 (1987), all taught their children at home because of religious convictions. In fact, the <em>Mazanec </em>court specifically held that \"within the ambit of the free exercise clause [there is] a constitutional right to educate ones [sic] children in an educationally proper home environment . . . .\u201d 614 F Supp 1160. These cases do, indeed, recognize the choice of a home school as protected under a parent\u2019s fundamental right, but only under the fundamental right to direct a child\u2019s religious education.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Also of interest is the fact that, while defendants cited no Michigan home-school cases, there are at least two that are directly relevant. One is of particular importance because defendants were parties. In <em>Clonlara, Inc v Runkel, </em>722 F Supp 1442 (ED Mich, 1989), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan held that defendants (and one other home-school couple)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">may have the right to choose home based education over public school education or other private school education. However, such home schooling, in the absence of a claim based on religious beliefs, may be subject to reasonable government regulation. Plaintiffs here have no fundamental right to educate their children at home free from reasoriable government regulation. <em>[Id. </em>at 1458.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>In <em>Hanson v Cushman, </em>490 F Supp 109 (WD Mich, 1980), home-school parents argued that parents\u2019 fundamental rights to direct their children\u2019s education arose from the penumbrae of the First, Ninth, and the Fourteenth Amendments. However, the court rejected this argument for basically the same reasons that the arguments here fail. See id. at 112-114. Although the Hansons cited some of the same cases as the defendants (i.e., <em>Meyer, Pierce, Yoder, </em>etc.), the court pointed out that language taken from these cases was dicta at best. <em>Id. </em>at 112. While giving these cases due consideration, the court concluded that the Hansons\u2019 asserted rights were nothing more than personal or philosophical choices and were, therefore, not within the bounds of constitutional protection. <em>Id. </em>at 114. The court, too, concluded that there is no fundamental parental right to direct a child\u2019s secular education.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, defendants argue that this Court has already decided that the state cannot require certified teachers. In support of this argument, defendants refer to Justice Riley\u2019s conclusion in <em>Sheridan Rd Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462, 565; 396 NW2d 373 (1986), cert den 481 US 1050 (1987), confirmed by a majority of the Court in <em>Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, </em>434 Mich 380; 455 NW2d 1 (1990), as standing for the proposition that teacher certification requirements are not compelling enough to interfere with parental rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Defendants have completely misconstrued the context in which Justice Riley\u2019s statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>made. By reviewing Justice Riley\u2019s opinion in <em>Sheridan Rd, </em>it becomes clear that her reference to the Fourteenth Amendment was in connection with a First Amendment claim. Indeed, the entire thrust of the lawsuit pitted the state\u2019s interest in ensuring quality instruction in nonpublic religious schools against the parents\u2019 freedom of religion claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Despite defendants\u2019 contention, neither this Court nor any other court has held that parents have a fundamental right to direct their children\u2019s education under all circumstances. Rather, state interference with such rights deserves strict scrutiny only within the context of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Having found strict scrutiny unnecessary because of the absence of a fundamental right, the state\u2019s teacher certification requirement need only satisfy the minimal scrutiny test. Although not analyzed in the courts below<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or raised by the defendants before this Court or the courts below, the dissenting opinion concludes that the teacher certification requirement does not survive the \"reasonably related to a legitimate state interest\u201d standard applied to ordinary regulatory measures that affect nonfundamental rights.

We find these arguments to be unpersuasive. The fact that the state has not contested the adequacy of the defendants\u2019 instruction is irrelevant in light of the fact it is defendants\u2019 burden to prove the unreasonableness of the certification requirement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As Justice Mallett\u2019s dissent in <em>People v DeJonge (After Remand), </em>442 Mich 266, 304-305; 501 NW2d 127 (1993), points out, the mere existence of other, even less restrictive, home-school regulations in our sister states tells us little about those states\u2019 interests, whether they are the same as or different from Michigan\u2019s, and whether their regulations relate reasonably to those interests. And, in any event, the number of states that do not require certified teachers for home schools is not as universal as suggested. In addition to California, Alabama<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and Nebraska<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> require certified teachers, and the Kansas Supreme Court has found that the state\u2019s compulsory attendance laws, in effect, prohibit home schools.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We are simply unconvinced there is any reason to find that the teacher certification requirement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>anything but at least reasonably related to the state\u2019s legitimate interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the case at bench, it was incumbent upon defendants to show the unreasonableness of the certification requirement,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and they have been unable to do so. Neither the defendants nor the dissenters have cited, and we have not found, any case holding that a state\u2019s teacher certification requirement is unreasonable in its relationship to the state\u2019s legitimate interests. We are convinced, therefore, that the requirement is not unreasonable. Teacher certification can measure, and to some extent ensure, the minimum qualifications of each teacher. Certification, is, therefore, at least not an unreasonable way to further the state\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In arguing that they were entitled to a hearing,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> defendants contend that before they can be prosecuted under the compulsory attendance law,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> they are entitled to a hearing provided by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>private and parochial schools act.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Defendants assert that they are entitled to this hearing because they are a \"state approved school\u201d as defined by the School Code.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Defendants point out that there are no formal procedures for approving nonpublic schools; all that exist are procedures for finding that self-proclaimed nonpublic schools are not in compliance with the private and parochial schools act.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Defendants argue, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>they are a nonpublic school within the meaning of the law until the state superintendent finds them not to be in compliance with the private and parochial schools act. Furthermore, it is only after the superintendent finds them not to be in compliance that the state can prosecute them for failing to comply with the compulsory education laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">While we disagreed with defendants regarding the first issue, we agree that they were entitled to a hearing before being prosecuted under the compulsory education laws. This conclusion is complicated, however, by the absence of any Michigan statute relating specifically to home schools.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> While all may agree that such schools are not illegal per se,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> there is no agreement about how they should be run. The compulsory education laws require parents to send their children to public school, <em>unless </em>the children are attending \"state approved nonpublic school[s].\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Thus, a home school is valid only if it can be considered a state-approved nonpublic school. The School Code defines a \"state approved nonpublic school\u201d as one that meets the requirements of the private and parochial schools act.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Therefore, to be valid, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>home school must meet the requirements of the private and parochial schools act. Indeed, the state prosecuted defendants, inter alia, because their home-school program did not utilize the services of a certified teacher, nor did they provide proof of a curriculum comparable to that offered by the public school. These requirements are the same as those required by the private and parochial schools act. If defendants can be prosecuted for failing to comply with certain provisions of the private and parochial schools act, it would seem that there is no reason why all of the act\u2019s provisions should not apply to defendants, including the provision requiring a hearing before the state may close a nonpublic school.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">This position is supported by \u00a74 of the act, which imposes a duty upon the person responsible for enforcing the compulsory education laws,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> upon notice from the state superintendent that a nonpublic school is not in compliance with the act, to make sure that the children from the school are compelled to attend some other school.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> As amicus curiae Department of Education points out, these provisions cannot be confused simply because the school administrators and parents are the same people. As we read this provision, where home schools are involved, once the state superintendent determines that a home school is not in compliance with the private and parochial schools act, and that school is closed, the superintendent has a duty to notify the relevant school district\u2019s attendance officer. <em>At this </em>point, the attendance officer may initiate criminal proceedings against the parents for failing to send their children to school in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>violation of the compulsory education laws. In essence, what defendants argue is correct: before home-school parents can be prosecuted under the compulsory education laws for failing to send their children to \"school,\u201d it must first be determined that the involved home school does not meet the requirements of the private and parochial schools act.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The Court of Appeals rejected this argument because it decided defendants had no school to close. The Court based this decision on the findings that, inter alia, there were no certified teachers or comparable curricula; but this is precisely the criteria that the state superintendent reviews in determining whether a nonpublic school is complying with the private and parochial schools act.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Court found this treatment to be consistent with the Attorney General\u2019s treatment of the issue, but the Attorney General was construing the provisions relevant to private schools \u2014 just what defendants are arguing for here. It does not make sense that the Court of Appeals itself, albeit unknowingly, applied the private and parochial schools act criteria in order to say that defendants have no school, and then told defendants that because they were not a school, they were not entitled to the act\u2019s hearing provision. In fact, they are a school until a hearing produces a determination to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The state\u2019s argument makes the same mistake.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The state argues that the provisions of the private and parochial schools act are not the concern of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the prosecutor. Rather, the state argued, the prosecutor was only interested in prosecuting parents who failed to send their children to school.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Closing a home school for failing to comply with the private and parochial schools act, although in effect what the defendants\u2019 prosecution resulted in, was not the prosecutor\u2019s concern. But the prosecutor argued that defendants were not sending their children to school because the \"school\u201d to which the parents sent their children, inter alia, did not utilize a certified teacher or provide comparable curricula. Again, these are the same criteria the state uses to close nonpublic schools under the private and parochial schools act. Even though he does not realize it, the prosecutor is concerned with the act\u2019s provisions because, if he has been informed that the provisions were not complied with, he can prosecute home-school parents for failing to send their children to school. It is only fair, then, that if defendants are required to comply with the act\u2019s provisions, they should also be entitled to the act\u2019s hearing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide parents a <em>fundamental </em>right to direct their children\u2019s secular education, and, thus, the state regulation need only be judged by a rational relationship test. We further conclude that the defendants have not met the burden of establishing that teacher certification is not rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sonably related to the state\u2019s legitimate interest. Moreover, defendants were entitled, under the statute, as administrators of a private home school, to the hearing provided by the private and parochial schools act before they could be prosecuted as parents who failed to send their children to school in violation of the compulsory education laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendants\u2019 convictions for failing to send their children to school in violation of the compulsory education laws are vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-5\">Griffin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> Michigan\u2019s compulsory school attendance law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">[E]very parent, guardian, or other person in this state having control and charge of a child from the age of 6 to the child\u2019s sixteenth birthday, shall send that child to the public schools during the entire school year.

Although the Court of Appeals found that \"[t]he teacher certification requirement is a backbone in the protection of\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> state education, this contention is dubitable in the instant case.

Some recent United States Supreme Court dicta support this proposition. See, e.g., <em>Runyon v McCrary, </em>427 US 160, 178-179; 96 S Ct 2586; 49 L Ed 2d 415 (1975) (\"[t]he Court has repeatedly stressed that . . . [parents] have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation\u201d). Hence, some courts relying on that and earlier Supreme Court language have applied a reasonableness test. See, e.g., <em>Hanson v Cushman, </em>490 F Supp 109, 114-115 (WD Mich, 1980) (applying a reasonableness standard in upholding Michigan\u2019s teacher certification requirement as applied to home schools).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Yet, reliance on this dicta may be unwarranted because they appear to stem from the confusion arising from applying Supreme Court pronouncements of the 1920s and 1930s in modern cases. Earlier this century, the Supreme Court had yet to develop the varying degrees of scrutiny ubiquitously applied in the modern era. The recognition of a constitutional right did not necessarily result in a clear specification of the particular degree of scrutiny to be applied. In fact, the Court not only explicitly recognized <em>\"fundamental </em>rights of the individual which <em>[Meyer, supra; Bartels v Iowa, </em>262 US 404; 43 S Ct 628; 67 L Ed 1047 (1923); <em>Pierce, </em>supra] declared,\u201d <em>Farrington, </em>n 6 <em>supra </em>at 299 (emphasis added), but at the same time articulated a reasonableness standard. <em>Id. </em>at 298. See also <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 534 and <em>Meyer, supra </em>at 399-401 (recognizing fundamental parental rights, while utilizing a reasonableness standard). Adding to the confusion was the Court\u2019s practice to articulate a reasonableness standard, while the application of that standard often left no doubt that much stronger scrutiny was to be applied. See, e.g., <em>Lochner, </em>n 5 <em>supra </em>at 58 (striking down a maximum hour law for bakeries because there was \"no reasonable foundation for holding [it] to be necessary or appropriate as a health law\u201d). Later, the Supreme Court differentiated between constitutional rights, applying a low standard of review (now articulated as a reasonableness or rational basis test) to disfavored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>rights, while applying heightened review (now articulated as strict scrutiny) to \"fundamental rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8A\">As noted, the modern Supreme Court has cited the earlier Court opinions without much elaboration. Hence, modern Supreme Court dicta also support the proposition that the right to educate one\u2019s children is deserving of strict scrutiny. See, e.g., <em>Smith, </em>n 6 <em>supra </em>at 881 (equating the \"right of parents ... to direct the education of their children\u201d with \"freedom of speech and of the press\u201d); <em>Kelley v Johnson, </em>425 US 238, 244; 96 S Ct 1440; 47 L Ed 2d 708 (1976) (equating the liberty protected in <em>Meyer, supra, </em>with the liberties protected in <em>Roe v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 [1973] [right of abortion], <em>Eisenstadt v Baird, </em>405 US 438; 92 S Ct 1029; 31 L Ed 2d 349 [1972] [right to obtain contraceptives], <em>Stanley, </em>n 5 <em>supra </em>[right of an unwed father to retain custody of children], and <em>Griswold, </em>n 4 <em>supra </em>[right of married couples to use contraceptives]); <em>id. </em>at 482 (referring to the right to direct the education of one\u2019s children as if it were fundamental); <em>id. </em>at 498 (Goldberg, J.) (noting that the rights recognized in <em>Pierce </em>and <em>Meyer </em>are fundamental). Not surprisingly, some modern authorities have concluded that the right of parents to direct the education of their children is fundamental. See, e.g., <em>Dep\u2019t of Social Services </em>v <em>Emmanual Baptist Preschool, </em>434 Mich 380, 416; 455 NW2d 1 (1990) (Cavanagh, J.) and <em>Sheridan Rd Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462, 536-540; 396 NW2d 373 (1986) (Riley, J.), cert den 481 US 1050 (1987) (finding the right to direct the education of one\u2019s children to be a fundamental right); <em>Ohio v Whisner, </em>47 Ohio St 2d 181, 214; 351 NE2d 750 (1976) (\"it has long been recognized that the right of a parent to guide the education, including the religious education, of his or her children is indeed a 'fundamental right\u2019 guaranteed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d); Hafen, n 2 <em>supra </em>at 548 (concluding that the right to direct the education of one\u2019s children is \"almost beyond the reach of legislative regulation\u201d and that \"most of the Court\u2019s opinions recognizing constitutional rights in the adjudication of family interests have subjected the legislation involved to more than minimal scrutiny\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">In any event, the divergent holdings arise because \"[t]he Supreme Court has never addressed directly the full range of parental autonomy questions presented by the home education movement,\u201d Lupu, <em>Home education, religious liberty, and the separation of powers, </em>67 BULR 971, 975 (1987), but in fact \"has continued to do its best to avoid the development of a consistent and understandable test for its family-related cases,\u201d Hafen, n 2 <em>supra </em>at 468, n 15.</p>\n<p id=\"AsA\">Because of the historical recognition of the vital importance of the autonomy, of the family, I am inclined to apply strict scrutiny in the private and home school context (as a government-provided benefit and subsidization of a right, public schools need not be subjected to such scrutiny, <em>Rust v Sullivan, </em>500 US 173; 111 S Ct 1759; 114 L Ed 2d 233 [1991]). Nevertheless, I do not rest this opinion upon such an analysis, but apply the reasonableness standard because I find that the requirement is not reasonably related to education, thereby negating the necessity of determining whether the higher standard of review is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"> Although <em>Mathews, </em>applies the standard with regard to the rational basis test of equal protection, there is no difference in its application with regard to due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> <em>People v DeJonge (On Rehearing), </em>179 Mich App 225, 236; 449 NW2d 899 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Besides Michigan, only two states, California and Alabama, appear to require teacher certification in home' schools.

Cf. <em>Whisner, supra </em>at 216-218 (striking down comprehensive school regulations as violating the right to direct the education of one\u2019s children, as well as the free exercise of religion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\"> The majority\u2019s analysis is unconvincing and contrary to long-established Supreme Court authority. Although the majority purports to find that the teacher certification requirement is valid because it satisfies the \"minimal scrutiny test,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 336, in fact it applies no scrutiny at all. The majority, for instance, discards defendants\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ments without carefully examining the factual record, and then claims that defendants failed to meet their burden of proof. The United States Supreme Court, on the other hand, carefully examines the state interest, the means the state utilizes to reach those ends, and the effectiveness of the parents\u2019 instruction when examining state regulation of parents\u2019 liberty to educate their children. <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 534-535; <em>Farrington, supra </em>at 298. If the means the state undertakes to meet a legitimate interest are unrelated to the interest it is attempting to further, the statute violates the liberty to direct the education of one\u2019s children. See, e.g., <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 534-535. Extending the majority\u2019s reasoning to its logical conclusions, however, a prohibition of private education would almost certainly be found to be reasonably related to educational achievement because that assertion is \" 'at least debatable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 338 (citation omitted). Yet, the Supreme Court rejected such reasoning and declared those laws unconstitutional. <em>Pierce, supra </em>at 534-535. Similarly, the rationale of the majority would most likely find a state\u2019s prohibition of foreign language instruction to be reasonable because parents could not disprove a state\u2019s assertion that foreign language instruction threatens national security. Again, the Supreme Court has struck down such statutes. See, e.g., <em>Farrington, supra </em>at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"AoU\"><em>Pierce, Farrington, </em>and their progeny are indistinguishable from the instant case. In each case the state asserted an interest that may have facially appeared reasonable, but that was disputed by the available evidence. Defendants have met their burden by showing that they adequately educate their children and that the state\u2019s certification requirement is unrelated to educational achievement in home schools.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
