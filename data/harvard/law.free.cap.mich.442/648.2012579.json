But there are limits to such claims. In the context of foster care, the Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">[T]here are also important distinctions between the foster family and the natural family. First, unlike. the earlier cases recognizing a right to family privacy, the State here seeks to interfere, not with a relationship having its origins entirely apart from the power of the State, but rather with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>a foster family which has its source in state law and contractual arrangements. . . . [T]he liberty interest in family privacy has its source, and its contours are ordinarily to be sought, not in state law, but in intrinsic human rights, as they have been understood in \"this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d Here, however, whatever emotional ties may develop between foster parent and foster child have their origins in an arrangement in which the State has been a partner from the outset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">A second consideration related to this is that ordinarily procedural protection may be afforded to a liberty interest of one person without derogating from the substantive liberty of another. ... It is one thing to say that individuals may acquire a liberty interest against arbitrary governmental interference in the family-like associations into which they have freely entered, even in the absence of biological connection or state-law recognition of the relationship. It is quite another to say that one may acquire such an interest in the face of another\u2019s constitutionally recognized liberty interest that derives from blood relationship, state-law sanction, and basic human right \u2014 an interest the foster parent has recognized by contract from the outset. [431 US 845-846.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Likewise, the DeBoers acquired temporary custody of this child, with whom they had no prior relationship, through the power of the state and must be taken to have known that their right to continue custody was contingent on the completion of the Iowa adoption. Within nine days of assuming physical custody and less than one month after the child\u2019s birth, the DeBoers learned of Cara Schmidt\u2019s claim that the waiver of rights procured by the attorney acting on behalf of the DeBoers was unlawful because she had not been afforded the seventy-two hour waiting period required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Iowa law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within two months of the child\u2019s birth, the DeBoers learned of Daniel Schmidt\u2019s claim of paternity when on March 27, 1991, he filed a petition to intervene in the DeBoers\u2019 adoption proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The State of Iowa has not arbitrarily interfered \"in a family-like association freely entered.\u201d Rather, the Iowa courts have proceeded with the adoption action initiated by the DeBoers, and at the conclusion of that litigation ruled that there would be no adoption, preventing the creation of the family unit that was the objective of the adoption petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In Docket No. 96366,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for two independent reasons. First, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (uccja) and the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (pkpa) deprive the Michigan courts of jurisdiction over this custody dispute and require the enforcement of the orders of the Iowa courts directing that the Schmidts have custody of the child. Second, the DeBoers lack standing to bring this custody action under our decision in <em>Bowie v Arder, </em>441 Mich 23; 490 NW2d 568 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>In Docket Nos. 96441, 96531, and 96532<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we vacate the orders of the Washtenaw Circuit Court and direct that the action be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. While a child has a constitutionally protected interest in family life, that interest is not independent of its parents\u2019 in the absence of a showing that the parents are unfit. In this case, in the Iowa litigation the DeBoers were unable to prove that the child\u2019s father would not be a fit parent, and no claim has been made that her mother is unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The facts are set out at length in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. Briefly, on February 8, 1991, Cara Clausen gave birth to a baby girl in Iowa. Proceedings in Iowa have established that defendant Daniel Schmidt is the child\u2019s father. On February 10, 1991, Clausen signed a release of custody form, relinquishing her parental rights to the child. Clausen, who was unmarried at the time of the birth,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had named Scott Seefeldt as the father. On February 14, 1991, he executed a release of custody form.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">On February 25, 1991, petitioners Roberta and Jan DeBoer, who are Michigan residents, filed a petition for adoption of the child in juvenile court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>in Iowa. A hearing was held the same day, at which the parental rights of Cara Clausen and Seefeldt were terminated, and petitioners were granted custody of the child during the pendency of the proceeding. The DeBoers returned to Michigan with the child, and she has lived with them in Michigan continuously since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">However, the prospective adoption never took place. On March 6, 1991, nine days after the filing of the adoption petition, Cara Clausen filed a motion in the Iowa Juvenile Court to revoke her release of custody. In an affidavit accompanying the request, Clausen stated that she had lied when she named Seefeldt as the father of the child, and that the child\u2019s father actually was Daniel Schmidt. Schmidt filed an affidavit of paternity on March 12, 1991, and on March 27, 1991, he filed a petition in the Iowa district court, seeking to intervene in the adoption proceeding initiated by the DeBoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">On November 4, 1991, the district court in Iowa conducted a bench trial on the issues of paternity, termination of parental rights, and adoption. On December 27, 1991, the district court found that Schmidt established by a preponderance of the evidence that he was the biological father of the child; that the DeBoers failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Schmidt had abandoned the child or that his parental rights should be terminated; and that a best interests of the child analysis did not become appropriate unless abandonment was established. On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the termination proceeding was void with respect to Schmidt, and that the DeBoers\u2019 petition to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the child must be denied. Those decisions have been affirmed by the Iowa appellate courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On remand from the Iowa Supreme Court, the district court ordered the DeBoers to appear on December 3, 1992, with the child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The DeBoers did not appear at the hearing; instead, their Iowa attorney informed the court that the DeBoers had received actual notice of the hearing but had decided not to appear. In an order entered on December 3, 1992, the district court terminated the DeBoers\u2019 rights as temporary guardians and custodians of the child. The court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">Mr. and Mrs. De[B]oer have no legal right or claim to the physical custody of this child. They are acting outside any legal claim to physical control and possession of this child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">On the same day their rights were terminated in Iowa, the DeBoers filed a petition in Washtenaw Circuit Court, asking the court to assume jurisdiction under the uccja. The petition requested that the court enjoin enforcement of the Iowa custody order and find that it was not enforceable, or, in the alternative, to modify it to give custody to the DeBoers. On December 3, 1992, the Washtenaw Circuit Court entered an ex parte temporary restraining order, which directed that the child remain in the custody of the DeBoers, and ordered Schmidt not to remove the child from Washtenaw County.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">On December 11, 1992, Schmidt filed a motion for summary judgment to dissolve the preliminary injunction and to recognize and enforce the Iowa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>judgment. The Washtenaw Circuit Court held a hearing on Schmidt\u2019s motion on January 5, 1993. It found that it had jurisdiction to determine the best interests of the child. It denied Schmidt\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and directed that the child remain with the DeBoers until further order of the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On March 29, 1993, the Court of Appeals reversed<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Washtenaw Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Schmidt\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that court lacked jurisdiction under the uccja, and that under our decision in <em>Bowie v Arder, supra, </em>the DeBoers lacked standing to bring the action. 199 Mich App 10; 501 NW2d 193 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Following the Court of Appeals decision, on April 14, 1993, a complaint for \"child custody, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief\u201d was filed in Washtenaw Circuit Court. The plaintiff was described as \"Jessica DeBoer (a/k/a Baby Girl Clausen), by her next friend, Peter Darrow.\u201d Mr. Darrow, a Washtenaw County attorney, had been appointed as one of the co-guardians ad litem for the child in the earlier custody case. On that date, the Washtenaw Circuit Court entered an order appointing Darrow as next friend in the new action, and an order to show cause directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>DeBoers and Schmidts to appear on April 22. The latter included language that pending that hearing, \"the minor child\u2019s residence <em>status quo </em>shall be maintained.\u201d At the hearing on April 22, after hearing argument by counsel for the Schmidts and the DeBoers, the circuit court entered an \"order continuing status quo.\u201d It provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">1. The status quo as to the residence of the Plaintiff, Jessica DeBoer, with Defendants, Roberta and Jan DeBoer shall be maintained during the pendency of this action or until further order of this Court, or any appellate court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">2. Counsel for the parties, and all other interested persons, if they obtain permission from the Court, may file briefs on the legal and constitutional issues raised by this action within 21 days from the date of this Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">On April 27, 1993, the Schmidts filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. They also filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court before decision by the Court of Appeals under MCR 7.302(C)(1). On May 6, 1993, we granted the DeBoers\u2019 application in Docket No. 96366,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Schmidts\u2019 application for leave to appeal before decision by the Court of Appeals in Docket Nos. 96441, 96531, and 96532.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 442 Mich 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Interstate enforcement of child custody orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>has long presented vexing problems. This arose principally from uncertainties about the applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because custody decrees were generally regarded as subject to modification, states had traditionally felt free to modify another state\u2019s prior order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The initial attempt to deal with these jurisdictional problems was the drafting of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1968. 9 ULA 123. That uniform act has now been enacted, in some form, in all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Michigan version of the act is found at MCL 600.651 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27A.651 <em>et seq. </em>The act provides standards for determining whether a state may take jurisdiction of a child custody dispute,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and sets forth the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>in which the courts of other states are prohibited from subsequently taking jurisdiction,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are required to enforce custody decisions of the original state,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and are permitted to modify such decisions.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Despite the widespread enactment of the uccja, variations in the versions adopted in some states, and differing interpretations, resulted in continuing uncertainty about the enforceability of custody decisions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In 1980, Congress responded by adopting the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> 28 USC 1738A. The pkpa \"imposes a duty on the States to enforce a child custody determination entered by a court of a sister State if the determination is consistent with the provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Thompson v Thompson, </em>484 US 174, 175-176; 108 S Ct 513; 98 L Ed 2d 512 (1988). The pkpa includes provisions similar to the uccja, and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>phatically imposes the requirement that sister-state custody orders be given effect.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In its March 29, 1993, opinion, the Court of Appeals agreed with Daniel Schmidt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Washtenaw Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to modify the Iowa custody orders and was instead required to enforce them. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">Schmidt asserts that pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clauses in both the United States Constitution, US Const, art IV, \u00a7 1, and the uccja, MCL 600.663; MSA 27A.663, the Washtenaw Circuit Court was obligated to recognize and enforce the valid judgment from Iowa. Iowa exercised jurisdiction, entered a judgment, and retained jurisdiction. Iowa has continued to exercise jurisdiction throughout, even to holding the DeBoers in contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">We find that the Washtenaw Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to intervene in this case. The uccja has been enacted by every state, including Michigan. See 1975 PA 297. Its primary purpose is to avoid jurisdictional competition between states by establishing uniform rules for deciding when states have jurisdiction to make child custody determinations. MCL 600.651; MSA 27A.651. Pursuant to \u00a7 656(1) of the uccja, MCL 600.656(1); MSA 27A.656(1), Michigan is precluded from exercising jurisdiction if a matter concerning custody is pending in another state at the time the petition to modify is filed in this state. See <em>Moore v Moore, </em>186 Mich App 220, 226; 463 NW2d 230 (1990). An adoption proceeding is included in the definition of a custody proceeding under the uccja. MCL 600.652(c); MSA 27A.652(c). <em>Foster v Stein, </em>183 Mich App 424, 430; 454 NW2d 244 (1990). The DeBoers filed their petition in Washtenaw Circuit Court on December 3, 1992. On that date the Iowa district court entered an order terminating the DeBoers\u2019 rights as temporary guardians and custodians of [the child], and scheduled a hearing for the DeBoers to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. Although the issues concerning the dismissal of the DeBoers\u2019 adoption petition and the right to physical custody of [the child] had been determined by the Iowa Supreme Court before December 3, 1992, further proceedings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>scheduled in the case. Under \u00a7 656(1) of the uccja, the Washtenaw Circuit Court was precluded from intervening in this case, and was obligated to recognize and enforce the Iowa order of December 3, 1992. US Const, art IV, \u00a7 1; MCL 600.663; MSA 27A.663.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">We find that the DeBoers\u2019 contention that a Michigan court could modify the Iowa order because Iowa did not act substantially in conformity with the uccja by doing a \"best interests of the child\u201d analysis is without merit. The Iowa court dismissed the adoption petition and granted custody of [the child] to Schmidt because he was the biological father of the child and because his parental rights had not been terminated. The Iowa court found that Iowa statutes and case law did not require the type of best interests analysis sought by the DeBoers in Michigan unless statutory grounds for termination had been established. [199 Mich App 17-19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The DeBoers argue that the Iowa custody orders were subject to modification by Michigan courts because the Iowa proceedings were no longer \"pending\u201d under the uccja at the time the Washtenaw Circuit Court action was filed on December 3, 1992. They point to <em>Ford Motor Co v Jackson, </em>47 Mich App 700; 209 NW2d 794 (1973), for the proposition that an action is no longer pending once a final determination has been made on appeal. They maintain that when the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the judgment awarding custody to the natural father on September 23, 1992, and thereafter denied the DeBoers\u2019 request for rehearing, that made the decree final, and therefore modifiable. The only remaining matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in Iowa were hearings to enforce the final order. They maintain that such enforcement proceedings do not involve custody issues, and thus the proceeding with regard to custody was no longer pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">We reject the DeBoers\u2019 construction of the uccja.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Enforcement of the Iowa decision is required by the pkpa,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and therefore a detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>analysis of the uccja is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The congressionally declared purpose of the pkpa is to deal with inconsistent and conflicting laws and practices by which courts determine their jurisdiction to decide disputes between persons claiming rights of custody. Inconsistency in the determination by courts of their jurisdiction to decide custody disputes contributes to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">the disregard of court orders, excessive relitigation of cases, [and] obtaining of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions .... [PL 96-611, \u00a7 7(a)(3), 94 Stat 3569.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Congress also recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">among the results of those conditions and activities are the failure of the courts of such jurisdictions to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other jurisdictions . . . and harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians. [PL 96-611, \u00a7 7(a)(4), 94 Stat 3569.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">For these reasons, among others, Congress declared that the best interests of the child required the establishment of a uniform system for the assumption of jurisdiction to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-11\">(3) facilitate the enforcement of custody and visitation decrees of sister States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">(4) discourage continuing interstate controversies over child custody in the interest of greater stability of home environment and of secure family relationships for the child;_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>(5) avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between State courts in matters of child custody and visitation which have in the past resulted in the shifting of children from State to State with harmful effects on their well-being. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 7(c)(3)-(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The suggestion that in this context the best interests purpose of the pkpa mandates a best interests analysis in Iowa, failing which the Iowa decision is not entitled to full faith and credit, would permit the forum state\u2019s view of the merits of the case to govern the assumption of jurisdiction to modify the foreign decree. It also suggests that Congress intended to impose the substantive best interests rule in all custody determinations on the laws of the fifty states.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This interpretation is in conflict with the directive of Congress that \"[t]he appropriate authorities of every State shall enforce according to its terms, and shall not modify except as provided . . . any child custody determination made consistently with the provisions of this section by a court of another State.\u201d 28 USC 1738A(a).__</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>It has been aptly noted that the vulnerability of a custody decree to an out-of-state modification presented the greatest need of all for the reform effort of the pkpa. \"In language that is subject to little or no misinterpretation the jurisdiction of the initial court continues to the exclusion of all others as long as that court has jurisdiction under the law of that state and the state remains the residence of the child or any contestant.\u201d Baron, <em>Federal preemption in the resolution of child custody jurisdiction disputes, </em>45 Ark L R 885, 901 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Certainty and stability are given priority under the pkpa, which gives the home state exclusive continuing jurisdiction. Thus, the pkpa expressly provides that if a custody determination is made consistently with its provisions, \"[t]he appropriate authorities of every State <em>shall </em>enforce [it] according to its terms, and <em>shall not </em>modify\u201d that custody decision. 28 USC 1738A(a) (emphasis added). \"A child custody determination ... is consistent with the provisions [of the pkpa] only if \u201d the court making the determination had jurisdiction under its own laws, and the state was the \"home state\u201d of the child when the proceedings were commenced. 28 USC 1738A(c)(l). At the time of commencement of both the termination and adoption proceedings, Iowa unquestionably had jurisdiction under its own laws and Iowa was unquestionably the home state of the child. Thus, the child custody determination made by the Iowa court was made consistently with the provisions of the pkpa.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Where the custody determination is made consistently with the provisions of the pkpa, the jurisdiction of the court that made the decision is exclusive and continuing as long as that state \"remains the residence of the child or of any contestant,\u201d and it still has jurisdiction under its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>own laws.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 28 USC 1738A(d). Unquestionably, Daniel Schmidt continues to reside in Iowa. Furthermore, Iowa law provides for continuing jurisdiction in custody matters,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and the Iowa courts regarded themselves as continuing to have jurisdiction of the custody proceeding because they continued to issue orders in the case: the order of December 3, 1992, terminating the DeBoers\u2019 right to custody and appointing Daniel Schmidt as custodian, and the order of January 27, 1993, holding the DeBoers in contempt. Because the Iowa custody determination was made consistently with the terms of the pkpa, and because Iowa\u2019s jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion continues, the Iowa court\u2019s order must be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The courts of this state may only modify Iowa\u2019s order if Iowa has declined to exercise its jurisdiction to modify it. 28 USC 1738A(f). Iowa has not declined to exercise its jurisdiction to modify its custody order; it has simply declined to order the relief sought by the DeBoers. Modification is not permitted on these facts:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Iowa continues to have jurisdiction, it has not declined to exercise that jurisdiction, its jurisdiction is, therefore, exclusive, and Iowa\u2019s exclusive continuing jurisdiction precludes the courts of this state from exercising jurisdiction to modify the Iowa order.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The uccja and the pkpa are legislative responses to the concerns expressed by Justice Jackson regarding the failure to recognize a custody judgment of a sister state. \"A state of the law such as this, where possession is not merely nine points of the law but all of them and self-help the ultimate authority, has little to commend it in legal logic or as a principle of order in a federal system.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, the uniformity of decisions contemplated by Congress cannot be realized if \"judicial home-state favoritism and the substitution of 'the best interest of the child\u2019 inquiry for jurisdictional inquiry . . . promote continuing custody litigation . . . .\u201d Blakesley, <em>Child custody </em>\u2014 juris<em>diction and procedure, </em>35 Emory LJ 291, 359 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">The pkpa does indeed preempt state law in the resolution of jurisdiction^ disputes. Initial custody jurisdiction is limited to just one forum \u2014 the home state. Modification jurisdiction is exclusively re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>served to the court that rendered the initial decree. Notice and opportunity to be heard must be given prior to a custody determination. Sister states are required to enforce those decrees and give them full faith and credit. Sister states are prohibited from interfering with those courts which are properly asserting jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">Custody litigation is full of injustice \u2014 let there be no doubt about that. No system of laws is perfect. Consistency in the application of the laws, however, goes a long way toward curing much of the injustice. While the laws of the fifty states may vary as to the substantive rules in custody determinations, at least there is a uniform standard imposed equally on all the states by the pkpa for determining which court makes that determination. The pkpa and its preemptive effect can no longer be avoided. [Baron, <em>supra </em>at 912.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The DeBoers argue that the Iowa judgment should not be enforced because the Iowa courts did not conduct a hearing into the best interests of the child in making the custody decision. They maintain that this undercuts the Iowa decision in two respects. First, they say this means that the Iowa decision was not in conformity with the uccja,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and therefore not entitled to enforcement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>that statute.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Second, they believe that the Iowa proceeding was repugnant to Michigan public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We reject the contention that the decision of the Iowa courts not to conduct a best interests of the child hearing in the circumstances of this case justifies the refusal to enforce the Iowa judgments.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The uccja and the pkpa are procedural statutes. To be sure, they express the purpose of assuring that the state that is in the best position to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>a proper determination regarding custody of the child be the one in which the action is brought, and that other states will follow the decision made there. That purpose has been achieved in this case. There can be no doubt that at the time the Iowa proceedings commenced in February 1991, that state was the appropriate one to take jurisdiction; it was in the best position to resolve the issues presented. As was conceded by counsel for the DeBoers during oral argument, the statutes do not provide that a best interests of the child standard is the substantive test by which all custody decisions are to be made. Each state, through, legislation and the interpretative decisions of its courts, is free to fashion its own substantive law of family relationships within constitutional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Further, we do not find the Iowa proceedings to be so contrary to Michigan public policy as to require us to refuse to enforce the Iowa judgments. Before turning to Michigan public policy, however, a preliminary matter must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">After passage of the pkpa, we are not free to refuse to enforce the Iowa judgment as being contrary to public policy. That statute says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">The appropriate authorities of every State shall enforce according to its terms, and shall not modify except as provided in subsection <em>(f) </em>of this section, any child custody determination made consistently with the provisions of this section by a court of another State. [28 USC 1738A(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Subsection (f) does not provide a basis for declining to enforce the Iowa order. For the first time at oral argument, the DeBoers asserted that the order was not made consistently with the pkpa. As they contended regarding the uccja, they think an order is not made consistently with the statute if a best interests of the child test is not Used. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ever, they point to no provision of the statute with which the Iowa courts did not comply, and they cite no authority for their interpretation of the PKPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Turning to the matter of Michigan public policy, while in many custody disputes Michigan does apply a best interests of the child test, there are circumstances in which we do not. For example, \u00a7 39 of the Adoption Code has a pair of provisions regarding the termination of parental rights of putative fathers who seek custody of a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">(1) If the putative father does not come within the provisions of subsection (2), and if the putative father appears at the hearing and requests custody of the child, the court shall inquire into his fitness and his ability to properly care for the child and shall determine whether the best interests of the child will be served by granting custody to him. If the court finds that it would not be in the best interest of the child to grant custody to the putative father, the court shall terminate his rights to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">(2) If the putative father has established a custodial relationship with the child or has provided support or care for the mother during pregnancy or for either mother or child after the child\u2019s birth during the 90 days before notice of the hearing was served upon him, the rights of the putative father shall not be terminated except by proceedings in accordance with section 51(6) of this ehapter[<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>] or section 2 of chapter XIIA.[<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>] [MCL 710.39; MSA 27.3178(555.39).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">There will be many cases in which the putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>father meets the conditions that bring him within subsection 2, but in which someone else could make a persuasive showing that the best interests of the child require denying the father custody. Nevertheless, under the statute, the best interests standard of subsection 1 would not apply.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Similarly, in the case of limited guardianships, if the hearing establishes that the parent or parents have substantially complied with a limited guardianship placement plan, the court is required to terminate the guardianship without using the best interests test that is applied where there has not been such compliance. MCL 700.424c(3); MSA 27.5424(3)(3). This is so even if the guardian could prevail on a best interests standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Finally, under Michigan law where a party has no legally cognizable claim to custody of a child, there is no right to a best interests hearing. E.g., <em>Ruppel v Lesner, </em>421 Mich 559; 364 NW2d 665 (1984); <em>Bowie v Arder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We express no opinion about whether we would require a Michigan court to hold a best interests of the child hearing if we were faced with the circumstances presented to the Iowa courts. However, we cannot hold that the Iowa judgment is unenforceable under the uccja and pkpa because such a hearing was not held.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">The Court of Appeals also concluded that the DeBoers lacked standing to claim custody of the child. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">We hold that the DeBoers lacked standing to bring this action in Washtenaw Circuit Court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Iowa district court order of December 3, 1992, implemented the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court and stripped the DeBoers of any legal claim to custody of [the child]. The grant of temporary custody was rescinded. At that time, the DeBoers became third parties with respect to [the child], and no longer had a basis on which to claim a substantive right to custody. <em>Bowie, supra </em>at 43-45, 49, states that neither the Child Custody Act[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>] nor \"any other authority\u201d gives standing to create a custody dispute to a third party who does not possess a substantive right to custody or is not a guardian. A right to legal custody cannot be based on the fact that a child resides or has resided with the third party. We take the reference in <em>Bowie, supra </em>at 45, to \"any other authority\u201d to include the uccja.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">The DeBoers\u2019 argument that <em>Bowie, supra, </em>does not apply to this case is without merit. As noted, the pronouncement in <em>Bowie, supra, </em>regarding the standing of third parties to create custody disputes is expressly not limited to actions brought under the Child Custody Act. Moreover, contrary to the DeBoers\u2019 assertions, they have created a custody dispute by filing a petition in Washtenaw Circuit Court. The Iowa Supreme Court decision, implemented by the Iowa district court\u2019s order of December 3, 1992, dismissed the DeBoers\u2019 petition to adopt [the child] and rescinded their status as temporary guardians and custodians. The DeBoers had no further legal rights to [the child]. The DeBoers have attempted to use the uccja and the Washtenaw Circuit Court to create anew a right that the Iowa courts had extinguished. The DeBoers initiated a custody dispute in this state. Pursuant to <em>Bowie, supra, </em>they had no standing to do so. To disavow <em>Bowie </em>in this case would give an advantage to third parties in interstate custody disputes that is not enjoyed by third parties in intrastate disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">The DeBoers\u2019 reliance on <em>In re Danke, </em>169 Mich App 453; 426 NW2d 740 (1988), and <em>In re Weldon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>397 Mich 225; 244 NW2d 827 (1976) (cases in which third parties with no legal right to custody wer\u00e9 granted standing to bring a custody action), is misplaced. Both cases were decided before <em>Bowie, supra. </em>The <em>Bowie </em>Court specifically stated that <em>Weldon, supra, </em>was overruled, and that a third party could not gain standing simply by filing a complaint and asserting that a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child. <em>Bowie, supra </em>at 48-49. [199 Mich App 19-21.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The DeBoers advance a variety of arguments in support of their claim that they have standing to litigate regarding the custody of the child.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> First, they argue that the uccja grants them standing, pointing particularly to two of the jurisdictional provisions in \u00a7 653(1).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The DeBoers also argue that <em>Bowie v Arder </em>does not deny them standing. To begin with, they think that <em>Bowie </em>let stand statements in the lower court decision to the effect that \"once judicial intervention has already taken place, the court may award custody to third parties.\u201d 190 Mich App 571, 573; 476 NW2d 649 (1991). Further, they see the only prohibition as being on the ability of a third party to <em>create </em>a custody dispute. In their view, judicial intervention in this dispute began over two years ago, and they did not create the dispute. The initial decree in Iowa resulted from Schmidt\u2019s creation of a custody dispute when he filed a petition for intervention on March 27, 1991. Their filing of the petition in Michigan was a response to and an effort to modify the Iowa custody decree dissolving their right to custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Further, the DeBoers believe that <em>Bowie </em>is inapplicable because it is a case dealing with the Child Custody Act. This is a uccja action in which the Child Custody Act\u2019s provisions regarding best interests of the child are only incidentally involved. Even <em>Bowie </em>recognized that kind of incidental use of the Child Custody Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In addition <em>Bowie </em>said that a circuit court has the power to grant custody to \"third parties according to the best interests of the child in an appropriate case (typically involving divorce)\u201d and that \"such an award of custody is based not on the third party\u2019s legal right to custody of the child, but on the court\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d 441 Mich 49, n 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Finally, the DeBoers assert that despite <em>Bowie </em>they had a substantive right to custody because they had custody pursuant to the February 25, 1991, order of the Iowa district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>In addition, the DeBoers maintain that there is a protected liberty interest in their relationship with the child, which gives them standing. They trace the recent history of constitutional protection of parental rights beginning with <em>Stanley v </em>Illinois, 405 US 645; 92 S Ct 1208; 31 L Ed 2d 551 (1972), through <em>Quilloin v Walcott, </em>434 US 246; 98 S Ct 549; 54 L Ed 2d 511 (1978), <em>Smith v Organization of Foster Families, </em>431 US 816; 97 S Ct 2094; 53 L Ed 2d 14 (1977), and <em>Lehr v Robertson, </em>463 US 248; 103 S Ct 2985; 77 L Ed 2d 614 (1983), to <em>Michael H v Gerald D, </em>491 US 110; 109 S Ct 2333; 105 L Ed 2d 91 (1989). From these cases, they extract the principles that it is the relationship between the parent and child that triggers significant constitutional protection and that the mere existence of a biological link is not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">We reject these arguments. As the Court of Appeals noted, <em>Bowie </em>was not limited to Child Custody Act cases. The uccja is a procedural statute governing the jurisdiction of courts to entertain custody disputes. It is not enough that a person assert to be a \"contestant\u201d or \"claim\u201d a right to custody with respect to a child. If that were so, then any person could obtain standing by simply asserting a claim to custody, whether there was any legal basis for doing so or not. The Court of Appeals has correctly read our decision in <em>Bowie </em>as requiring the existence of some substantive right to custody of the child. We adhere to the holding of <em>Bowie </em>that a third party does not obtain such a substantive right by virtue of the child\u2019s having resided with the third party. 441 Mich 43.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We also agree with the Court of Appeals rejection of the DeBoers\u2019 arguments regarding the \"cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ation\u201d of a dispute and that they only seek to modify the Iowa order. It is true that <em>Bowie </em>recognized the incidental application of the Child Custody Act standards in other kinds of actions \u2014 typically divorce cases. However, the problem with the DeBoers\u2019 reasoning is that there is no action that they are entitled to bring to which the Child Custody Act can be applied incidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">It may be that the Iowa district court\u2019s February 25, 1991, order appointing the DeBoers as custodians during the pendency of the Iowa adoption proceeding was sufficiently analogous to a Michigan guardianship (which would create standing)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> to have given them standing to prosecute a custody action during the effectiveness of that order. However, as the Court of Appeals said, when the temporary custody order was rescinded, they became third parties to the child and no longer had a basis on which to claim a substantive right of custody.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The United States Supreme Court cases on which the DeBoers rely do not establish that they have a federal constitutional right to seek custody of the child. None involved disputes between a natural parent or parents on one side and non-parents on the other. While some of those cases place limits on the rights of natural parents, particularly unwed fathers, they involve litigation pitting one natural parent against the other, in which, almost of necessity, one natural parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>must be denied rights that otherwise would, have been protected. Sometimes a nonparent in a sense \"prevails\u201d in such actions, but that has been in the context of adoption by a stepfather who is married to the child\u2019s natural mother<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> or legitimization of the status of the natural mother\u2019s husband, who is not the biological father.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Several of the cases talk about an unwed father\u2019s rights as being dependent on the development of a relationship with the child. We read those decisions as providing the justification for denying the unwed father\u2019s rights, rather than as establishing that nonparent custodians obtain such rights merely by having custody. Further, as the Iowa district court noted after reviewing these United States Supreme Court cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">It is therefore now clearly established that an unwed father who has not had a custodial relationship with a child nevertheless has a constitutionally protected interest in establishing that relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">And, as the Iowa Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">We agree with the district court that abandonment was not established by clear and convincing evidence. In fact, virtually all of the evidence regarding Daniel\u2019s intent regarding this baby suggests just the opposite: Daniel did everything he could reasonably dp to assert his parental rights, beginning even before he actually knew that he was the father.[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In Docket Nos. 96441, 96531, and 96532, the next friend for the child argues that we should recognize the right of a minor child to bring a Child Custody Act action and obtain a best interests of the child hearing regarding her custody. Because of the interrelationship of this action to the DeBoers\u2019 application for leave to appeal in Docket No. 96366, we granted leave to appeal before decision by the Court of Appeals and directed the parties to brief the question whether the action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Basically, the next friend advances three theories on which a child is entitled to bring such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">First, the next friend maintains that the Child Custody Act gives children the right to bring such actions. MCL 722.24; MSA 25.312(4), says that in actions under the act, \"the court shall declare the inherent rights of the child.\u201d The next friend asserts that there is nothing in the act that would deprive the child of the right to bring \u00e1n action.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Second, the next friend maintains that the child has a due process liberty interest in her relationship with the DeBoers. Cases in other contexts are cited for the proposition that children are \"persons\u201d under the constitution and that constitutionally protected liberty interests run both to adults and minors. E.g., <em>In re </em>Gault, 387 US 1; 87 S Ct 1428; 18 L Ed 2d 527 (1967); <em>Planned Parenthood v Danforth, </em>428 US 52; 96 S Ct 2831; 49 L Ed 2d 788 (1976); <em>Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School Dist, </em>393 US 503; 89 S Ct 733; 21 L Ed 2d 731 (1969). The next friend reiterates the argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ments made by the DeBoers that cases such as <em>Lehr v Robertson </em>and <em>Smith v Organization of Foster Families </em>establish that the liberty interest in family life arises out of relationships based on day-to-day contact and not on biological relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Third, the next friend argues that the child is denied equal protection on two grounds. First, children are treated differently on the basis of whether they are in the custody of \"psychological\u201d parents rather than a biological parent. Second, the Child Custody Act grants some children residing with third-party custodians the right to a best interests hearing (those living with court-appointed guardians), but not others.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">We do not believe that the Child Custody Act can be read as authorizing such an action.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The act\u2019s consistent distinction between the \"parties\u201d and the \"child\u201d makes clear that the act is intended to resolve disputes among adults seeking custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">It is true that children, as well as their parents, have a due process liberty interest in their family life. However, in our view those interests are not independent of the child\u2019s parents. The Legislature has provided a right of parental custody and control of children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">Unless otherwise ordered by a court order, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>parents[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>] of an unemancipated minor are equally entitled to the custody, control, services and earnings of the minor, but if 1 parent provides, to the exclusion of the other parent, for the maintenance and support of the minor, that parent has the paramount right to control the services and earnings of the minor. [MCL 722.2; MSA 25.244(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The mutual rights of the parent and child come into conflict, only when there is a showing of parental unfitness.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As we have held in a series of cases, the natural parent\u2019s right to custody is not to be disturbed absent such a showing, sometimes despite the preferences of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In <em>Burkhardt v Burkhardt, </em>286 Mich 526; 282 NW 231 (1938), the child was one year old at the time of his parents\u2019 divorce. The mother was awarded custody, but voluntarily placed the child with third parties. Several years later, the mother took custody of the child. The father obtained an order giving him legal custody, but directing that the child actually be in the care of the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>parties. We reversed, awarding custody to the mother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-4\">It is a well-established principle of law, too well grounded to need citation of authority, that the parents, whether rich or poor, have the natural right to the custody of their children, subject to judicial control only when the safety or interests of the child demand it. . . . The choice of a child of the tender age of four years cannot be considered by the court in its determination of what disposition shall be made of the case. [286 Mich 534-535.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><em>Liebert v Derse, </em>309 Mich 495; 15 NW2d 720 (1944), involved the custody of a six year old. He had been legally adopted by a couple. His adoptive mother died when the child was two years old, and the adoptive father temporarily placed him with the child\u2019s aunt. Several years later, when the child was six, he objected to returning to his father, who petitioned for habeas corpus, seeking return of the child. The trial court declined to disturb the \"wholesome and happy surroundings\u201d of custody with the aunt. We reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\">We recognize the long-established rule that the best interest of the child is of paramount importance, . . . and that it is our judicial duty to safeguard his welfare and care .... However, we never have interpreted such rule so as to deprive a parent of the custody of his or her child, unless it was shown that the parent was an unsuitable person to have such custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">When placed on the witness stand, the boy said, in substance, that he thought his father would be good to him but that he preferred to stay with defendants. Such preference was the natural desire of a small child to remain in the environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to which he had become accustomed. While his wishes are entitled to consideration, it is clear that a six-year-old child is hardly competent to determine what environment and whose custody are best for his present and future welfare. Furthermore, his present wish to remain with defendants cannot overrule the established legal right of his father to his custody. [309 Mich 500-504.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In <em>Riemersma v Riemersma, </em>311 Mich 452; 18 NW2d 891 (1945), the child had lived with her grandparents since she was two years old. Two years later, the mother took her back, and the grandparents brought an action for custody. After quoting from <em>Liebert v Derse, </em>we held the mother entitled to custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">There was no allegation or showing that the mother was not a suitable person to have the custody of her infant daughter. In the absence of such a showing, she was . . . clearly entitled to the child\u2019s custody. [311 Mich 462.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Finally, in <em>Herbstman v Shiftan, </em>363 Mich 64; 108 NW2d 869 (1961), the natural father placed his one and one-half-year-old daughter with relatives of his deceased wife. Three and one-half years later he sought to have the child returned to him. We summarized the applicable principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">It is a well-established principle of law that the parents, whether rich or poor, have the natural right to the custody of their children. The rights of parents are entitled to great consideration, and the court should not deprive them of custody of their children without extremely good cause. A child also has rights, which include the right to proper and necessary support; education as required by law; medical, surgical, and other care necessary for his health, morals, or well-being; the right to proper custody by his parents, guardian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>or other custodian; and the right to live in a suitable place free from neglect, cruelty, drunkenness, criminality, or depravity on the part of his parents, guardians, or other custodian.

A guardian ad litem was appointed, before Daniel Schmidt moved to intervene in the action. We have no reason to believe that the guardian ad litem\u2019s advice to the court was anything but a good-faith effort to advise regarding the interests of the child.

Nor does the Child Custody Act\u2019s exception for guardians deny equal protection. Children living with guardians and those living with other third-party custodians are also not similarly situated.

Litigants having custody could relocate, wait until the jurisdictional requisites are met in the new state, and bring a modification action any time after the first state\u2019s order had <em>become </em>final.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Such a result would render courts powerless to enforce judgments entered in full compliance with procedural due process, and make the adjudicated rights of persons held to be adoptive parents, as well as those found to be fit biological parents, vulnerable to collateral attack by the disappointed contestant. Such a result is not in the best interests of families, biological or adoptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">In addition, there is substantial doubt whether the Iowa decision is the kind of \"custody order\u201d that is modifiable at all. When we speak of modifying custody orders, we are ordinarily talking about the typical case of a contest between natural parents. Such orders are at least theoretically perpetually modifiable. Where circumstances change, modification can be made in the child\u2019s best interests, because the biological parents have an inherent right to care, custody, and control of the child. That rationale, however, does not apply in a case such as this involving an adoption petition. The decision not to terminate Daniel Schmidt\u2019s rights and to dismiss the adoption petition put an end to the proceeding, just as would have been the case had the Iowa courts terminated Schmidt\u2019s rights and finalized the adoption. To say that the order in the instant case is modifiable would have the effect of destabilizing finalized adoptions as well as other final orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\"> The Michigan Court of Appeals cases on which the DeBoers principally rely, <em>In re Danke, </em>169 Mich App 453; 426 NW2d 740 (1988), and <em>Bull v Bull, </em>109 Mich App 328; 311 NW2d 768 (1981), do not mention the pkpa.

The Iowa courts relied on the constitutionally protected opportunity interest of a biological father in Schmidt\u2019s circumstance to conclude that termination was not in the best interest of the child unless unfitness was shown, and found, as fact, that the DeBoers had not shown unfitness. We have not had occasion to construe our adoption statute, MCL 710.39(1); MSA 27.3178(555.39X1), in light of <em>Lehr v Robertson, </em>463 US 248; 103 S Ct 2985; 77 L Ed 2d 614 (1983). We cannot say, however, that if the constitution requires such construction, it would be against our public policy to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> The DeBoers rely principally on two cases, <em>Bull v Bull, </em>n 23 <em>supra, </em>and the New Jersey decision in <em>EEB v DA, </em>89 NJ 595; 446 A2d 871 (1982), cert den sub nom <em>Angle v Bowen, </em>459 US 1210; 103 S Ct 1203; 75 L Ed 2d 445 (1983), which refused to enforce custody awards by courts in other states where the other state court did not conduct a hearing using a best interests of the child test. As noted earlier, the decision being appealed in <em>Bull v Bull </em>was made before the effective date of the pkpa. Further, the <em>Bull </em>Court found that the Georgia decision did not comport with the uccja. We find no such flaw in the Iowa decisions in the instant case. However, insofar as <em>Bull v Bull </em>is inconsistent with this opinion, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">We reject the rationale of <em>EEB v DA, </em>to the extent that it is cited for the proposition that an order transferring custody pursuant to a judgment determining custody is modifiable per se on a best-interests analysis. The DeBoers have cited neither Michigan nor Iowa law for this proposition, which, if accepted, would mean that an order granting custody would be enforceable only if the losing party voluntarily complied.

Indeed, analysis of the cases reveals a shifting of emphasis rather than a remaking of substance. This shifting reflects more the modern principle that <em>a child is a person, and not a subperson over whom the parent has an absolute possessory interest. A child has rights too, some of which are of a constitutional magnitude </em>.... <em>[Bennett v Jeffreys, </em>40 NY2d 543, 546; 387 NYS2d 821; 356 NE2d 277 (1976).

In general this would require recognition that the child\u2019s welfare is the principle guiding the process of decision, but in addition that the emotional and psychological advantages to the child of a parent\u2019s care should be placed high in the scale of factors which contribute to that welfare.

When adults are forced to bear the consequences of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>choices, however disastrous, at least their character and personality have been fully formed, and that character can provide the foundation for recovery, the will to go on.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The character and personality of a child two and one-half years old is just beginning to take shape: To visit the consequences of adult choices upon the child during the formative years of her life, and to force her to sort out the competing emotional needs of the Schmidts and DeBoers, is unnecessarily harsh and without legal justification. The pkpa does not require this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The pkpa was enacted to protect the child.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This Court, by ignoring obvious issues concerning the welfare of the child and by focusing exclusively on the concerns of competing adults, as if this were a dispute about the vesting of contingent remainders, reduces the pkpa to a robot of legal formality with results that Congress did not intend.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The motif of the majority opinion is that the pkpa made us do it, that this Court had no choice consistent with the \"law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That thesis ignores the legislative history of the pkpa<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and judicial decisions that construe the pkpa. The pkpa does not oblige this Court to turn its back on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The majority rejects the rationale<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of <em>EEB v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>DA, </em>89 NJ 595; 446 A2d 871 (1982), cert den sub nom <em>Angle v Bowen, </em>459 US 1210; 103 S Ct 1203; 75 L Ed 2d 445 (1983).

They seek, rather, to litigate, for the first time, whether transferring custody of the child to the Schmidts is in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\"><em>EEB </em>is one of two state supreme court decisions in which the court considered the issue whether a state is obliged by the pkpa or the uccja to enforce a custody determination made by another state following a failed adoption where the other state did not, before making its custody determination, consider the best interests of the child. The other case is <em>Lemley v Barr, </em>176 W Va 378; 343 SE2d 101 (1986). The West Virginia Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Court, cognizant of the uccja,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> concluded that there must be a best interests hearing before it could decide whether to require prospective adoptive parents to transfer custody of the child to biological parents whose parental rights had not been duly terminated. As in <em>EEB </em>and the instant case, the courts of the state where the biological parents resided had failed to conduct such a hearing before requiring the prospective adoptive parents to return the child to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Because the United States Supreme Court has ruled that the pkpa does not provide an implied cause of action in United States courts to determine which of two conflicting state custody determinations is valid,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> there are no federal court decisions construing the pkpa and there will be none. The conflict between the New Jersey and the West Virginia decisions on the one hand, and this Court\u2019s decision in the instant case on the other, can only be resolved by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">I agree with the New Jersey and West Virginia Supreme Courts \u2014 the only courts before the instant case to consider the precise issue before us\u2014 that the pkpa does not require a state, such as Michigan, to transfer, without a best interests hearing, custody of the child from prospective adoptive parents with whom she has bonded almost since birth, to comply with the decree of a state- in which the biological parents live, when that decree was entered without considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>whether a transfer of custody would serve the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Professor Clark, after reviewing at length the history of adjudication under the pkpa<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the uccja, found little or no consistency in adjudication. He saw little diminution in what he characterized as local court chauvinism, the awarding of custody to the home town parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">He also observed that the pkpa and the uccja have provided an excuse for courts that wished to avoid the difficult and distasteful task of reaching the merits, the evaluation of parents as candidates for custody, \"of trying to discover what disposition will best serve or least harm the child.\u201d Instead of grappling with the tough issues of deciding the case on the merits, \"the case can be analyzed in terms technical enough to delight a medieval property lawyer.

The use of either of these bases for jurisdiction should go far to achieve the purposes outlined above as being the purposes which jurisdictional rules governing adoption should serve.[<footnotemark>52</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">As Professor Clark explains, the only issues in an adoption proceeding with respect to the natural parents, are \u201cwhether the consent is genuine, or whether the alleged abandonment or neglect did occur. These resemble <em>the issues in the ordinary transitory </em>lawsuit, and there is thus no need for any requirements of domicile or residence on the part of the natural parents.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">But, suggests Professor Clark, \"[s]ince adoption consists of matching a child with a new parent or set of parents,\u201d there is a need for a \"thorough opportunity to study the child and his background. To give the court this opportunity, the child must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>be present and available in the jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> He concludes for those reasons that that subject matter jurisdiction in adoption should be where the adoptive parents reside and the child is physically present.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Iowa might have been the appropriate jurisdiction and in the best position to decide whether Cara Clausen\u2019s consent was genuine and whether Daniel Schmidt\u2019s claimed parental rights should be terminated because he abandoned the child or was unfit. Merely because Iowa might have been the appropriate jurisdiction for those purposes, does not mean that it had jurisdiction within the <em>meaning of the pkpa </em>to decide whether custody of the child should be permanently awarded, in the case of this failed adoption, to the Schmidts or the DeBoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">If, as Professor Clark contends, the pkpa provides \"the governing rules for jurisdiction in [adoption] cases and for the effect to be given to decrees of adoption or for the termination of parental rights,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> then Michigan, the home state, and not Iowa had subject matter jurisdiction within the meaning of the pkpa.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">g</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">I conclude that because Iowa was not the home state, or the state with significant connection, and thus did not have jurisdiction within the meaning of the pkpa, the pkpa does not require Michigan to enforce an Iowa decree transferring custody of the child from the DeBoers to the Schmidts.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">It was necessary to resolve whether Daniel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Schmidt was the biological father, had abandoned the child, and was fit or unfit before Iowa could decide that he had parental rights and that his parental rights should not be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Until those issues were adjudicated, the issue whether custody should remain with the DeBoers because that was in the child\u2019s best interests had not ripened for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The Iowa decree is not res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Although Iowa had in personam jurisdiction over all the parties, and, under traditional views of in <em>personam jurisdiction, </em>could enter a custody order transferring the child from the DeBoers to the Schmidts, it did not have <em>subject matter jurisdiction </em>to make a custody determination within the meaning of the pkpa, enforceable under the strictures of the pkpa, because Michigan, by then, had become the home state of the child and the state with significant connection. The DeBoers left Iowa with the child in good faith, not to escape Iowa jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The issues actually litigated and determined in Iowa were whether Daniel Schmidt was the biological father, had abandoned the child, and was fit or unfit. Because it was determined that he was the biological father, had not abandoned the child, and was not unfit, it was decreed that he had parental rights and that the DeBoers\u2019 petition for adoption must therefore be dismissed. Subsequently, it was determined that Cara Schmidt\u2019s parental rights would be restored because she and Daniel Schmidt had married, not because it was determined that her consent to the adoption of the child was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">The proceedings in Iowa, which began as adop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tion proceedings, were transformed into parental rights termination proceedings after Daniel Schmidt intervened in the adoption proceedings. In holding that his parental rights would be recognized and not terminated, the Iowa Supreme Court said that, in a parental rights termination proceeding, the best interests of the child are not to be considered under Iowa law in deciding whether parental rights should be terminated unless the statutory grounds for termination have been established. Having concluded that Daniel Schmidt\u2019s parental rights would not be terminated, the custody of the child was ordered transferred to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The DeBoers\u2019 petition for rehearing, asserting that although it had been adjudicated that Daniel Schmidt\u2019s <em>parental rights </em>would not be terminated, the best interests of the child should be considered before ordering the transfer of <em>custody </em>from the DeBoers to the Schmidts was denied without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The only issues actually litigated and decided<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> were whether Daniel Schmidt\u2019s parental rights should be recognized and not terminated. The reason given by the Iowa Supreme Court for not considering the best interests of the child was that the child\u2019s best interests are not relevant on the issues in a parental rights termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The separate question whether, in a dispute between a parent and a third-party custodian, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>best interests of the child should be considered in deciding whether to transfer custody from the custodian to the parent was not actually litigated. And, as stated by the Iowa Supreme Court, a determination of the best interests of the child was not essential or even pertinent to decision of the question whether Daniel Schmidt\u2019s parental rights should be recognized and not terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In denying rehearing, the Iowa Supreme Court did not enlarge on the reasons set forth in its opinion. Its silence does not provide a basis for concluding, contrary to the statements in the opinion explaining why the best interests of the child could not be considered on the <em>termination of parental rights issue, </em>that it had considered, adjudicated and decided that the best interests of the child may not be considered in deciding the <em>separate issue whether custody should be transferred </em>from the custodian, the DeBoers, to the parent, Daniel Schmidt. That issue, not having been adjudicated and decided, and not being necessary or pertinent to decision under Iowa law on the question whether Daniel Schmidt\u2019s parental rights should be terminated, is not precluded under the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">For reasons already stated, I would hold that the Iowa decree may not be enforced under the pkpa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>because Iowa was not the home state, and thus did not have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Assuming that Iowa had jurisdiction, the question remains whether the Iowa decree was subject to <em>modification </em>in Michigan, because Iowa declined to exercise jurisdiction to conduct a hearing to consider whether to modify on the basis of the best interests of the child following its conclusions that Daniel Schmidt was the biological father, had not abandoned the child, and was not unfit, and that his parental rights would be recognized. I would hold that the decree was subject to modification because Iowa declined to exercise jurisdiction to conduct such a hearing.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The majority stresses<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> that, under the pkpa, the jurisdiction of Iowa courts, \"continues\u201d as long as those courts have jurisdictions under the law of Iowa, and any contestant resides in Iowa,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> and that a court of another state \"shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a custody deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>mination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of this section <em>to make a custody </em>determination.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">I acknowledge, assuming that Iowa had jurisdiction, although it was not the home state or the state , of significant connection, that its jurisdiction \"continued.\u201d I further acknowledge that Michigan could not then exercise jurisdiction while Iowa courts were exercising jurisdiction \"to <em>make </em>a custody determination.\u201d But the Iowa courts had made their custody determination, ordering that custody of the child be transferred, before Michigan exercised jurisdiction to consider whether the Iowa decree should be modified. The continuing jurisdiction provision of the pkpa does not bar Michigan from considering whether to modify the Iowa decree after Iowa had made its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Proceeding on the hypothesis that Iowa had jurisdiction, although not the home state or state of significant connection, Michigan could exercise jurisdiction to modify the Iowa decree only if Iowa courts had \"declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The Iowa Supreme Court failed to exercise jurisdiction to modify when it denied rehearing to consider the best interests of the child, and, therefore, Michigan could properly exercise jurisdiction to modify the Iowa decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, in similar circumstances, held that \"Ohio\u2019s failure to conduct a best interest hearing constitutes refusal to exercise jurisdiction under 28 USCA \u00a7 1738A(f)(2). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>pkpa, therefore, New Jersey is free to modify the Ohio decree. This result comports with the congressional intent that child custody decisions be made in the state best able to determine the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>EEB v DA, supra, </em>607.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">A custody dispute is more than a jurisdictional chess game in which winning depends on compliance with predetermined rules of play. A child is not a pawn. In exercising its discretion within the confines of uccja and pkpa, a court should consider not only the literal wording of the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>but their purpose: to define and stabilize the right to custody in the best interest of the child. <em>[EEB v DA, supra, </em>p 611.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The West Virginia Supreme Court reached essentially- the same conclusion in the construction of the uccja, and required a best interests hearing before it would decide, following a failed adoption, whether to enforce a decree ordering transfer of custody entered by the state where the biological parents resided where a best interests hearing had not been conducted. Lemley v <em>Barr, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>64</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\n<em>B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">As in <em>EEB, </em>the DeBoers litigated the termination of parental rights issue in the Iowa courts. The DeBoers requested a best interests determination at each stage in the'proceedings. After the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the best interests of the child were not a factor to be considered in deciding whether to terminate the parental rights of Daniel Schmidt, the DeBoers, like the adoptive parents in <em>EEB, </em>petitioned for rehearing, seeking a best interests hearing with respect to a change in custody. The Iowa Supreme Court, like the Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>EEB, </em>denied rehearing.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The DeBoers then, like the adoptive parents in <em>EEB </em>and <em>Lemley,</em><footnotemark><em>66</em></footnotemark><em> </em>asked that the home state, Michigan, conduct a best interests hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">As in <em>EEB, </em>the refusal of the Iowa Supreme Court to hear the petition for rehearing constituted a refusal to exercise jurisdiction to modify. Because the Iowa Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction to conduct a hearing to consider whether to modify on the basis of the best interests of the child, Michigan may, consistent with the pkpa, exercise jurisdiction to conduct a hearing to consider whether to modify on the basis of the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In <em>Interest of Brandon LE, </em>the Supreme Court of West Virginia modified a Florida custody decree that required that a custodial grandmother transfer custody of a child to his father with whom he had little contact.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The court wrote: \"To protect the equitable rights of a child in this situation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>child\u2019s environment should not be disturbed without a clear showing of significant benefit to him, notwithstanding the parent\u2019s assertion of a legal right to the child.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Daniel Schmidt, like the father in <em>Brandon L E, </em>prevailed on the issue of parental fitness. He asserted, as does Daniel Schmidt, that it was through no fault of his that he did not have an opportunity to establish a relationship with his child. The West Virginia Supreme Court, nevertheless, concluded that the child\u2019s best interests must prevail. The child\u2019s right to a best interests determination lies in equity and is not dissipated by a finding of parental fitness.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Even in child snatching cases, courts have placed consideration of the child\u2019s best interests ahead of punishment of the wrongdoer. Courts have recognized that the passage of time may mean' that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to continue living with the party that \"kidnapped\u201d the child from the lawful custodian.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The majority states that the suggestion that \"the best interests purpose of the pkpa mandates a best interests analysis in Iowa\u201d also suggests that \"Congress intended to impose the substantive best interests rule in all custody determinations on the laws of the fifty states.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2d\">I acknowledge that the \"pkpa is a procedural and jurisdictional statute, which does not impose principles of substantive law on the states.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqGl\">Iowa may indeed be free to award the custody of children, in particular circumstances, without regard to their best interests. It does not follow that a decree rendered without consideration of the child\u2019s best interests is entitled to enforcement under the pkpa, where the court rendering the decree declined to exercise jurisdiction to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>a hearing to consider whether to modify the decree on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">A decree rendered by a state other than the home state is not a determination made \"consistent with the provisions\u201d of the pkpa.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> A decree rendered without consideration of the child\u2019s best interests is not a decree that the Congress intended that all other states must enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The DeBoers advance several theories to support their argument that they have standing to litigate their claims to custody of the child. They argue that the uccja<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> grants them standing, that they have a protected liberty interest in their relationship with the child, and that <em>Bowie v </em>Arder<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> does not deny them standing. The majority discusses and rejects all these arguments.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">I would hold that the DeBoers have standing under the pkpa. Because the DeBoers have standing under the pkpa, and, as the majority notes, the pkpa \"clearly preempts inconsistent state law\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> the majority\u2019s analysis and rejection of the DeBoers\u2019 arguments is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The controlling provisions in the standing dispute are those defining jurisdiction. The DeBoers claim jurisdiction under both the \"home state\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>and \"significant connection\u201d tests of the pkpa.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> \"Home state\u201d jurisdiction requires that the child be living with \"his parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent\u201d for at least six months \"immediately preceding the time involved.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The pkpa provides that <em>'person acting as a parent\u2019 </em>means a person, other than a parent, who has physical custody of a child and who has <em>either been awarded custody by a court or claims a right to custody.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>80</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">\"[Significant connection\u201d jurisdiction hinges on, whether \"the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with the State other than mere physical presence.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)

They were granted and permitted to retain physical custody by court order during each step of the proceedings in Iowa, until the order of the Iowa district court terminating all rights to custody on December 3, 1992. Michigan courts have maintained the status quo thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The majority holds that the rescission of the temporary custody order by the Iowa district court made the DeBoers third parties to the child and stripped them of any basis on which to claim a substantive right of custody.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The pkpa provides however, that a person acting as a parent is someone who \"has . . . been\u201d awarded custody. \"Has\u201d refers to the past. In the past, the DeBoers were granted physical custody by the Iowa courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The DeBoers also have standing as persons who \"claim[] a right to custody\u201d of the child. The DeBoers\u2019 claim to a right of custody rests on the court orders granting them custody. The action of the Iowa courts granting the DeBoers physical custody of the child and maintaining physical custody with them throughout the proceedings in Iowa is evidence that the Iowa courts saw merit in the DeBoers\u2019 claim to custody. Although the Iowa courts have now ruled against the DeBoers, that does not strip the DeBoers of their claim to custody when their claim challenges the enforceability in Michigan of the Iowa decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">The majority relies on <em>Bowie to </em>conclude that the DeBoers have no claim to custody. <em>Bowie, </em>however, does not address the definition of claim to custody. <em>Bowie </em>construes Michigan\u2019s Child Cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tody Act.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> <em>Bowie </em>and the Child Custody Act are preempted by the pkpa.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The majority concludes that the pkpa preempts inconsistent state law and that it controls the issue of jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Since the pkpa preempts inconsistent state law when jurisdiction is the issue, then it preempts inconsistent state law on standing issues. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bowie </em>denying standing to third parties is necessarily limited to intrastate custody disputes and does not govern whether the DeBoers have standing in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">To conclude that the pkpa preempts in determining jurisdiction but not with respect to standing is untenable. The pkpa definitions of standing are part and parcel of the jurisdictional definitions. Standing in a \"home state\u201d depends on the presence in the state of a \"person acting as a parent.\u201d Standing in a \"significant connection\u201d state depends on the presence in the state of a \"contestant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The pkpa is structured so that a determination of jurisdiction incorporates a finding of standing. The pkpa cannot be parsed to conclude that it preempts state law on jurisdiction but not on standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Superimposing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bowie </em>depriving third parties of standing in <em>intrastate </em>disputes upon third parties in <em>interstate </em>disputes govern\u00e9d by the pkpa violates the Supremacy Clause. The statement in <em>Bowie </em>that this Court was not limiting the decision to third-party actions brought under the Child Custody Act must neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>sarily be limited to intrastate disputes in light of pkpa preemption.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Because the pkpa governs this dispute and provides the DeBoers with standing, either as persons acting as parents or as contestants, there is no need to address any of the other standing arguments raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">We express no opinion about whether we would require a Michigan court to hold a best interests of the child hearing if we were faced with the circumstances presented to the Iowa courts.[<footnotemark>87</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">This litigation unavoidably requires this Court to consider and decide whether a Michigan court would hold a best interests hearing were it faced with the circumstances presented to the' Iowa courts. I think it clear that Michigan law would require such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Also implicated are the child\u2019s and the DeBoers\u2019 constitutional right to equal protection of the laws and due process of law. To grant to some citizens of this state such a hearing, and to refuse to provide such a hearing to other citizens similarly situated, poses constitutional issues that can be avoided by recognizing that a best interests hearing is required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Consideration of the child\u2019s best interests is required in all manner of custody disputes, including adoptions, parental rights termination proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ings, and proceedings concerning parental rights of putative fathers.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">The public policy of Michigan, as declared by the Legislature in \u00a7 39<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> of the Michigan Adoption Code,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> requires a Michigan court to consider whether the best interests of a child would be served by awarding custody to a putative father, such as Daniel Schmidt, who did not live with the mother or contribute to her support during the pregnancy:<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>(1) <em>If the putative father does not come within the provisions of subsection </em>(2), and if the putative father appears at the hearing and requests custody of the child, the court shall inquire into his fitness and his ability to properly care for the child <em>and shall determine whether the best interests of the child will be served granting custody to him. If the court \u00f1nds that it would not be in the best interest of the child to grant custody to the putative father, the court shall terminate his rights to the child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-4\">(2) <em>If the putative father has established a custodial relationship with the child or has provided </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>support or care for the mother during pregnancy </em>or for either mother or child after the child\u2019s birth during the 90 days before notice of the hearing was served upon him, the rights of the putative father shall not be terminated except by proceedings in accordance with section 51(6) of this chapter or section 2 of chapter XIIA. [MCL 710.39; MSA 27.3178(555.39). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Daniel Schmidt does not qualify under subsection 2 of the statute because he did not \"establish a custodial relationship with the child\u201d or provide \"support or care for the mother during pregnancy\u201d as required under subsection 2. Accordingly, Daniel Schmidt falls into the category of putative fathers for whom Michigan requires a best interests hearing before his parental rights would be recognized and he could obtain custody.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The sympathetic portrayal of the Schmidts in the majority opinion ignores that it was Cara Schmidt\u2019s fraud on the Iowa court and on Daniel Schmidt that is at the root of this controversy. If she had identified Daniel Schmidt as the father when she consented to waive her parental rights, before she had a change of heart, he too might have relinquished his parental rights. If Daniel Schmidt had refused to relinquish his rights, the DeBoers would not have assumed custody of the child and this litigation would have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">To fault the DeBoers is unwarranted. Why should they have believed that Cara Schmidt was telling the truth when she said she had fraudulently named the other man as the father? The DeBoers discovered that Schmidt had a dismal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>record as a father.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> They chose, as provided by the legal system, to challenge his claim that he was the biological father and also to contest his fitness as a father.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The Iowa courts thought there was sufficient merit in the DeBoers\u2019 claims that they maintained custody of the child with the DeBoers until after the Iowa Supreme Court ruled. One justice agreed with the DeBoers.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Justice Snell observed in dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>sent that holding the rights of biological parents paramount to other values casts a cloud over adoptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The majority suggests that the DeBoers are posturing when they claim that they seek to vindicate the best interests of the child, and would be emotional not to accept unquestioning without seeking relief in another forum, the decision of this Court.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The majority is not troubled that the result of its decision will be to return the child to Cara Schmidt despite her fraud. The majority appears to excuse her fraud by stressing that she gave her consent within forty hours, not seventy-two hours.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> This was brought to the attention of the Iowa courts. The Iowa Supreme Court declined to hold that a consent given within seventy-two hours is necessarily invalid and remanded for a determination whether she waived the seventy-two hour provision.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The decisions of this Court are entitled to respect. I am hopeful, however much I disagree with this decision, that it will be duly respected. But the Court goes too far in asking of the DeBoers unquestioning obedience to its decision. The Court\u2019s preachment bespeaks a grandiose view of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The majority, by ignoring the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the child, has approached this case as if it were a contest between two parties over a piece of property. If the majority were true even to this approach, it would find for the DeBoers and not the Schmidts.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The relevant property law analysis would involve the allocation of risk of loss among innocent persons in cases of fraud. Here, the DeBoers and Daniel Schmidt are the victims of Cara Schmidt\u2019s fraud on the Iowa court. The question before a court would then be who must suffer the consequences of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The law generally places the risk of loss on the person in the best position to avoid the loss in the first place.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Putative fathers are aware that sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>intercourse may result in pregnancy, and of the potential opportunity to establish a family. If they wish to protect that opportunity, they can do so by maintaining some relationship with the women with whom they had intercourse to determine whether they become pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Daniel Schmidt and Cara Clausen ceased their sexual relationship within a month of the time the child was conceived. Daniel Schmidt had observed that Cara Clausen was pregnant. He was thus on notice and inquiry. The child was conceived in the last days of April, 1990 and was born on February 8, 1991. If Daniel Schmidt had bothered to count, he would have known that the child was probably his. Cara Schmidt\u2019s subterfuge was successful because, as Judge Snell observed, Daniel, knowing that Cara was pregnant, \"did nothing to protect his rights.\u201d Where there is fraud, the law must place the risk of loss somewhere. I would not place that risk on the child but rather on the putative father.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The majority\u2019s decision appears to be driven by the same philosophical preference for the rights of biological parents reflected in this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ruppel v Lesner, </em>421 Mich 559; 364 NW2d 665 (1984),<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> and <em>Bowie v Arder, </em>441 Mich 23; 490 NW2d 568 (1992).<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Those decisions and the instant litigation have inspired legislative efforts to amend the Child Custody Act to reverse the rule enunciated in <em>Bowie </em>effective as of the date it was decided, and to restore the standing of persons such as the DeBoers.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The majority directs that this Court\u2019s judgment order enter forthwith. This has only been done, in the last twenty-five years, when, on recommendation of the Judicial Tenure Commission, a judge is removed from office,<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> or when, on two occasions, such a directive was necessary because otherwise scheduled bond sales would, fall through. See <em>Bigger v </em>Pontiac, 390 Mich 1; 210 NW2d 1 (1973), concerning the sale of bonds for the construction of the Silverdome, and <em>Eby v Lansing Bd of Water &amp; Light, </em>417 Mich 297; 336 NW2d 205 (1983), concerning the sale of bonds for the construction of the Belle River power plant. Directing that the judgment order issue forthwith is clearly extraordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The majority has not explained why such a direction is being given in this case. It might be to forestall the possible application to this case of any amendment of the Child Custody Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The majority\u2019s specific direction imposing time limits regarding the return of the child also reflects its apparent conclusion that the Schmidts are the aggrieved parties and the majority\u2019s determination to see to it that nothing prevents righting the wrong done them by the DeBoers in prolonging this litigation and by the Washtenaw Circuit Court in deciding to hold a best interests hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">I recognize that this litigation must come to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>end. But the judicial process has not run its course simply because this Court has announced its decision. The DeBoers may seek rehearing. They may seek a stay from this Court, which clearly will be refused; they may then seek a stay from a justice of the United States Supreme Court and apply for certiorari. They may even seek relief in Iowa. There may be other courses of legal action that resourceful counsel may recommend or undertake. It is unseemly for this Court to appear to be thwarting such efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Decisions of the United States Supreme Court<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> concerning the rights of putative fathers to retain custody of a child <em>where a family relationship has been established </em>have been relied on to construe Iowa statutes to provide Daniel Schmidt with the <em>opportunity </em>to create a family relationship. Viewing the matter as a contest between adults, the Schmidts and the DeBoers, the majority sees the Schmidts as having a better claim to the child than the DeBoers. The majority rules that the DeBoers have no standing in this Court, and cannot have a hearing on the merits whether their claim is better than the Schmidts.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">There is a third party, the child. She, too, is a person with a liberty interest under the constitution. But, says the majority, that interest cannot be asserted by the DeBoers because they have no standing. It also rules that the child\u2019s next friend cannot assert her interest because there cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>any infringement of her independent liberty interest unless Daniel Schmidt is unfit.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">I would avoid reaching the question whether a child has a separate claim under the constitution until it is necessary to grapple with that momentous issue. That issue can be avoided by recognizing the child\u2019s statutory right under the Child Custody Act to have the court \"declare the inherent rights\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> of the child and by holding that the Iowa decree cannot be enforced in Michigan without a best interests hearing in the child\u2019s home state, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Since the majority has decided that a best interests hearing is not required by the Child Custody Act or the pkpa, the Court should consider and decide whether the child\u2019s interests in protecting <em>her family relationship </em>with the DeBoers is as constitutionally protected as a liberty interest as Daniel Schmidt\u2019s asserted constitutionally protected liberty interest in having an opportunity to establish a family relationship with the child. The Court should also consider and decide how those interests can be reconciled, either by a hearing concerning the best interests of the child, or by another standard or other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">If the danger confronting this child were physical injury, no one would question her right to invoke judicial process to protect herself against such injury. There is little difference, when viewed from the child\u2019s frame of reference, between a physical assault and a psychological assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The law provides compensation for mental distress in countless situations, and has recognized that persons who suffer psychological injury are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>entitled to the protection of the law. It is only because this child cannot speak for herself that adults can avert their eyes from the pain that she will suffer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\"> Ante, p 655.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\"> <em>Ante, </em>pp 692-693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-12\"> <em>Lemley v Barr, </em>176 W Va 378, 381; 343 SE2d 101 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\"> The media reports that the Schmidts have said that they may or will call the child Jessica Schmidt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b814-10\"> This Court granted leave to appeal limited to the issues of jurisdiction and standing (No. 96366), and failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted (Nos. 96441, 96531, 96532).

The problems arise when the parent seeks to reclaim the child or to revoke his consent to adoption and the non-parent refuses to restore the child to the custody of the parent. In the temporary placement cases, if the child is not returned to the parent, the parent\u2019s expectations will be frustrated thereby deepening the parent\u2019s heartache and bitterness. And in the adoption cases the parent may have consented to the adoption under the stress of circumstances and may have tried to change her mind relatively soon after giving the consent. Due to these factors, the parent\u2019s interest should perhaps be given greater weight than in the stepparent cases, and the child retained in the custody of the non-parent only where his welfare clearly dictates that result. Even in these circumstances, however, <em>it should not be necessary to prove the parent un\u00f1t as a condition of awarding custody to the non-parent. If the child has been in the non-parent\u2019s care for a substantial period of time, taking into account that time may have a different signi\u00f1cance for a child, and if the child is strongly attached to the non-parent emotionally and psychologically, so that the child will suffer serious harm by being shi\u00f1ed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>to another\u2019s custody, then the non-parent should be awarded custody.

The record shows that Daniel has largely failed to support these children financially and has failed to maintain meaningful contact with either of them.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b852-9\"><em> </em>His opinion was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">I respectfully dissent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">The evidence is sufficient to show abandonment of the baby by Daniel. The record shows he has previously failed to raise or support his other two children. He quit supporting his son, born in 1976, after two years. From 1978 to 1990 he saw him three times. He has another daughter whom he has never seen and has failed to support. He stated he just never took any interest in her. In every meaningful way, he abandoned them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-12\">Daniel knew that Cara was pregnant in December 1990. He saw her in the building where they worked for the same employer. The child was born in February 1991. Having knowledge of the facts that support the likelihood that he was the biological father, nevertheless, he did nothing to protect his rights. The mother, Cara, who knew better than anyone who the father was, named Scott as the father. The legal proceedings logically and reasonably were based on these representations. The termination of parental rights as known to exist at the time were legally completed and an adoption process was commenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-13\">Daniel\u2019s sudden desire to assume parental responsibilities is a late claim to assumed rights that he forfeited by his indifferent conduct to the fate of Cara and her child. The specter of newly named genetic fathers, upsetting adoptions, perhaps years later, is an unconscionable result. Such a consequence is not driven by the language of our statutes, due process concerns or the facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">I would remand for termination of Daniel\u2019s parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>based on abandonment and denial of Cara\u2019s motions. The intervention petition of Daniel in the adoption case should be dismissed on remand and the adoption proceed.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\"> <em>Ante, </em>pp 692-693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b853-11\"> <em>Ante, </em>pp 655-656.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"97\">\n<p id=\"b853-12\"> This was not decided on remand. Instead of deciding that question, it was decided on remand from the Iowa Supreme Court that Cara Schmidt\u2019s parental rights should be restored because Daniel Schmidt\u2019s rights had been recognized and they had married.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"98\">\n<p id=\"b854-7\"> Recording statutes require persons claiming an interest in real property to provide notice of their interest \u2014 by a proper recording \u2014 or take subject to the interest of third persons who purchase in good faith and without notice of the prior interest. Similarly, the Uniform Commercial Code, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 9-301, 9-302, in cases involving personal property, requires secured creditors to give proper notice or to take subject to the rights of bona fide purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">The law thus requires a person claiming an interest in property to assert it in a way that is plain and simple for the rest of the world to ascertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">The DeBoers were misled by Cara Schmidt\u2019s fraudulent warranty. She identified to the DeBoers as the father of the child a person whom she knew was not the father. She allowed the DeBoers to take custody of the child knowing that the DeBoers, relying on her misrepresentation, had obtained a waiver of parental rights from the wrong person.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Daniel Schmidt, the real father \u2014 and thus the true owner for ' purposes of this property law analysis \u2014 enabled Cara Schmidt to perpetrate her fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">Under another property law analysis, estoppel, the law again places the loss on the least cost risk avoider, that is, the person who was in the best position to avoid the loss in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Under the doctrine of voidable title (see, e.g., UCC \u00a7 2-403), the true owner enables another to appear to be the true owner with the result that the rights of the true owner are subordinated to those of a bona fide purchaser who takes without actual notice of the prior interest. Daniel Schmidt enabled Cara Schmidt to appear to be the true owner of the child because he took no steps to assert his rights. He gave Cara Schmidt a voidable title, which, in the hands of an innocent purchaser, ripens into full title good against the world including the true owner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"99\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\"> The Court reversed an award of temporary custody to the child\u2019s grandparents, despite a finding that this would be in the child\u2019s best interests. The Court held that the circuit court lacks authority to enter an order granting custody to a third party over the parents\u2019 objection where the child is living with the parents, no divorce or separate maintenance proceedings have been instituted, and there has been no finding of parental unfitness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"100\">\n<p id=\"b855-10\"> The Court held that third parties do not have standing to petition for custody on the basis that the child resides or has resided with the third party, unless they are guardians or limited guardians or have a substantive right to custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"101\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\"> Senate substitute for HB 4064, passed Senate June 10, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"102\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\"> See, e.g., In re <em>Ryman, </em>394 Mich 637; 232 NW2d 178 (1975); <em>In re Seitz, </em>441 Mich 590; 495 NW2d 559 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"103\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\"> <em>Michael H v Gerald D, </em>491 US 110; 109 S Ct 2333; 105 L Ed 2d 91 (1989); <em>Stanley v Illinois, </em>405 US 645; 92 S Ct 1208; 31 L Ed 2d 551 (1972); <em>Quilloin v Walcott, </em>434 US 246; 98 S Ct 549; 54 L Ed 2d 511 (1978); <em>Caban v Mohammed, </em>441 US 380; 99 S Ct 1760; 60 L Ed 2d 297 (1979); <em>Lehr v Robertson, </em>463 US 248; 103 S Ct 2985; 77 L Ed 2d 614 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Cf. <em>Reno v Flores, </em>507 US \u2014; 113 S Ct 1439; 123 L Ed 2d 1 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"104\">\n<p id=\"b858-8\"><em> Ante, </em>p 657.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"105\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\"> MCL 722.24; MSA 25.312(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
