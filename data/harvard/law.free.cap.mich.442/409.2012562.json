The suspension was for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Calvert commenced an action for superintending control in the Court of Appeals. That Court stayed the removal of Calvert\u2019s name from the list, and subsequently held that the judges did not have the authority to suspend Calvert from writing bonds or to remove his name from the list. The Court ruled that the sole responsibility for supervising the conduct of persons who write bonds had been vested by the Legislature in the insurance commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Reference was made to provisions of the Insurance Code empowering the insurance commissioner to investigate the character and fitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>of a person who applies for a license, and to suspend or revoke a license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Court of Appeals said that the question presented was whether the judges <em>or </em>\u201cthe Insurance Commissioner . . . have the authority to suspend\u201d Calvert and remove his name from the list.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) While the insurance commissioner has the power to discipline insurance agents and bail bondsmen, it does not follow that the statutory provisions from which the disciplinary powers of the insurance commissioner derive were intended to occupy the whole field and to preclude judges from declining to accept bonds from persons who violate provisions of the law regulating the furnishing of bonds. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals because the Insurance Code, in providing that the commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of an agent, does not bar judges from refusing to accept bonds written or provided by a person who violates the provisions of the Penal Code concerning the writing of bonds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">Courts generally have held that the judicial power includes the authority to decline for good reason to accept a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">A panel of the Pennsylvania Superior Court said that the power to fix bail or accept recognizance is a \"judicial power,\u201d and a judicial officer has the right to exercise reasonable discretion respecting \"the sureties, and all other matters in connection therewith\u201d as \"necessary incidents to judicial power, subject only to limitations imposed by the constitution and statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Tennessee Supreme Court said that a judge \"has full authority to determine who shall and who shall not qualify as a bondsman in his own court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska said that the acceptance and approval of bonds is a \"judicial function of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals said that \"reasonable requirements governing and regulating professional . . . bondsmen clearly come within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the inherent powers of the court and may be properly supervised by the court.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL0\">A panel of the Ohio Court of Appeals said that \"in determining the sufficiency of \u00e1 surety the courts have a sound discretion to determine not only his financial ability to respond to the penalty in the bond but also his moral responsibility in reaching a conclusion as to whether bail will insure the presence of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">The court is not without protection if the surety company is deemed a poor moral or unsafe risk.

On its face, \u00a7 167b (see n 1 for text), aims, not at limiting the supervisory powers of the circuit court, but at preventing abuse of the bail bond system.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">Subsection (1) prohibits bondsmen from procuring business by giving money or property to persons operating within the criminal justice system. MCL 750.167b(l); MSA 28.364(2X1). Subsection (2) prohibits bondsmen from procuring business for attorneys. MCL 750.167b(2); MSA 28.364(2)(2). Subsection (3) sets fee limits on bonds, and prohibits any involvement of bondsmen in seeking dismissals of criminal charges. MCL 750.167b(3); MSA 28.364(2)(3). Subsection (4) requires that a list of bondsmen be made available anywhere persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>are kept in custody, and that the list be compiled annually. MCL 750.167b(4); MSA 28.364(2X4). Violation of any provision of the chapter is a misdemeanor. MCL 750.167b(5); MSA 28.364(2)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"AhY\">The whole of \u00a7 167b is directed toward protecting the integrity of the bail bond system. Neither bondsmen nor any other participants in the criminal justice system are to be permitted to manipulate the bond process to their advantage. Bondsmen may not seek to influence participants in the criminal justice system to steer business to them or away from competitors. Attorneys may not exploit the advantage of the contact, likely to occur at an early point in the process, between bondsmen and defendants. The requirement that a list be prepared gives circuit judges responsibility for maintaining an impartial list that assures access to the system by both bondsmen and persons in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"Ase\">The listing requirement does not limit the discretion of circuit judges, but, rather, imposes on them an essentially administrative duty. The administrative character of the listing requirements is evident when it is viewed along with the other requirements relating to the list set out in subsection (4).</p>\n<p id=\"AIU\">The names must be typewritten or printed, arranged alphabetically, posted in a conspicuous place, and furnished upon request without recommendation. The name of any bondsman selected must also be recorded at the place of detention.

I agree with the majority that because the insurance commissioner has been given licensing and regulatory authority over a bail bondsman does not mean that a judge setting bail must accept the surety of a particular licensed bondsman.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">I do not agree with, and respectfully dissent from, the majority view that a judicial circuit can disregard the clear mandate of the statute that plaintiff, as one \"engaged in the business of becom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ing surety upon bonds,\u201d be included in the annually compiled list of such persons. MCL 750.167b(4); MSA 28.364(2)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As pointed out by the majority, the judges of each circuit have been given the administrative task of listing and posting in designated places the names of those writing bonds in the county. It is understandable that the defendants, in their efforts to correct the irregularities and violations allegedly perpetrated by the plaintiff, would seek to remove him from the list and thus disconnect him from exposure to his clients, rather than rely on their own abilities to refuse to honor his bonds in their respective courtrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Efficiency, however, is not reason enough to ignore the clear mandate of the statute. Nor, in my view, is it satisfactory to base a decision whether or not to observe the statute on the fact, as set forth by the majority, that \"[i]n removing Calvert\u2019s name from the list, the judges did not, however, contravene the purpose ... of the Insurance Code . . . [or] frustrate or impede the effectiveness of . . . either the Penal Code or the Insurance Code . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 416. It is unseemly and without authority on the subject of legislative interpretation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for this Court to suggest that a statute need only be complied with if doing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>fulfills its perceived purpose. We too are subject to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defendant judges call upon us to recognize their \"inherent supervisory authority\u201d as a basis for disregarding the mandate of MCL 750.167b(4); MSA 28.364(2)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The judges assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">To deny a court the jurisdiction and authority to review the moral fitness and/or financial responsibility of bail bondsmen, as well as compliance with the laws of the State of Michigan, would be to violate the very principles and beliefs which formulated the separation of powers doctrine; and the inherent supervisory authority a court has over <em>all </em>persons appearing before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">There can be no doubt but that the judges\u2019 task would be made easier if they could address their plight under a doctrine of \"inherent supervisory authority.\u201d I believe, however, that the plight and their view of the availability of inherent power is exaggerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">First, the judges are not as helpless as they seem to believe. While it would make more sense to be able to remove a bondsman from a list promulgated by the judges, in fact they have indicated their intention to disapprove of his bonds and sureties case by case. I do not think, however, that the better sense approach justifies reliance on the inherent power doctrine. The court is clearly not helpless, as evidenced by the fact that forfeitures against the plaintiff in nine different cases from the defendants\u2019 circuit were approved on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>appeal. See <em>Calvert v Lapeer Circuit Judges, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided November 28, 1992 (Docket No. 125191).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Secondly, while the defendants state, \"The Court of Appeals would have Michigan trial courts close their eyes to such misconduct and simply turn the matter over to the Commissioner of Insurance,\u201d there is no evidence that the circuit court, either on its own or through the State Court Administrator\u2019s office, has brought its concerns to the commissioner of insurance. It would be entirely too cynical to suggest that it is better to enroll yet another class of citizens as officers of the court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and declare yet another inherent authority, than to rely on a legislatively created regulatory scheme that must be adhered to and relied on by the public at large with similar concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In support of their position, defendants cite and quote an opinion of Federal District Judge Newblatt in which he dismissed a civil rights action filed by the plaintiff against the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\"[T]he Court finds that supervisory control of the conduct of licensed bail bondspersons acting as bail bondspersons is within the judicial power of the court(s) in which the bail bondsperson provides bond including the right to approve or reject the bonds proffered by the bondsperson. <em>The authority under Michigan law of the Insurance Commissioner to license bondspersons and to review and revoke such licenses does not negate the power of a court to control the conduct of such bonds-persons in that court. </em>MCL 550.103, 550.104, [500].1242(2) [MSA 24.243, 24.244, 24.11242(2)]. Moreover, the statute relied upon by the Michigan Court of Appeals in <em>Calvert v Lapeer Circuit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Judges, 187 Mich App 431 [468 NW2d 253] (1991), to hold that judges do not have authority to review the moral fitness or fiscal responsibility of bail bondspersons <em>only refers to posting of a list in a conspicuous place and does not in any way negate the power of the court to control the conduct of such licensees. </em>MCL 750.167[b](4) [MSA 28.364(2X4)] ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\"Accordingly, I hold that as to the matters alleged in Count i, the defendant state judges were acting in an area in which they have jurisdiction and were acting in their judicial and not their administrative capacity. Thus, they are absolutely immune.\u201d <em>[Calvert v Connolly, </em>unpublished opinion of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, decided June 30, 1992 (Docket No. 91-CV-40304-FL). Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">I, and. I am sure the majority, agree with Judge Newblatt, but it does not support the defendants\u2019 claim that they can disregard the mandate of the state statute. A careful reading of this quotation makes it clear that Judge Newblatt is referring to the ability of a judge to supervise his dealings with a bail bondsman who is acting on behalf of a defendant in a given case. He also supports the position taken by the majority, with which I agree, that the licensing authority of the insurance commissioner does not interfere with judges\u2019 ability to refuse to accept bonds written by plaintiff or a similarly situated surety. <em>Id. </em>The federal district judge then goes on to say that the statute denying the judges\u2019 \"authority to review the moral fitness or fiscal responsibility of bail bondspersons only refers to posting of a list in a conspicuous place and does not in any way negate the power of the court to control the conduct of such licensees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">I agree with Judge Newblatt and would find that, while the circuit judges have certainly done their best to keep the bail bond practices of their court above reproach, they have nonetheless unnecessarily exceeded their authority in having the plaintiff deleted from the list of those licensed to represent sureties in that county.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-5\">Riley, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\"> The majority cites <em>American Druggists Ins Co v Bogart, </em>707 F2d 1229, 1233 (CA 11, 1983) (placing a surety on a disqualification list for failing to pay a bond forfeiture violates the basic due process rights of the surety), <em>In re Johnson, </em>26 NC App 745, 748-749; 217 SE2d 85 (1975) (suspending a bondsman for one year was a disciplinary proceeding regarding the violation of a court order, not the revocation of his license), and <em>Summit Fidelity &amp; Surety Co of Akron, Ohio v Nimtz, </em>158 Neb 762; 64 NW2d 803 (1954) (issuing a writ of mandamus requiring the judges to refrain from enforcing a court rule regulating bondsmen where questions of fact remain was an abuse of discretion), in support of the rule announced, but those cases do not stand for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>proposition that the court can ignore a specific legislative mandate requiring a listing of bondsmen in the county.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> Defendant\u2019s agree with the dissent in the Court of Appeals that bondsmen are akin to bailiffs or lawyers and should be considered officers of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
