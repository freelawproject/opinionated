That contract was entered into on September 1, 1925, and provided that, \u201cif the\u201d appellant \u201cshall first make the payments and perform the covenants hereinafter mentioned on his part to be made and performed,\u201d the appellee \u201ccovenants and agrees to convey and assure to\u201d appellant \u201chis heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, in fee simple, clear of all incumbrances whatever, by a good and sufficient deed, the lot\u201d described, and the appellant agrees to pay to appellee \u201cthe sum of thirteen thousand dollars in the manner following: Six hundred fifty dollars cash in hand, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged; thirteen hundred fifty dollars thirty days after date or ten days after delivery of abstract; two thousand three hundred thirty three dollars thirty days after delivery of abstract;\u201d and other named amounts at stated dates thereafter. The bill contained averments to the following effect: The sum of $650 was paid by appellant at the time the contract was executed, and the sum of $1,-350 was paid by him on October 15, 1925. On the 13th and 24th days of January, 1926, appellant requested appellee \u2018\u201cto forward abstract of title as required of defendant by the terms and provisions of the contract aforesaid.\u201d During the latter part of January, 1926, appellee forwarded to appellant what purported to be an abstract of title covering said property. On February 2, 1926, appellant by letter advised appellee that appellant refused to accept the purported abstract \u201cas an abstract showing good title to said property,\u201d and demanded the return to appellant of the $2,000 theretofore paid by him, and interest on that sum. Appellee refused to comply with that demand or to rescind said contract. Between the time the contract was entered into and the time appellee failed and refused to furnish appellant with a proper abstract of title as required by the terms of said contract, appellant was ready, willing, and able to perform the terms and provisions of said contract by him to be performed. The contract, a copy of which was made an exhibit to the bill, contains no reference to an abstract of title except that contained in language above quoted. It confers on appellee the option of forfeiting or terminating it in case of appellant\u2019s failure to make any payment called for or to perform any of the covenants on his part, but contains no provision as to appellant canceling or terminating-the contract. The bill does not allege that appellee\u2019s title to the lot described is defective, or that appellee is insolvent or is or has been unable or unwilling to eonvey a good fee-simple title to that lot, clear of all incumbrances whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">The bill asserts the claim that appellant is entitled to a rescission or cancellation of the contract and to a repayment of the sums he has paid because of appellee\u2019s failure and refusal to furnish an abstract showing good title to said property. The contract imposes no such obligation on the appellee. It gave appellant no right to rescind because of appellee\u2019s failure to furnish an abstract of title, and did not make appellant\u2019s obligations to pay the stipulated amounts, and to accept a deed to the lot conveying a fee-simple title, clear of incumbrances, contingent upon his being furnished an abstract of title. The language of the instrument seems to be consistent with the parties contemplating that appellant would obtain an abstract of title from some one other than appellee. Even if the provision in that regard imposed an obligation on appellee, the furnishing by appellee of an abstract showing a good title was not made a condition precedent to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>pellant becoming and remaining obligated to pay <em>the </em>agreed price and to accept a good and sufficient deed of the lot conveying a fee-simple title, clear of incumbrances, and, so far as appears, appellant\u2019s remedy at law for appellee\u2019s breach of his obligation to furnish an abstract of title was not inadequate. This being so, and the allegations of the bill not showing that the contract sought to be canceled was voidable at the instance of the appellant because of mistake, fraud, imposition, or the existence of any recognized ground for granting the equitable remedy of cancellation or rescission, a right to equitable relief was not disclosed by the bill, and the court'did not err in sustaining the motion to dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The decree .is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
