The Commissioner assessed the additional tax on two grounds: First, profits from the sale of 9,200 shares of the common stock of the Pure Oil Company at $24.50 per share on a finding that the fair value on March 1, 1913 was $\u00cd5.25 per share instead of $22.50 as returned by the plaintitff; and, second, that while twenty dividends on the plaintiff\u2019s stock in corporations had been declared in 1916 and nine in 1917 and all paid in 1917, all were taxable at the 1917 rate instead of at the lower rate for 1916, when profits enough to pay all had been accumulated, as reported by the plaintiff in his income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-26\">The plaintiff had judgment on both phases of the action for the full amount of his claim and the government sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The question raised on the first ground for making the additional assessment is ruled adversely to the government by our decision this day made in Heiner, Collector, v. Crosby and Heiner, Collector, v. Anderton, 24 F.(2d) 191, where the facts, except as to the 'date the stoek was acquired or from which profit is reckoned, are the same as in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The question on the second ground for increasing the assessment had its rise in opposite meanings which the parties attributed to the words of subsections (a) and (b) of section 31 of the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended by the Revenue Act of 1917 (40 Stat. 337, 338 [Comp. St. \u00a7 6336z]), the first of which declares the term \u201cdividends\u201d to mean any \u201cdistribution\u201d made or ordered by a corporation out of its earnings or profits, and the second provides that any \u201cdistribution\u201d made to stockholders \u201cin the year 1917 * * * shall be deemed to have been made from the most recently accumulated undivided profits or surplus, and shall constitute a part of the annual income of the distributee for the year in which received.\u201d The question, regarded by the trial court as one purely of law, was whether distribution should be considered made when the dividend is declared, as contended by the plaintiff, or when the dividend is paid, as \u2022 contended by the government. The learned trial court held that distribution occurs when the dividend is declared. That question is now ruled adversely to the plaintiff by the decision of the Supreme Court in Mason v. Routzahn, Collector, 48 S. Ct. 50, 72 L. Ed.-, following a related decision in Edwards, Collector, v. Douglas, 269 U. S. 204, 46 S. Ct. 85, 70 L. Ed. 235, wherein that court held that \u201cthe date of payment, not the date of the declaration of the dividend, is the date of distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">But there still remains open the question as to which tax rate, that of 1916 or 1917, should be applied according as the facts show in which of the two years were the most recently accumulated earnings from which, according to the statute, the distributions were made. While the District Court did not in its opinion set forth specific findings of fact pursuant to section 7 of the Tucker Act (24 Stat. 505 [28 USCA \u00a7 764; Comp. St. \u00a7 1577]), Chase v. United States, 155 U. S. 489, 499, 15 S. Ct. 174, 39 L. Ed. 234, the facts recited in its opinion may have been sufficient to support its judgment based on its interpretation of the Revenue Act that distribution occurs when dividends are declared; but there are not sufficient findings of fact with reference to profits and surplus of the various corporations, if any, which had accumulated either during the whole of the year 1917 or in the fractional periods of that year prior to the several payments of dividends to enable the court now to render judgment conformably with the law of Mason v. Routzahn. Therefore the judgment must be reversed and the ease remanded for retrial in conformity with this opinion on the issue of profits from the sale of the plaintiff's stock in the Pure Oil Company and with the law of Mason v. Routzahn on the issue of the tax rate to be applied to dividends paid in 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
