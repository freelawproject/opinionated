Guekenheimer &amp; Bros! Company, against which the United States had a lien for the taxes sought to be distrained thereby. Thereupon John M. Ralston, who had bought said property at a sheriff\u2019s sale upon a judgment in a state court, recovered against said company subsequent to said lien, and of which lien notice was given to the sheriff before the sale, filed a bill in the court below, praying the collector be restrained from proceeding on the warrant. To this bill a demurrer was filed, raising the question of the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and alleging the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law, viz. to pay the tax under protest and bring suit to recover the same if wrongfully collected. On hearing the court sustained the demurrer, whereupon Ralston took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">In view of Rev. St. \u00a7 3224 (26 USCA \u00a7 154; Comp. St. \u00a7 5947), \u201cNo suit for the purpose of restraining the * * * collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court,\u201d and section 267 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA \u00a7 384), \u201cSuits in equity shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at'law,\u201d it is clear that these mandatory provisions constrained the court below to dismiss the bill. The fact that the present plaintiff is the successor in title to the taxpayer does not put him on any higher plane than the taxpayer, or confer any rights the latter did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">The judgment .below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
