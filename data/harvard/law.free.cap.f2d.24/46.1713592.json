The controversy involves only a single shipment of 1,250 tons. The decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>was for the difference between the alleged contract rate of $4.50 per ton and the higher rate of $6.72 per ton, which the shipper was obliged to pay to another carrier. The question raised here.is whether the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the libel on the ground that the alleged contract between the parties was void for lack of mutuality. The material parts of that instrument read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cShipper agrees to deliver all asphalt available for a period of ninety (90) days, beginning when the steamship Raimund is ready to load at Destrehan, to each steamer who agrees to load same, but shall not be obligated to load more than 1,500 tons per steamer, nor to shift to Destrehan for less than 1,000 tons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cDelivery as required by steamer. Steamer to give shippers 15 days\u2019 notice of the expected date ready to load Destrehan, at which time shippers are to declare quantity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Appellee, the Mexican Petroleum Corporation, had a large refinery near New Orleans at Destrehan, La. Asphalt was one of its by-products, a considerable part of which it exported to foreign ports, including .Hamburg, Germany. Appellant, -the North German Lloyd, maintained a regular line of steamers between New Orleans and German ports, and just prior to the execution of the contract in question had transported a number of appellee\u2019s shipments of asphalt to Hamburg. On June 23, 1926, appellee offered to deliver to appellant for transportation to Hamburg all asphalt \u201cavailable\u201d for a period of 90 days, but appellant replied that it would only agree to accept definitely stated amounts. Appellee refused to accept this counter proposition, the reason stated being that it did not know what its \u201crequirements\u201d would be. The final form of contract was agreed upon on June 29, but only after the insertion of the words \u201cto each steamer who agrees to load same\u201d in the first clause above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">It is argued here by appellee that, after the contract was entered into, appellant agreed to transport the asphalt it shipped at the higher rate, and therefore was bound in the amount of the decree, regardless of the validity of the contract sued on; but the evidence is insufficient to support that view. The testimony goes no further than to show that after the contract was signed tentative discussions were had, in which appellee\u2019s agent insisted upon asphalt being taken on a named ship, and appellant\u2019s agent refused to assume the undertaking. The rights of the parties must therefore depend upon the validity of the formal written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">The course of 'previous dealings between the parties, and the negotiations that led up to the execution of the contract in question were set out in the libel, and admitted by the court, at appellee\u2019s instance, as extrinsic evidence to explain any ambiguity there might be in the contract itself. The word \u201cavailable,\u201d as used in the contract and unexplained, would seem to describe only such asphalt as appellee might thereafter decide to ship to Hamburg. All asphalt produced at appellee\u2019s refinery was not exported, but some of it was disposed of in this country, and of that exported all was not shipped to Hamburg. That word, as explained by the extrinsic evidence, is not shown to have the same meaning as the word \u201crequirements,\u201d as is now contended; for it does not appear that appellee offered to ship all the asphalt it could sell to its customers in Hamburg. The question of appellee\u2019s requirements was not at any time the subject-matter of discussion. The quantity to be shipped depended entirely upon the uncontrolled future wish or desire of appellee. There was no method agreed upon by which it could be otherwise determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We are of opinion, also, aside from what has already been said, that appellant\u2019s agreement to carry was likewise unenforceable. There was no promise to take any ascertainable quantity, but only sueh as was delivered \u201cto each steamer who agrees to load.\u201d That language was inserted after appellee refused to ship definite quantities. It did not contemplate that shipments would be made on every steamer of the steamship line. It is therefore clear from the context that a future agreement, which would bind some of the steamers less than the whole number in the fleet, was intended. The use of the present for the future tense is not uncommon, and cannot prevail against the manifest intention of the parties. We think it is clear that the words \u201cto load\u201d mean to carry or transport, and serve only to identify from time to time such steamers as might thereafter be designated by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Our conclusion is that the alleged contract is unenforceable, because its performance was made to depend upon the mere will of either party to it. \u25a0 The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
