From the decision of the Commissioner, dismissing the opposition, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">It appears that since 1897 appellant company and its predecessor have been manufacturing and putting on the market the breakfast food made of wheat and barley under the trade-mark name of Grape-Nuts.\u201d An enormous business has been built up by this company, and it is claimed that it will be damaged' by the registration of the word \u201cWheat-Nut\u201d because of the similarity of the marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">In considering the matter of confusing similarity, we think it important to examine into the character of the goods on which the marks are used. The goods are both largely wheat 'products. The users of Grape-Nuts are familiar with the fact that the cereal sold under that name is chiefly produced from wheat; hence the adoption of the\u00bb word \u201cwheat\u201d as part of appellee\u2019s mark is merely the name of the produet on which the marks are used. This we deem important, in determining whether or not the marks are so similar as to lead to confusion. The purchasing public, seeking a wheat cereal, might easily be misled by the similarity of the marks, applied to the same product.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-24\">This case can be distinguished from the case of Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., 54 App. D. C. 285, 297 F. 544, where it was held by the Commissioner that the marks \u201cFig-Nuts\u201d and \u201cGrape-Nuts\u201d were not confusingly similar. This court refused to entertain an appeal in that ease, on the ground that the Trade-Mark Act of 1920 (15 USCA \u00a7 121 et seq.) does not provide for appeals from the decision of the Commissioner. While we are not called upon now to review the Commissioner\u2019s decision, it will be noted that the goods on which the marks in that ease were used were dissimilar. \u201cFig-Nuts\u201d is composed of figs and nuts. Besides, the marks are much more dissimilar than in the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-25\">We think that the present case is in line with the decision of the Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>Patents in Postum Cereal Co. v. Hillis, opposition No. 2098, <em>where the </em>question involved was the similarity of the marks \u201cGrape-Nuts\u201d and \u201cBran-Nuts.\u201d There, as here, the marks were applied to goods composed largely of a wheat produet, and the user of one might readily be confused by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">This case is not without difficulty; but, applying the rule, we have many times announced, that, \u201cwhere there is a doubt about the identity of two marks, the doubt will be resolved against the one last in the field\u201d (Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Blair Milling Co., 50 App. D. C. 281, 270 F. 1021), we think <em>the </em>opposition should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The decision of the Commissioner is-reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
