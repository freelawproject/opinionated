W., was occupied by them as a near-beer saloon and residence; that on the 18th of March, 1926, at about 9:15 p. m., Officer Blackwell, one of the affiants, purchased from Isaac Jacobs one-half pint of colored intoxicating liquor, paying therefor $1; that this liquor was ordered from Mrs. Jacobs, who had her husband get it from \u201cupstairs.\u201d Affiant Blackwell further stated \u201cthat he is positive that intoxicating liquor containing one-half of one per centum or more of alcohol by volume which is fit for use for beverage purposes\u201d is contained in the premises described in the search warrant. A search warrant issued under similar circumstances was sustained by this court in Maynard v. United States, 57 App. D. C. 314, 23 F.(2d) 141. That decision is controlling here. See, also, Dumbra v. United States, 268 U. S. 435, 45 S. Ct. 546, 69 L. Ed. 1032; Weeke v. United States (C. C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 398; Fry v. United States (C. C. A.) 9 F.(2d) 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-27\">The indictment against each defendant charged that \u201con, to wit, the 26th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1926, and at the District of Columbia aforesaid, [the defendant] did unlawfully and feloniously possess a certain intoxicating liquor, to wit, whisky containing one-half of 1 per c'entum and more of alcohol by volume, the said liquor so possessed as aforesaid being then and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>there fit for use for beverage purposes.\u201d This averment is challenged on the ground of indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Section 32, title 2, of the National Prohibition Act (41 Stat. 317 [27 TTSCA \u00a7 49]), provides that it shall not be necessary \u201cin any affidavit, information, or indictment to give the name of the purchaser or to include any defensive negative averments, but it shall be sufficient to state that the act complained of was then and there prohibited and unlawful.\u201d The section further authorizes the trial court to direct \u201cthe furnishing the defendant a bill of particulars when it deems it proper to do so.\u201d No request for such a bill was made by these defendants. Certainly in such circumstances the indictment is sufficient. Horowitz v. United States (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In the indictment against the husband, the first conviction of possessing intoxicating liquor was alleged to have occurred in the police court of the District of Columbia on or about April 7, 1923, and to have resulted in a sentence of a fine of $25, and, in default, to be committed to the Washington Asylum and Jail for a term of 30 days. The government introduced in evidence the records of a prior conviction on the 17th day of April, 1923, of the offense of the unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, in which Jacobs was sentenced to pay a fine of $25, and, in default, to serve 30 days in jail. This record was objected to on the ground of variance, and the point is presented here, although no authorities are cited in support of the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\"> In a ease where a party is proceeded against for a second or third offense under the statute, and the sentence prescribed is different from the first by reason of its being a second or third offense, the fact thus relied on must be averred in the indictment. Rex v. Allen, Russ. &amp; R. 513; Reg. v. Page, 9 C. &amp; P. 756; 3 Whart. C. L. \u00a7 3417; 1 Bish. C. L. (6th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 961, 963. But such an averment of prior conviction does not charge an offense. As stated by Lord Campbell in the ease of Reg. v. Clark, 20 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. Rep. 582: \u201cIt is only the averment of a fact which may affect the punishment. The jury do not find the person guilty of the previous offense; they only find that he was previously convicted of it, as an historical fact.\u201d It is apparent, we think, that Jacobs could have suffered no prejudice because of the averment in the indictment that his prior conviction was on the 7th, instead of on, as the record disclosed, the 17th, day of April, 1923. This is even more apparent, when it is considered that a similar discrepancy between the date upon which the second offense was alleged to have taken place and the date of its actual occurrence would not have constituted a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">The further contention is made in behalf of Isaac Jacobs that there was no proof of the identity of the Isaac Jacobs named in the record of the prior conviction. It is the general rule that identity of names will be accepted as prima facie evidence of identity of persons. State v. Lashus, 79 Me. 504, 11 A. 180; State v. Bizer, 113 Kan. 731, 216 P. 303; State v. Court, 225 Mo. 609, 125 S. W. 451; Bayha v. Mumford, 58 Kan. 445, 49 P. 601. There being no evidence in this case to rebut the prima facie presumption arising from the identity of names, there was a sufficient basis for the verdict of the jury. Lau v. United States (C. C. A.) 13 F.(2d) 975; Harris v. United States (C. C. A.) 10 F.(2d) 358; Belcher v. Commonwealth, 216 Ky. 126, 287 S. W. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The judgment in each case is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
