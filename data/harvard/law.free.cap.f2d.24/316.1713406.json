There is no dispute about the facts, and the single question for consideration is whether a child born on a merchant vessel of American registry, on the high seas, of parents of the Chinese race and subjects of China, but domiciled in the United States, to which country they are returning from China at the time of the child\u2019s birth, is a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The petitioner\u2019s contention is that a child so bom comes within the scope of section 1 of article 14 of the Constitution of the United States which provides that \u201call persons bom or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, axe citizens of the United States.' * * * \u201d The meaning of this provision and the general subject of citizenship, both by birth and by naturalization, are elaborately discussed in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 18 S. Ct. 456, 42 L. Ed. 890, where it is definitely held, in effect, that if the petitioner here had been bom within an area of land over which the United States exercises dominion as a sovereign power, he would be a citizen though of alien parentage. The real point in issue is therefore limited to the inquiry whether such a birth upon an American merchant vessel at sea is birth \u201cin the United States\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Undoubtedly petitioner\u2019s theory that a merchant ship is to be considered a part of the territory of the country under whose flag she sails finds a measure of support in statements made in some of the decided cases and in texts upon international law. But no one of the decisions brought to our attention involved the precise question here presented, and the general statement, or its equivalent, that a vessel upon the high seas is deemed to be a part of the territory of the nation whose flag she flies, must be understood as having a qualified or figurative meaning. Manifestly in a physical sense that must be true. In view of recent decisions of the Supreme Court, elaboration upon this point is thought to be unnecessary. Scharrenberg v. Dollar S. S. Co., 245 U. S. 122, 127, 38 S. Ct. 28, 62 L. Ed. 189; Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100, 122, 43 S. Ct. 504, 67 L. Ed. 894, 27 A. L. R. 1306. In the latter case the court had under consideration the territorial coverage of the clause \u201cUnited States and all territories subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d in the Eighteenth Amendment. Speaking of defendants\u2019 contention that by this language the Prohibition Law extends to domestic merchant ships outside the waters of the United States, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201cIn support of their contention the defendants refer to the statement sometimes made that a merchant ship is a part of the territory of the country whose flag she flies. But this, as has been aptly observed, is a figure of speech, a metaphor. Scharrenberg v. Dollar S. S. Co., 245 U. S. 122, 127, 38 S. Ct. 28, 62 L. Ed. 189; In re Ross, 140 U. S. 453, 464, 11 S. Ct. 897, 35 L. Ed. 581; 1 Moore, International Law Digest, \u00a7 174; Westlake, International Law (2d Ed.) p. 264; Hall, International Law (7th Ed., Higgins) see. 76; Manning, Law of Nations (Amos) p. 276; Piggott, Nationality, pt. II, p. 13. The jurisdiction which it is intended to describe arises out of the nationality of the ship, as established by her domicile, registry and use of the flag, and partakes more of the characteristics of personal than of territorial sovereignty. See The Hamilton, 207 U. S. 398, 403, 28 S. Ct. 133, 52 L. Ed. 264; American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U. S. 347, 355, 29 S. Ct. 511, 53 L. Ed. 826, 16 Ann. Cas. 1047; 1 Oppenheim, International Law (3d Ed.) \u00a7'\u00a7 123-125,128. It is chiefly applicable to ships on, the high seas, where there is no territorial sovereign; and as respects ships in foreign territorial waters it has little application beyond what is affirmatively or tacitly permitted by the local sovereign. 2 Moore, International Law Digest, \u00a7\u00a7 204, 205; Twiss, Law of Nations (2d Ed.) \u00a7166; Woolsey, international Law (6th Ed.) \u00a7 58; 1 Oppenheim, International Law (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 128, 146, 260. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>fendants further contend that the Amendment covers foreign merchant ships when within the territorial waters of the United States. Of course, if it were true that a ship is a part of the territory of the country whose flag she carries, the contention would fail. But, as that is a fiction, we think the contention is right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">And it was further said-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cVarious meanings are sought to be attributed to the term \u2018territory\u2019 in the phrase \u2018the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u2019 We are of opinion that it means the regional areas \u2014 of land and adjacent waters \u2014 over which the United States claims and exercises dominion and control as a sovereign power. The immediate context and the purport of the entire section show that the term is used in a physical and not a metaphorical sense \u2014 that it refers to areas or districts having fixity of location and recognized boundaries. See United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 390, 4 L. Ed. 404. It now is settled in the United States and recognized elsewhere that the territory subject to its jurisdiction includes the land areas under its dominion and control, the ports, harbors, bays and other enclosed arms of the sea along its coast and a marginal belt of the sea extending from the coast line outward a marine league, or three geographic miles [citing eases]. This, we hold, is the territory which the amendment, designates as its field of operation; and the designation is not of a part of this territory, but of \u2018all\u2019 of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We find no substantial reason for holding the phrase of the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cin the United States,\u201d was intended to have a wider scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It is said upon behalf of the petitioner that under this view we would have an absurd and- unjust result in that appellant and others similarly situated would have no political status and would be in the position of a man without \u00e1 country. But such conclusion does not necessarily follow. In Inglis v. Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. 99, 155, 70 L. Ed. 617, Mr. Justice Story said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201cTwo things usually concur to create citizenship; First, birth locally within the dominions of the sovereign; and secondly, birth within the protection and obedience, or, in other words, within the ligeance of the sovereign. That is, the party must be bom within a place where the sovereign is, at the time, in full possession and exercise of his power, and the party must also, at his birth, derive protection from, and consequently owe obedience or allegiance to, the sovereign, as such de facto. * \u2022 * There are some exceptions, which are founded upon peculiar reasons, and which, indeed, illustrate 'and confirm the general doctrine. Thus, a person who is bom on the ocean is a subject of the prince to whom his parents then owe allegiance; for he is still deemed under the protection of his sovereign, and bom in a place where he has dominion in common with all other sovereigns. So the children of an ambassador are held to be subjects of the prince whom he represents, although bom under the actual protection and in the dominions of a foreign prince.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">And the language was quoted with apparent approval in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 659, 18 S. Ct. 456, 42 L. Ed. 890. In that view appellant is not without a country, but was bom in allegiance to and under the protection of the Chinese government, with such temporary qualification only of the rights and obligations of that sovereignty as are recognized by the law of nations during the time the nationals of one country are being carried on the ships of another on the high seas. Moreover, if we resort to considerations ab inconvenienti as an aid to construction, we are inclined to think that in a comprehensive view the weight of such argument is against appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
