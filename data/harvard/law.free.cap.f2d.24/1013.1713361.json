After an adverse decision by the Board of Examiners in Chief, appellant canceled all the rejected claims and substituted others, which the Board refused to consider. On Appeal to the Commissioner, he ruled that \u201cwhile these claims should have been presented to the examiner in order that his opinion as to them should be before the appellate tribunals, yet in view of the history of the case, these claims will be admitted and here considered.\u201d After full consideration, the Commissioner disallowed, the substituted claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-26\">We have carefully examined the Commissioner\u2019s decision in the light of appellant\u2019s argument and brief, and are convinced of its correctness. We therefore affirm the decision, without a restatement of reasons. Af.firmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
