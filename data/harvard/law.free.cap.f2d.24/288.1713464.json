On the record, therefore, neither of these companies was entitled to registration. Thereupon both companies filed evidence tending to establish abandonment by Schneider of the mark. It is in evidence that Schneider attempted to sell his mark to the Chesterfield Company for $1,000, and that, his offer being refused, he sold it to the Sexton Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">Patent Office tribunals, after a review of the evidence, have found that Schneider had made no' trade-mark use of the word \u201cChesterfield\u201d ; and that the attempted sale of the mark, unaccompanied by any business, con'ferred no rights upon the Sexton Company. We concur in this ruling. Rice-Stix Dry Goods Co. v. Schwarzenbach-Huber Co., 47 App. D. C. 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">It clearly appears, as found by the Patent Office, that, as between the Chesterfield Company and the Sexton Company, the Chesterfield Company was the first to adopt and use this mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
