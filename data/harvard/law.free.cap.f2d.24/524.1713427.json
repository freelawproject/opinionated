The following are appellant\u2019s assignment of errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cFirst. That the court erred in entering the decree therein entered on the 19th day of November, 1926.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cSecond. That the court erred in its order of the 14th day of January, 1927, in refusing to permit the defendant to file his amended answer therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Federal equity rule 17 provides that a final decree entered, after the expiration of 30 days after the entry of the order pro confesso, \u201cshall be deemed absolute, unless the court shall, at the same term, set aside the same, or enlarge the time for filing the answer, upon cause shown upon motion and affidavit.\u201d It doesl not appear from the record that any cause for setting aside the final decree was \u201cshown upon motion and affidavit\u201d; no cause being alleged in the motion to. be permitted to file an amended answer, and no affidavit as to the existence of a cause being presented or filed. This being so, the court is not chargeable with error in denying the motion to file an amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">If the defense sought to be made had been duly made, it would not have been sustainable. It appears from the allegations of the proposed amended answer that the defense sought to be made was based on oral representations of an agent of the appellee to the effect that the engine which was the subject of the contract of sale and of the mortgage made in pursuance of that contract would be suitable for a vessel which the appellant was constructing when that contract was made, and would furnish reasonable and proper motive power for such-vessel. The subject of the written contract being a known, described, and definite article, there was no implied warranty that it would accomplish the purpose for which the appellant bought it, though the appellee knew the purpose which the appellant intended to accomplish with it, and parol evidence to prove an express warranty by the appellee that the article would be suitable to accomplish such purpose is not admissible.
