If the defendants did the things charged, they were guilty of a breach of their undertaking, and actually appropriated to their use the product of plaintiff\u2019s labors and expenditures of money. We are of opinion that the complaint shows grounds for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">It appears that there is a suit pending on the patent granted plaintiff upon the device in question, for which the court compelled the bringing of a separate suit. It would seem that, under equity rule 26, plaintiff had the right to join his two causes of action, and, in the interest of economy of time and effort, it appears desirable that in this ease that should be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">The order of dismissal is reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, to proceed in harmony with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
