The whole phrase \u00e1bove quoted is mere surplusage; it adds nothing to the crime alleged, is a mere conclusion of law, and its omission would have been immaterial. The other assignments of error are equally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
