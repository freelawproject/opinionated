The record does n\u2019ot show that there was a certificate of probable cause for the allowance of such appeal, as required by statute. U. S. C. tit. 28, \u00a7 466 (28 USCA \u00a7 466; Comp. St. \u00a7 1293). Under that statute the appeal was not allowable in the absence of such certificate. It follows that the appeal should \u25a0be dismissed. We will add that, if that order had been subject to be reviewed by this court, it seems that it would be subject to be affirmed on the authority of the decision in the case of Dunn v. Lyons, Sheriff (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 14; Id., 48 S. Ct. 305, 72 L. Ed.- (Oct., 1927, term).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
