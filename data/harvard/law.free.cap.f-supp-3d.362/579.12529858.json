The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, putting before me the question whether the claim can be decided as a matter of law based on undisputed facts, without a trial.

[DE 63-1 at 5,6.] ERC received the collection account of plaintiff Erin Johnson with Sprint on March 6 or 7, 2016. [DE 63-1 at 17.] Johnson has never used a cell phone for other than personal use, and therefore the debt on her account with Sprint was not incurred for business purposes. [DE 63-2 at 27.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ERC sent Johnson three collection letters concerning her Sprint account. The initial collection letter was sent by ERC on March 8, 2016. Here's what it said in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon receipt and clearance of $1,094.72 [full balance of debt], your account will be closed and collection efforts will cease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   This letter serves as notification that your delinquent account may be reported to the national credit bureaus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [DE 65-1 at 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A second letter dated April 21, 2016 is the focus of this lawsuit. Johnson did not receive the April 21 letter until May 5, 2016. [DE 63-2 at 23.] The pertinent portion of the letter reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Our records indicate that your balance with Sprint remains unpaid; therefore your account has been placed with ERC for collection efforts. We are willing to reduce your outstanding balance by offering discounted options.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Option 1: Pay the settlement of $875.78, please remit by May 26, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Option 2: Pay the settlement of $930.51, payable in 2 monthly payments of $465.26.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Option 3: Pay the settlement of $985.25, payable in 3 monthly payments of $328.42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We are not obligated to renew this offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    This letter serves as notification that your delinquent account may be reported to the national credit bureaus.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Payment of the offered settlement amount will stop collection activity on this matter....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Unless you dispute the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, within thirty (30) days after your receipt of this notice, the debt will be assumed to be valid by us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [DE 65-1 at 5] (emphasis added). The language I have emphasized in bold is what is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ERC's Senior Vice President of Compliance, Jason Davis, testified in his deposition that \"collection activity\" as used in the letter meant that phone calls and letters from ERC about the account would stop upon receipt of the full amount of the debt, and if the debt had already been reported, full payment would result in updated credit reporting to reflect that the debt had been paid in full or settled. [DE 63-1 at 3, 20.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Depending on the client, ERC waits between 33 and 45 days after it sends the first collection letter before reporting a debt to credit bureaus. [DE 63-1 at 12.] According to ERC's policies, Johnson's debt to Sprint became eligible for credit reporting on April 21, 45 days after ERC received the account. [DE 63-1 at 22.] ERC first reported Johnson's Sprint account debt to credit reporting agencies on April 24, 2016, more than a month before the earliest due date of the settlement options offered in the April 21 letter. [DE 63-1 at 19.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Johnson testified that the April 21 letter was not clear whether her debt would be reported or had already been reported. [DE 63 at \u00b6 36.] Johnson interpreted the April 21 letter to mean that she could prevent the Sprint account from appearing on her credit reports if she made a payment as requested in the letter, or disputed the debt within 30 days as referenced in the letter. [DE 63 at \u00b6 38.] Recall that Johnson received the April 21 letter in early May. And the day after reading the April 21 letter, Johnson checked her credit reports and found that the debt had already been reported. [DE 63-2 at 23.] She then disputed the debt to TransUnion and contacted an attorney. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A third letter was sent to Johnson dated June 6, 2018. [DE 63-6 at 2.] The June 6 letter is largely identical to the April 21 letter, offering three settlement options (but for lower amounts more favorable to the debtor than previously offered). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Johnson did not submit any payment on her Sprint account, but on July 24, 2016, ERC sent a \"deletion\" to the credit bureaus concerning Johnson's account because ERC had received notice of Johnson's \"lawsuit or pre-suit\" disputing the debt. [DE 63-1 at 19.] Johnson never made\n   any payments to ERC on the Sprint account, but does not dispute the accuracy of the balance due on the account.

In a case of this kind, the Court of Appeals has held \"that plaintiffs may prevail only by producing extrinsic evidence, such as consumer surveys, to prove that unsophisticated consumers do in fact find the challenged statements misleading or deceptive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043488\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/790/#p800\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501419\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/818/#p822\">\n    689 F.3d at 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The third type of case described in\n   <em>\n    Ruth\n   </em>\n   is a lay down win for the plaintiff. These are the cases where the collection letter includes plainly deceptive language. When confronted with such a letter, a court can grant summary judgment to the plaintiff \"without requiring them to prove what is already clear.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3501419\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/689/818/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Recall that Johnson's claim is based on letter that she received from ERC dated April 21 and which she received in early May. This was the second of three letters that she received from\n   ERC. Johnson argues that this letter falls into the third category of claims as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Ruth\n   </em>\n   - that the letter is plainly misleading on its face because it falsely suggested that credit reporting could be prevented by timely payment of an offered settlement amount. [DE 62 at 15.] The argument depends on Johnson's interpretation of the phrase \"may be\" in the notification \"that your delinquent account may be reported to the national credit bureaus,\" and her interpretation of the subsequent sentence advising that \"[p]ayment of the offered settlement amount will stop collection activity on this matter.\" [DE 71-1 at 2.] ERC contends that the notice is not plainly deceptive or misleading. Instead, ERC argues this is a category 2 case as described in\n   <em>\n    Ruth\n   </em>\n   in which Johnson can only prevent summary judgment in ERC's favor by offering extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion or deception, which Johnson admittedly does not have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even with the understanding that credit bureau reporting is \"collection activity\" within the meaning of the letter, the letter does not\n   <em>\n    plainly\n   </em>\n   indicate either that credit bureau reporting has not yet taken place or that timely payment will prevent a report of the debt to the national credit bureaus. A consumer might possibly construe the letter to mean those things, but would not necessarily do so. It is also reasonable to construe the letter as intended, namely as a notice that the delinquent account is subject to credit reporting (which could occur or has already occurred), but that payment of an offered settlement will impact any credit reporting (such as by an updated notice that the debt has been resolved) as well as other collection efforts (such as additional dunning letters). The \"delinquent account\" language may reasonably be read as a statement about eligibility for credit reporting but not a statement as to whether or not the account has yet been reported. That the same notice about reporting to the national credit bureaus appears in all three letters, both before and after the debt was reported, supports this generic interpretation, because the language is then accurate in all three letters both before and after actual reporting took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the second sentence of the challenged language, the phrase \"stop collection activity\" cannot reasonably be read to mean \"\n   <em>\n    prevent\n   </em>\n   collection activity\" when the language appears in a letter that is itself \"collection activity.\" Like the sentence about credit reporting, this statement about stopping collection activity is accurate in all three letters if understood to mean that resolution of the debt will stop\n   <em>\n    further\n   </em>\n   collection activity, which for a debt already reported means an updated report reflecting that the debt has been resolved. With respect to a debt already reported, because the word \"stop\" connotes \"bring to a halt\" rather than \"delete\" or \"reverse,\" reasonable interpretation includes action taken to reflect the satisfaction of the previously reported debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Johnson wrongly asserts that ERC ignores the three categories of\n   <em>\n    Ruth\n   </em>\n   to contend that extrinsic evidence is always necessary to support a \u00a7 1692(e) claim. [DE 75 at 2-3.] To the contrary, ERC expressly acknowledges that extrinsic evidence of consumer confusion is required only in the one category of cases involving language that is not confusing or misleading on its face but might be so to a significant fraction of the population. [DE 71 at 5, 7.] Johnson's efforts to avoid an adverse summary judgment depend on her misinterpretation of the standard for the second category of cases. The first and third categories involve statements that are, on the one hand,\n   <em>\n    plainly\n   </em>\n   not deceptive, or, on the other,\n   <em>\n    plainly\n   </em>\n   are deceptive, leaving the middle category as the broader one encompassing statements that are only\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   deceptive. But Johnson argues that the 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit has held that extrinsic evidence is not required of a consumer-debtor where a collection representation is \"susceptible to two different constructions, one of which is inaccurate.\" [DE 75 at 5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Veach v. Sheeks\n   </em>\n   , one of the cases Johnson relies on for this proposition, is distinguishable because it involves an actual misrepresentation as to the amount of the debt, not a statement that is merely potentially confusing or misleading.\n   <em>\n    Veach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9378383\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/690/#p693\">\n    316 F.3d at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Chuway v.

Ruling on the previous motion to dismiss, I noted that the word \"may\" has two different possible meanings in its context here - either \"can\" or \"might in future.\" [DE 27 at 9.] The former interpretation is espoused by ERC and, as a statement of the debt's eligibility for credit reporting, was true each time it was used in the three collection letters. Johnson points out that if the word \"may\" is read as \"might in future\" then the statement, when interpreted in conjunction with the next sentence about payment stopping collection activity, might suggest that timely payment could prevent credit reporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Johnson cites\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

And like\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , these decisions also identify the principle Johnson relies on as flowing from the lower \"least sophisticated debtor\" standard that is inapplicable in the Seventh Circuit.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

But that is neither here nor there for present purposes. In a hierarchical system of courts, my job is to follow what my superiors tell me, and the Seventh Circuit has made it abundantly clear that \"the unsophisticated-debtor standard is an objective one and is not the same as the rejected least-sophisticated-debtor standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Durkin v. Equifax Check Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095668\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/410/#p414\">\n    406 F.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (7th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, I am persuaded that under the Seventh Circuit's approach, ERC is correct when it argues that the two possible interpretations require extrinsic evidence to establish that a significant fraction of the population would be misled by the letter's language. [DE 71 at 5.] Because the language is not\n   <em>\n    plainly\n   </em>\n   deceptive, \"the plaintiff must come forward with evidence beyond the letter and beyond [her] own self-serving assertions that the letter is confusing in order to create a genuine issue of material fact[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Durkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095668\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/410/#p414\">\n    406 F.3d at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This extrinsic evidence can take the form of an appropriately designed and conducted consumer survey or an appropriate expert witness.\n   <em>\n    Sims v.

Plaintiff lacks any such objective evidence, banking instead on her assertion that the letter \"is deceptive on its face.\" [DE 62 at 15.] Now with all the parties' evidence and argument before me, I reject that position. Because I conclude that the challenged statements in ERC's letter are not plainly misleading or deceptive, Johnson's failure to offer extrinsic evidence that the language would confuse or mislead a significant fraction of the population is fatal to her FDCPA claim.\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2783448\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/959/#p963\">\n    445 F.3d at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The delinquency notice provided by ERC presents the \"normal case\" in which a plaintiff alleging a violation of the FDCPA for confusing or misleading statements \"must come forward with more than her own confusion as evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney v.

Without a showing by extrinsic evidence that the language Johnson cites \"unacceptably increases the level of confusion\" such that \"a significant fraction of the population would be similarly misled,\" ERC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Sims v.
