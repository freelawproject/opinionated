BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involves a police encounter in the parking lot of a Dothan Walmart. The Recommendation adequately recites the facts, and neither Mestre nor the government disputes them. Bermudez challenges only two of the Recommendation's findings of fact. Because these two findings are closely entwined with the Recommendation's legal conclusions, they are discussed in Part III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend IV. Thus, there must be a \"search\" or a \"seizure\" to trigger the Fourth Amendment's protections. No party objects to the Recommendation's finding that a seizure occurred here. But the Recommendation is unclear on precisely\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the seizure occurred, and that issue is critical to the case. For a seizure to be valid, it must be \"justified at its inception.\"\n   <em>\n    May v.

Determining when the seizure occurred, therefore, determines what facts the court may consider in determining reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Recommendation appears to find that the seizure occurred when Officer Hughes retained Defendants' identification. Bermudez contends that the seizure occurred the moment Officer Hughes opened the door of the vehicle and began\n   speaking to Defendants. For these reasons, Bermudez is correct, and his objection on that point is sustained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The seizure occurred when Officer Hughes opened the door and began questioning Defendants.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Not all police-citizen encounters are seizures.

The video shows Officer Hughes, without Defendants' permission, opening the car door and beginning to ask questions without first asking whether Defendants were willing to speak with him. Although Officer Hughes began by asking whether Defendants were all right, the questions quickly moved from a simple \"welfare check\" to asking where Defendants were from and what they were doing. During this conversation, Officer Hughes was standing before the open car door, holstered weapon visible, as Defendants laid across the second-row seat. It would have been difficult for Defendants to get out of the car or drive away if they wished. Although the conversation was friendly at first, Officer Hughes initiated contact by opening the door and asking questions without first seeking Defendants' permission. This is evidence not of a consensual encounter, but a show of authority that would have led a reasonable person to believe he was not free to end the conversation and leave. The court therefore finds that the seizure occurred the moment Officer Hughes opened the door and began questioning Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     No reasonable suspicion to support a seizure existed before Officer Hughes opened the door and began questioning Defendants.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Recommendation concludes there was reasonable suspicion justifying a seizure based largely on events occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the seizure, including Defendants' unusual travel plans, their explanation for\n   sleeping in the Walmart parking lot, and the new clothes in the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Officer Hughes ascertained this information\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he opened the door and began questioning Defendants;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after the seizure had occurred. Because a seizure must be justified from its inception, the court considers only the facts available to Officer Hughes at the moment he opened the car door and began questioning Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   That leaves only three facts based on which Officer Hughes could have suspected wrongdoing: (1) Officer Hughes had seen the two men in the parking lot the day before;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) they were present in a high-crime area; and (3) they were asleep in a late-model SUV.

Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11289368\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/592/#p595\">\n    976 F.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595-96 (9th Cir. 1992). Second, while an individual's presence in a high crime area is among the \"relevant contextual considerations\" in the reasonable-suspicion analysis, this fact, \"standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p124\">\n    528 U.S. at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p124\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Nor does an individual's presence in a high-crime location on two consecutive days support reasonable suspicion, especially when that location is the most popular retailer in America.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jessica Tyler,\n   <em>\n    These Are the 20 Biggest Retailers in America\n   </em>\n   , Business Insider (Aug. 13, 2018, 12:56 PM), https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-retailers-in-america-based-on-sales-2018-8. Finally, that Defendants were sleeping in their late-model SUV does not support reasonable suspicion. This fact \"would likely apply to a considerable number of those traveling for perfectly legitimate purposes\" and does not \"reasonably provide ... suspicion of criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9053597\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/1102/#p1107\">\n    351 F.3d at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, there is no evidence Officer Hughes received a complaint about Defendants' presence in the Walmart parking lot. Second, Defendants did not appear furtive or nervous when Officer Hughes began questioning them. Finally and most importantly, Officer Hughes could not articulate why Defendants' otherwise-innocent behavior led him to suspect that criminal activity was afoot, or what sort of criminal activity he suspected. Because Officer Hughes did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the stop, his later search of the vehicle was also unjustified under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For these reasons, Officer Hughes's search and seizure violated Defendants' Fourth Amendment rights. The Recommendation is therefore rejected, and Defendants' motions to suppress are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is ORDERED as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. The Magistrate Judge's Recommendation (Doc. # 59) is REJECTED to the extent discussed herein;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Defendants' objections (Doc. # 63, 68) are SUSTAINED to the extent discussed herein; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Defendants' motions to suppress (Doc. # 34, 38) are GRANTED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DONE this 23rd day of January, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Mestre, unlike Bermudez, does not argue with Recommendation's finding that the seizure occurred when Officer Hughes retained Defendants' licenses. He thus says \"the facts should be limited to those available\" to Officer Hughes up until he retained Defendants' licenses. (Doc. # 63, at 11.) And those facts, he says, do not support a finding of reasonable suspicion. For the reasons discussed in Part III.A, Bermudez has the better argument. That is, the Fourth Amendment seizure occurred when Officer Hughes opened the door and began questioning Defendants, not when Officer Hughes retained Defendants' licenses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller v.

Though not a \"blatant\" contradiction, the video shows Officer Hughes approaching the vehicle, peering in the back window, then waving to those inside. The door handle is just outside the camera's view when the door clicks open, but the camera immediately turns back to show Officer Hughes with his right hand on the door handle and his left hand on the side of the door pulling it open. The representation that Bermudez opened the door is also belied by the fact that the video shows Bermudez in a position that would not easily allow him to open the door. The second-row seat is folded down and Bermudez is laying on top of it, with only his upper body visible. One hand appears to be beneath him as he lays on his side, and the other hand is holding a shoe. Had Bermudez moments earlier reached for the door handle, one would expect one hand to be free and near the door. Moreover, the Recommendation found that Hughes opened the door, (Doc. # 59, at 2), and no party objected to that finding. The court therefore finds that it was Officer Hughes, not Bermudez, who opened the door.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Bermudez objects to the Recommendation's finding that Officer Hughes \"noticed that their car contained brand new clothes, still folded, with the tags intact, compounding his suspicion that they were engaged in criminal activity.\" (Doc. # 59, at 12.) That objection is sustained. The body camera video shows that when Officer Hughes opened the door, there were some clothes underneath Bermudez as if he had been sleeping on top of them, but they are rumpled up and no tags are immediately visible. Officer Hughes discovered the \"new clothes\" upon a full-fledged search of the vehicle. And that information arose well after Defendants were seized.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Bermudez objects to the Recommendation's finding that Defendants \"had parked in a high crime area for more than 24 hours.\" (Doc. # 59, at 11.) That objection is sustained. Hughes admitted on cross-examination that he did not know \"whether the vehicle had moved and come back or was just there for 24 hours.\" (Doc. # 56, at 30.) He also admitted that the vehicle was not in the same spot, but the same general area. (Doc. # 56, at 29.) It is unremarkable that someone would visit Walmart two days in a row. So without other evidence, seeing the same vehicle in the Walmart parking lot on two consecutive days does not prove it was there the entire period. Thus, Bermudez' objection is sustained on the Recommendation's finding that Defendants remained in the parking lot for 24 hours.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
