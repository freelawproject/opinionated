INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 8, 2018, Plaintiffs Kevin Sabicer and Marilyn Sabicer filed this action in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Defendants Ford Motor Company (\"Ford\"), Santa Margarita Ford, and Does 1 through 10. (Dkt. 1-2 [Complaint, hereinafter \"Compl.\"].) On January 22, 2012, Plaintiffs purchased a 2011 Ford F-150 (\"the Vehicle\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) In connection with the purchase, Plaintiffs received an express warranty in which Ford undertook to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the Vehicle or to provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance of the Vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The Vehicle later developed defects, including problems related to the driveshaft, transmission, suspension, traction control, and other components and systems, and Plaintiffs took the Vehicle to Santa Margarita Ford for repairs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to service or\n   repair these defects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Plaintiffs assert causes of action against Ford for (1) violation of California Civil Code \u00a7 1793.2(d), (2) violation of California Civil Code \u00a7 1793.2(b), (3) violation of California Civil Code \u00a7 1793.2(a)(3), (4) breach of express written warranty, and (5) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-30.) Plaintiffs assert a cause of action against Santa Margarita Ford for (6) negligent repair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ford removed the case to federal court on December 10, 2018, invoking diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. 1 [Notice of Removal].) According to the Notice of Removal, Ford is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Michigan. Ford concedes that Santa Margarita Ford is a citizen of California, but contends that its citizenship should be ignored for purposes of diversity jurisdiction because Santa Margarita Ford is fraudulently joined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9.) On January 10, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the action to Los Angles Superior Court, arguing that Santa Margarita Ford had not been fraudulently joined, that Ford failed to prove the amount in controversy exceeds $ 75,000, and that Ford failed to offer proof of Plaintiffs' citizenship. (Dkt. 9.) For the following reasons, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A civil action brought in state court, but over which a federal court may exercise original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant to a federal district court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

If at any time before final judgment, the court determines that it is without subject matter jurisdiction, the action shall be remanded to state court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Conversely, \"if there is any possibility that the state law might impose liability on a resident defendant under the circumstances alleged in the complaint, the federal court cannot find that joinder of the resident defendant was fraudulent, and remand is necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1044.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants have not carried their burden of showing that Plaintiffs obviously fail to state a cause of action against Santa Margarita Ford. Plaintiffs bring a cause of action against Santa Margarita Ford for negligent repair. The elements of negligence are duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n   <em>\n    Burgess v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2005404\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/2/1064/#p1072\">\n    2 Cal. 4th 1064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1072,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20615\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.2d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=831%20P.2d%201197\">\n    831 P.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). \"One who undertakes\n   repairs has a duty arising in tort to do them without negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Sw. Forest Indus., Inc. v. Westinghouse Elec.

In support of their negligent repair claim, Plaintiffs allege that they took their Vehicle to Santa Margarita Ford on at least one occasion. (Compl. \u00b6 32.) They further allege that Santa Margarita Ford owed them a duty to use ordinary care and skill in the storage, preparation, and repair of their Vehicle and that Santa Margarita Ford breached this duty by failing to properly store, prepare, and repair the Vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) They allege this breach was a proximate cause of their damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue that the economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs' negligent repair claim against Santa Margarita Ford. The economic loss rule arises out of \"[t]he distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Seely v. White Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2335733\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/63/9/#p18\">\n    63 Cal. 2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2017\">\n    45 Cal.Rptr. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.2d%20145\">\n    403 P.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965). In other words, while a manufacturer may be appropriately held liable for physical injuries, regardless of the terms of any warranty, the manufacturer cannot be held liable \"for the level of performance of his products in the consumer's business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer's demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2017\">\n    45 Cal.Rptr. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.2d%20145\">\n    403 P.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, a plaintiff may recover in tort \"when a product defect causes damage to 'other property,' that is, property\n   <em>\n    other than the product itself\n   </em>\n   ,\" whereas \"[t]he law of contractual warranty governs damage to the product itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v.

Plaintiffs allege problems with various subcomponents of the engine, including the rear driveshaft, engine compartment, and turbocharger. (Compl. \u00b6 10.) The economic loss rule would not bar recovery in tort for damage that these subcomponents cause to the engine as a whole or for damage that the engine caused to the Vehicle in which it has been incorporated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777255\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/473/#p483\">\n    29 Cal. 4th at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20614\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20P.3d%20450\">\n    58 P.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the manufacturer of a defective window may be liable in tort for damage that the window's defect causes to other parts of the home, but expressing no opinion as to \"whether there may be situations in which the economic loss rule would bar recovery for damages that a defective component part causes to other portions of the finished product of which it is a part\"). Defendants have failed to prove that a customer could not possibly recover against a dealership for negligent repair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lytle v.

June 13, 2016) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs' negligent repair claim against Santa Margarita Ford is barred by the two-year statute of limitations. In their Notice of Removal and opposition, Defendants cite to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 339, asserting that a two-year statute of limitations applies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal at 10; Dkt. 11 [Opposition] at 9.) But section 339 deals with causes of action based on contract, not tort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20339\">\n    Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For injury to personal property, a three-year statute of limitations applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20339\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 338(c)(1). From the allegations in the Complaint, Plaintiffs' negligent repair claim is not time barred on its face. Defendants assert that the last repair occurred on July 14, 2015 and that Plaintiffs have alleged no facts to justify tolling the statute of limitations. (Opp'n at 10-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 Ex. 3 [Repair History].) But the relevant inquiry is whether Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   state a claim for negligent repair against Santa Margarita Ford. Under the delayed discovery rule, courts postpone commencement of the limitation period until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered all facts essential to his cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Camsi IV v. Hunter Tech. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4394603\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/230/1525/#p1536\">\n    230 Cal.

Defendants have failed to prove that there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   possibility that Plaintiffs could invoke the delayed discovery rule to assert a negligent repair claim against Santa Margarita Ford.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061131\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/1039/#p1043\">\n    582 F.3d at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alternatively, Defendants ask this Court to exercise its discretion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 to dismiss Santa Margarita Ford as a party. Dismissal of dispensable nondiverse parties should be exercised sparingly after considering whether such dismissal will prejudice any of the parties in the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p832\">\n    490 U.S. 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p832\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605006\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/826/#p832\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). The Court declines to do so here. The claims of both Ford and Santa Margarita Ford are sufficiently intertwined, factually and legally, that severance would be inconvenient and inefficient. As Santa Margarita Ford performed many of the repairs of the Vehicle, it would be far more convenient for Plaintiffs to present any claims related to those repairs in the same case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In light of the presumption against removal jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514302\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/980/564/#p566\">\n    980 F.2d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Defendants have failed to show that joinder of Santa Margarita Ford was fraudulent.
