Thus, Defendants were not fiduciaries when selecting the Principal CITs' underlying investments as alleged in the Complaint because those actions all occurred before the parties executed the relevant participation agreements.

Therefore, even though Defendants were not fiduciaries for their selection of investment options for the Principal CITs before they entered into the participation agreements with the Retirement Plans, they became fiduciaries after the agreements because the agreements named them as fiduciaries and because they \"ha[d] the exclusive right to manage and control the Target Date Funds.\" [ECF No. 23-3 at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court also finds that Plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to show that Defendants PMC and PGI were fiduciaries as the investment advisors of the Principal CITs.

The court's analysis of the plaintiffs' second theory that the defendants imprudently limited the investments in the plan and therefore offered investments with excessively high fees was decided on a different basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329886\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/575/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329886\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/575/\">\n    at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But in the present case, Plaintiffs have not alleged that Defendants inadequately informed them of the total fees. Instead, Plaintiffs claim is more similar to the plaintiffs' secondary theory in\n   <em>\n    Hecker.\n   </em>\n   However, as will be discussed below, when the Court views the facts alleged by Plaintiffs in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Complaint's allegations raise an inference that the overall fees were higher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants also cite\n   <em>\n    Sacerdote v.

Aug. 25, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Sacerdote\n   </em>\n   , the court held the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for a breach of the duty of loyalty because there were no factual allegations to support the defendants' actions were intended to benefit itself or a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The court also said that the plaintiffs' allegation regarding unnecessary and excessive fee layers was insufficient to support a prudence claim because the plaintiffs did not allege the inclusion of investments with certain administrative and investment advisory fees led to higher fees overall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs specifically alleged Defendants retained imprudent fees to benefit themselves and their affiliates. Plaintiffs alleged \"Defendants consistently invested the assets of the Principal CITs in costly and underperforming index funds, vehicles, and share classes, and failed to timely remove those funds long after a reasonable investigation would have revealed the availability of lower cost, better performing options.\" [ECF No. 1 \u00b6 21]. Plaintiffs\n   alleged that \"for eleven of the thirteen investments held by the Principal CITs, Defendants failed to use the least expensive vehicle,\" which led to \"higher fees to Defendants and their affiliates, and lower returns for participants.\" Viewing the allegations as a whole, the Court finds Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the overall fees were higher. This is especially true in this case where sixty to seventy percent of the Principal CITs funds were invested in Principal Index Funds, which had fees five to fifteen percent higher than marketplace alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants also cite\n   <em>\n    Meiners v.

Defendants' remaining arguments tend to ask the Court to weigh the facts, a task that is not permitted when considering a motion to dismiss. Nor do Plaintiffs have to rebut the lawful reasons why Defendants chose to retain the assets of the Principal CITs in their proprietary investments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p594\">\n    588 F.3d at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, the Defendants' exemption does not excuse them from their obligation to act prudently in monitoring the underlying investments of the Principal CITs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Main v.

However, as discussed above, the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaint contain much more detail and specificity, and it appears from the allegations in the Complaint that Defendants failed completely to investigate cheaper alternatives, especially when some of the cheaper alternatives were different versions of Principal's own investment options. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a breach of the duties of loyalty and prudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    C. Loss Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants next argue Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts that show Defendants' breach caused a loss. Defendants argue Plaintiffs' loss was caused not by them but by the Retirement Plans' fiduciaries who entered into the participation agreements with Defendants. Defendants argue that by agreeing to the fee structure, the retirement plan fiduciaries thus caused the harm to Plaintiffs. However,\n   Defendants had a continuing duty to monitor the CITs investments and remove imprudent ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tibble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589314\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1823/#p1828\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs adequately alleged Defendants caused them harm by failing to obtain less costly investments, which would have resulted in higher returns for Plaintiffs. At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court is required to view the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, having done so the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    D. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Lastly, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim related to Defendants' initial\n   <em>\n    selection\n   </em>\n   of the Principal CITs' underlying investments is barred by the statute of limitations. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The relevant statute of limitations provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   No action may be commenced under this subchapter with respect to a fiduciary's breach of any responsibility, duty, or obligation under this part, or with respect to a violation of this part, after the earlier of--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (1) six years after (A) the date of the last action which constituted a part of the breach or violation, or (B) in the case of an omission the latest date on which the fiduciary could have cured the breach or violation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201113\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This lawsuit was filed on April 16, 2018.

Indeed, Plaintiffs' Complaint states it is proposing a class period beginning \"at any time on or after April 16, 2012.\" Since the initial selection of the Principal CITs' underlying investments occurred in 2009 that claim is time barred. However, as Plaintiffs point out, their claim that Defendants violated their fiduciary duties by failing to monitor and remove imprudent investments is not time barred.\n   <em>\n    Tibble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589314\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1823/#p1828\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A plaintiff may allege that a fiduciary breached the duty of prudence by failing to properly monitor investments and remove imprudent ones.

Therefore, Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants failed to monitor and remove imprudent investments is only barred to the extent Defendants may have breached that duty before April 16, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   IV.
