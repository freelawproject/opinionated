Because Plaintiff spent less than 30% of his employment with Nacher in the service of a vessel, he was not a Jones Act seaman.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to how many hours Lee spent working on vessels, the following facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff worked for Nacher for\n   a total of 387 hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon being hired, he underwent 16 hours of training on land on May 22, 2014 and May 23, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then worked on the Noble Drilling Rig, DANNY ADKINS, for 87 hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between July 7, 2015 and July 19, 2014, Plaintiff worked for 164 hours on the platform located in High Island Block 531-A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties dispute how many hours Plaintiff worked on the platform located in High Island Block 474. Based on work logs attached to the instant motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nacher states it is undisputed Plaintiff worked on the platform located in High Island Block 474 for 120 hours between June 20, 2014 and June 28, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff admits he worked on the platform located in High Island Block 474 for 84 hours, but states he spent 18 hours on a transport vessel en route to High Island Block 474 and 18 hours \"on and off\" the transport vessel, moving equipment from the transport vessel to the platform located in High Island Block 474.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, Plaintiff attaches the same work logs attached to Nacher's motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In summary, it is undisputed Plaintiff spent a total of 264 hours,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   or 68% of his 387-hour total employment with Nacher, working either on land or on a stationary platform. It is undisputed he spent 87 hours,\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   or 22% of his total employment with Nacher, working on a vessel. The dispute arises from Plaintiff's argument that the 18 hours, or 5% of the total, he spent being transported to a stationary platform, and the 18 hours, or the final 5%, he spent unloading a vessel at a stationary platform should be considered time spent working on a vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Plaintiff is correct, he would have spent 123 hours, or 32% of his total employment with Nacher, in service of a vessel, and Nacher would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law that he is not a seaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Time that platform workers spend on transport vessels going to and from a stationary platform is not considered time spent in service of a vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Munguia v. Chevron Co., U.S.A.\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held a platform worker who frequently used boats to travel to the platforms where he worked was not a seaman because \"[t]he various boats were merely a means of transportation. They constituted in effect a boat pool, a nautical motor pool, from which [the plaintiff] daily selected or was assigned a boat to enable him to transport himself and his equipment to the various places where his pumping, gauging, or other platform work was to be done.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lee spent 18 hours on a vessel being transported to the stationary platform located in High Island Block 474. As a matter of law, these hours, which constituted 5% of his total employment with Nacher, are not considered time spent in the service of the vessel for purposes of determining seaman status. The transport vessel was merely part of a nautical motor pool enabling Plaintiff to be transported to the platform where he was to work. Because Plaintiff's time being transported to the platform is not time spent in service of a vessel, these hours cannot be counted toward the required 30% of time spent in the service of a vessel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lee spent 18 hours \"on and off\" the transport vessel, moving equipment from the vessel to High Island Block 474.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Time spent performing work related to a stationary platform, even if technically on board a vessel, is not considered time spent in service of that vessel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hufnagel v. Omega Serv. Ind., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff repaired offshore oil and gas platforms and sometimes ate or slept on vessels that served as floating \"hotels.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5th Cir. 1999). The Fifth Circuit held he was not a Jones Act seaman because his \"duties involved platform work, and were not related to the navigation, maintenance, or voyage of the [vessel, and his] sole purpose for being present on the platform or the [vessel] related to the repair of the platform.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hufnagel\n   </em>\n   , Lee's sole purpose for being present on the vessel related to his work on the stationary platform. As a matter of law, these 18 hours, which constituted 5% of his total employment with Nacher, are not considered time spent in the service of the vessel for purposes of determining seaman status. As a result, Plaintiff cannot show he spent 30% of his total employment with Nacher working on a vessel for purposes of establishing seaman status. Because Plaintiff spent less than thirty percent of his time in the service of a vessel, \"the facts and the law will reasonably support only one conclusion,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Plaintiff was\n   not a Jones Act seaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
