D.E. 137. The Court has reviewed the Motion, the pertinent portions of the record and is otherwise fully advised of the premises. For the reasons discussed below, the Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs are Illinois corporations engaged in the business of offering and issuing automobile insurance policies in Florida to provide personal injury protection (\"PIP\") and/or medical payments coverage (\"MPC\") under Florida's Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law. Defendants, Felix Filenger (\"Filenger\"), Andrew Rubinshteyn (\"Rubinshteyn\"), Linda D. Varisco (\"Varisco\"), Olga Spivak (\"Spivak\") and David Greydinger (\"Greydinger\"), are chiropractors that provided medical services at-and had ownership over and control over various medical clinics in Florida, as described\n   <em>\n    Infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their complaint with this Court on May 10, 2017, asserting that between November 2009 and May 2017, the Defendants, acting in their capacity as owners and employees of the Defendant Clinics, provided medical services to individuals involved in automobile accidents, who were insured under Plaintiffs' PIP or MPC policies, thereby receiving more than $ 1.8 million in payments from Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs allege claims for: (1) unjust enrichment against all Defendants (Count II): and (2) declaratory judgment against the Defendant Clinics (Count II). D.E. 1. Before Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, Greydinger had been indicted and pleaded guilty to one count of Preparing and Presenting False and Fraudulent Insurance Claims of less than $ 20,000.00. D.E. 1 \u00b6 22. After Plaintiffs filed their complaint, Varisco, Filenger, Rubinshteyn, Spivak and Greydinger, were indicted by the United States Government on charges including, racketeering, wire fraud, and presenting false and fraudulent insurance claims. D.E. 1; D.E. 68; D.E. 69; D.E. 75. Accordingly, on November 20, 2017, the Court stayed the proceedings until the criminal prosecutions as participation in discovery could implicate the Defendants' Fifth Amendment rights. D.E. 88. The Court ordered the parties to file a status report every sixty days advising the Court as to the status of the prosecutions. On July 11, 2018, the parties filed their Fourth Joint Status Report, explaining that the pending criminal prosecutions had concluded and the Court reopened the case. D.E. 93. The Court then held a status conference on August 10, 2018, requiring certain Defendants to appear for deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court subsequently entered an amended Scheduling Order for Pretrial Conference and Trial, D.E. 103, setting a Motion deadline of November 16, 2018. D.E. 103. On October 23, 2018, the Court entered final default judgment against Defendants: Olga Spivak, D.C., Accumed Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc., and Medwell Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc. D.E. 124. As to the remaining Defendants, Plaintiff moved for final default judgment as to Advance Medical Associates and Hollywood Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc., on November 16, 2018, D.E. 137, and on the same date Plaintiff moved for summary judgment as to Defendants Filenger, Rubinshteyn, Varisco, Greydinger, and Total Rehabilitation &amp; Wellness Center (\"Total\"). As such, the remaining Defendants were required to respond by November 30, 2018, but as of the date of this Order, no response to either\n   Motion has been filed with the Court. Defendants Greydinger and Total do not oppose this Motion for Summary Judgment against them. D.E. 136 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court cannot grant summary judgment solely by virtue of a party's default.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, the Court may take the moving party's statement of material facts as admitted pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(b):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Effect of Failure to Controvert Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n   </strong>\n   All material facts set forth in the movant's statement filed and supported as required above will be deemed admitted unless controverted by the opposing party's statement, provided that the Court finds that the movant's statement is supported by evidence in the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Local Rule 56.1(b). Accordingly, as Plaintiffs' statement of material facts is supported by facts in the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.E. 135, and as Defendants have not responded to the Motion or the statement of material facts, the Court deems Plaintiffs' statement of material facts as admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9271924\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/363/1099/#p1101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the facts are uncontroverted the Court does not recite them in full here, but a brief summary of the facts, as taken from Plaintiffs' statement of material facts, D.E. 135, is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Defendant Clinics\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs are Illinois corporations engaged in the business of offering and issuing automobile insurance policies in Florida to provide personal injury protection (\"PIP\") and/or medical payments coverage (\"MPC\") under Florida's Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Advance Medical Associates and Forme Rehab, Inc. (\"Advance\"), and Defendant Hollywood Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc. (\"Hollywood\"), were Florida corporations that operated as unlawful health care clinics providing medical services to State Farm Mutual and State Farm Fire Insureds involved in automobile accidents. Defendant Varisco was the sole President and Vice President of both Advance and Hollywood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant Medwell Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc. (\"Medwell\") was a Florida corporation that also unlawfully provided medical services to State Farm Mutual and State Farm Fire Insureds involved in automobile accidents. The true owners and operators of Medwell were Filenger and Rubinshteyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Accumed Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, Inc. (\"Accumed\") was a Florida corporation Accumed that also unlawfully provided medical services to State Farm Mutual and State Farm Fire Insureds involved in automobile accidents. Accumed's true owners were Filenger and Rubinshteyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Total Rehabilitation &amp; Wellness Center, P.A. (\"Total\") was a Florida corporation that also unlawfully providing medical services to State Farm Mutual and State Farm Fire Insureds at the same location as Accumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Defendant Chiropractors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant Varisco was a licensed Florida chiropractic physician and resident of Broward County, Florida. At times material, Varisco falsely purported to wholly own Advance and Hollywood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant Spivak, at all times material, was a licensed Florida chiropractic physician and resident of Broward County, Florida. Spivak falsely purported to wholly own Medwell and Accumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant David Greydinger, D.C. (\"Greydinger\") is a resident of Lee County, Florida. Greydinger's chiropractic license was permanently revoked in September 2014, following a plea of guilty to one count of Preparing and Presenting False and Fraudulent Insurance Claims of less than $ 20,000.00. Greydinger falsely purported to be Total's sole owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At times material, Defendants Filenger and Rubinshteyn resided in Miami Dade County, Florida. Filenger and Rubinshteyn maintained an ownership interest, in whole or in part, in all the Defendant clinics. Filenger is a lay person that has never held a medical license of any kind in the State of Florida. Rubinshteyn is licensed in the State of Florida as an occupational therapist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The HCAA and Clinic Ownership\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Florida Health Care Clinic Act (\"HCAA\") requires that health clinics be licensed under the HCAA unless the clinic is \"wholly owned\" by a licensed healthcare practitioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20400.9905\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 400.9905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(g), 400.991. Thus, in order for Filenger and Rubinshteyn, as unlicensed healthcare practitioners, to have an ownership interest in the Defendant Clinics, the Defendant Clinics had to be licensed pursuant the HCAA, but the Defendant Clinics were not licensed pursuant to the HCAA. Instead, the Defendant Chiropractors concealed Filenger's and Rubinshteyn's ownership interest by representing to the State of Florida that the Defendant Chiropractors \"wholly owned\" the Defendant Clinics as licensed healthcare practitioners. If a clinic is not licensed under the HCAA and is not exempt under the \"wholly owned\" exemption, the clinics' services are unlawful and are not compensable under Florida law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Scheme\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Defendants unlawfully provided medical services to patients insured by Plaintiffs who were involved in automobile accidents and submitted bills for PIP benefits to Plaintiffs, for which payments were made under the mistaken belief that the Defendant clinics were lawfully operating as \"wholly owned\" clinics. Defendants also obtained payment from Plaintiffs for services that were not lawfully provided because: (a) Defendant clinics were not licensed as required by Florida law; (b) Defendant clinics did not qualify for the \"wholly owned\" exemption from Florida's mandatory clinic licensure laws because Filenger and/or Rubinshteyn were the true owner(s), in whole or in part, and/or controlled the operations of Defendant clinics; and (c) Defendants participated in a scheme to intentionally circumvent Florida's mandatory clinic licensing laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Prosecution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 26, 2017, Varisco pled guilty to the offense of Conspiracy to Commit Mail Fraud, Wire Fraud, Health Care Fraud, and Making False Statements in Connection with Obtaining Health Care Benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 371. In the Stipulated Statements of Fact filed in support of the guilty plea, Varisco admits her role in the fraud scheme as a \"nominee\" owner of Defendant clinics Advance and Hollywood. Varisco was sentenced on March 5, 2018 to 366 days in prison, plus 3 years of supervised release with special conditions imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On December 18, 2017, Filenger pled guilty to the offense of RICO Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C., Section 1962. In the Stipulated Statements of Fact filed in support of the guilty plea, Filenger admits, among other things, his true ownership\n   interest in Defendant chiropractic clinics and his unlawful use of chiropractors claiming to be the sole owners of his chiropractic clinics in order to obtain an exemption from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Filenger was sentenced to 78 months in prison plus 3 years supervised release with special conditions imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On or about December 20, 2017, Rubinshteyn pled guilty to the offense of RICO Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1962. In the Stipulated Statements of Fact filed in support of the guilty plea, Rubinshteyn admits, among other things, his true ownership interest in Defendant chiropractic clinics and his unlawful use of chiropractors claiming to be the sole owners of his chiropractic clinics in order to obtain an exemption from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Rubinshteyn was sentenced to 72 months in prison plus 3 years supervised release with special conditions imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 8, 2018, Spivak pled guilty to the offense of Conspiracy to Commit Racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1962. In the Stipulated Statements of Fact filed in support of the guilty plea, Spivak admits, among other things, her role in the fraud as a \"nominee\" owner of Medwell. Spivak was sentenced to 30 months in prison plus 2 years supervised release with special conditions imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Interrogatories &amp; Fifth Amendment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant Filenger failed to provide answers to Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories and failed to provide documents to Plaintiff's First Request for Production and instead, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. Among many interrogatories, Filenger failed to answer whether he was \"at any time employed or retained by any of the Clinics, his duties, his compensation or any details of his involvement in the Clinics.\" Moreover, he failed to respond to a question requesting that he explain in detail his role as owner of the Clinics along with identifying his responsibilities, tasks and obligations. Again, he instead asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant Rubinshteyn also failed to provide answers to Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories and/or documents to Plaintiff's First Request for Production, other than to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. In identical fashion to Filenger, Rubinshteyn failed to answer whether he was \"at any time employed or retained by any of the Clinics, his duties, his compensation or any details of his involvement in the Clinics.\" Moreover, exactly as Filenger, he failed to respond to a question requesting that he explain in detail his \"role as owner of the Clinics\" along with identifying his responsibilities, duties, tasks and obligations. Again, instead of responding, he asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant Greydinger failed to provide answers to Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories and failed to provide any responsive documents to Plaintiff's First Request for Production. Instead, Greydinger invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. When asked to state the name of every business/corporation/entity, other than Total where he owned and/or held an ownership interest or was employed, Greydinger chose to assert his \"Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\" Moreover, Defendant Greydinger was deposed on September 4, 2018, and declined to answer all substantive questions by asserting his Fifth Amendment constitutional privilege. Furthermore, Greydinger did not appear with any of the requested documents listed on the Notice of Taking Deposition\n   <em>\n    duces tecum.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Similarly, Defendant Total provided Plaintiffs with Answers to Interrogatories that omit the name of the person answering\n   Interrogatories on its behalf (without any verification) and stated the same response to each question: \"I am invoking my Fifth Amendment rights,\" and similarly provided a Response to Request for Production stating, \"I am invoking my constitutional Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant, Varisco, in her Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint also invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to most allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Summary judgment is authorized only when the moving party meets its burden of demonstrating that \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

D.E. 136. Accordingly, the Court will first consider Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim and their claim for declaratory judgment before turning to the effect of Defendants' invocation of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Unjust Enrichment &amp; Declaratory Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To make out a claim for unjust enrichment under Florida law, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he or she conferred a benefit on defendants; (2) the defendants have knowledge of the benefit; (3) defendants voluntarily accepted and retained the benefit conferred; and (4) the circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for the defendants to retain the benefit without paying the value thereof to the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Golden v.

Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on their unjust enrichment claim because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) Plaintiffs unknowingly conferred benefits on Defendants by making payments to the clinics pursuant to improper claims for benefits for its insureds; (2) Defendants voluntarily accepted and retained those benefits from Plaintiffs despite their knowledge that the services purportedly rendered by them were not \"lawfully provided\" as required by Florida law; and (3) Defendants' retention of those benefits was wrongful and in violation of Florida law, which, as a result, harmed Plaintiffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   D.E. 136 at 15. The Court agrees. The undisputed statement of material facts, Plaintiffs' affidavit, and the attached business records indicate that Defendants submitted thousands of dollars of bills to Plaintiffs for unlawfully rendered medical services, Defendants received payments for these services in the amount of $ 1,880,485 despite not being appropriately licensed under the Health Care Clinic Act, and all Defendants except Greydinger were criminally indicted and eventually convicted for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , attempting to circumvent the HCAA by falsely purporting to \"wholly-own\" the clinics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 135 at 8-10; D.E. 136-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit has twice dealt with similar circumstances and twice held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [u]nder Florida law [an insurer] [is] entitled to seek a judicial remedy to recover the amounts it paid [to a clinic operating in violation of the Clinic Act] and to obtain a declaratory judgment that it is not required to pay [the clinic] the amount of the outstanding bills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Defendants have provided neither evidence nor argumentation to refute Plaintiffs' allegations and record evidence and thus, the Court finds that summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs is appropriate on their unjust enrichment claim. Moreover, as Courts in this district routinely hold, \"it is widely accepted that a defendant is not required to individually receive payments in order for a cause of action for unjust enrichment to exist.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

As explained by the Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Basically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Maryland Casualty Co. v.
