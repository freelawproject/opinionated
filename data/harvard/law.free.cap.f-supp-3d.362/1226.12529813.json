Plaintiff filed a Response in Opposition (Doc. # 51) on September 4, 2018. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of a contractual dispute between two former business partners in the golf merchandise industry. The issue raised is whether the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the out-of-state defendant. The Court concludes that it may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint (Doc. # 46): In 2011, Plaintiff RG Golf Warehouse, Inc. (Plaintiff) and The Golf Warehouse, Inc. (Defendant) considered entering into a business relationship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(a).) On January 27, 2011, Plaintiff's chief executive officer, Brad Wolansky, and Defendant's president, Ronald Ploog, met in Orlando, Florida to \"discuss the parties' prospective business relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(a)(i).) A few weeks later, on February 21, 2011, Plaintiff and Defendant executed a letter of intent to enter into a business relationship; Plaintiff and Defendant executed the final contract (the Referral Agreement) on March 10, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the parties entered into the Referral Agreement, Plaintiff was a Minnesota corporation with \"home offices in Minnesota and Lee County, Florida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(i).) On June 17, 2013, after Defendant was purchased by a Minnesota entity, Defendant instructed Plaintiff to move its \"business out of Minnesota within the next 13 days\" in order to avoid \"an intrastate tax nexus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(ii).) Defendant informed Plaintiff that if it failed to comply with that request, Defendant would consider terminating the Referral Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(ii)-(iii).) Plaintiff complied with Defendant's request and on June 21, 2013 reincorporated in South Dakota and moved its principal place of business to Lee County, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(v).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the remainder of June 2013 through November 2014, Plaintiff \"performed the [Referral Agreement] with its principal place of business in Lee County, Florida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(viii).) During that time, Defendants used \"Plaintiff's Florida address for all monthly sales data, payment reports, and remittances to Plaintiff, with payments made to Plaintiff's Wells Fargo Bank account with a Florida address.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(c)(i).) On November 12, 2014, Defendant terminated the Referral Agreement by written correspondence sent to \"Plaintiff's address in Lee County, Florida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b)(x).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Defendant terminated the Referral Agreement, Defendant filed an alleged \"bad-faith trademark registration\" so that it could tortiously interfere with a contract between Plaintiff and Golfsmith International (Golfsmith). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(f).) Defendant allegedly used the trademark registration as the basis of \"a misleading and improper cease-and-desist letter\" it sent to Golfsmith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(f)(iv).) That cease-and-desist letter ultimately caused Golfsmith to terminate its contract with Plaintiff because Golfsmith wanted to avoid \"the prospect of expensive trademark litigation\" with Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(f)(iv).)

And although Defendant operates an interactive website that is accessed daily by potential and actual Florida customers, the Court finds that only amounts to doing business \"as\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   in Florida,\" which is \"insufficient under the plain text of the [long-arm] statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938229\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/1162/#p1167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8938229\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/1162/#p1167\">\n    at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Plaintiff's Relocation of its Principal Place of Business to Florida\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant because it caused Plaintiff to relocate its principal place of business to Florida. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, because Defendant knew Plaintiff \"had\n   some connection to Florida\" and had no connection to any other state, Defendant caused the Florida relocation when it directed Plaintiff to move its business out of Minnesota. (Doc. # 51, p. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds this conduct insufficient to support specific jurisdiction over Defendant. First, the Court is aware of no authority - and Plaintiff cites to none - establishing that such conduct satisfies Florida's long-arm statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Defendant did in fact cause Plaintiff's move to Florida. Indeed, as Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint, \"Plaintiff did not have an\n   <em>\n    official\n   </em>\n   tie to Florida\" prior to Defendant's request. (Doc. # 46, \u00b6 (7)(b)(vii) (emphasis in original.) Because Plaintiff had no official tie to Florida, and since Defendant did not specifically request that Plaintiff relocate to Florida, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that Defendant caused Plaintiff's relocation to Florida. Accordingly, Plaintiff's relocation of its principal place of business to Florida is insufficient to confer specific jurisdiction over Defendant under Florida's long-arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    2) Section 48.193(1)(a)(2) - Committing a Tortious Act in Florida\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff argues the Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant pursuant to Section (1)(a)(2) of Florida's long-arm statute because the alleged tortious interference occurred in Florida. In relevant part, Section (1)(a)(2) provides that a party may be subject to specific jurisdiction for \"[c]ommitting a tortious act within [Florida].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Amended Complaint asserts that the alleged tortious interference occurred in Florida because when Defendant sent the \"misleading and improper cease-and-desist letter\" to Golfsmith, the resulting financial harm to Plaintiff (Golfsmith's termination of its contract with Plaintiff) occurred in Florida. (Doc. # 46, \u00b6 7(f)(iv).) In response, Defendant contends the alleged tortious interference did not occur in Florida because the cease-and-desist letter was sent by Defendant's counsel in Minnesota to Golfsmith's office in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Florida's appellate courts \"are deeply divided on the issue of whether a tortious act committed outside the state resulting in injury inside the state subjects the actor to jurisdiction in Florida under\" Section (1)(a)(2) of Florida's long-arm statute.\n   <em>\n    Posner\n   </em>\n   , 178 F.3d at 1216.

Thus, because specific jurisdiction is authorized under Section (1)(a)(2) of Florida's long-arm statute, the Court will address whether exercising such jurisdiction over Defendant comports with due process\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    3) Section 48.193(1)(a)(7) - Breach of a Contract Requiring Acts to be Performed in Florida\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court may exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant because Defendant failed to make payments owed to Plaintiff under the Referral Agreement. Plaintiff asserts that after it relocated its principal place of business to Florida, Defendant used Plaintiff's Florida \"address for all monthly sales data, payment reports, and remittances to Plaintiff\" and made payments \"to Plaintiff's Wells Fargo Bank account with a Florida address.\" (Doc. # 46, \u00b6 (7)(c)(i).) Plaintiff thus reasons that, pursuant to Section 48.193(1)(a)(7), specific jurisdiction over Defendant is authorized under Florida's long-arm statute because Defendant failed to continue making payments to Plaintiff's Florida bank account under the Referral Agreement. In Response, Defendant argues that (1) Defendant's mere failure to make payments in Florida is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction under Florida's long-arm statute; and (2) after Plaintiff's relocation to Florida, Defendant continued to make payments into Plaintiff's Minnesota bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Section (1)(a)(7) of Florida's long-arm statute provides that a party may be subject to specific jurisdiction for \"[b]reaching a contract in [Florida] by failing to perform acts required by the contract to be performed in [Florida].\" Failure to make payments owed under a contract \"where payment is due to be made in Florida is sufficient to satisfy\" Section (1)(a)(7) of Florida's long-arm statute.\n   <em>\n    Glob.

(Doc. # 6-1, \u00b6 11.) In that email, which is attached as an exhibit to Hamrick's affidavit, Plaintiff's representative directed Defendant to send the wire transfers to \"Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
