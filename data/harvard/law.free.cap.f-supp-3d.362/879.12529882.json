BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, the United States Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\"), the United States Department of Agriculture, and the United States Forest Service amended land use plans for federal lands in eleven western states (including Idaho) to protect the Greater Sage Grouse, its habitat, and to prevent it from being listed as an endangered species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Tugaw Ranches, LLC, is a cattle ranching operation based in Oakley, Idaho. Tugaw Ranches operates on private and public lands, including on BLM and Forest Service grazing allotments affected by the amended rules. In its Complaint, Tugaw Ranches alleges that the BLM and the Forest Service violated the Congressional Review Act (\"CRA\") because they failed to submit the land use plan amendments to Congress for review as required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion, asserting that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this claim because the CRA prohibits\n   judicial review of claimed omissions in violation of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) challenges the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. A lack of jurisdiction is presumed unless the party asserting jurisdiction establishes that it exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1996, Congress enacted the Congressional Review Act (\"CRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 808. The CRA added a new chapter to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") that establishes the mechanisms and procedures by which Congress may review and overturn agency rules. Broadly speaking, the CRA sought to restore a measure of accountability in that before an agency rule can take effect, it (the agency) must submit a report to both houses of Congress and the Comptroller General containing a copy of the rule, a concise general statement relating to the rule, and the proposed effective date of the rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 801(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once the agency submits a proposed rule, Congress has a set timeframe in which it can review the rule and, if desired, pass a joint resolution voiding the rule.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If both houses of Congress pass such a resolution, it goes to the President for his signature or veto.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

Because the statutory language is not clear, the Court must look to other sources to determine the meaning, intent, and application of \u00a7 805.

Claiming that the omission here is their failure to submit the proposed changes to Congress, Defendants claim that judicial review is unavailable. Defendants point to an early case discussing the breadth of \u00a7 805, and one Court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   determination that \"the statute provides for no judicial review of any 'determination, finding, action, or omission\n   <em>\n    under this chapter\n   </em>\n   ,' not '\n   <em>\n    by Congress under this chapter.\n   </em>\n   ' The Court must follow the plain English.\"\n   <em>\n    Tex.

This case, like all the others cited by the parties, is not exactly on point. Defendants' cited language here comes from a footnote in an out of District and out of Circuit case in which the party argued that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the actions of Congress were not reviewable. That Court determined that \u00a7 805 was not so restrictive that it only included Congressional action. Importantly, however, there is no mention in that decision of how far the provision of non-review applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To further its argument, Defendants point back to the APA and its explanation that Congress is not an agency, by definition, that its decisions are not subject to review (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and to a Supreme Court case (\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n    505 U.S. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481206\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/788/\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ) in which the Court held that the President's actions are also not subject to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because both Congress' and the President's actions under the APA and CRA are explicitly exempt from review, Defendants assert that the only plausible reading of \u00a7 805 is that the agencies themselves are not subject to judicial review-otherwise that section would be meaningless because the other actors in the CRA are already immune.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For its part, Tugaw Ranches contends that the fact that \u00a7 805 does not mention agencies cuts against the idea that they are exempt. In its estimation, only those entities that are listed, or otherwise referenced, in the CRA fall under the exemption. Because the President and Congress are listed in the CRA-and have been granted immunity elsewhere-Tugaw Ranches agrees that they are exempt, but in like manner, it contends that actions by the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\") and the Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") are also non-reviewable as they too are listed in the CRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court is not convinced that this matter is as clear as either side asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The simple absence of something does not mean that the opposite is true. The\n   omission of detail in \u00a7 805 does not mean that the Court should-as Defendants' suggest-limit non-reviewability to \"agency\" action because other relevant parties are listed elsewhere as exempt from judicial review. Nor should the Court, however-as Tugaw Ranches suggests-try to find a complete list of those who are exempt as there are numerous other groups and individuals listed in the CRA that Tugaw Ranches has failed to identify, including the Comptroller General and-at issue here-Federal Agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Simply put, \u00a7 805 is not clear and unambiguous. There is no way (by simply looking at the statute itself) for the Court to determine exactly whose actions are subject to judicial review and whose are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court understands the idea promulgated by the Eastern District of Texas that the plain language of \u00a7 805 goes to the CRA as a whole (and thus there is no review of anyone's actions-including agencies); but is concerned with the actual result of such a finding, and the fact that such a finding might conflict with other provisions within the CRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For example, the CRA provides that, if Congress and the President enact a resolution disapproving a particular rule, the agency is barred from adopting the same or any \"substantially similar\" rule.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20801\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Congress does not itself enforce this provision, as it can disapprove any rule submitted to it regardless of whether it is the same or substantially similar to a prior disapproved rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, this provision can only operate if courts enforce it against recalcitrant agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Michael J.

Defendants outright reject this idea and repeatedly state that \"congress has numerous options for policing agency compliance without judicial review.\" Dkt. 26, at 5. But what about third parties? Congress might be able to compel compliance, but what is Tugaw Ranches to do? If Defendants submitted their plans to Congress and Congress and/or the President subsequently approved or rejected said plans, that would be the end of it. But if the agency never submits its plans-\n   <em>\n    as required-\n   </em>\n   the Court is troubled with Defendants' position that essentially any rule or law can go into effect without oversight or approval and there is no legal remedy available for an affected third party.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Paul J. Larkin, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Reawakening the Congressional Review Act\n   </em>\n   , 41 HARV. J.L. &amp; PUB.

They need the courts to protect them against what Congress and the President have dealt them\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Presumably, Congress could have written this statute to include-or exclude- certain individuals, organizations, or groups. And while it appears relatively clear that the actions of the President and Congress are not subject to review under the CRA, there is nothing to indicate if Courts should give that same level of deference to agencies. Considering this ambiguity, the Court must continue its inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court next turns to other Courts and any relevant findings concerning \u00a7 805 -specifically whether any have found the language of \u00a7 805 is \"clear and unambiguous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the outset the Court notes that the following cases are only persuasive; not only by definition-as none are from courts within this District or Circuit-but also in substance-as many are factually distinguishable or lack significant analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants rely heavily on the D.C.

Nevertheless, the Court does find the following discussion insightful:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   As this Court reads\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20805\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (\"No determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter shall be subject to judicial review\"), it is susceptible to two plausible meanings: (1) as\n   <em>\n    Texas Savings\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    American Electric\n   </em>\n   concluded, Congress did not intend for\n   courts to have any judicial review of an agency's compliance with the CRA; or (2) Congress only intended to preclude judicial review of Congress' own determinations, findings, actions, or omissions made under the CRA after a rule has been submitted to it for review. Under the first interpretation, which\n   <em>\n    Texas Savings\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    American Electric\n   </em>\n   adopted, agencies could evade the strictures of the CRA by simply not reporting new rules, and courts would be barred from reviewing their lack of compliance. This result would be at odds with the purpose of the CRA, which was to provide a check on administrative agencies' power to set policies and essentially legislate without Congressional oversight. The CRA has no enforcement mechanism, and to read it to preclude a court from reviewing whether an agency rule is in effect that should have been reported would render the statute ineffectual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, the language of the statute precludes judicial review of a \"determination, finding, action, or omission under this chapter ...\" Agencies do not make findings and determinations under this chapter; Congress, on the other hand, is required to make a number of findings and determinations under the CRA. Therefore, it is logical to interpret the judicial preclusion language as barring review of the determinations, findings, actions, or omissions made by Congress after a rule is submitted by an agency, but not extending the bar of judicial scrutiny to questions of whether or not an agency rule is in effect that should have been reported to Congress in the first place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20805\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20805\">\n    at *5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted, the CRA does not define much of the language used in \u00a7 805, but the Court agrees that certain terms (such as findings, determinations etc.) appear to be geared towards Congressional duties under the act rather than agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court believes it has identified every case that discusses \u00a7 805 in any fashion and, unfortunately, clarity is not to be found. While the weight of the cases\n   <em>\n    seems\n   </em>\n   to be in favor of non-reviewability, this idea comes from a mere two Circuits\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a handful of District Courts\n   <em>\n    none of which are binding on this Court.\n   </em>\n   Conversely, there is at least one Circuit\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a handful of other districts that appear to have found some measure of judicial review available under the CRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In short, this matter is far from settled law, \u00a7 805 is not clear and unambiguous as required, and in light of this ambiguity, the Court must continue its inquiry by looking at the legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   B.

Reading judicial review out of the CRA foils its primary purpose. Congress enacted the APA and CRA to act as a check and balance on agency action. Reading the statute in such a way as to foreclose that option-even more specifically: to foreclose that option just for the agencies-arbitrarily gives said agencies more power than originally intended. An agency may only act within the bounds of its statutory authority and the Court is uncomfortable allowing an agency a \"pass\" when it elects-for whatever reason-to not submit rule changes to Congress as required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paul J. Larkin, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    The Trump Administration and the Congressional Review Act\n   </em>\n   , 16 GEO. J.L. &amp; PUB. POL'Y 505, 518 (2018) (noting that without judicial review \"an agency would be able to violate the CRA with impunity by declining to submit a rule to Congress. That would make nonsense of the statute. It also would violate the Constitution by authorizing government agencies to act in a lawless manner.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, were the Court to accept Defendants position, it would leave Tugaw Ranches without remedy-and any accountability in the CRA would be null and void. The strong presumption of judicial review absent clear direction otherwise is persuasive to the Court. In the absence of a clear and unambiguous agency exception in \u00a7 805, the Court cannot accept a result that ultimately defeats the purpose of the act itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The language of \u00a7 805 is not clear and unambiguous. Although at first blush \u00a7 805 appears to be a blanket prohibition on all judicial review of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   actions taken by anyone under the CRA, such un-checked authority does not make sense, defeats the general purpose of the act, is contradicted by the legislative history, and ultimately leaves third parties without any remedy at law against violations of the act itself. Furthermore, what scant caselaw is available on the matter is conflicting, shallow in reasoning and analysis, and only persuasive in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As noted, \u00a7 805 simply states that \"[n]o determination, finding, action, or omission under [the CRA] shall be subject to judicial review,\" yet fails to describe whose determination, finding, action, or omission is prohibited from judicial review. One could interpret this as applying to all parties acting under the CRA (i.e., promulgating agencies, Congress, OMB, GAO, and the President), or one could interpret this solely as precluding judicial review of only certain groups' actions under the CRA (the President and Congress for example).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Upon review, the Court finds that \u00a7 805 does not clearly prohibit judicial review of agency action under the CRA and that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

This is precisely why the judicial branch exists. Congress, the President, and an agency could go round after round on an issue-and arguably have some modicum of enforcement through pressure, politics, rules, funding, or some other function-but ultimately, it is the Court that must determine if there has been statutory compliance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Such is the case in\n    <em>\n     Texas Sav. &amp; Cmty.
