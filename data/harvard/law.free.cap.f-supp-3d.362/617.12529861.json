BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Arkansas Times challenges the constitutionality of Act 710, a state statute requiring that companies doing business with state entities certify that they are not boycotting Israel. The relevant facts are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Act 710 prohibits state entities from entering into contracts with companies for goods or services unless those companies certify in writing that they are not currently engaged in, nor will they engage in for the duration of their contract, a \"boycott of Israel.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-1-503\">\n    Ark.

It defines a \"boycott of Israel\" to mean:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [E]ngaging in refusals to deal, terminating business activities, or other actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with Israel, or persons or entities doing business in Israel or in Israeli-controlled territories, in a discriminatory manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2025-1-503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-1-502(1)(A)(i).

Dozens of states have passed similar statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. Opp. Pl. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 2 n.1, Doc. No. 14. There is a somewhat similar federal law authorizing the \"President [to] issue regulations prohibiting any United States person ... from ... support[ing] any boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a [friendly] country.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204607\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 4607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (1979) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Anti-Boycott Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-232, \u00a7\u00a7 1771-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Arkansas Times is a weekly newspaper in Arkansas. Its publisher and chief executive officer is Alan Leveritt. For many years, the Times has contracted with Pulaski Technical College, now the University of Arkansas-Pulaski Technical College (\"Pulaski Tech\"), to publish advertisements for the college. In 2016, the Times entered into twenty-two advertising contracts with Pulaski Tech for amounts over $ 1,000; in 2017, it entered into thirty-six such contracts. In 2018, the Times entered into twenty-five such contracts before October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In October 2018, the Arkansas Times and Pulaski Tech were preparing to enter into a new advertising contract. Pulaski Tech, consistent with Act 710's certification requirements, informed Leveritt that he would have to certify that the Times is not currently engaging in, nor would for the duration of the contract engage in, a boycott of Israel. Leveritt declined to do so, citing the Times's First Amendment rights. Specifically, the Times takes the position that it should not have to choose between doing business with the state and its right to freedom of expression. Leveritt also asserts that while he was not afforded an opportunity to decline certification and to offer a twenty percent reduction in price, such a discount is unacceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Times has previously complied with the law's certification provision on dozens of occasions, as it entered into many advertising contracts with Pulaski Tech after Act 710 went into effect. Further, while the paper's editorial board has been critical of Act 710, it appears that the Times has never engaged in, nor ever written in support of, a boycott of Israel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lindsey Millar,\n   <em>\n    Arkansas Times challenges law that requires state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel in federal court\n   </em>\n   , Arkansas Times: Arkansas Blog (Dec. 11, 2018) (\"The Times has never participated in a boycott of Israel or editorialized in support of one.\"). Nothing indicates the Times will engage in such a boycott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because of the Times's refusal to certify, the parties did not execute a contract in October 2018, and there are no existing contracts between them. It is also very unlikely that there will be any future advertising contracts between the Times and Pulaski Tech because of this certification requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Arkansas Times brings this lawsuit asserting that Act 710 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It seeks a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the law's certification provision while this suit is pending. Defendants oppose the motion and have moved to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Arkansas Times presents two arguments challenging the constitutionality of Act 710's certification requirement. First, it asserts that the law impermissibly compels speech regarding contractors' political beliefs, association, and expression. Second, it asserts that the law impermissibly restricts state contractors from engaging in protected First Amendment activities, including boycott participation and boycott-related speech, without a legitimate justification. Defendants dispute both of these arguments and assert that the Times lacks standing to bring its boycott-restriction claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the Times has standing to bring both of its claims, a preliminary injunction is denied because the Arkansas Times has failed to show that a boycott of Israel, as defined by Act 710, is protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Arkansas Times has standing to bring its boycott-restriction claim because it suffered an injury in fact when it lost a government contract after refusing to comply with Act 710's certification provision. It does not have to allege that it intends to boycott Israel or that it would have boycotted Israel but for Act 710.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal courts may hear only \"cases\" and \"controversies.\" U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl.1. \"[T]here is no case or controversy unless the party initiating the [lawsuit] has standing to sue.\"\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass'n, Inc. v.

It may even call upon others to boycott Israel, write in support of such boycotts, and engage in picketing and pamphleteering to that effect.

MOTION TO DISMISS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because engaging in a boycott of Israel, as defined by Act 710, is neither speech nor inherently expressive conduct, it is not protected by the First Amendment. Accordingly, the Arkansas Times has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ;\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Arkansas Times's motion for a preliminary injunction [Doc. No. 2] is denied, and defendants' motion to dismiss [Doc. No. 15] is granted. Defendants' motion for leave to file a reply brief [Doc. No. 22] is denied as moot. This case is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 23rd day of January 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
