BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Interactions between Plaintiff and Jane Roe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As students at the University, Plaintiff became friends with a woman, referred to in this case under the pseudonym Jane Roe. ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 51. The two had a relationship over a year-and-a-half where they would often kiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. During this time, two instances occurred that lead Roe to file a report with the Boulder Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54, 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The first was in the spring of 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Plaintiff and Roe were drinking and, when alone, Plaintiff playfully pinned Roe's arms over her head and moved his hand down Roe's body towards her genitals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roe said \"no\" and Plaintiff stopped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The two continued their friendship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second incident was in July 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54. Plaintiff and Roe engaged in sexual intercourse, which Plaintiff states he \"stopped because he felt guilty about cheating on his girlfriend at the time, who was also [Roe's] close friend.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, Roe stated that she did not remember the encounter, which surprised Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The two did not speak until January 2016 when Roe accused Plaintiff of rape regarding the July 2015 encounter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Days after, Roe filed the report with the Boulder Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Criminal and University Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The University's Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (\"OIEC\") discovered Plaintiff's allegations made to the Boulder Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58. OIEC assigned Lauren Hasselbacher and Tessa Walker (the \"Investigators\") to investigate Roe's allegations against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60. The Investigators were charged with determining whether Plaintiff, by touching Roe's genitals without her consent in the incident in the spring of 2014, violated the terms of 2013-14 Student Conduct Code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61, 68. That code instituted a \"preponderance of information\" standard regarding the evaluation of complaints that a student violated its terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. Additionally, the Investigators were tasked with determining whether Plaintiff violated OIEC's Sexual Misconduct Policy concerning the alleged sexual assault in July 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 27, 2016, the Investigators observed the Boulder Police Department's interview with Roe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65. The Investigators did not observe the Boulder Police Department's January 28 interview with Plaintiff, but viewed a recording of the interview on March 24.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66, 84. The same day as Plaintiff's interview, OIEC sent Plaintiff a notice of investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. The notice of investigation read that if Plaintiff did not respond as directed, OIEC was authorized to make conclusions without his participation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. The notice of investigation gave Plaintiff two business days to find an advisor and to call and schedule a meeting with the Investigators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Roe was notified that her participation was optional and she could confer with the Investigators at any time convenient to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day, Roe met with her and Plaintiff's mutual friends-some of which were involved in the investigations-and relayed her side of the story to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 3, with his mother as his advisor, Plaintiff met with the Investigators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. From February 8 to 15, the Investigators conducted three witness interviews and reviewed those witnesses' statements with the Boulder Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 22, Plaintiff requested access to his OIEC investigative file which was denied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. The next day, OIEC informed Plaintiff that it would notify him when fact-gathering was complete and that he could review the summary of his interview in person at the OIEC office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 1, the Investigators again met with Roe and on March 21, she was again interviewed by the Boulder Police Department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79, 81. Also on March 21, the Investigators notified Plaintiff that he could review his OIEC investigative file for a two-hour period on March 28.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. They added that they wanted to ask Plaintiff follow-up questions after his review of the file and that they were drafting a written evidence summary to be issued the following week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 22, Plaintiff disputed the fairness of the process because the Investigators \"planned to issue the written evidence summary prior to his review of the investigative file and response to any follow up questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83. Plaintiff asked for the Investigators' follow-up questions to be provided in advance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 28, Plaintiff's counsel asked to review Plaintiff's file the first week in April, but OIEC requested additional time because then-Vice President Joe Biden was visiting the University from April 5 to 8.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85. As explained\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   Biden's visit was related to an initiative regarding\n   the prevention of sexual violence on college campuses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 1, the Investigators issued a written evidence summary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86. This was before Plaintiff reviewed the investigation file or answered follow-up questions. He was informed he had seven days to review and respond to the summary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Investigators emailed the summary to Roe, who was informed to not share it with anyone besides her advisor, \"as sharing it with any witnesses or participants in the investigation could be reviewed as retaliatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87. Roe shared the summary with the Boulder Police Department and no action was taken by OIEC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 13, Plaintiff and his attorney reviewed his file for two hours with an OIEC administrator present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90. Plaintiff was not allowed to make copies of any documents in the file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 18, the Boulder Police Department issued a second report concerning the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91. On May 2, the Investigators issued an amended written evidence summary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. Three days later, Plaintiff's counsel objected to the OIEC investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94. The next day, Plaintiff and his counsel reviewed his case file under the same circumstances as the prior review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 13, the Investigators emailed a notice of finding to Plaintiff, notifying him that he was found responsible for non-consensual sexual contact for the allegation in spring 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119. Plaintiff was found not responsible for the alleged sexual assault in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Investigators informed Plaintiff that the next day, the Standing Review Committee would review his final investigative report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96. The Standing Review Committee reviewed the evidence file and a 55-page confidential final report, which was issued the same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97. In the confidential final report, the Investigators found Roe's statements consistent and Plaintiff's statements inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Multiple times during this process, notifications sent to Plaintiff incorrectly stated that the applicable student conduct code was the 2014-15 version, instead of the code from the correct period of time, which was the 2013-14 version.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 119, 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 30, the University's Title IX Coordinator and OIEC Executive Director, Valerie Simons, solely determined Plaintiff's sanction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 120-22. Plaintiff was: (1) suspended for 18 months; (2) banned from campus; (3) required to undergo \"an evaluation and treatment from a licensed sex offender provider\"; (4) required to provide proof of any court-ordered or other sanctions; (5) required to have any application for readmission be personally approved by Simons; and (6) to have no contact with Roe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126. The notice of sanction did not notify Plaintiff of any right to an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127. The 2013-14 Student Conduct Code permitted an appeal, but the 2015-16 OIEC procedures did not permit an appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On August 18, Plaintiff submitted a statement of appeal on the grounds that: (1) \"the established procedures were not followed in a significant way and, as a result, the factual findings and the sanction, were not correct\" and (2) \"the severity of the sanction was not appropriate based on the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 31, Simons notified Plaintiff that she would review Plaintiff's appeal pursuant to the 2016-17 OIEC procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129. Simon stated that she would singularly conduct a preliminary inquiry, although under the 2013-14 Student Conduct Code, an appeal should have been reviewed by a committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 129-130. Simons denied the appeal and upheld Plaintiff's sanction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In October 2017, after trial to a jury, Plaintiff was found not guilty on all criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57, n.8. Plaintiff subsequently filed suit against the University on August 30, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Allegations of Gender Bias\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In his Complaint and reiterated in his Response, Plaintiff levies a litany of information alleging how the University was biased against men. ECF Nos. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 19-140; 12 at 3-10. Plaintiff generally alleges evidence of bias based on: (1) federal, local, and campus pressure to comply with Title IX; and (2) biases and conflicts of interest from relevant employees of the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    1. Federal, local, and campus pressure to comply with Title IX\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In April 2011, the Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") of the United States Department of Education issued a guidance letter which became known as the \"Dear Colleague Letter\" (\"DCL\"). ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 19. The DCL directed colleges and universities to take immediate action to eliminate sexual harassment, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"the DCL minimized due process protections for the accused by, among other things, eschewing any presumption of innocence, mandating a preponderance of the evidence standard, limiting cross-examination, and forbidding certain forms of alternative dispute resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint notes that in May 2013, a female student at the University filed a complaint to OCR claiming that it violated Title IX by not issuing a sufficient sanction against a male found responsible for sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. OCR opened an investigation against the University which garnered press coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25, 27, 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 2014, OCR released additional guidance providing procedures for schools to follow when responding to complaints of sexual violence and \"advised schools to adopt a trauma informed approach, advising, for example, that hearings should be 'conducted in a manner that does not inflict additional trauma on the complainant.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. The same year, the White House issued a report that advocated for trauma-informed training and noted that a school risked losing federal funding if OCR found the school to have violated Title IX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the University responded to these government guidances in various ways.
