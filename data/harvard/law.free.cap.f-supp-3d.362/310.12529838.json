INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government charged Defendant Marelle Tyrece Windham (Windham) in a\n   four-count indictment involving various narcotics and firearm crimes. Pending before the Court is Windham's motion to suppress evidence from two traffic stops in or around Hartsville, South Carolina (motion to suppress). Windham is represented by counsel. Having carefully considered the motion, the response, oral argument, the record, and the applicable law, it is the judgment of the Court Windham's motion to suppress will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of two traffic stops conducted by Hartsville Police Department officers. The first stop occurred on March 9, 2017 (first stop), and the second stop occurred on March 15, 2018 (second stop).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 28, 2018, the Government filed a four-count indictment against Windham. ECF No. 3. Count One, which arises out of the first stop and subsequent arrest, charged Windham with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Counts Two through Four arise out of the second stop and subsequent arrest. Count Two charged Windham with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. Count Three charged Windham with possession of narcotics (cocaine base) with the intent to distribute. And Count Four charged Windham with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 9, 2018, Windham filed his motion to suppress. ECF No. 35. On December 17, 2018, the Government filed its response. ECF No. 39. On January 3, 2019, the Court held a hearing (motion hearing) on Windham's motion to suppress. Counsel for the Government and Windham made arguments and the officers who conducted both traffic stops offered testimony. ECF No. 41. The Government introduced video evidence from dash cameras and body cameras of both stops, as well as a series of maps detailing where each stop took place. ECF No. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Windham asserts four grounds why his statement and physical evidence from the first stop should be suppressed. Windham avers the officer lacked probable cause, failed to timely provide\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, lacked territorial jurisdiction, and the evidence is not otherwise admissible under the \"inevitable discovery\" doctrine. With respect to the second stop, Windham avows the officer lacked probable cause and was outside of his jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the conclusion of the motion hearing, the Court denied Windham's motion to suppress as to the second stop in its entirety. With respect to the first stop, as fully detailed below, the Court denied in part Windham's motion to suppress; and it took a portion of Windham's motion to suppress under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ECF No. 39 at 2. Curtis turned his patrol car around and, while pursuing the sedan to investigate the window tint, observed the sedan twice fail to use a turn signal within the required distance from the stop sign.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9035715\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/538/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As Curtis accelerated to\n   initiate a traffic stop, the sedan ran a stop sign and made a quick turn into a driveway.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9035715\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/538/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the hearing, Officer Curtis testified he was just outside the Hartsville city limits when he first noticed Windham's vehicle. Officer Curtis was still within the immediate vicinity of the city of Hartsville when he followed Windham to the residence where he ultimately stopped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The entire pursuit and subsequent arrest occurred within Darlington County, where Hartsville is located, and within three miles of the city limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After parking the vehicle in the driveway, the driver emerged from the vehicle, and Curtis recognized the driver as Windham.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Although Windham attempted to walk towards the residence, Curtis detained him and asked for identification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Windham admitted he had no identification and subsequently told Curtis he did not have a driver's license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this point, Curtis handcuffed Windham and placed him in the backseat of his patrol car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Several seconds later, before he was given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, Curtis' dash camera captured the following exchange: Windham said \"Hey, listen, come here. Come here. I'm going to show you something. We gonna go to my car.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Curtis asked, \"Whatcha got?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Windham responded, \"There's a firearm in my car, but it's registered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Windham further elaborated the firearm is \"in the backseat of my car\" and \"wrapped in my black jacket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Curtis searched the backseat of Windham's vehicle and found the firearm and ammunition where Windham told Curtis it was located.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. After a few minutes, Curtis asked Windham if \"he had anything else on [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Windham stated he had some marijuana in his possession.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Law enforcement then found a $ 1 bill with 0.4 grams of marijuana wrapped inside of the bill inside Windham's pocket.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The second stop occurred on March 15, 2018, when Hartsville Police Officer Reichard (Reichard) was operating a stationary radar and noticed a white sedan driving east on West Washington Street at fifty-nine miles per hour (mph) in a forty-mph zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Reichard attempted to pursue the sedan, but the driver accelerated and Reichard fell further behind. Hartsville Police Officer Johnson (Johnson) spotted the vehicle, initiated pursuit with his blue lights on, and ultimately pulled the vehicle over on Elmwood Drive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When Officer Reichard first noticed Windham was speeding, he was driving in the Hartsville city limits on West Washington Street.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The subsequent pursuit and arrest took Officer Reichard outside of the Hartsville city limits, but well within Darlington County and within three miles of the Hartsville city limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Reichard and Johnson approached the vehicle, Windham was in the driver's seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The officers asked Windham to step out of the vehicle and away from the woman and young children who were also in the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. As Johnson began to pat Windham down, Reichard noticed a bag fall from Windham's lap. Reichard's body camera captured the following conversation: Reichard asked, \"What's that baggie right there?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. After Reichard took possession of the baggie, he asked Windham, \"Crack?\" and Windham responded, \"Yeah.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this point, Windham was handcuffed and walked to the back of his vehicle, where Reichard informed Windham of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Windham was further searched and the officers found $ 511 on his person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They also found a Glock 23 .40 caliber pistol and twenty-nine .40 caliber bullets while searching the trunk of Windham's vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While on the scene, Windham admitted to previously purchasing the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also claimed possession of the firearm the following day, March 16, 2018, during an interview with Task Force Officer Scott Gauger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In Windham's motion to suppress, he advances four grounds why his statements and the physical evidence from the first stop should be suppressed and he asserts two grounds why the physical evidence from the second stop should be suppressed. The Court will address each stop and ground in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. March 9, 2017, Stop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

ECF No. 39 at 10-11. The dispositive question is whether Windham was subject to an interrogation. The Court holds Windham was subjected to interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Within one minute of arriving at the residence where Windham stopped his vehicle, Officer Curtis had handcuffed Windham and told him to wait at the back of his patrol car. Windham told Officer Curtis, \" 'I ain't did nothin',\" to which Officer Curtis responded, \"You know something though.\" Windham replied, \"Know what?\" Officer Curtis instructed Windham, \"come get in the back of the car right now\" and then asked Windham, \"Whose house is this?\" Windham answered, \"that my aunt house right there - you know, Miss Carrie.\" A few seconds later, Windham told Officer Curtis, \"Hey listen, come here. Come here. I'm going to show you something. We gonna go to my car.\" Officer Curtis asked Windham, \"whatcha got?\" Windham responded, \"there's a firearm in my car, but it's registered.\" While Windham is still handcuffed in the back seat of the patrol car, Officer Curtis asked him several minutes later if \"he had anything else on him.\" Windham, who had not yet been given his Miranda warnings, replied that he had some marijuana in his possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Under these facts, Officer Curtis should have known his statements \"You know something though\" and \"whatcha got?\" were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. In between the two statements, Officer Curtis instructed Windham \"come get in the back of the car right now.\" Similarly, Officer Curtis should have known his question \"do you have anything else on you\" was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Because Windham was in custody, subjected to interrogation, and had not been given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, the Court will grant Windham's motion to suppress both of his statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Windham also moved to suppress the Glock 22 .40 caliber pistol and ammunition seized from the backseat of the car and the marijuana found in his pocket at the time of his arrest on the ground the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation led to the discovery of physical evidence. Windham contends the traditional \"fruits of the poisonous tree\" doctrine applies to bar the admission of the physical evidence discovered as a result of his statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   When a statement is suppressed because of a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation, it does not follow that any physical or derivative evidence discovered as a result of the statement should also be suppressed. The \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine does not require suppression of physical or derivative evidence discovered as a result of those statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because this holding is dispositive of this issue, the Court need not address Windham's argument regarding inevitable discovery here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karsten v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan of Mid-Atl. States, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521750\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/8/#p11\">\n    36 F.3d 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"If the first reason given is independently sufficient, then all those that follow are surplusage, thus, the strength of the first makes all the rest dicta.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With respect to the marijuana found in Windham's pocket, the Court holds the inevitable discovery doctrine is applicable. Windham was lawfully arrested, transported to the detention center, and upon his arrival, he was frisked and his property was collected during intake procedures. Because of the uniform procedures and protocols, it is inevitable any contraband still in Windham's possession at the time of intake would have been discovered. Thus, the Court will deny Windham's motion to suppress on the fourth ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. March 15, 2018, Stop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Ground One: Probable Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Windham's first ground for suppressing evidence arising from the second stop is he was not speeding and committed no traffic infractions justifying this stop. ECF No. 35 at 12. Windham's contention is unfounded and contrary to the weight of the evidence. Officer Reichard credibly testified he clocked Windham going fifty-nine mph in a forty mph zone with his radar. In addition, the video evidence from Officer Reichard's patrol car camera shows Windham pulling farther away from the officer after Officer Reichard initiated his pursuit of the vehicle. For these reasons, the Court will deny Windham's motion to suppress as to the first ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Ground Two: Territorial Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Windham's second ground for suppressing evidence is the same territorial jurisdiction argument he raised in his motion to suppress evidence from the first stop. As set forth more fully above, Windham's unlawful conduct was first noticed while he was driving within the Hartsville city limits. Windham's ongoing unlawful behavior continued outside of the city limits, but stayed within the immediate vicinity of the city of Hartsville. The arrest occurred within Darlington County, the same county in which Hartsville is located, and it occurred within three miles of the city limits. For all of these reasons, the Court will deny Windham's motion to suppress as to the second ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Wherefore, based on the foregoing discussion and analysis, it is the judgment of the Court Windham's motion to suppress is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n   Windham's motion to suppress is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to the statements he made during the first stop on March 9, 2017. The remainder of his motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
