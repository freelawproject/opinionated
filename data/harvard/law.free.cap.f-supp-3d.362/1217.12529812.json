(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1) Defendant is a health maintenance organization (\"HMO\") that directly or indirectly solicits or effects coverage of, collects charges or premiums from, or adjusts or settles claims on behalf of residents of Florida for health insurers and HMOs through a health maintenance contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By way of background, Congress established a federally subsidized health insurance program, Medicare Part C, which allows beneficiaries to opt-out of traditional Medicare and choose Medicare Advantage plans offered by private companies known as Medicare Advantage Organizations (hereinafter, \"MAO\") such as Aetna.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-21,\n   <em>\n    et.seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.100\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et.seq.\n   </em>\n   MAOs then contract with eligible patients regarding rates, costs, etc. for medical services using both in-network and out-of-network medical providers, such as Plaintiff.

(\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 2) Under a third-party beneficiary theory, Plaintiff seeks to enforce the terms of a medical policy between Defendant and the patients to recoup the outstanding balance for billed services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38) Plaintiff asserts that, as an out-of-network and noncontract provider for the patients, it is entitled to \"recover benefits for health care treatment regarding the above-referenced policy\" for emergency care and services rendered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant breached the medical policy contract by \"fail[ing] to properly pay or deny\" Plaintiff's claims for services rendered to the patients in violation of Florida Statutes.
