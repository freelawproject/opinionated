As explained more fully below, the Court denies the motion because it is untimely and because Enclarity waived its personal jurisdiction defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In broad terms, personal jurisdiction refers to a court's power to bring a particular defendant into the judicial process. Generally, courts may exercise that power only if the defendant has constitutionally sufficient contacts with the state in which the court sits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790092\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/421/#p425\">\n    623 F.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (7th Cir. 2010) (laying forth the standards for determining whether personal jurisdiction exists). Personal jurisdiction can either be \"general\"- meaning a defendant has such a strong connection to a state that a court within that state may hear\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   claim against it-or \"specific.\" Specific personal jurisdiction allows a court to hear a claim against a defendant who may not be subject to general jurisdiction if the claim arises out of the defendant's connection to the state where the court sits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790092\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/421/#p425\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that the Court lacks general jurisdiction over Enclarity. Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 4. To adjudicate the claims against Enclarity, then, the Court must have specific jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Enclarity challenges specific personal jurisdiction only as to claims brought by out of state plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It argues that because those plaintiffs did not receive faxes in Illinois and were not otherwise injured in Illinois, their claims do not relate to Enclarity's connection to Illinois and must be dismissed. Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 4-9. Mussat rejoins that specific jurisdiction need not be established for claims brought by absent class members, and that in any case, Enclarity waived its personal jurisdiction defense by failing to raise it earlier. The Court agrees with the latter of Mussat's arguments, and also finds that Enclarity's motion is untimely. Accordingly, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Enclarity's Motion is Untimely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Enclarity styles its motion as one for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), but clearly seeks the relief contemplated by Rule 12(b)(2), which permits a defendant to seek dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. Presumably, Enclarity has done so because Rule 12(b) motions \"must\" be made before a responsive pleading is filed, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), and Enclarity filed a responsive pleading-its answer-before making this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hedeen Int'l, LLC v.

Wright and Arthur R. Miller,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1367 (3d ed., 2018). And according to the plain text of Rule 12(h)(2) and (3), the only 12(b) defenses that may properly be brought after the close of pleadings in a 12(c) motion are 1) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, 2) failure to join a party required by Rule 19(b), and 3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511970\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/994/333/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, asserting a personal jurisdiction defense in a Rule 12(c) motion is improper.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Ill. Jan. 15, 2013), this Court is not inclined to do so here because, as discussed below, Enclarity should have asserted its personal jurisdiction defense well before it answered Mussat's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Enclarity Waived its Personal Jurisdiction Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure make clear that a party may not raise in a Rule 12 motion a personal jurisdiction defense that was \"available but omitted\" from an earlier Rule 12 motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2). Omitting an available defense from the first Rule 12 motion a party files results in waiver of that defense. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1)(A). Enclarity acknowledges that it objected to personal jurisdiction only after the Court denied its 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. It argues, however, that the objection was not \"available\" when it filed its first motion (and therefore not waived) because the Supreme Court had not yet decided\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , the case upon which the current motion is premised. Defendant's Reply in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings 8, ECF No. 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Courts have formulated what it means for a defense to be \"available\" in different ways. Generally, though, parties avoid waiver despite omitting a defense from an earlier motion when \"a prior authoritative decision indicated that the defense was unavailable\" and \"the defense became available thereafter by way of supervening authority (say, an overruling of the prior decision or a legislative clarification.)\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

But Enclarity repeatedly argues that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   is the operative case which provided a new personal jurisdiction defense; it does not argue that the defense was unavailable until a court applied\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   to absent class members. The\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning is therefore applicable here, and the Court finds it persuasive. In light of the Supreme Court's instruction that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   represents a \"straightforward application ... of settled principles of personal jurisdiction,\" 137 S.Ct. at 1783,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   cannot reasonably be characterized as an intervening change in the law and so was\n   \"available\" to Enclarity within the meaning of Rule 12(g)(2) when it moved for dismissal under 12(b)(6).

The motion was not decided until March 2018; until that time, nothing precluded Enclarity from seeking leave to amend or supplement its pending motion to dismiss to add a personal jurisdiction defense when\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   was decided. Instead, Enclarity sat on its hands and in doing so waived the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    InsideSales.com, Inc. v.

Failing to brief one aspect of a legal theory in an initial motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is a far cry from failing to raise the defense all together. And the language of Rule 12(h) is unequivocal that waiver follows from the failure to join available motions as required by Rule 12(g)(2) ; it provides no discretion to excuse such waivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanderford v.

Shortly after, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The defendant then raised for the first time a personal jurisdiction challenge in its reply brief, which the plaintiff had addressed pre-emptively in its response.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202238191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *9 n. 11. This Court stated in a footnote that it would consider the argument because\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   was not handed down until after the motion to dismiss was filed, and the plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202238191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But unlike Enclarity, that defendant raised its personal jurisdiction defense in its first Rule 12 motion (albeit in the reply), early in the litigation process, and less than a month after the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   . In contrast, Enclarity raised its defense for the first time in an answer filed more than nine months after the decision came down.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It also waited to file this motion until approximately two months after the Court referred the case to the magistrate judge for discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Enclarity's argument that it raised its defense \"at the first reasonable opportunity,\" Defendant's Reply Brief at 8, is entirely unpersuasive. To the contrary and as noted above, Enclarity could have raised the defense when it first moved for dismissal in October 2016. Next, it could have raised it when it supplemented that motion with new authority in March 2017, more than a month after the Supreme Court granted certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   .

And at a minimum, even if Enclarity was still at that point subjectively unaware that it might have a personal jurisdiction defense, it could have moved to supplement its motion for a second time during the eight months after\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   came down but before this Court made its ruling. Enclarity's inaction suggests either that for months after\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   was decided it still did not realize it had a personal jurisdiction defense to assert or, more likely, that Enclarity opted to hold that arrow in its quiver to use in the event its 12(b)(6) motion did not carry the day as filed. Neither explanation warrants relief from the operation of Rules 12(g)(2) and 12(h)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, after finally asserting a lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer, Enclarity did not mention this new defense in the joint status report filed on April 3, 2018 or at the status hearing held before the Court the next day.
