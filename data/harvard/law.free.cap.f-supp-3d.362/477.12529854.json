For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Loop, LLC (\"AutoLoop\" or \"Plaintiff\") brings this action on behalf of itself and other automotive software application vendors to remedy and enjoin purported ongoing antitrust and state law violations by Defendant CDK Global, LLC (\"CDK\" or \"Defendant\"). [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6 1.] Plaintiff alleges that CDK and its non-party co-conspirator The Reynolds and Reynolds Company (\"Reynolds\") have committed antitrust violations and inflicted widespread harm on automotive dealers, vendors of software products and services (like Plaintiff), and the automotive industry by conspiring to eliminate competition for providing data integration services for dealer data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.] Plaintiff is an automotive software products and services company, providing integrated\n   software solutions to more than 2,000 car dealers across the country. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.] Plaintiff offers three suites of software: sales, service, and marketing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.] Each suite includes multiple software applications that dealers can select to enhance their ability to sell cars and serve customers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Vendors like Plaintiff need access to dealer data for their products and services to function. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.] This dealer data includes vehicle and parts inventory, customer name and contact information, customer leads, completed and pending sales information, vehicle financing and insurance (\"F &amp; I\") information, vehicle pricing information, and service and repair information. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The DMS Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Dealers traditionally have stored a significant portion of their data on a database within their data management system (\"DMS\"), which is software that dealers use to help manage their businesses (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , accounting, sales, service, and human resources). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.] Defendant and non-party Reynolds both have significant market power in the DMS market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.] Together, they control approximately 75% of the United States market by number of dealers and approximately 90% when measured by number of vehicles sold. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant controls approximately 45% of the DMS market, and Reynolds controls approximately 30%. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Switching DMS providers presents significant logistical challenges and is highly disruptive to business operations. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.] It can take a dealership more than a year of preparation, staff training, and testing before a new DMS can be put into operation, resulting in significant training and implementation costs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The average DMS client tenure is more than 20 years. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68.] Defendant's own CEO publicly has recognized that dealers are hesitant to switch DMSs because the process can take time and can be very difficult. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to their DMSs, Defendant and Reynolds offer standalone software applications that compete directly with applications offered by Plaintiff and other third-party vendors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.] DMS providers (including Defendant and Reynolds) historically have allowed dealers to provide third parties (including vendors like Plaintiff) automated access to the dealer data stored on their DMSs through data integration service providers, which collect and standardize the data to provide it to the dealer's chosen third-party vendors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.] Plaintiff sells automotive software products and services to dealers, including applications that help dealers market, sell, and service cars. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.] Plaintiff's applications, like those of other vendors, require access to dealer data stored on a dealers' DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Dealer Data Integration Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Data Integration Services (\"DIS\") market consists of services that provide access to dealer data on their respective DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.] Data integrators (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , DIS providers) also may provide value-enhancing services, such as putting data from different DMSs in a uniform format, data hygiene (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , error correction), and granular control by dealers over which vendors receive which data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant and Reynolds each provide data integration services for their respective DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.] Defendant's data integration service is known as Third Party Access (\"3PA\"), and Reynolds's data integration service is known as the Reynolds Certified Interface (\"RCI\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Third parties also have provided competing data integration services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Indeed, Defendant owns two such third-party data integrators-Digital Motorworks, Inc. (\"DMI\") and IntegraLink. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Other third-party data integrators have included Authenticom, Inc. (\"Authenticom\") and Superior Integrated\n   Solutions, Inc. (\"SIS\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] At one time, both CDK and Reynolds had \"open\" DMSs, meaning that neither took steps to prevent dealer clients from authorizing third-party access to the dealers' data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.] During this time, the competition between data integration services made access to dealer data cost effective. For example, an application vendor could pay a data integrator $ 50 per dealer per month. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] With dealers in control of access to and use of their data, vendors created an array of innovative software products and services to help dealerships market, sell, lease, and service cars. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over time, Reynolds began to \"close\" its DMS by selectively blocking third-party data integrators from accessing dealer data stored on the Reynolds DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.] As Reynolds reduced competition for DIS through its blocking activities, Reynolds increased the fees it charged for data integration through RCI. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant continued to differentiate its product as an \"open\" DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] At the same time, Defendant's own data integration businesses provided vendors with access to dealer data on the Reynolds DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant's open-access policy allowed it to gain (albeit very slowly) DMS customers at Reynolds's expense and to enter long-term contracts with those dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Defendant marketed its \"open\" system directly to dealers and issued press releases stressing that it \"believes in the fair competitive environment and does not use its leverage through supply of the dealer management system to reduce competition through the restriction of data access.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That competition between Defendant and Reynolds halted in early 2015 when Defendant began blocking dealers from granting third-party access to dealer data and, at the same time, agreed to shut down its data integration business for dealers using a Reynolds DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.] Plaintiff alleges that these changes were the result of horizontal agreements with Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .] Effective February 18, 2015, Defendant and Reynolds entered into three written agreements. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96.] The centerpiece was a \"Data Exchange Agreement\"-also referred to as the \"wind-down\" agreement-pursuant to which Defendant agreed to wind down its data integration business on the Reynolds DMS, with Reynolds promising not to block Defendant's access to the Reynolds system during the wind-down period (approximately 5 years). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] During that period, Reynolds agreed that CDK could continue to extract dealer data just as it had before, using login credentials provided by the dealer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As for other independent integrators, Defendant and Reynolds agreed that they would not \"take any steps to assist any person that it reasonably believes to have plans to access or integrate with the other party's DMS.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to the written agreements, senior CDK and Reynolds executives also have admitted that they have agreed to restrict access to dealer data and destroy data integrators like Authenticom, Superior Integrated Solutions, Inc. (\"SIS\"), and others. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103.] For example, on April 3, 2016, at an industry convention in Las Vegas, Dan McCray (CDK's former Vice President of Product Management) told Steve Cottrell (Authenticom's founder and CEO) that Defendant and Reynolds had agreed to lock Authenticom and other third parties out and that they were \"working collaboratively to remove all hostile integrators from our DMS system.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104.] By eliminating competition for data integration services, CDK and Reynolds have seized control over dealer data and thwarted dealers' ability to control access to and the usage of their data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.] According to Plaintiff, as a result of these agreements, vendors like Plaintiff had no choice but to access dealer\n   data through CDK's and Reynolds's own data integration services. Plaintiff's integration fees therefore have skyrocketed from approximately $ 79 per month per rooftop with independent data integrators to more than $ 730 per month per rooftop with Defendant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.] Other vendors have seen similar increases. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Alleged Exclusive Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly after entering into the Data Exchange Agreement, Defendant began \"renegotiating\" its contracts with vendors for 3PA access. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114.] Consistent with its decision to close its DMS, Defendant imposed contractual provisions requiring that vendors using 3PA for any of its dealer-customers on a CDK DMS agree to use 3PA exclusively for all of its of its dealer-customers on CDK DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115.] For example, Plaintiff's Managed Interface Agreement (\"MIA\") and accompanying Statement of Work, dated January 12, 2016, states in Section 1(f):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [AutoLoop] agrees that it will not (a) otherwise access, retrieve, license, or otherwise transfer any data from or to an [sic] CDK System (including, without limitation, pursuant to any [independent data integrator] ) for itself or any other entity or (b) contract with, or otherwise engage, any third party (including any [dealer] ) to access, retrieve, license or otherwise transfer any data from or to an CDK System.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] These contractual provisions prohibit Plaintiff from sharing dealer data between its own products and services because Plaintiff's solutions cannot receive dealer data from any source other than 3PA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The new 3PA contract also includes a price-secrecy provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   All terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the pricing terms hereof) * * * shall be considered confidential information under the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. [AutoLoop] may generically inform its [dealers] that CDK has charged [AutoLoop] a fee for the use of the [3PA program] as long as it does not inform any [dealer] of the amount of such fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.] Internal CDK documents state the purpose of these provisions is \"to create minimal awareness to dealer\" regarding CDK's exorbitant pricing for data integration. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] CDK includes the same or substantially similar provisions in its standard 3PA contract with other vendors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The CDK standard contract also bars vendors from indicating \"in any way\" that an increase in the price of products or services is related to an increase in the integration fees charged by CDK: \"Vendor shall never indicate in any way to any CDK Vendor Client [i.e., dealer] that any increase in any price charged by Vendor to any CDK Vendor Client is in reaction to, or in any other way associated with, any modification in the price charged by CDK hereunder with respect to Vendor's use of the CDK Interface System.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 124.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After entering into the Data Exchange Agreement, Defendant also took the new position that its existing contracts with dealers prohibited allowing data integrators to access its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125.] Defendant also recently forced many of its dealers to extend their contracts by years by threatening to terminate their DMS service. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.] Many of these dealers were on month-to-month contracts, and had been for a long time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Without prior notice, Defendant informed these dealers that their DMS services would terminate in less than 60 days unless the dealers entered into years-long contracts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff contends that dealers generally had no choice but to sign the lengthy extensions given the impossibility of switching DMS providers in such a short amount of time.

Horizontal Conspiracy (Count I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff brings a Section 1 horizontal conspiracy claim against Defendant based on agreements between Defendant and Reynolds that were designed to eliminate competition in the provision of dealer data integration services. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's horizontal conspiracy claim fails for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is wrong about what the challenged agreements provide. Focusing on the written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds, CDK argues that the \"agreements effect only a wind-down of CDK's hostile access to Reynolds's DMS[.]\" [260, at 13.] Although the 2015 Agreements do not require CDK and Reynolds to block third-party access on their own DMSs, as noted by Judge St. Eve in the\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   case, the agreements do \"effectively require that CDK stop hostile access of Reynolds DMSs (for a period, at least) and, more importantly, expressly prohibit Defendants from assisting in the hostile access of one another's DMSs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Plaintiff alleges that dealers preferred \"open\" DMSs and that several dealers complained when Defendant began blocking data integrators. [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 111-13.] It therefore is reasonable to infer that Defendant and Reynolds were motivated to conspire with each other so they could close their systems to data integrators without fear that their customers would turn to another provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Furthermore, accepting CDK's argument that Plaintiff only has alleged parallel conduct would require that the Court ignore well-pleaded allegations that CDK executives admitted to the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such admissions are direct evidence of an illegal conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052985\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/622/#p628\">\n    630 F.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (7th Cir. 2010) (recognizing \"an admission by an employee of one of the conspirators\" as direct evidence supporting a price-fixing case). The Court therefore rejects Defendant's argument that Plaintiff only has alleged parallel conduct insufficient to establish a horizontal conspiracy claim under Section 1. As Judge St. Eve noted in the\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   decision, accepting Defendant's argument that AutoLoop only has alleged parallel conduct \"requires the Court to ignore well-pleaded allegations of fact (that the executives admitted the agreement), and then credit an inference in Defendants' favor (that the agreement did not exist because Reynolds had already engaged in integrator blocking) over a contrary one in [Plaintiff's] favor (that Reynolds agreed, for example, to escalate or enhance its blocking, or agreed not to go after CDK for its hostile access, in exchange for CDK's commitment to begin blocking).

However, in making that argument, Defendant did not cite to any cases establishing what a plaintiff must allege to survive a motion to dismiss a market-division claim. In fact, Defendant does not cite to any cases addressing the necessary showing for such a claim. While it is clear that market-division agreements are agreements between \"competitors to stay out of each other's territories[,]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield United of Wisconsin v.

Neither party sufficiently addresses the relevant legal standards. Without the benefit of adequate briefing supported by relevant case law, the Court declines to rule on whether Plaintiff sufficiently has alleged a market-division claim. In the absence of a sufficient justification to make a ruling, the tie goes to the non-moving party and the claim survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Exclusive Dealing (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Defendant engaged in exclusive dealing. \"An exclusive dealing contract obliges a firm to obtain its inputs from a single source.\"\n   <em>\n    Paddock Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chicago Tribune Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/42/#p46\">\n    103 F.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (7th Cir. 1996). \"The objection to exclusive-dealing agreements is that they deny outlets to a competitor during the term of the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Roland Mach.

Because of the procompetitive benefits of exclusive dealing (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , increasing allocative efficiency, preventing free-riding), courts analyze exclusive dealing under the rule of reason.\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Plaintiff argues that it sufficiently has alleged that Defendant's contracts with vendors contain unlawful exclusive dealing provisions, adopting Judge St. Eve's analysis in the\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   case and referring to the briefing in\n   <em>\n    Cox Automotive, Inc., et al. v. CDK Global,\n   </em>\n   LLC, Case No. 18-cv-1058 (N.D. Ill.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to bring an exclusive dealing claim based on Defendant's contract with vendors, the Court agrees that Plaintiff states a claim for exclusive dealing. Plaintiff alleges that \"[a]s a condition of participating in CDK's 3PA data integration service, vendors must generally agree to use 3PA exclusively for all of the vendors' products and services.\" [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6 20; see also\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 114-124.] Defendant argues that Plaintiff's exclusive dealing claim fails because 3PA is a \" 'managed interface' that is part of CDK's DMS, not a separate product.\" [260, at 19.] According to Defendant, there is no separate market for data integration services because the \" 'peculiar characteristics' of 3PA preclude any finding that it is a separate product.\" [160 (Reply Br. in\n   <em>\n    Cox Automotive\n   </em>\n   ), at 15.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant fails fully to develop this argument. Although Defendant identifies two relevant factors for determining a product market (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"separate demand\" and \"the products peculiar characteristics and uses\"), Defendant does not even discuss other relevant indicia such as \"distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown Shoe Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168106\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/294/#p325\">\n    370 U.S. 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168106\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/294/#p325\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168106\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/294/#p325\">\n    8 L.Ed.2d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962). Of the two factors identified by Defendant, only one (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the products peculiar characteristics and uses) arguably support a finding of a separate product. The other relevant factors appear to weigh in favor of finding a separate market for data integration services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   For\n   example, as Defendant repeatedly recognizes, it is not the dealers that purchase data integration services. Thus, there are distinct customers and distinct prices for the data integration services. Furthermore, based on the fact-intensive nature of the product-market inquiry, the issue is not properly resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Ploss v.

Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not alleged substantial foreclosure because there are no allegations that Defendant's vendor or dealer contracts foreclosed Plaintiff from a substantial share of any market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff appears to concede that it has not been foreclosed from a substantial share of any market, but argues that the foreclosure of Authenticom from the data integration market caused an increase in prices and a reduction in output below competitive levels. [126 (Resp. Br. in\n   <em>\n    Cox Automotive\n   </em>\n   ), at 19-20.] For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's anticompetitive conduct dramatically raised integration fees for software vendors, often doubling or even tripling the price. [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 126-139, 142-144.] In its reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails sufficiently to allege that Authenticom was foreclosed from the data integration market. [160 (Reply. Br. in\n   <em>\n    Cox Automotive\n   </em>\n   ), at 16 n.7.] However, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant and Reynolds together control approximately 75 percent of the DMS market by number of dealers and approximately 90 percent when measured by number of vehicles sold. [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6 10.] Defendant alone controls approximately 45 percent of the DMS market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff further alleges that \"with the two dominant DMS providers agreeing to block independent integrators, it would be impossible for competing data integrators to survive.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104.] Indeed, vendors like Plaintiff are forced to pay supracompetitive prices for data integration services because they need to be able to service dealers who have CDK or Reynolds as their DMS providers. Vendors are likely only willing to pay such prices because Authenticom (the only other remaining data integrator) is foreclosed from competing for that business.

Plaintiff alleges that dealers are \"locked in\" CDK's DMS. [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 47-51.] In support of that assertion, Plaintiff alleges that \"switching DMS providers presents significant logistical challenges and is highly disruptive to business operations. It can take a dealership over a year of preparation, staff training, and testing before a new DMS can be put into operation * * * The financial costs in terms of training and implementation are significant.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48.] Indeed, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's own CEO publicly has recognized that dealers are hesitant to switch DMSs because the process can take time and can be very difficult. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant argues that because of its contractual bars on third-party DMS access, dealers were aware of its aftermarket power and its terms when they purchased the contracted with CDK. [260, at 23.] However, Plaintiff repeatedly alleges that Defendant publicly took the position that it permitted access by third-party integrators. [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 64-68.] For example, Plaintiff alleges that \"CDK's top executives have repeatedly made public statements that dealers may grant data integrators rights to access their DMS.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.] \"Steve Anenen, CDK's longtime CEO, publicly stated that dealers have the right to grant third parties access to, and use of, their data. He told the industry publication Automotive News, 'We're not going to prohibit that or get in the way of that.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] He further stated, \"I don't know how you can ever make the opinion that the data is yours to govern and to preclude others from having access to it, when in fact it's really the data belonging to the dealer. As long as they grant permission, how would you ever go against that wish?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).] The amended complaint identifies similar statements made by other CDK executives. [See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant nonetheless argues that dealers could not be justified in relying on these representations given contrary language in their contracts with Defendant. [260, at 23.] In making this argument, Defendant cites to cases recognizing that \"[a] party is not justified in relying on representations outside of or contrary to the written terms of a contract he or she signs when the signer is aware of the nature of the contract and had a full opportunity to read it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cromeens, Holloman, Sibert, Inc. v.

However, it is not apparent from the face of the amended complaint that Defendant's contracts with dealers contradict these representations. Although Defendant's contract with dealers permitted dealers to authorize its agents to access the DMS [194 (Am. Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 65, 72, 88], it is not clear\n   whether third-party data integrators were acting as the dealers' agents. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that the data integrators are the agents of dealers [260, at 9], but Plaintiff need not anticipate factual defenses that Defendant may raise regarding Plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Mitcheff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865733\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/635/#p637\">\n    696 F.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637 (7th Cir. 2012) (\"Complaints need not anticipate defenses and attempt to defeat them.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

Although discovery ultimately may demonstrate that data integrators were contractually prohibited from accessing Defendant's DMS, based on the well-pleaded allegations in the amended complaint it is plausible that dealers believed that they could authorize third-party integrators to access their DMSs, especially in light of public statements by CDK executives indicating that dealers had such authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant CDK also argues that Plaintiff's allegation that vendors are prohibited from informing dealers of how much Defendant's integration services cost does nothing to support Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   claim because-according to Defendant-that allegation is contradicted by Plaintiff's allegations that dealers are aware of the price differences between 3PA and third-party data integrators. Judge St. Eve reached the opposite conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   , concluding that it is reasonable to infer from such an allegation \"that dealers cannot price shop for 'lifecycle'-a fact that the\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   court found critical.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

In reaching that conclusion, Judge St. Eve noted that a few vendors might share pricing information despite the contractual prohibition, but still found that \"[t]he proper market definition in this case can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the 'commercial realities' faced by consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525541\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/931/#p951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    504 U.S. at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant argues that the allegations in this case differ from the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   , because the allegations here \"tell a story that dealers, industry-wide, are concerned about increased prices for vendor applications on so called 'closed' DMSs.\" [260, at 24.] However, the fact that dealers know the price of vendor applications and are unwilling to fully absorb increased costs for data integration services does not mean that dealers industry-wide are aware of the exact cost of data integration services, even if they are concerned about increasing costs and the reduced efficiency of vendor applications. Accordingly, Plaintiff plausibly has alleged an\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

While it is true that Defendant's argument in support of dismissal are not limited to those raised by Defendant in its initial motion to dismiss, this does not mean that Defendant is relieved of its obligation to assert its intent to arbitrate at the \"earliest feasible\" time. Indeed, there is no indication that anything in the amended complaint had any impact on Defendant's arbitration argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    To be sure, the Court is not saying that Defendant's participation in discovery alone is the basis for finding waiver. Defendant could have participated in discovery while reserving its right to arbitrate. Given the simplicity of Defendant's arbitration argument (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiff must arbitrate all claims relating to the RIA), however, it does not appear that any delay was necessary for Defendant to be able to determine which of Plaintiff's claims are or are not arbitratable. Thus, Defendant's participation in discovery without any reservation of its right to arbitrate until July 2018 was inconsistent with the intent to arbitrate. Similarly, the Court is not saying that Defendant's motion to transfer and consolidate alone is the basis for finding waiver. Rather, taking all of Defendant's actions together, it cannot be said that Defendant acted consistent with the intent to arbitrate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Because the Court finds that Defendant waived any right to arbitrate Plaintiff's claims and that Defendant does not have any right to invoke Reynolds's right to arbitrate in the first place, the Court does not address whether Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of Plaintiff's arbitration agreement with Reynolds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The parties dispute to what extent the Court must rely on earlier decisions made by the MDL court. Throughout its brief, Plaintiff relies on Judge St. Eve's opinion in the\n    <em>\n     Authenticom\n    </em>\n    matter. Defendant contends that the Court is free to disagree with that opinion as it sees fit.

The Court will of course address the specific allegations in the amended complaint currently before the Court, but the Court sees no basis for deviating from Judge St. Eve's opinion to the extent it is relevant to the allegations in the amended complaint here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendant argues that such a motive is not plausible because CDK would not risk treble-damages liability in exchange for Reynolds's mere agreement to continue doing what it already had done for years. [260, at 15.] However, based on the allegations in the amended complaint, there was no guaranty that Reynolds would maintain its closed policy.

[\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ] However, nothing prevented Reynolds from deciding to open its DMS. Indeed, given that Plaintiff alleges that Reynolds lost business to CDK as a result of its closed DMS, Reynolds had the incentive to do so. While CDK is free to argue that the purported concessions demonstrate that Reynolds and CDK merely engaged in parallel conduct, the Court cannot simply ignore the well-pled allegations of a horizontal agreement at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Plaintiff incorporated certain briefing from\n    <em>\n     Cox Automotive, Inc., et al. v.
