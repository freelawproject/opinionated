Plaintiffs Bohler Bleche GmbH &amp; Co.

The court remanded the Final Determination to Commerce for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Bohler Bleche GMBH &amp; Co. v.

As part of that process, Commerce created merchandise groups, each assigned a control number (\"CONNUM\"), meant to group together \"identical merchandise\" used to match home market sales with U.S. sales. The Department compared the weighted-average of export sales within each CONNUM to the weighted-average of home market sales in that same CONNUM. I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. As part of this process, the Department created a hierarchy of product characteristics, the third of which was QUALITY, which would be used for the purposes of sorting merchandise based on various quality-related characteristics.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs proposed their own methodology, called CONNUM2, \"that replaced the QUALITY field (which reported the type\n   of steel and the chemical composition) with a GRADE field (which reported the gross estimation of the cost of alloy).\" Remand Results at 4 (citing Pls.' Questionnaire Resp. B-13-14 (July 15, 2016), P.R. 163-174). Alternatively, Plaintiffs requested a number of changes to Commerce's methodology, including that the QUALITY field be placed first in the hierarchy, and that a QUALITY subcategory be added specifically for high alloy tool steel products. I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. In response, Commerce moved the QUALITY field to first in the hierarchy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, Commerce's methodology produced a weighted average dumping margin of 53.72%, Final Determination, and Plaintiffs challenged those results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On review, the court faulted Commerce's determination for \"fail[ing] to account for commercially significant physical differences based on alloy content.\"\n   <em>\n    Bohler I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What's more, the court found that \"[t]hroughout the investigation, the Department largely ignored Plaintiffs' central argument: that the Department's methodology allows comparisons of products with commercially distinct physical characteristics ... to determine whether\" dumping occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court disregarded Commerce's insistence that the challenges to the model-match methodology were untimely.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found Commerce's selected methodology unreasonable for insufficiently accounting for alloy contents and remanded to the Department so that Commerce could \"amend its model-match methodology\" so that a new model could be produced to differentiate between \"similar\" and \"identical\" products.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Commerce was ordered to \"design a model-match methodology in [its] investigation that accounts for all commercially significant physical differences\" and \"apply recalculated dumping margins consistent with its redetermination of its model-match methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On remand, the Department has now \"reconsidered its model-match methodology\" and \"intends to use [Plaintiffs'] proposed alternative model-match methodology (i.e., CONNUM2 which replaces the QUALITY field with a GRADE field) and to recalculate [Plaintiffs'] dumping margins and the all-others rate.\" Remand Results at 1-2. Commerce's revised methodology \"replaced the QUALITY product characteristic field with a GRADE field to account for all commercially significant differences, including alloy content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The Department viewed Plaintiffs' CONNUM2 proposal from the underlying investigation as the only option that would \"account for all commercially significant physical differences,\" namely alloy content.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. This change resulted in a revised antidumping duty margin of 28.57%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its comments on the Remand Results, Plaintiffs encourage the court to sustain Commerce's determination.

Comments in Support of the Final Results of Redetermination Pursuant to Court Remand 3, ECF No. 57 (Nov. 8, 2018). Commerce, on the other hand, issued the Remand Results under respectful\n   protest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Viraj Grp., Ltd. v.

The Department's altered methodology accounts for physical differences based on alloy content and, per the court's prior order, results in a reasonable determination. Accordingly, Commerce's Remand Results are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The statute requires that Commerce compare \"[f]oreign like product[s],\" defined either as identical merchandise or similar merchandise,\n   <em>\n    SKF USA, Inc. v.

Cir. 2008), in such a manner as to allow for a \"fair comparison,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a). While it is true that the Department's prior methodology ran counter to the directives of the statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohler I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Commerce's methodology cannot be sustained because it allows subject merchandise to be cast as 'identical' to dubiously similar foreign like products, when the statute plainly requires a different approach.\"), generally this court grants Commerce substantial discretion in its review of the Department's chosen model match methodology,\n   <em>\n    SKF USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4131041\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/1373/#p1375\">\n    537 F.3d at 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce's altered methodology not only differentiates between identical and similar products, it also provides a reasonable basis for conducting a fair comparison. Whereas Commerce's prior methodology neither aligned with statutory directives nor resulted in fair comparisons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohler I\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n    324 F.Supp.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the methodology chosen on remand is reasonable as it fairly compares commercially significant differences in physical characteristics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds the Department's determination-that is, adopting CONNUM2 and the resultant rate-to be reasonable as it is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Commerce's determination in full and enters judgment in the Department's favor.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The court previously sustained the Department's determination that the model-match methodology need not further account for process.\n    <em>\n     Bohler I\n    </em>\n    , 42 CIT at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526612\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/1344/\">\n     324 F.Supp.3d at 1354\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
