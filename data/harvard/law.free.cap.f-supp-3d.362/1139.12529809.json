These Motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for decision. For the following reasons Defendants' Motion to Strike Sullivan's Declarations filed in Opposition to Summary Judgment is due to be GRANTED; Sullivan's Consolidated Motion for Summary Judgment is due to be GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART; Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is due to be GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART; and Sullivan's Motions to Strike are due to be DENIED as MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants operate approximately 158 Papa John's stores in Alabama, Louisiana,\n   Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia, and Utah. As part of their business, Defendants employ delivery drivers who use privately owned automobiles to deliver pizzas or other foods on behalf of the Defendants. This case involves a minimum wage claim by Sullivan, who is a delivery driver formerly employed by the Defendants. Sullivan brought this case as a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act, (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , alleging that Defendants failed to pay him and others similarly situated a minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Central to the parties' dispute is the method Defendants use to reimburse drivers for the cost drivers incurred making deliveries on behalf of Defendants. Defendants' reimbursement policy is not based on a per-mile rate, but is calculated by multiplying a predetermined amount per delivery (called the \"Mileage Rate\") by the number of discrete delivery addresses to which a driver delivers. The Mileage Rate fluctuates according to local gas prices and also seeks to reimburse drivers for certain maintenance costs incurred such as oil changes and tire replacements. At the end of each delivery driver's shift, a \"Checkout Report\" is created by Defendants that includes the total amount of reimbursement due to the driver for the deliveries they made on their shift. The Checkout Reports do not include the total number of miles driven by the drivers each shift, nor do Defendants track or maintain records of delivery drivers' actual expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sullivan's minimum wage claims are based on the Department of Labor (\"DOL\") regulations made according to the rulemaking authority delegated to the DOL under the FLSA. Those regulations state that \"the wage requirements of [the FLSA] will not be met where the employee 'kicks-back' directly or indirectly to the employer ... the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.35\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A kickback occurs when the cost to the employee of tools specifically required for the performance of the employee's work \"cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under [the FLSA].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.35\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sullivan argues that Defendants' reimbursement method undercompensates the amount of actual expenses that Sullivan incurred delivering for Defendants, such that the kick-back given to Defendants reduces Sullivan's hourly wage below the federal minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequent to the filing of the parties' motions for summary judgment, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   that otherwise valid arbitration agreements providing for the waiver of collective action procedures during arbitration must be enforced. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Concerned that\n   <em>\n    Epic Systems\n   </em>\n   was possibly at odds with early holdings in relation to the class-wide-nature of this action, the Court ordered the parties to indicate their support or opposition to dismissal of this action in favor of individual arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 283.) The parties responded, with Defendants supporting such dismissal and Sullivan initially opposing it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 287 &amp; 88.) The Court set a hearing for the parties to offer arguments both in regards\n   to the arbitration agreements and any decertification arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a motion on June 15, 2018, Plaintiffs reversed their earlier decision and indicated that they did not oppose dismissal of the conditionally certified class members so that they could participate in individual arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 294.) Defendants likewise filed a Motion for Decertification on June 20, 2018. In light of these additional motions, the Court on June 22, 2018, decertified the class of Opt-in Plaintiffs, dismissing them without prejudice. The sole remaining plaintiff in this action is Sullivan himself. The Court thus addresses in this Memorandum of Opinion only the issues that directly implicate Sullivan, because the Court is without power to make any holding regarding the former Opt-in Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties have moved for summary judgment on over ten discrete issues. While some arguments are made only by Sullivan or Defendants, the central issues of this case are addressed in both parties' summary judgment briefs. In an attempt to create a coherent treatment of the parties' dispute, the Court first addresses the \"core issues\" surrounding the parties' dispute, wherein a grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants would require dismissal of this action. After finding that the core of this action is not due to be dismissed, the Court then addresses additional issues raised by both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. MT.

Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.\n   </em>\n   to the claims in this action.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    328 U.S. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    90 L.Ed. 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946). \"In\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Sullivan points to\n   <em>\n    Caro-Galvan v. Curtis Richardson, Inc.\n   </em>\n   as a sufficiently similar case to this action to support the claim that Sullivan is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Mt.

In\n   <em>\n    Caro-Galvan\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were farm workers who brought suit under the FLSA for violation of the minimum wage provisions of \u00a7 206(a). The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' case after finding that plaintiffs had failed to submit sufficient evidence to show that the deductions that the defendant-employer had taken\n   from the plaintiffs' paycheck for \"board, lodging, or other facilities\" under \u00a7 203(m) were unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Caro-Galvan\n   </em>\n   reversed the lower court's Rule 41(b) dismissal, finding that the district court had improperly shouldered the plaintiffs with the burden of proof instead of determining that\n   <em>\n    Mt.

In addition to reiterating an employer's duty to keep records of \"deductions\" from wages of employees under the general requirements of the FLSA, \u00a7 516.27(a) additionally requires that the employer \"maintain and preserve records substantiating the cost of furnishing each class of facility,\" i.e., maintain records to substantiate the costs incurred which are later applied to an employee's wage as a \"facility\" deduction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m). Section \u00a7 516.27(b) further requires than an employer maintain records showing on a workweek basis the deductions from a wage, if those deductions reduce the employee's remuneration below the applicable minimum hourly wage. In this way, \u00a7 516.27 requires more than just an employer's accounting of the deduction itself, but also that the employer \"go on the record\" with the exact costs that he believe substantiates that deduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Caro-Galvan\n   </em>\n   is ultimately unhelpful because it dealt with the recordkeeping requirements under \u00a7 516.27 for \"board, lodging, or facilities\" deductions from wages and further, these deductions were for items provided to the employees by the employer. Sullivan's theory of an FLSA violation does not turn on \"board, lodging, or facilities\" deductions as defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m) ; he instead argues that he has been forced to kick back part of his wages as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.35\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sullivan does not allege, nor could he reasonably, that Defendants have failed to comply with \u00a7 516.27's explicit recordkeeping requirements. Sullivan argues that Defendants have failed to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 516.2 &amp; 516.6 by not recording the expenses incurred by Sullivan delivering pizzas. Neither of those cited regulations requires Defendants to record Sullivan's actual expenses. On its face \u00a7 516.2(a)(10) requires Defendants to record \"[t]otal additions to or deductions from wages paid\" and does not even mention the employee's own expenses. Section 516.6(c) is a closer call, as it requires an employer to retain in regards to \"[r]ecords\n   of additions or deductions from wages paid: (1) [t]hose records relating to individual employees referred to in \u00a7 516.2(a)(10) and (2) All records used by the employer in determining the original cost, operating and maintenance cost, and depreciation and interest charges, if such costs and charges are involved in the additions to or deductions from wages paid.\" \u00a7 516.6(c)(2). Section 516.6(c)(2) does not purport to require that employers keep records of each employee's expenses, but rather the methodology used to arrive at the additions or deductions from wages paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sullivan additionally cite two other cases that ostensibly held that\n   <em>\n    Mt.

Despite Sullivan's representations to the contrary, neither\n   <em>\n    Villalpando\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Melgar\n   </em>\n   made such a holding based on \u00a7\u00a7 516.2 &amp; 516.6 alone.

While not preclusive,\n   <em>\n    Villalpando\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Melgar\n   </em>\n   's decision to rely on state recordkeeping law rather than \u00a7\u00a7 516.2 &amp; 516.6 tends to show that those DOL regulations do not require an employer to record their employees' business expenses-but rather the \"additions or deductions\" from wages paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For his\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   argument, Sullivan also relies on\n   <em>\n    Arriaga v. Florida Pacific Farms, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   's statement that \"there is simply no legal difference between an employer requiring a worker to have the tools before the first day of work, requiring the tools to be purchased during the first workweek, or deducting the cost of the tools from the first week's wages.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11393654\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/1228/#p1237\">\n    305 F.3d 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1237 (11th Cir. 2002). Sullivan argues that this statement somehow makes incumbent on Defendants the duty to track Sullivan's' actual expenses incurred operating his own vehicle. The quoted portion of\n   <em>\n    Arriaga\n   </em>\n   has nothing to do with recordkeeping obligations, and dealt with the interpretation of the calculation of a minimum wage violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Sullivan has not shown convincing authority to the Court that\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   burden shifting should apply by reason of Defendants' failure to record Sullivan's actual expenses. Additions and deductions that Defendants have made from Sullivan's paychecks are not the same as expenses that Sullivan incurred in operating his vehicles. The DOL surely could have specified such, especially considering the overwhelming burden this would impose on employers such as Defendants to gather and correlate the data for the different expenses that each employee would incur. Indeed, \u00a7 516.27's referral to \"board, lodging, or other facilities\" shows that in the event the DOL wishes for lawyers to record specific costs, it will say so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [an] employer ... shall maintain and preserve records substantiating the cost of furnishing each class of facility.... Separate records of the cost of each item\n   furnished to an employee need not be kept. The requirements may be met by keeping combined records of the costs incurred in furnishing each class of facility, such as housing, fuel, or merchandise furnished through a company store or commissary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20516.27\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Other persuasive authority buttresses the Court's conclusion that Defendants are not required to record Sullivan's actual expenses. Responding to a letter requesting an opinion regarding cost reimbursement for uniforms provided to a tipped employee without charge that were damaged in a non-work related context, the DOL stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   We note that the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20516.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(10) require an employer to maintain, for a period of two years, records showing the total additions to or deductions from wages paid each pay period. Thus, records documenting any deductions from wages of employees for purchasing employer-required uniforms must be maintained. Similarly, records documenting any deductions from wages of employees for voluntarily purchasing additional uniforms in excess of the number provided, as discussed above, must also be maintained.\n   <em>\n    However, if employees purchase excess uniforms on their own, rather than through the employer, no record of such private transactions need be kept under the FLSA.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Opinion Letter Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205483046\">\n    2008 WL 5483046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *3 (emphasis added). While not binding on the Court, it appears that the DOL's interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20516.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(10) is that where the employee incurs a cost on behalf of the employer, the employer need not record such private transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Simple reference to Sullivan's expert report shows the insurmountable burden Sullivan's proposed recordkeeping standard would impose on employers. In determining reasonable estimates for the former Opt-in Plaintiffs' vehicle costs, Sullivan's expert Paul Lauria only gathered average cost data from one type of car from each class of common vehicles, i.e., truck, SUV, sedan, or compact. Nor does Paul Lauria even attempt to use data from the former Opt-in Plaintiffs themselves, as \"standard methodology used within [his] industry does not rely on reports of costs actually incurred or reported after-the-fact by drivers.\" (Doc. 256-1 at 18.) According to Sullivan's own expert, it is not feasible or helpful to rely on a driver's report of his own costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Without clearer indication from the DOL, it does not appear that Defendants have violated recordkeeping requirements by failing to track Sullivan's actual expenses. Sullivan appears to argue that the finding that\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting applies is a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   finding that representative testimony can be used. This is an overstatement.\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

Clemens\n   </em>\n   burden shifting. Ultimately, for Sullivan to use representative testimony in the form of an expert report, the Court must ask whether the experiences of a subset of employees can be probative as to the experiences of all of them. Said another way, the Court must determine whether the representative samples used by Sullivan could be \"used to establish liability in an individual action.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1049\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court's holding that\n   <em>\n    Mt.

A categorical exclusion of that sort, however, would make little sense. A representative or statistical sample, like all evidence, is a means to establish or defend against liability. Its permissibility turns not on the form a proceeding takes-be it a class or individual action-but on the degree to which the evidence is reliable in proving or disproving the elements of the relevant cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1049\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately,\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   burden shifting and the use of representational evidence are two different issues. Representational evidence is appropriate where FLSA class members are similar such that \"each [former] class member could have relied on that sample to establish liability if he or she had brought an individual action. If the sample could have sustained a reasonable jury finding as to hours worked in each employee's individual action, that sample is a permissible means of establishing the employees' hours worked in a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1049\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1046-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Sullivan may no longer take advantage of the \"just and reasonable inference\" standard, the finding that\n   <em>\n    Mt.

SULLIVAN'S ARGUMENTS CONCERNING DEFENDANTS' REIMBURSEMENT RATE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sullivan additionally argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether \"Defendants used a vehicle-reimbursement methodology that is contrary to the law.\" (Doc. 235 at 60.) Sullivan primarily bases his argument on his interpretation of DOL Field Operations Handbook \u00a7 30c15, which according to him requires Defendants to either \"track, record, and reimburse their employees' actual vehicle expenses incurred on the job, or (2) reimburse their employees at the IRS standard business mileage rate.\" (Doc. 235 at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DOL Handbook \u00a7 30c15 states in whole:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Car expenses: employee's use of personal car on employer's business.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   In some cases it is necessary to determine the costs involved when employees use their cars on their employer's business in order to determine minimum wage compliance.

The IRS standard business mileage rate (currently 28 cents per mile) represents depreciation, maintenance and repairs, gasoline (including taxes), oil, insurance, and vehicle registration fees. In situations where the IRS rate changes during the investigation period, the applicable rates should be applied on a pro-rate basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    (b)\n   </strong>\n   The IRS standard business mileage rate may be used in lieu of actual costs for FLSA purposes\n   <em>\n    whether or not\n   </em>\n   the employee will be able to take a deduction on his or her tax return for the business use of the employee's car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (emphasis in original).

The text of \u00a7 30c15, \"the IRS standard business mileage rate ... may be used (in lieu of actual costs and associated recordkeeping) to determine or evaluate the employer's wage payment practices for FLSA purposes\" does not support Sullivan's interpretation. Nowhere does \u00a7 30c15 require Defendants to record Sullivan's actual costs, the section instead makes a general reference to \"associated recordkeeping.\" In this Opinion, the Court has already held the FLSA and DOL's regulations do not require employers to track employees' actual expenses incurred. To the extent \u00a7 30c15 purports to require employers to track their employees' actual expenses, it is not entitled to deference because it has no basis in the DOL's recordkeeping regulations. Nor does it make sense to require the Defendants to reimburse Sullivan at the IRS standard-as the Court has already held that an employer may either pay actual costs or use a reasonable approximation thereof. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 197 at 14-21.) The IRS rate is arbitrary and has no logical tie to the ultimate question in a minimum wage case-whether Sullivan was paid the federal minimum wage taking into account reimbursements he received for vehicle expenses he incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if Sullivan's interpretation was supported by the text of DOL Handbook \u00a7 30c15, which it is not, this interpretation is at odds with the DOL's regulations and the FLSA itself. No regulation or statute supports Sullivan's contention that if the Defendants do not keep records of Sullivan's actual costs or then Defendants' compliance with minimum-wage laws must be measured by the IRS standard business mileage rate. Defendants only have to pay Sullivan the minimum wage after deducting actual expenses and including reimbursements-not\n   the IRS standard business mileage rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Sullivan cites a number of non-binding cases for his interpretation of DOL Handbook \u00a7 30c15, none of which are particularly persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Zellagui v.

Section 778.217 Compared to Section 531.35\" appears to address multiple issues surrounding the expenses Sullivan can include in his calculations to determine whether Defendants have violated the minimum wage provision of the FLSA. Defendants first argue that because Sullivan did not incur certain vehicle expenses \"solely by reason of action taken for the convenience of his employer,\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.217\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that those expenses are not to be deducted from Sullivan's wages for the purposes of determining whether Defendants complied with the minimum wage provision of the FLSA. (Doc. 269-1 at 43.) Defendants state they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law to the extent Sullivan's Complaint can be construed as claiming a minimum wage violation in any FLSA workweek by virtue of expenses incurred \"solely by reason of action taken for the convenience of his employer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants then inexplicably change their argument to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.35\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to discuss the \"kickback\" standard in that section.

Plaintiff must be analyzed to determine whether the cost was incurred for an employer's\n   <em>\n    primary benefit.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 269-1 at 44.) Defendants appear to be arguing two different standards should apply to determine whether certain vehicle expenses should be used to calculate minimum wage violations the \"solely by reason of action taken for the convenience of his employer\" under \u00a7 778.217 and the \"primary benefit\" analysis under \u00a7 531.35.

While\n   <em>\n    Arriaga\n   </em>\n   dealt with \"other facilities,\" specifically the \"transportation furnished employees between their homes and work,\" this action does not involve the provision of \"other facilities\" as defined under \u00a7 531.32(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, this action deals with the provision by Defendants to Sullivan of wages, which Sullivan alleges are being kicked back to Defendants through Sullivan's payments for insurance, registration costs, vehicle depreciation, and repair costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants argue the evidence establishes that \"(1) some Plaintiffs did not own the vehicles used to deliver for a Defendant, (2) state laws required drivers to be insured and vehicles to be registered, (3) Plaintiffs paid for insurance and registration as part of their ordinary life, and (4) Plaintiffs paid insurance, registration, maintenance and repair costs for their primary benefit.\" (Doc. 269-1 at 44 (emphasis omitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to Sullivan, there are numerous issues of fact concerning the statements that Defendants argue they have established, and for that reason Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Defendants have shown that some former Opt-in Plaintiffs did not in fact own the vehicles that they used to deliver pizzas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 (purporting to list the former Opt-in Plaintiffs and other documents in the record which establish that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs do not own the vehicles used for pizza deliveries).) Defendants have likewise referenced statements by some former Opt-in Plaintiffs that finance companies required vehicle insurance, state law requires insurance and vehicles to be registered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 25-27.) None of these facts are helpful in answering the dispositive question of whether Defendants have shifted part of their business expenses to Sullivan. Thus questions of fact remain as to whether these costs or some portion of these costs have been shifted from the employer to employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    5. LACK OF RECORD EVIDENCE SHOWING MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants argue that summary judgement should be granted because Sullivan has failed to present any evidence that establishes violations of the FLSA's minimum wage provision. Defendants state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   No Plaintiff has disclosed, and there is no record evidence that would establish with regards to each Plaintiff for each workweek in which each Plaintiff alleges a minimum wage violation: (1) the number of hours worked by each Plaintiff, (2) the wages paid to each Plaintiff, (3) the reimbursement provided to each Plaintiff, and (4) the expenses allegedly incurred by each Plaintiff for a Defendant's primary benefit. On this basis alone, each Plaintiff's FLSA minimum wage claim(s) must be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) Defendants do not develop this argument, nor do they include citation to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   controlling or precedential authority on their failure-of-proof argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Sullivan relies on the report of his vehicle-costing expert, Paul Lauria, which used a representative model of the former class members and approximation to establish that Defendants failed to pay a minimum wage. In light of\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods\n   </em>\n   , the proper inquiry before the Court is whether the report is representative enough to be used by Sullivan individually:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   One way for respondents to show, then, that the sample relied upon here is a permissible method of proving classwide liability is by showing that each class member could have relied on that sample to establish liability if he or she had brought an individual action. If the sample could have sustained a reasonable jury finding as to hours worked in each employee's individual action, that sample is a permissible means of establishing\n   the employees' hours worked in a class action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594872\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1036/#p1049\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue of whether this report is so representative as to be usable in proving Sullivan's individual claim is not before the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants take too-narrow of a view of the use of class-wide testimony to establish liability, apparently arguing that it may never be used to show liability. Defendants' argument has no basis in the Federal Rules of Evidence or in\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Sullivan's report creates a dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants violated the FLSA by failing to pay Sullivan the minimum wage. Defendants' reimbursement to delivery drivers is done on a per-delivery basis. Sullivan nonetheless calculates that, for example, in 2016, Defendants' average annual\n   <em>\n    per-mile\n   </em>\n   reimbursement rate for its drivers was $ 0.27. Sullivan's expert Paul Lauria estimates that the average costs incurred by former class members delivering pizzas for Defendants in 2016 was $ 0.40 per mile. The per-mile difference in the Defendants' reimbursement, with what Sullivan's expert estimates was the actual cost incurred was $ 0.13. Sullivan, based on the data contained in Defendants' Checkout Reports, has calculated an average of sixteen (16) miles driven per hour worked. Multiplying the per-mile cost the former Opt-in Plaintiffs incurred, on average, with the amount of miles driven in an hour yields an average unreimbursed cost incurred by the former Opt-in Plaintiffs of $ 2.08 per hour-which in terms of the FLSA is the kickback allegedly given to Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   To determine whether this arrangement violates the FLSA minimum wage provision, the Court must then subtract the kickback amount from the per-hour wage given to drivers. According to Sullivan, the highest-paid delivery driver received $ 8.20 per hour, although most delivery drivers received much less. Subtracting the average kickback amount, $ 2.08, from the highest pre-kickback hourly wage reveals an actual hourly wage of $ 7.12 per hour. This amount is lower than the current federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour. This calculation does not take in to account that the vast majority of the former Opt-in Plaintiffs made only the federal minimum wage. The Court notes that while the parties offered argument on the sufficiency of evidence to show a class-wide violation, neither party offered calculations or argument to Sullivan specifically. The Court cannot assess whether Defendants' payments to Sullivan violated the FLSA, because the arguments and evidence are not properly before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants do not interact with Sullivan's damages calculations, but generally object to his use of expert testimony. They state that \"[Sullivan] point[s] to no underlying admitted or admissible evidence that supports the purported conclusions\" contained in Sullivan's report. (Doc. 258 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.) Defendants do not specify which conclusions in the report are not supported by admissible evidence. Nor does it matter that Paul Lauria's report is unsworn, as the Eleventh Circuit has held that parties' exhibits may be considered\n   for purposes of pretrial rulings so long as they can be reduced to admissible form at trial.\n   <em>\n    McMillian v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051507\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1573/#p1584\">\n    88 F.3d 1573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1584 (11th Cir. 1996). Summary judgment is not due to be granted to Defendants at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    6. LACK OF RECORD EVIDENCE TO ESTABLISH DAMAGES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Along with Defendants' argument above that Sullivan has failed to establish liability, Defendants also argue that summary judgment is due to be granted because Sullivan has \"not disclosed damages under [ Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 ], and the record does not contain evidence of damages as to each workweek in which each [former Opt-in Plaintiff] claims damages.\" (Doc. 269-1 at 48.) Defendants' argument that Sullivan must prove damages \"by the workweek,\" which they have repeated throughout this litigation, is troubling, because the data Defendants kept in their Checkout Reports is not by the workweek but biweekly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 279-1 (data in Defendants' Checkout Reports is stored biweekly).) Defendants' storage of this data, or Defendants' parent-company PJI International, Inc.'s storage, facially fails to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20516.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 516.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7), which requires:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (7) Hours worked each workday and total hours worked each workweek (for purposes of this section, a \"workday\" is any fixed period of 24 consecutive hours and a \"workweek\" is any fixed and regularly recurring period of 7 consecutive workdays)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Although Sullivan does not specifically raise this argument in regards to\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   burden shifting, Defendants' failure to keep\n   <em>\n    weekly\n   </em>\n   records of its drivers' hours is likely in violation of their recordkeeping obligations. The Court cannot now fault Sullivan for not being able to prove weekly violations when Sullivan does not have the needed information that Defendants were obliged to retain under law. To the extent that Sullivan must rely on the burden-shifting regime of\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens\n   </em>\n   , including the showing of hours worked by a \"just and reasonable inference\" because of Defendants' failure to keep\n   <em>\n    weekly\n   </em>\n   timesheets, he is so entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendants also make an argument relating to \"interrogatory responses,\" that are blank or incomplete. The Court has already dismissed a number of former Opt-in Plaintiffs for failure to respond to Defendants' interrogatories. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 232, 262.) Obviously, to the extent that Sullivan himself \"does not know\" a specific claimed expense, no jury could base an award of damages on\n   <em>\n    that interrogatory response.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants then make the converse argument, \"[t]o the extent [the former Opt-in] Plaintiffs' interrogatory answers reflect a \"weekly\" cost incurred, there is no evidence (and no allegation) that the amount reported is an actual amount expended or an estimation of each week's expenses incurred.\" The former Opt-in Plaintiffs' interrogatory answers constitute evidence, and Defendants do not explain why such answers are insufficient. Defendants wrote the interrogatory request for costs incurred, so they can hardly fault the former Opt-in Plaintiffs for responding to Defendants' subpoena and attempting to use that information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court does not understand Defendants' argument that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs' attested to response to the interrogatory is not itself evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    7. DEFENDANTS' SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH DEFENSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Sullivan asserts that Defendants have failed to show entitlement to specific affirmative\n   defenses raised in Defendants' Answer.

(Doc. 235-3 at 229.) While Saunders was unsure whether that form notice had been changed subsequent to 2011, it is nonetheless informative for the parties' dispute for the Court to \"parse\" the amounts stated. The form notice states: \"While you are 'on-the-road' and subject to earning tips, you are paid $ 4.00 per hour. [Defendants] take[ ] a tip credit in the amount of the difference between minimum wage and $ 4.00 per hour, not to exceed the value of tips actually received.\" (Doc. 235-36.) According to the notice, then, a driver would receive $ 4.00 per hour in \"cash wages.\" To find the \"tip credit\" applied to drivers, the notice states that the cash wage, $ 4.00 per hour, is subtracted from the federal minimum wage, $ 7.25 per hour. This yields an amount of $ 3.25 per hour which constitutes the \"tip credit\" portion of drivers' wages. In the bounds of this hypothetical, should drivers receive more than $ 3.25 per hour in tips, they would be entitled to retain those tips-but that excess is not counted towards compliance with federal minimum wage requirements because it is not a \"tip credit.\" On the other hand, if a driver receives less than $ 7.25 an hour in cash wage and actual tips, the employer must still pay the driver the difference to ensure the driver receives the federal minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   To the extent that Defendants may subsequently argue\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the amount of tips-\n   <em>\n    in excess\n   </em>\n   of the amount of (1) cash wage and (2) tip credit paid-can be used in a post hoc fashion to offset Sullivan's vehicle costs so that a minimum wage violation does not occur, that argument is foreclosed by \u00a7 203(m) and DOL regulations. The purpose of the tip credit reporting requirements is at least partially to ensure that Defendants \"go on the record\" with the amount of cash wages, tip credit, and non-tip-credit tips. Employers cannot be allowed to retroactively increase or decrease the tip credit amount that counts towards their minimum wage compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Perrin v. Papa John's International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   convincingly states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Although the Plaintiffs do not raise overtime claims in this litigation, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the relationship among the FLSA's tip credit, minimum wage, and overtime provisions highlights the importance of the FLSA's tip credit notice requirements. By limiting their tip credit to the difference between Plaintiffs' cash wage and the applicable minimum wage, and so notifying Plaintiffs, Defendants were permitted to similarly limit Plaintiffs' regular rate of pay for overtime purposes to minimum wage. Had Defendants taken a higher tip credit to offset against potential unreimbursed expenses, as they claim the DOL guidance documents allow, this would have increased Plaintiffs' regular rate of pay and, correspondingly, increased the amount Defendants owed Plaintiffs for overtime. Nothing in the DOL guidance documents, regulations, or the FLSA permits Defendants to claim a higher tip credit retroactively, in order to gain the benefit of an offset, without having notified Plaintiffs of the higher tip credit (and the correspondingly higher rate of pay for overtime purposes).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362891\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/114/707/#p721\">\n    114 F.Supp.3d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 (E.D.

Defendants state that they \"read the FLSA, read the regulations, read the Field Operations Manual, looked for cases, looked for DOL opinion letters, and consulted counsel\" to determine whether they were complying with the FLSA in reimbursing their drivers.

Saying that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs have \"knowledge of the factual allegations in the Complaint\" is a vacant statement unhelpful to focusing the Defendants' discovery efforts. If a statement that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs \"know about the civil action\" were sufficient under Rule 26(a)(1), then the disclosure requirements themselves would be meaningless. Sullivan's disclosures also indicate that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs have \"information concerning the hours they worked, the rates at which they were compensated, the job-related expenses they incurred, and the amounts they were reimbursed by Defendants for job-related expenses.\" These more specific disclosures likewise do not contain anything indicating that Defendants should have asked the former Opt-in Plaintiffs about complaints to their supervisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Sullivan argues that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Charvat v.

The facts of\n   <em>\n    Charvat\n   </em>\n   differ from this case.

Here, Defendants not only deposed many of the former Opt-in Plaintiffs, but asked for additional disclosures from the former Opt-in Plaintiffs so that they could better prepare for the depositions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 82.) Defendants had likewise requested leave to depose more than the limited number of Opt-in Plaintiffs they actually deposed; this Court certainly would have permitted Defendants to depose more of the former Opt-in Plaintiffs had Sullivan properly disclosed the above information. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Charvat\n   </em>\n   had knowledge of the affiant's identity because the affiant signed interrogatory responses on behalf of the defendant, thus qualifying for the exception in Rule 26(e)(1)(A) that the \"the additional or corrective information has ... otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.\" On the other hand, Sullivan included as allegations in his Complaint that many of the former Opt-in Plaintiffs \"frequently complained about Defendants' low reimbursement rates.\" (Doc. 58 \u00b6 46.)

Sullivan argues that there was substantial justification because he included a general allegation in his Complaint that the former Opt-in Plaintiffs \"frequently complained about Defendants' low reimbursement rates.\" Defendants have been deprived the chance to ask about such complaints during depositions, but also from testing the truth of those averments by speaking with the managers to whom the complaints were supposedly made. For these reasons, Sullivan's failure is also not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   This is not the first time that Defendants have objected to Sullivan's disclosure practices. Indeed, Defendants filed a Motion to Compel on March 31, 2017, arguing that Sullivan had disclosed \"virtually nothing related to his claims,\" (doc. 82 at 2), and that Defendants needed disclosures to prepare for the noticed depositions. Sullivan resisted Defendants' Motion, and ultimately the Court did not rule on the parties' specific dispute due to the vast number of discovery disputes in this action. Instead, the Court mooted the Motion following the end of discovery. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 281.) Sullivan clearly chose to not make more specific initial disclosures, and must suffer the consequences of not doing so. He cannot now argue the Defendants were not prejudiced when the Defendants so clearly indicated they needed more information to conduct depositions. Thus, Defendants' Motion to Strike (doc. 210) is due to be granted and the affidavits relied upon by Sullivan in opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (docs. 198-1-198-29) are stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Sullivan next argues that if Defendants reviewed the applicable DOL Field Operations Handbook as they purported to have done, they would have known that their reimbursement policy was in violation of the FLSA. Sullivan again points to the DOL Handbook \u00a7 30c15 for the proposition that Defendants willfully or recklessly disregarded the FLSA. As the Court has held above, the DOL Handbook is not binding law, but persuasive to the extent that it does not otherwise contradict the FLSA and DOL regulations. Defendants did not \"willfully\" violate the FLSA by not tracking driver's actual vehicle costs, because tracking of the driver's actual costs is not required under the FLSA. Nor must Defendants reimburse at the IRS rate, but must only reimburse their drivers to the extent that those drivers receive the federal minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   During the deposition of Defendants' corporate representative, Saunders explained that Defendants sought to \"reasonably approximate the cost of incremental miles of a pizza delivery driver.\" (Doc. 198-33 at 12.) This included reimbursements for \"regular repair and maintenance costs\" which factored in costs of driving like oils changes, tire replacements, \"brakes, a brake job, windshield wipers, and other general disposables.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) On the other hand, Defendants did not seek in the reasonable approximation of their delivery driver's costs to include financial charges, insurance, or registration costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Much of the parties' dispute comes down to undecided issues of law in the Eleventh Circuit-such as whether costs of driving like insurance and registration must be reimbursed. Given that there is no clear holding on those issues, the Court cannot say that Defendants' failure to include those costs was a willful or a reckless disregard of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Sullivan also states that Defendants had access to \"information showing they were in violation of the FLSA\" because Defendant PJ United's franchisor PJI International \"was sued in August 2009 for this exact same violation of the FLSA.\" (Doc. 198 at 25.) PJI settled that lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement,\n   <em>\n    Perrin v. Papa John's International, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 09-01335-AGF (E.D. Mo. Jan. 12, 2016). PJI's settlement, in a different judicial district, does not have any bearing on whether Defendants willfully violated the FLSA through their vehicle reimbursement methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Since Sullivan has not shown that Defendants acted willfully or recklessly, the appropriate statute of limitations is two rather than three years as to Sullivan's FLSA claims. The Court emphasizes that this holding extends to Sullivan alone, and should not be construed as reaching the other former Opt-in Plaintiffs that have been dismissed prior to the entry of this Memorandum of Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Defendants have not renewed their challenge to Sullivan's use of the expert report.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Indeed Defendants' argument is difficult to understand considering the multiple motions and months of arguments, with multiple telephone conferences and hearings wherein Defendants fought to receive interrogatory responses from the former Opt-in Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    Sullivan makes the disingenuous argument that Defendants' \u00a7 260 argument should be dismissed because the Defendants characterized the issue as \"unripe.\" (Doc. 256 at 49 (\"[P]ursuant to Defendants' admission that their affirmative defense 'is not ripe' that affirmative defense should be dismissed.\") (citation omitted) ). No reasonable reader viewing Defendants' argument would understand Defendants as asking for dismissal of their own affirmative defense. Defendants use of \"ripeness\" in context plainly asks this Court to forbear deciding the \u00a7 260 defense until liability has first been proved. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 271 at 41) (\"The issue of liquidated damages does not arise until a finding of liability has been made. [Sullivan]'s motion for summary judgment is facially theoretical at this point, and the issue of liquidated damages, if it is to be considered at all by the Court, is not ripe.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Defendants are required under \u00a7 516.2(a)(1) as employers to \"maintain and preserve payroll or other records containing ... with respect to each employee\" the employee's name and identifying number.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    Sullivan's Undisputed Fact 98 states \"Before the summer of 2016, which covers the vast majority of the recovery period, Defendants never used a tip credit to increase the wages of their delivery drivers above the minimum wage in states where in which the federal minimum wage applies.\" (Doc. 235 \u00b6 98.) In response to Undisputed Fact 98, Defendants states: \"Admitted that prior to summer of 2016 no operating company defendant took a tip credit to increase the wages of a Delivery Driver above the minimum wage but denied that the combination of cash wages paid and tip credit taken was limited to $ 7.25 per hour.... (Doc. 271 at 18.) Parsing this statement into its two constituent parts yields diametrically opposed responses: (1) \"[P]rior to summer of 2016 no operating company defendant took a tip credit to increase the wage of a Delivery Driver above the minimum wage\" and \"denied [to the extent] the combination of cash wages paid and tip credit taken was limited to $ 7.25 per hour.\" The first statement plainly asserts that prior to 2016 Defendants' cash wage with tip credit did not exceed the federal minimum wage; the second then appears to argue that the cash wage with tip credit did exceed minimum wage. (See also Doc. 271 at 18 (responses 98 and 100).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    Defendants have made no argument in their Response in Opposition to Summary Judgment in regards to this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
