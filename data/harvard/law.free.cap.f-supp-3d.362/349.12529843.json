He seeks to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the immigration court that ordered his deportation lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and thus that order was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, he argues that the immigration court only obtains jurisdiction when a valid Notice to Appear (NTA) is issued and, relying on\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), he argues that his NTA was not valid to confer jurisdiction because it did not provide a specific date, time, and place for him to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant's motion raises a number of interrelated issues which, as counsel for both parties acknowledged at a hearing, have not been directly addressed by the Fourth Circuit and on which district courts have expressed differing views. For the reasons set forth herein, the court concludes that the NTA-standing alone-was insufficient to serve as a charging document. At the very least, the court will assume that is true for purposes of this opinion. Regardless, the court does not believe that the deficiency in the NTA resulted in a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction such that the order was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court further concludes that, in order for Vasquez Flores to challenge the deficiency in the NTA as part of this criminal proceeding, he must satisfy the three requirements set forth in \u00a7 1326(d). The court finds, however, that he cannot satisfy the third requirement. For these reasons, discussed below, the court will deny the motion to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vasquez Flores is charged in a single-count indictment with illegal reentry after\n   deportation, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The deportation referenced in the indictment occurred in 2011. Specifically, on November 1, 2011, Vasquez Flores, who then was being held at Middle River Regional Jail, was served with a warrant for arrest of an alien. On the same date, Vasquez Flores was transported to Harrisonburg, Virginia, and served with an NTA, but that NTA did not contain a set hearing date or place, which was, and is, a common occurrence. The record is silent as to whether he subsequently received a Notice of Hearing. He was then detained in the custody of Homeland Security and remained in that custody (in several different locations) until he appeared before an immigration court in York, Pennsylvania, on November 23, 2011, and was ordered removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the order signed by the immigration judge (IJ) has the word \"Waived,\" indicating that Vasquez Flores waived his right to appeal (Dkt. No. 51-4), the audio recording of the proceedings does not reflect that his appeal rights were discussed or waived. Nonetheless, he did not appeal from the deportation order. He was removed from the United States on December 16, 2011, pursuant to a \"Warrant of Removal/Deportation.\" Then, on August 8, 2018, he was found in the United States and subsequently indicted in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The audio recording of Vasquez Flores's 2011 immigration proceeding is part of the record before this court. The recording lasts approximately eight minutes, and it contains the exchange between the IJ and Vasquez Flores, through his interpreter. Some portions of it are emphasized by the parties and worth noting. After Vasquez Flores confirmed that he was not legally present in the United States, the IJ asked him if he would voluntarily leave the United States if ordered to do so. Vasquez Flores said he would. The IJ told him that the fine was $ 5,000 and asked if anyone could pay that for him. He told the IJ that he had no money; it would have to be less. Then the IJ asked whether his girlfriend or anybody else would be willing to buy him an airline ticket to leave, and Vasquez Flores said no. Thereafter, the IJ ordered his deportation back to Honduras. The IJ then asked if he had any questions, and Vasquez Flores responded that he could pay a lower bail. The IJ told Vasquez Lopez he was not going to give a lower bail and now that the deportation order had been signed, \"you don't have a bail at all.\" The IJ then concluded with \"Good luck to you,\" and the recording ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For purposes of the motion before the court, there are two significant aspects of that recording. First, Vasquez Flores twice informed the IJ that he had some unknown amount of funds available to him. Vasquez Flores argues that this supports his assertion that the IJ should have allowed him to voluntarily depart, rather than being removed, and that if he had appealed the order of removal, he could have been given the opportunity to voluntarily depart. Critically, a voluntary departure does not qualify as a removal or deportation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, and as the United States concedes, the recording does not contain any discussion by the IJ concerning Vasquez Flores's rights to appeal from his deportation order, nor does it contain any statement by Vasquez Flores that he was waiving his appeal rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As noted, Vasquez Flores's primary argument, relying on\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , is that the NTA is invalid because it failed to specify a date and time for his hearing. From there, he argues that because the NTA is the charging document in an immigration case and it confers jurisdiction on the immigration court, an invalid NTA means that the immigration court never had subject-matter jurisdiction. He then relies on cases in other contexts in which courts held that any \"ultra vires\" orders from agencies or orders from a tribunal without subject-matter jurisdiction are void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, he contends that this lack of subject-matter jurisdiction alone is enough to dismiss the indictment because, without any valid order of removal, he cannot be convicted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As an alternative argument, he asserts that, even if he were required to satisfy the three \u00a7 1326(d) requirements for a collateral challenge to a deportation order, he can do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The United States responds that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding is narrow and limited to its context, and, as such, the NTA here was valid to confer jurisdiction on the immigration court under the regulations governing NTAs as charging documents. It further argues that, even if the NTA was invalid, that does not result in a loss of\n   <em>\n    subject-matter\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction, so as to render the order necessarily void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   Finally, it argues that, no matter how Vasquez Flores's challenge is characterized-and even if it is considered a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction-he must still satisfy the three \u00a7 1326(d) requirements in order to raise that challenge in this criminal proceeding. He cannot do so, according to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , a number of district courts have grappled with motions similar to the one before the court. Notably, each side's arguments (or portions of them) can find support in some of those decisions, many of which are cited in the parties' briefing. The court has reviewed many of those cases and has also considered some cases decided after the briefing or hearing in this case, several of which are cited herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    and Its Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   was an immigration appeal that involved a statutory remedy known as cancellation of removal and application of the \"stop-time rule.\" That cancellation is available to some nonpermanent residents who have \"been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). The \"stop-time rule\" provides that the period of continuous physical presence is deemed to end \"when the alien is served a notice to appear under section 1129(a) of this title.\" \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court acknowledged an INA regulation that required a time and place to be included only \"where practicable,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but it refused to allow that regulation to trump the plain language of the statute describing the contents of an NTA. Instead, the Supreme Court held that an NTA that does not specify when and where the removal hearing will take place \"is not a 'notice to appear under 1229(a)' and therefore does not trigger the stop-time rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   Court described the question before it as a \"distinct\" one that included a reference to the stop-time rule,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , its reasoning and the language used elsewhere in the opinion suggest that an NTA under \u00a7 1229(a) is categorically deficient absent a time and place for the hearing, and that it was applying that general holding to the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere\n   in the statutory section, including as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \u00a7 1229(a)\"). Thus, it appears that the holding is applicable outside the narrow scope of the stop-time rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nonetheless, the United States argues that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   turned on the explicit reference in the \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A)\"stop-time rule\" to \u00a7 1229(a)'s definition of what constitutes a \"notice to appear.\" Unlike the \"stop-time rule,\" its argument continues, the regulations governing the vesting of jurisdiction in an immigration court do not expressly reference \u00a7 1229(a)'s definition of a \"notice to appear.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1003.15\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1). Instead, the regulations concerning jurisdiction do not contain any reference to \u00a7 1229(a). From this, the United States argues that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here. This reasoning finds support in some district court decisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dec. 17, 2018), the court addressed defendant's argument under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   that the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to enter a removal order because his NTA failed to state the date and time of the removal hearing. The court reasoned that the defendant had waived any challenge to the validity of the proceeding where he \"knowingly and voluntarily conceded his removability and relinquished a host of rights, including his right to be present at, or even have, a removal hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 294,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206617703\">\n    2018 WL 6617703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.

The\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   court explained in some detail why it did not find a deficient NTA to result in a lack of\n   <em>\n    subject-matter\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction, citing several persuasive reasons for its conclusion, and the court again agrees with its reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529212\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/428/#p437\">\n    355 F.Supp.3d at 437-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206834363\">\n    2018 WL 6834363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7. In part, this turns on the nature of subject-matter jurisdiction in federal courts, which necessarily renders orders from a court lacking it void. The explanation of the\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   court on this point is worth quoting at length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [D]efendant's reliance on cases involving the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def. Mot. to Dismiss Indictment [Dkt. No. 22] 10 (\"[A]ny action by a court without subject-matter jurisdiction is 'ultra vires' and therefore void.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The metes and bounds of a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction are governed by the Constitution's vesting of the federal judicial power,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, and by congressional grants of jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By analogy, an agency's subject-matter jurisdiction would stem from congressional grants of authority to act in a particular arena. Yet in this case defendant relies not on a congressional limitation, but rather on a regulation promulgated by the agency itself. In that sense, section 1003.14(a) is more akin to a federal court's local rules, which (like the regulations at issue here) are the product of congressionally delegated gap-filling authority,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(1), but which in no way affect the federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the best reading of section 1003.14(a) is that although it imposes a procedural requirement on immigration authorities' initiation of removal proceedings, that requirement is not \"jurisdictional\" in the formal sense, and a defect in a notice to appear does not necessarily render a resulting deportation order void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206834363\">\n    2018 WL 6834363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court agrees with this reasoning.

No. 58 at 1.) Moreover, as noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at note 1, the United States has conceded that it cannot establish waiver by clear and convincing evidence. Based on this, the court concludes that the first two prongs of the test are satisfied, related to exhaustion of administrative remedies and judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Vasquez Flores argues two different bases for establishing \"fundamental unfairness.\" The first hinges on his subject-matter jurisdiction argument. Specifically, he argues that the deficient NTA did not confer jurisdiction on the immigration court, and, had the IJ correctly found that he did not have jurisdiction, Vasquez Flores would not have been ordered removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reasons that the court has already discussed, it concludes that the immigration court did, in fact, have subject-matter jurisdiction. Thus, this argument cannot form the basis for Vasquez Flores's satisfaction of the third \u00a7 1326(d) requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   His second ground of prejudice is connected not to the NTA, but to the failure of the IJ to advise him of his appellate rights. Specifically, he argues that, had he been properly advised of his appeal rights, he could have appealed. On appeal, his argument continues, there was a \"reasonable probability that he would not have been deported\" but would have been allowed to voluntarily depart instead. He focuses on the fact that he told the IJ he was willing to depart and could pay a lesser fine than $ 5,000, and that the IJ could have imposed only a $ 500 fine. With a lesser payment, he contends, there is a reasonable probability that he could have paid that amount and had money left over for a plane ticket, and so the Board of Immigration Appeals would have allowed him to voluntarily depart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As noted previously, to establish the third requirement of \u00a7 1326(d) -fundamental unfairness-Vasquez Flores must show that his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding and that he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court assumes, without deciding, that the failure to advise him of his appeal rights constituted a due process violation. But he still must show prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court has carefully considered the parties' arguments on the issue of prejudice, which were fleshed out during the hearing. This included a threshold dispute about the appealability of the denial of voluntary departure, governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c, and appeals therefrom, which are limited to some degree by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court assumes, for purposes of this opinion and in defendant's favor, that the IJ determined that Vasquez Flores did not qualify under the last prong of the statute allowing voluntary departure, a ruling that would be appealable to both the BIA and to a federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court nonetheless does not find a \"reasonable probability\" that, had he appealed and raised the issue, he would have been allowed to voluntarily depart. To show an entitlement to voluntary departure, Vasquez Flores had to \"establish[ ] by clear and convincing evidence that [he] has the means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1)(D). This is a burden that he does not have a reasonable probability of establishing based on the record. First of all, while he indicated that he could pay less than a $ 5,000 bond, he did not indicate how much he could pay and certainly did not state that he could pay the minimum bond the IJ could have imposed, which was $ 500.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3). Rather, at one point he stated that he had\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   money. Perhaps more significantly, though, he unequivocally told the judge that no one would pay for his ticket back to Honduras. Based on the record before the IJ, then, there was no evidence that he had the means to depart, let alone clear and convincing evidence. To the contrary, the evidence was primarily that he did not have such means. Accordingly, he has not shown a \"reasonable probability\" that the result on appeal would have been different. He therefore fails to establish that his prior order of deportation was invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.

At least some circuits have held that, under the Real ID Act of 2005, courts have appellate jurisdiction over questions of law in denials of discretionary relief (such as statutory eligibility), but do not have jurisdiction over a decision based purely on an IJ's discretion.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corro-Barragan v.

Thus, interpreting the IJ's decision as a discretionary one could render it immune from judicial review and thus invalidate any claim of prejudice. In light of the court's conclusion that Vasquez Flores cannot show prejudice, the court will assume the option more favorable to Vasquez Flores on this threshold issue of the availability of judicial review.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
