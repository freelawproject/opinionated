No. 183 at 7 (Response).) Plaintiff argues that Claim 14 \"improves upon the content-distribution and retrieval mechanisms present in conventional Internet search engine technology\" that search pre-indexed webpages by keywords. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 10.) The '117 Patent's purported admissions identified by Defendants, when read in context, emphasize that the elements of, the problem to be solved by, and the solution set forth in Claim 14 exist only in a networked computer environment as exemplified by the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 185 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As to Defendants comparing the subject matter of Claim 14 to brick-and-mortar stores or libraries, Plaintiff argues that Defendants' analogy ignores the computer network environment and specific software operations set forth in Claim 14. (Dkt. No. 183 at 9-11.) Plaintiff also argues that the '177 Patent describes how its claimed invention arose due to \"the recent adoption and acceptance of online networks such as the Internet,\" and thus, Defendants' asserted abstract idea-developing a personal collection of online content-is not \"long prevalent.\" (Dkt. No. 185 at 2 (citing '177 Patent at 1:33-35).) As such, Plaintiff argues that, similar to the patent-eligible\n   claims in\n   <em>\n    McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Claim 14 recites a specific, patent-eligible process for \"storing and retrieving information in a computer network using a distributed, portal-based architecture that was not previously used.\" (Dkt. No. 183 at 11-12 (citing\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/\">\n    837 F.3d 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2016) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having considered the evidence and arguments presented, the Court finds that Claim 14 is not directed to an abstract idea. The Court is not persuaded that the \"apparatus for distributing content through one or more distributed information access points to a centralized access point of a user\" set forth in Claim 14 is comparable to Defendants' analogy of selecting and donating books from and to a library or store. The analogy ignores the language of Claim 14, and the '177 Patent's specification, which provides a specific and distinct system for identifying and distributing information that includes a centralized access point that \"provide[s] the user with access to content chosen by or for the user\" and \"enable[s] a user to manage any content contributed,\" at least one distributed information access point that \"allow[s] a user to choose content for addition to their centralized access point,\" and an administrative interface \"operative to create groupings of content into one or more distributed information access point(s).\" '177 Patent at 55:4-27, 55:35-37. Contrary to Defendants' focus on the abstractness of developing a personalized access point, Claim 14 is directed to using the selection and contribution of content by the users to their respective personalized access points to distribute content through a network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, although the '177 Patent invokes \"textbooks and libraries\" when discussing the scope of information storage and retrieval challenges associated with online networks (e.g., the Internet), the '177 Patent also notes that existing techniques for finding and accessing desired information over a network \"fall[s] far short of meeting the needs of information providers and information users.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '177 Patent at 1:30-52. Specifically, the '177 Patent identifies keyword-based search engines that require pre-indexing of Internet content and explains the need \"to provide improvements in the way demand for information is identified, content is generated in response to a defined demand, and the way in which users access desired information.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1:65-2:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, Defendants' proffered cases involving abstract ideas for transmitting, labeling, or indexing information for subsequent retrieval are distinguishable. Unlike ineligible claims that merely \"collect[ ], organiz[e], and display ... information on a generic display device,\" Claim 14 recites \"a specific improvement to the way computer[ ] [networks] ... operate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Interval Licensing LLC v.

Specifically, the network architecture set forth in Claim 14 \"provide[s] the user with access to content chosen by or for the user\" based on the contribution of content to the user's personalized access point and the personalized access points of users on the network, an arguably unconventional process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '177 Patent at 55:4-27, 55:35-37;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:46-48, 30:36-45, 46:18-20;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re TLI Commc'ns LLC Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p614\">\n    823 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (Fed.

For example, Claim 14 requires that \"the centralized access point is further operative to enable a user to manage any content contributed by them.\" The parties did not dispute the construction of \"content contributed\" set forth in Claim 14 before this Court, and thus the term is afforded its plain and ordinary meaning.
