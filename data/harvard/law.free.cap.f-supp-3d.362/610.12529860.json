BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ronald Thomas worked as a brake mechanic at Stuart's Brake Shop in Little Rock and North Little Rock for approximately twelve years, where he was required to blow out brake drums with compressed air, grind down new brakes to the appropriate shapes and sizes, and sweep floors. Thomas Dep. 8:9-25, 10:16-24, 12:9-22, 13:18-25, 17:13-21, 20:24-21:6, Doc. No. 243-1. He was also in the shop while other mechanics performed similar tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11:14-24, 13:5-17, 17:22-18:1. Blowing out brake drums, grinding brakes, and sweeping the floors forced brake dust into the air, which Thomas breathed. Thomas Dep. 12:17-13:8; 19:3-12, 21:7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the time in question, many brake products contained asbestos, which has been linked to various diseases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holstein Rep. at 6-7, 17, Doc. No. 247-1. Plaintiff Michael Thomas, Ronald's son, is bringing this lawsuit in his personal capacity and as executor of Ronald's estate, alleging that Ronald died as a result of the mesothelioma he contracted from breathing\n   in asbestos fibers from the brakes manufactured and sold by Ford, Honeywell, Abex, Genuine Parts, and NAPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, Doc. No. 173. Plaintiff is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for defendants' failure to warn; negligent design or defect; breach of implied warranty; gross negligence; and willful, wanton, and reckless conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-67.

LEGAL STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

To prove the asbestos-containing brakes caused Ronald Thomas's harm, plaintiff must show that: (1) Thomas was exposed to asbestos-containing brakes made by one or more of the defendants; (2) his asbestos exposure was frequent; and (3) his injury was caused by defendants' products, and not from some other source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavers v.

Ford moves for summary judgment claiming plaintiff: (1) needs expert testimony to prove his claim; (2) cannot prove Ford's products were capable of causing mesothelioma ; (3) cannot prove Ronald Thomas was exposed to Ford products with sufficient frequency, regularity, and proximity; (4) cannot prove a design defect because none of his experts will establish that Ford's products were defective; and (5) cannot prove a breach of warranty because plaintiff failed to notify Ford of this claim before filing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    1. Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ford's motion to exclude plaintiff's experts was denied. Doc. No. 299. Consequently, Ford's motion for summary judgment for failure to provide expert testimony is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2. General Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether plaintiff can meet the general causation requirement. Although\n   Ford asserts that its products could not cause mesothelioma, Ford's Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 4, Doc. No. 198, plaintiff's expert, Edwin Holstein, testified that the asbestos in Ford's brakes causes mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Holstein Dep. 58:18-25, 62:15-63:5, 116:10-17:1, Doc.

Thomas Dep. 137:1-4. He installed Ford brakes from a labeled box and his employer bought brakes from a Ford dealership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   15:15-19, 137:8. He stated that ten to fifteen brake jobs per day were performed at the Stuart's location in Little Rock and approximately six were performed per day at the North Little Rock location. Thomas Dep. 123:15-22. In that Thomas performed many of these jobs himself during his twelve years at Stuart's, there is sufficient evidence to create a dispute of fact as to whether he was exposed to an asbestos-containing Ford product with sufficient frequency, regularity, and proximity to meet his burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513720\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/349/550/\">\n    79 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   369 ; Thomas Dep. 8:12-14, 17:14-21.

Further, it was foreseeable that the work performed by the brake mechanics would create brake dust that the mechanics would breathe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thomas Dep. 23:2-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ford argues that, as a matter of law, plaintiff cannot prove Ford's breaks had a defective design because plaintiff has failed to show that a safer alternative design existed. Ford's Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 9. Such a showing, however, is not required.\n   <em>\n    Boerner v.

Ark. Jan. 14, 2008). Therefore, summary judgment is denied on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    5. Breach of Warranty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Summary judgment is granted to Ford on plaintiff's breach of warranty claim because plaintiff failed to notify Ford of Thomas's injury and plaintiff's intent to seek damages for breach of warranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-2-607\">\n    Ark.

Although this language is found in the notes to the statute, and not in the statute itself, the Arkansas Supreme Court looks to the official comments when interpreting Arkansas's Uniform Commercial Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cotner v. Int'l Harvester Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1616724\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/260/885/\">\n    260 Ark. 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1616724\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/260/885/\">\n    545 S.W.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630 (1977).

Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Honeywell's motion to exclude the testimony of plaintiff's experts, Arnold Brody and Holstein, was denied. Doc. No. 299.

Therefore, the only question unique to Honeywell is whether Thomas was exposed to Honeywell brakes with sufficient frequency, regularity, and proximity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513720\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/349/550/\">\n    79 S.W.3d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bendix brakes are Honeywell products. Honeywell's Statement of Facts \u00b6 7, Doc.

Thomas Dep. 87:22-88:4. He stated he was sure he was present when Bendix brakes were being ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   90:4-6. Bill Parsons, who worked with Thomas, testified that Parsons used Bendix brakes frequently. Parsons Dep. 18:24-19:7, Doc. No. 243-2. Parsons said the shop might replace a thousand brake shoes a week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   19:17-20:7. Reviewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Thomas, a reasonable juror could infer that Thomas was exposed to Bendix brakes and that his exposure was a cause of his mesothelioma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chavers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1513720\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark/349/550/\">\n    79 S.W.3d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    2.

This is sufficient to create a dispute of fact as to whether the grinding of new Abex brakes caused Thomas's mesothelioma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Abex, however, distinguishes between Thomas's exposure to new brakes that Thomas could clearly identify as Rayloc brand, and old brakes Thomas removed from cars, which bore no brand identification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Abex's Br.

Therefore, summary judgement is granted on any claim for liability against Abex that is rooted in its market share. Evidence has been presented, however, that Stuart's had repeat customers and that its brake mechanics installed Rayloc brakes on the cars of repeat customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parsons Dep. 29:17-21. Testimony that attempts to quantify the use of Abex's products by showing that brake mechanics removed brakes from cars of repeat customers that the mechanics knew were Rayloc brakes is not rooted in market share theory and is permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Summary judgment is denied on the issue of punitive damages, and defendants' motions to bifurcate are denied. Although Ford argues that Michigan law should apply on the issue of punitive damages, it does not argue against applying Arkansas law to the issue of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ford's Br.

When deciding which state's law applies in tort cases, Arkansas courts first consider \"which [s]tate has the most significant relationship to the action and the parties\" and then analyze five factors: \"(1) predictability of results, (2) maintenance of interstate and international order, (3) simplification of the judicial task, (4) advancement of the forum's government interests, and (5) application of the better rule of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276980\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/836/#p841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276980\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/836/#p841\">\n    at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Arkansas has the more significant relationship to the case and the parties because Thomas was injured in Arkansas and Ford did business in Arkansas. Thomas Dep. 8:2-6, 15:15-24. Although Ford's\n   principal place of business is in Michigan, Thomas had no relationship to Michigan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 8. Further, Arkansas's governmental interest in protecting its citizens from harmful out-of-state products is furthered by applying Arkansas law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

The motion is denied because Thomas presented some evidence evincing that defendants were aware that the asbestos fibers in their brakes were harmful but that defendants continued to distribute those brakes anyway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Taylor Dep. 65:4-66:25, 68:1-24, Doc.

The notices of adoption [219, 228] are recognized. The motions for summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages and motions to bifurcate [Doc. Nos. 204, 211, 221, 223] are denied.
