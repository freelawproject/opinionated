(Docket Entry (\"D.E.\") 1.) Before the Court is Jones' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (D.E. 71.) Plaintiff has responded to the motion, (D.E. 72), and Defendant submitted a reply, (D.E. 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This protracted lawsuit, which has witnessed numerous procedural twists and legal turns, has been considered at every level of the federal court system over its four-year lifespan. Because of its present procedural posture, the Court will briefly set forth the facts as characterized by Sanders in her complaint, along with subsequent events:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 22, 2013, officers of the 24th Judicial Task Force, including Jones, utilized a confidential informant and initiated a controlled drug buy from Sanders using a phone number allegedly assigned to the Plaintiff. The event was captured on video. (D.E. 1 at \u00b6 6-8.) Although the video did not show Sanders' involvement due to its poor quality, the written report of the exchange erroneously attributed the drug seller's phone number and car as belonging to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8, 12-13.) Despite her lack of involvement in the purchase, Sanders was indicted for criminal conduct related to the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) After the grand jury returned a true bill in reliance on the inaccurate statements, Plaintiff was forced to post bail and hire counsel to defend the charges, which were ultimately dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sanders sued Jones in this Court for damages based upon claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as related state law causes of action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24-41.) All allegations were subsequently dismissed by the Court except the \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim, which was based on a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (D.E. 33.) On interlocutory appeal, the Sixth Circuit reversed this Court's denial of summary judgment on the remaining claim.\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

(D.E. 62.) Jones filed a suggestion of death, (D.E. 63), and on August 14, 2018, the Court granted the motion of Sanders' administratrix to substitute the Estate of Amy Sanders as the Plaintiff, (D.E. 66). During a subsequent status conference, the Court requested briefing by the parties on the issue of whether, under Tennessee law, the \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim abated upon the death of Sanders. (D.E. 70.) Thereafter, Jones\n   moved to dismiss the lawsuit, to which Plaintiff responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court's distillation of\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   generated three premises upon which it relied in its decision. \"First, the characterization of \u00a7 1983 as a cause of action is itself a question of federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1754045\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/827/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 294 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 269-70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"Second, all \u00a7 1983 claims must be characterized in the same way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 271-75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) This, the Court reasoned, is because not all \u00a7 1983 claims had state law equivalents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a uniform classification would avoid \"uncertainty and time-consuming litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 295 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 272-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"Third, \u00a7 1983 actions are best characterized as personal injury actions,\" because \"the evils that Congress addressed in the Civil Rights Act of 1871 sounded in tort and are most analogous in the main to tort actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 277, 280,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). By adopting this reasoning, the Sixth Circuit impliedly rejected the methodology employed by other courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Applying this reasoning to the Fourth Amendment case before it, the Sixth Circuit held that Ohio's survivorship statute allowed the plaintiff's case to go forward.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/#p280\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court only referenced Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2305.21, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In addition to the causes of action which survive at common law, causes of action for mesne profits, or injuries to the person or property, or for deceit or fraud, also shall survive; and such actions may be brought notwithstanding the death of the person entitled or liable thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, it did not consider the effect of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2311.21, which reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Unless otherwise provided, no action or proceeding pending in any court shall abate by the death of either or both of the parties thereto, except actions for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, for a nuisance, or against a judge of a county court for misconduct in office, which shall abate by the death of either party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thus, arguably, as in Tennessee, state law claims for malicious prosecution in Ohio may indeed abate upon the death of either party. The\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   holding did not disturb\n   the abatement of these purely state causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Applying the Sixth Circuit's reasoning to Plaintiff's case, Sanders' action for malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983, which under\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   is characterized as a personal injury claim, survives the death of the Plaintiff. Accordingly, Defendant's arguments fail and his motion to dismiss is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 24th day of January 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The federal policy for \u00a7 1983 cases includes: \"(1) compensation of persons for injuries caused by deprivations of their federal rights and (2) deterrence of deprivation of rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Frontier Ins.
