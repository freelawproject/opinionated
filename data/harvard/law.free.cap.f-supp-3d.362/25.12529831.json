In that role, Dr. Galdes oversaw several Biogen groups, including the Protein Pharmaceutical Development (\"PPD\") group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jessica Ballinger was employed by Biogen as a Senior Director responsible for PPD. She reported directly to Dr. Galdes. Andrew Weiskopf was employed by Biogen as a Director in PPD and reported to Ms. Ballinger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Andrea Sinclair was employed in the Human Resources (\"HR\") department at Biogen and was the HR employee primarily assigned to provide HR support to the PPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff,\n   <strong>\n    Dr. Mark Brader,\n   </strong>\n   worked for Biogen from October 8, 2007 until November 6, 2015. He was employed as a Principal Scientist in PPD. Dr. Weiskopf was his direct supervisor from July 2013 until his employment with Biogen ended. Dr. Brader's\n   previous supervisor was Mariana Dimitrova.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biogen's Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Biogen provides its employees with a document entitled \"Values in Action Code of Business Conduct\" (\"Code\"). The document instructs employees to \"[p]romptly report concerns about possible violations of laws, regulations, this Code and policies to your supervisor\" as one of every employee's responsibilities. Responsibilities for managers include that \"[n]o matter who the allegation involves, [the manager] must report it without exception.\" The Code also states, in its \"Harassment-free workplace\" section, that all employees \"have the right to work in an environment that is free from intimidation and harassment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Biogen also provides its employees with a Non-Discrimination and Non-Harassment Policy (\"Policy\"). The Policy states that \"Biogen is committed to providing a workplace free of unlawful harassment and discrimination. The document provides that \"[s]upervisors and managers must immediately report any alleged or perceived incidents or discrimination or harassment (whether or not the incident occurs in his or her area of responsibility).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Both the Code and the Policy set forth a non-retaliation policy. The Code states that Biogen does not tolerate \"[t]hreatening, intimidating, coercing, or retaliating against those who report their concerns - anywhere, anytime, for any purpose.\" The Policy provides that \"Biogen will not knowingly permit any retaliation against any employee who complains in good faith, of discrimination or harassment or who participates in an investigation. It is a violation of this Policy, and unlawful, to retaliate against [such] employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Biogen has a separate \"ADA Non-Discrimination and Accommodation Policy\" (\"ADA Policy\") that states \"Biogen is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and it is the Company's policy to hire, train, promote, compensate, and administer all employment practices without regard to disability. Discrimination against job applicants or employees because they are disabled is prohibited and will not be tolerated by Biogen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Biogen also maintains a Global Investigations Protocol (\"GIP\") setting forth its \"procedures for the reporting, evaluation, and tracking of matters that potentially require internal investigation by Biogen Idec or its affiliates and sets forth guidelines for the conduct and documentation of resulting internal investigations.\" The GIP \"applies to matters involving potential violations of law, Biogen Idec's Code of Conduct, or other significant internal policies by Biogen Idec personnel or individuals acting on Biogen Idec's behalf.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Brader's June 18, 2014 Presentation and its Feedback\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 18, 2014, Dr. Brader gave a presentation to the PPD group. The presentation was a technical review showcasing the work he and his team had accomplished over the previous years. Dr. Brader's presentation was mostly comprised of slides that he had previously presented both internally at Biogen and externally. Dr. Brader was especially focused on this presentation because while he was on leave for back surgery, Dr. Weiskopf informed him that TD senior management would be in attendance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the same time, Dr. Brader was aware that he was being considered for a promotion to director.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the presentation, Dr. Brader's former manager, Dr. Dimitrova, expressed some concerns to Dr. Weiskopf about Dr.\n   Brader's presentation. Dr. Weiskopf shared Dr. Dimitrova's feedback with Dr. Brader during a meeting on Friday, June 20, 2014. Dr. Brader claims that Dr. Weiskopf made \"objectionable statements\" that he \"couldn't understand\" about his presentation when they met, calling his presentation \"terrible,\" and stating that Dr. Brader's presentation had insulted PPD and Dr. Dimitrova and was used inappropriately to present Dr. Brader's personal views and agenda. Dr. Brader further states that Dr. Weiskopf's comments were absurd and nonsensical, leaving him bewildered and confused by this sudden and malicious criticism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Brader asked Dr. Weiskopf to meet to discuss the feedback several times between their initial meeting on June 20, 2014 and June 30, 2014, and, in fact, met with Dr. Weiskopf multiple times during this period. Dr. Brader characterized Dr. Weiskopf's feedback with respect to his June 18, 2014 presentation as \"harassment.\" He testified that Dr. Weiskopf's feedback and conduct was offensive because it insulted him and was, in his view, \"blatantly and obviously false.\" When he was asked what he thought was Dr. Weiskopf's motivation, Dr. Brader testified that he did not know and that he could only \"speculate\" as to Dr. Weiskopf's motivation. He also testified that he was unaware of Ms. Ballinger's motivations during this time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Brader's Concerning Behavior\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the weeks following his presentation, Dr. Brader's wife began to notice negative changes in his mental health. On Sunday, June 29, 2014, Dr. Brader ran into Ms. Ballinger and her husband, who is also employed at Biogen, during a walk in Lexington, where they both live. Ms. Ballinger was concerned that Dr. Brader was not \"himself\" during this interaction and it appeared there was \"something not right\" with him. Later that day, Dr. Brader emailed both Dr. Weiskopf and Ms. Ballinger seeking to meet further with them about the feedback he had received regarding his presentation. Based on her encounter and the emails Dr. Brader later sent to both Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf, Ms. Ballinger became concerned about Dr. Brader. The next day, Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf informed Ms. Sinclair about their concerns with Dr. Brader's behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    5.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meetings on June 30, 2014\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Brader met with Dr. Weiskopf on the morning of June 30, 2014. This meeting was requested by Dr. Brader. During the meeting, Dr. Brader asked Dr. Weiskopf to \"stop harassing\" him and, specifically, objected to Dr. Weiskopf's criticisms of his June 18, 2014 presentation. When Dr. Weiskopf would not agree that his criticisms of Dr. Brader were \"inappropriate or unfair,\" Dr. Brader asked two colleagues to join the meeting. Dr. Brader indicated to the two colleagues that he and Dr. Weiskopf were having \"a disagreement about [his] performance or [his] technical presentation, a disagreement that [he was] having difficulty understanding,\" and he wanted their help in \"understand[ing] what [Dr. Weiskopf was] trying to communicate to [him].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Brader claims that he did not feel safe during this meeting because Dr. Weiskopf would not change his criticisms of his presentation. Dr. Brader testified that while Dr. Weiskopf did not make any movement that made him fear for his physical safety, his \"body language,\" \"hostile persona,\" and unwillingness to change his view on Dr. Brader's presentation made Dr. Brader feel unsafe and \"very concerned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After meeting with Dr. Weiskopf, Dr. Brader emailed Ms. Ballinger. Shortly thereafter, around 2:30 PM, Dr. Brader\n   met with Ms. Ballinger at the Starbucks on Biogen's campus. Ms. Ballinger described Dr. Brader as \"agitated\" and jumbled and noticed that he kept putting his hands in and out of his pockets. Dr. Brader told Ms. Ballinger that he considered Dr. Weiskopf's criticisms of his presentation as harassment, including the \"way [Dr. Weiskopf] chose to conduct [his] performance review and the way in which he communicated to [him].\" Dr. Brader testified that he did not know the reason, motivation, or basis for what he characterized as Dr. Weiskopf's \"harassment\" of him. During the meeting, Ms. Ballinger asked Dr. Brader why he did not feel safe, but Dr. Brader could not provide her with a clear response. After the meeting, Ms. Ballinger reported on what had happened during the meeting to Ms. Sinclair. At Ms. Sinclair's request, Ms. Ballinger emailed Dr. Brader to confirm information on the employee assistance program and to connect him with Ms. Sinclair to follow-up on any concerns about feeling safe at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    6.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emails from Dr. Brader\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After his meeting with Ms. Ballinger, Dr. Brader began to send a series of emails to Ms. Sinclair, Ms. Ballinger, Dr. Weiskopf, and other Biogen employees on June 30 and July 1, 2014. Dr. Brader testified that he believed by this point that he was having some type of mental health episode. The emails sent were, for the most part, incoherent. Certain of the emails generally stated that Dr. Brader did not feel safe at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 30, 2014, at 4:45 PM, Dr. Brader sent an email to Ms. Sinclair. At 4:52 PM, he sent an email to Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf. In these emails, he stated that he does not feel safe at work. He sent an email to Ms. Sinclair at 5:31 PM. The email is full of incomplete thoughts and is unclear. Two minutes later, at 5:33 PM, he sent another email to Ms. Sinclair, indicating that it was his first \"normal\" email of the day. Within thirty seconds, he sent another email to Ms. Sinclair with only a subject line that read \"I do not feel safe at work.\" In response to this email, Ms. Sinclair sent an email to Dr. Brader at 5:50 PM. In that email, Ms. Sinclair referred Dr. Brader to Biogen's Employee Assistance Program. She included, \"It is important that our employees feel safe at work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While he was emailing Ms. Sinclair, Dr. Brader was also responding to an email sent by an external collaborator at New York University. He told the external collaborator that he had \"a small HR issue right now to deal with.\" When he was further pressed on the issue by the external collaborator, Dr. Brader responded that he \"told [his] supervisor that [he did not] feel safe.\" [Id.]. He copied Ms. Sinclair in that email. In response, Ms. Sinclair sent an email to Dr. Brader, copying Ms. Ballinger, requesting that they \"connect tomorrow before [he] respond[s] to further e-mails.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On that same day at 9:38 PM, Dr. Brader sent a reply to Ms. Sinclair and copied Dr. Weiskopf, Dr. Galdes, and Ms. Ballinger. Dr. Brader claimed he \"need[ed] to get a message to [Biogen's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") ]\" and that he was \"upset.\" A few minutes later, at 9:55 PM, Dr. Brader sent an email to Dr. Weiskopf, Dr. Galdes, Ms. Sinclair, and Ms. Ballinger and copied several Biogen employees. The email was directed to Dr. Galdes. At 11:14 PM, Dr. Brader sent another email to Ms. Sinclair but copied several other Biogen employees, including Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf. He again requested to meet with Biogen's CEO and indicated that he was \"not feeling 100.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 1, 2014, at 3:01 AM, Dr. Brader sent an email to Dr. Weiskopf and copied Ms. Sinclair and two additional Biogen employees, including Brian Fahie, Dr. Brader's \"mentor.\" In this email, Dr. Brader\n   indicated that he would \"see a mental health professional asap\" and that he had \"been described as mentally unstable by [his] supervisor and senior director.\" At 7:24 AM, Dr. Brader sent Dr. Galdes an email. He noted that \"there is something terribly wrong with PPD.\" He further indicated that he recently sought \"treatment for possible PTSD.\" Dr. Brader also stated that he would \"plead insanity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response to Ms. Sinclair's email to him at 7:43 AM indicating that she would call his home phone or cell phone at 8 AM, he sent an email at 7:54 AM and copied Dr. Weiskopf. In this email, Dr. Brader stated that he was \"directly called crazy by [his] senior director.\" He also wrote that he was \"unusually angry, but calm.\" At 10:41 AM, Dr. Brader sent an email to Ms. Sinclair, Dr. Galdes, and Dr. Weiskopf, copying Ms. Ballinger and several other Biogen employees. The email listed 41 bullet points, the first one which included, \"Yes I retruly [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] am wondering whether I have a mental health issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Sinclair spoke with Dr. Brader on July 1, 2014 in an effort to understand why he did not feel safe at work. Dr. Brader responded to Ms. Sinclair that he did not feel safe at work because of a dispute over performance feedback that he had been given by Dr. Weiskopf and Ms. Ballinger. Ms. Sinclair offered Dr. Brader Biogen's confidential Employee Assistance Program. Eventually, Ms. Sinclair was able to speak to Dr. Brader's wife, who confirmed that Dr. Brader had been hospitalized. On the morning of July 1, 2014, Dr. Brader's wife emailed to express her appreciation for Ms. Sinclair's assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 7, 2014, while hospitalized, Dr. Brader sent two other largely incoherent emails to a lengthy list of Biogen employees. These emails asked for Biogen's assistance and stated that he was \"scared.\" Dr. Brader did not mention the words \"harassment\" or \"discrimination\" in these emails. Rather, his focus remained on the feedback he received on June 18, 2014 concerning his presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    7.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Brader's Medical Leave\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dr. Brader was on medical leave from July 1, 2014 to October 26, 2014. Biogen uses a third party vendor to manage medical leave. No Biogen employee received information from a medical care provider regarding the cause of Dr. Brader's behavior in late June and early July 2014. The only specific medical information given to Biogen regarding what had happened to Dr. Brader at this time came from Dr. Brader's wife, who told Ms. Sinclair three weeks after his symptoms started that an infection had caused Dr. Brader's behavior, and that his behavior was part of a temporary issue. Dr. Brader's health care provider supported the information given by his wife: in completing Biogen's Disability and Accommodation Questionnaire (\"DAQ\") for Dr. Brader's July to October 2014 leave, the provider noted that the \"impairment began following back surgery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ms. Sinclair, Dr. Galdes, and Ms. Ballinger understood that Dr. Brader's behavior in late June and early July 2014 was, as his wife indicated, caused by a temporary infection and that he had recovered fully from his infection when he returned to work. Prior to this lawsuit, Dr. Brader never stated to any of them that he had a broader mental health issue. Dr. Brader's health care provider also supported the conclusion that his illness was temporary and that he had fully recovered when, in completing the DAQ, he noted that \"upon return\" Dr. Brader would have \"no restrictions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    8.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Brader's Return to Work in October 2014\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Brader met with Ms. Sinclair on the day he returned to work. He requested,\n   and was permitted, to use vacation time when he initially returned to work so that he was not working a full schedule immediately. He made no other request for accommodation. Dr. Brader returned to his same position, compensation, and responsibilities. He did not make any complaint about feeling unsafe at work or about discrimination or harassment when he returned to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Prior to his leave, Dr. Brader had worked on a project with an external collaborator, Avia Biosystems (\"the Avia Project\"). While Dr. Brader was on leave, the Aviva Project was moved to another group and Dr. Brader did not return to this project after his medical leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Around March 2015, Dr. Brader began to pursue what he believed was a novel \"crystallization concept.\" He continued to explore this idea, and received support and funding for it, until his employment with Biogen ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dr. Brader testified that the conduct that formed the basis of his present suit was his removal from the Avia Biosystems project and feedback from Dr. Weiskopf, including statements allegedly calling his crystallization concept \"stupid,\" and telling Dr. Brader not to ask so many questions in meetings and not to try so hard. Notably, Dr. Brader contends that Dr. Weiskopf's inappropriate treatment of him started before he became disabled (or came to be perceived as disabled) on June 30, 2014. Dr. Brader testified that Dr. Weiskopf's response to his crystallization concept was \"disingenuous\" because Dr. Weiskopf was not a subject matter expert in this area. He testified that he thought Dr. Weiskopf's conduct could be motivated by \"professional jealously\" and \"a desire to take undue credit\" for Dr. Brader's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dr. Brader received his 2015 mid-year review in late July or August 2015. Dr. Brader testified that he did not complain about discrimination during this period of time and that, while he felt Dr. Weiskopf's review was not accurate, he did not know what Dr. Weiskopf's motivation was for the allegedly inaccurate review. Dr. Brader contends that he complained to Ms. Ballinger about Dr. Weiskopf in April 2015 regarding \"Dr. Weiskopf's conduct\" toward him. In this April 2015 discussion, Dr. Brader told Ms. Ballinger that Dr. Weiskopf told him that he was \"trying too hard\" and thinks he also spoke to her about Dr. Weiskopf restricting the number of questions he could ask. Dr. Brader claims that he complained to Ms. Ballinger about Dr. Weiskopf in a July 31, 2015 email. The email referenced was sent when Ms. Ballinger was on vacation and requests Ms. Ballinger's help \"understanding the performance expectations [Dr. Weiskopf] sets for [Plaintiff].\" Ms. Ballinger responded to his email on her return from vacation. Dr. Brader sent another email on August 11, 2015 to Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf detailing suggestions for Dr. Weiskopf to improve his \"managerial effectiveness.\" Both Ms. Ballinger and Dr. Weiskopf responded on August 20, 2015, with Dr. Weiskopf stating that he was \"committed to working together with [Dr. Brader] to help him be successful and to strengthen [their] working relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Brader testified that he complained to Mr. Fahie, another Biogen employee, starting in May 2015, about the fact that Dr. Weiskopf told him not to try too hard and about the August 2015 mid-year review. Mr. Fahie was not Dr. Brader's supervisor and Dr. Brader did not report to him directly. Dr. Brader testified that he complained to Mr. Fahie that Dr. Weiskopf's criticism of him was \"very bizarre\" and contrary to Biogen's \"core values.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On September 29, 2015, Dr. Brader met with Ms. Ballinger and presented her with a two-page document outlining his concerns with the mid-year performance feedback\n   and his position that his mid-year review was not accurate. The document that he handed Ms. Ballinger did not reference harassment or discrimination; nor did it mention that he felt unsafe at work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    9.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dr. Brader's Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Galdes was involved in a Biogen team that planned for a major restructuring of the company in 2015, and was responsible for deciding how the TD department would implement the restructuring. He was first told on August 6, 2015 that there would be a reduction in force as part of the restructuring. The reduction in force was confidential prior to its public announcement and was given the code name \"Gemstone.\" Dr. Galdes was one of only about twenty people - out of a workforce of approximately 8,000 worldwide - who were told about the restructuring at this time. Dr. Galdes testified that he was responsible for identifying a list of employees in PPD who would be laid off as part of the company's restructuring and reduction in force (the \"Gemstone list\"). He further testified that he alone decided to include Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dr. Galdes included Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list no later than September 9, 2015. Dr. Brader asserts he has no knowledge of who made the decision to include him in the Gemstone list or when that decision was made. Dr. Galdes included Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list because Biogen did not need either him or his post-doctoral student, whose positions were dedicated specifically to new innovations and biologics. Dr. Galdes testified that he did not consider Dr. Brader's \"mental breakdown\" in any manner when he was determining whether or not Dr. Brader should be included on the Gemstone list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Dr. Galdes did not discuss the decision to include Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list with Ms. Ballinger or Dr. Weiskopf until the decision was being implemented in October 2015. Dr. Brader was notified on October 22, 2015, on the same date notice was provided to most other impacted employees, that he was included on the Gemstone list and that his employment with Biogen would end on November 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. Brader, filed his verified complaint in this matter in Massachusetts Superior Court on April 7, 2016. On May 16, 2016, Biogen removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1441(c)(1)(A) because Dr. Brader asserted federal claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ..\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On October 20, 2017, Biogen filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims asserted in the complaint. Dr. Brader opposed the motion on November 22, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response to Dr. Brader's submissions opposing summary judgment, Biogen filed a motion to strike several affidavits filed by Dr. Brader on the basis that the affidavits contained statements that were not based on the personal knowledge of the affiants, constituted inadmissible hearsay, or were otherwise inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   At a hearing on May 2, 2018, I denied the motion to strike and outlined the uses for which I would make use of that evidence in connection with summary judgment protocol. I also allowed further submissions on the question of the appropriate statute of limitations. Dr. Brader filed his supplemental memorandum on May 16, 2018 and Biogen filed its response on May 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Now, having had the benefit of both a hearing and supplemental submissions, I will grant Biogen's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is well established that a \"court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

Biogen's decisions not to promote Dr. Brader and to remove him from the Avia Project during his leave of absence are both discrete incidents that fall outside the 300-day limitations period. Similarly, while Dr. Brader's statements that he was being harassed and felt unsafe at work may indicate a continuing violation, there is no evidence that Biogen's alleged failure to investigate and act was part of a discriminatory policy that is, in and of itself, a violation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The standard applied by the Commonwealth, however, is more sympathetic to plaintiffs. For the continuing violation rule to apply under Massachusetts law, there must be \"(1) at least one discriminatory act [that] occurred\" within the 300-day limitations period; (2) the alleged discriminatory act must have \"a substantial relationship to the alleged untimely discriminatory acts;\" and, (3) the earlier violations were such that they \"did not trigger [the plaintiff's] awareness and duty to assert his rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mass.

When the claim is based on an allegation that the harassment created a hostile work environment, Massachusetts courts have held that the limitations\n   period begins to run when the plaintiff knew that her employer would not take steps to remedy the harassment, rather than when she had notice that she had an actionable claim.\n   <em>\n    Cuddyer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080037\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/521/\">\n    434 Mass. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=750%20N.E.2d%20928\">\n    750 N.E.2d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Even this lower standard is not met here. While Dr. Brader certainly alleged that at least one wrongful act - his termination - took place within the limitations period, he has not shown that his termination had any relationship, much less a substantial one, to the alleged misconduct in 2014. There is no evidence in the record that Biogen's decision to terminate Dr. Brader was influenced by his 2014 breakdown, or that the individuals responsible for making the decision to terminate him were aware of the fact that he continued to have concerns about his mental health after his return from leave in October 2014. At most, Dr. Brader can argue that he did not know that Biogen would not act to remedy the alleged harassment until after he returned from his leave of absence in October 2014. However, he has provided no evidence on record that Biogen was aware of the fact that he faced ongoing harassment because of his disability until after the decision to terminate Dr. Brader was made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Consequently, I find no evidence that the violation was continuous such that the alleged misconduct that took place in 2014 is actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    b. The Discovery Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dr. Brader also argues that the statute of limitations should be tolled under the so-called \"discovery rule,\" which states that \"a particular cause of action does not begin to [accrue] until the plaintiff knows, or should have known, that she has been harmed by the defendant's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Silvestris\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tantasqua Regional School Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783194\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/756/\">\n    446 Mass. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20N.E.2d%20328\">\n    847 N.E.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delaware State College\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ricks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p259\">\n    449 U.S. 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p259\">\n    101 S.Ct. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715909\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/250/#p259\">\n    66 L.Ed.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (recognizing the same rule in cases alleging employment discrimination under federal law). Here, Dr. Brader alleges that he could not reasonably have known that Biogen was discriminating against him because of his disability until he was ultimately terminated in October 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive. Dr. Brader certainly was aware of the fact that Biogen failed to promote him and subsequently removed him from the Avia Project in October 2014. He also should have known that his supervisor's behavior had not changed once he returned from leave in October 2014. He could have complained at that time. Consequently, Dr. Brader has not shown that his claims relating to conduct taking place in 2014 should be allowed under the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    c. Equitable Tolling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, Dr. Brader argues that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because his mental illness prevented him from filing a timely claim. Though Dr. Brader's reluctance to confront his employer is to some degree understandable, it is not sufficient to invoke\n   the doctrine of equitable tolling, especially in the absence of an allegation that Biogen intentionally concealed information or that Dr. Brader did not understand the nature or effects of his actions.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Arkwright Mutual Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1027970\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/423/1021/\">\n    423 Mass. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20N.E.2d%2040\">\n    673 N.E.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (1996) (rescript);\n   <em>\n    Desando\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lucent Technologies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9447883\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/193/358/#p361\">\n    193 F.Supp.2d 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361 (D.

Dr. Brader had to say something to put Biogen on notice that the complained-of harassment was based on his disability, but his own testimony indicates that he did not make those specific complaints. Most of his complaints involved the feedback that he received from Dr. Weiskopf. When Ms. Sinclair asked for a clarification about why he felt unsafe at work, he did not provide her with an explanation. In any event, Ms. Sinclair provided him resources to help him address his concerns. When he was hospitalized, Mrs. Brader informed Ms. Sinclair that his behavior may have been caused by an infection after his back surgery and that it would likely be resolved. Moreover, when Dr. Brader returned to work after his three to four month medical leave, his only request was that he be permitted to work a part-time work schedule. He was accommodated in response to his request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Dr. Brader has provided arguments based on Biogen's HR policies and procedures for complaints for harassment and his main arguments revolve around what those policies allegedly require Biogen to undertake when receiving such complaints. He states that the only plausible reason Ms. Sinclair did not take his complaints seriously was on account of his mental disability at the time. Furthermore, Dr. Brader asserts that Ms. Sinclair's decision was in direct conflict with Biogen policies that require her to report or investigate Dr. Brader's concerns. Although the alleged violation of Biogen's HR policies is\n   arguably problematic, these assertions do not bolster Dr. Brader's discrimination and retaliation claim and do not give weight to his pretextual arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    3.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Discrimination Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In arguing its motion for summary judgment on the merits, Biogen contends both that it acted without the requisite animus and that it has established a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decisions and that Dr. Brader cannot establish that Biogen's justification for its decisions is mere pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The ADA \"prohibits discrimination against 'a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Freadman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metro.

It does,\n   however, argue that Dr. Brader does not show that he was discriminated against\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his disability. Biogen further argues that it had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating his employment that is not pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For the sake of deciding the present motion, I will assume that Dr. Brader suffers from a disability or handicap and that he was, nevertheless, able to perform the essential functions of his job, either with or without reasonable accommodation. I cannot, however, agree with Dr. Brader that Biogen took an adverse employment action against him because of, in whole or in part, his protected disability or that Biogen's reasoning for its actions was pretextual. Since these two elements dovetail with one another, I consider them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although Dr. Brader has listed several discriminatory actions taken against him in his opposition memorandum, the two adverse employment actions that he has identified that may potentially qualify as evidence of discrimination are the following: Biogen's decision to transition the responsibility for the Avia Project to another employee while Dr. Brader was on medical leave in 2014 and its decision to include Dr. Brader in the layoff list pursuant to its reduction in force in 2015. As I have concluded in Section III.A.\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , while only the termination is within the statute of limitations, I will consider the Avia Project as evidence to the degree it provides support for a finding that the termination was discriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Dr. Brader was out on medical leave from July 2014 until October 2014. In order to accommodate both him and the external collaborator, Avia Biosystems, it was reasonable for Biogen to have another employee continue work with Avia Biosystems. It is hard to imagine such a project being placed in suspension due to the absence of one employee. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there was any negative impact on Dr. Brader as a result of this project being transitioned to someone else. He speculates that he did not get promoted as a result, but such speculation, in the absence of any record evidence, is not sufficient. Indeed, Dr. Brader does not allege that his pay was cut or that he was otherwise demoted or prevented from working on future collaborations. His only objection is that he was removed from a specific project while on medical leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   More fundamentally, it is undisputed that Dr. Brader was included in a large reduction in force that resulted in Biogen's laying off a significant portion of its work force. The reduction in force was confidential prior to its public announcement and was given the code name \"Gemstone.\" Dr. Galdes did not discuss the decision to include Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list with Ms. Ballinger or Dr. Weiskopf until the decision was being implemented in October 2015. He included Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list no later than September 9, 2015. Dr. Galdes testified that he included Dr. Brader on the Gemstone list because Biogen did not need either him or his post-doctoral student, whose positions were dedicated specifically to new innovations and biologics. Based on this evidence, it is clear both that Dr. Brader has not shown that he was discriminated against\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his disability and that Biogen met its burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for both Dr. Brader's transition out of working with Avia Biosystems and his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Dr. Brader also cannot establish that Biogen's justification for its decisions was mere pretext. No doubt Dr. Brader's colleagues and supervisors, as a result of his actions and emails during the relevant time period, could surmise that he was not acting as he normally would and that something was wrong. Dr. Brader maintains that he was being harassed because of his mental illness, and, that as a result, he felt unsafe at work. He characterized Dr. Weiskopf's feedback with respect to his June 18, 2014 presentation as \"harassment,\" but when he was asked what he thought Dr. Weiskopf's motivation was for his actions in 2014, Dr. Brader testified that he did not know and that he could only \"speculate\" as to Dr. Weiskopf's motivation. In a meeting with Dr. Weiskopf on the morning of June 30, 2014, Dr. Brader asked Dr. Weiskopf to \"stop harassing\" him and, specifically, objected to Dr. Weiskopf's criticisms of his presentation. Furthermore, when asked why he did not feel safe, Dr. Brader could not provide a clear response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In further support of his arguments, Dr. Brader points to Biogen's HR policies, which establish a supervisor's responsibilities when any alleged or perceived incidents or discrimination or harassment are reported to them. He also offers evidence that Biogen has a known history of conducting an investigation when an employee tells them they do not feel safe, and that it failed to investigate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, both Ms. Sinclair and Ms. Ballinger, on several occasions, directed Dr. Brader's attention to Biogen's employee assistance program. Notably, in her affidavit in support of Dr. Brader, Ms. Moore asserts that Biogen's HR policies \"must be adhered to in letter and spirit in order to prevent unlawful actions, inappropriate conduct, threatening behavior, and/or a hostile work environment to permeate the Biogen workplace, among other things.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Dr. Brader's complaints, especially in the beginning, did not raise a concern of unlawful or inappropriate behavior. Rather, they primarily concerned Dr. Weiskopf and his comments about Dr. Brader's presentation. The only potentially alarming information he relayed to Biogen during the relevant time period was that he felt unsafe. When asked to clarify, his responses were usually incoherent. To be sure, the incoherence of his emails strongly supports his claim that there was something wrong with Dr. Brader. However, that is not enough to support the proposition that Dr. Brader's disability was the motivation for Ms. Ballinger's and Dr. Weiskopf's treatment of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Dr. Brader also speculates that a decision to promote him was made in June 2014, before he had a disability, and was then revoked after he became disabled. He cites Ms. Sinclair's notes from September 2014 that reference a June 19, 2014 promotion meeting. These notes, however, do not state that a decision had been made to promote Dr. Brader in June 2014, but rather that the matter was discussed. More specifically, the notes do not support the inference that Biogen declined to promote Dr. Brader because of his disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Moreover, Biogen's decision to reassign the Avia Biosystems project to another Biogen employee when Dr. Brader was on medical leave was appropriate in light of the circumstances. The affidavits submitted by Dr. Brader from the Avia Biosystems cofounder and Dr. Brader's post-doctoral student that Dr. Brader provided do not support the conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Biogen's\n   </em>\n   decision was based on Dr. Brader's disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Brader makes much of the fact that he only spent 15% of his time on new technology advancement and innovation, the area of work in which Biogen no longer wanted to invest. This he observes\n   was less than the 20% that another Biogen employee dedicated to continuing Dr. Brader's research after he was let go. But Dr. Brader fails to acknowledge that instead of having two employees, one of whom worked 15% of his time on new technology advancement and innovation, Biogen was left with one employee who arguably spent 20% of his time on new technology advancement and innovation. Consideration of job functions is not inherently suspect. I do not find Dr. Brader's reliance on these percentages particularly illuminating when considering whether Biogen's decision to terminate him was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Therefore, I will grant summary judgment to Biogen on the discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    4.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Retaliation Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With respect to the retaliation claim, Biogen argues that Dr. Brader did not engage in protected activity and, even if he did, Dr. Brader cannot establish that he suffered retaliation as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The ADA's retaliation provision provides that \"[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter.\"\n   <em>\n    Freadman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733007\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/91/#p99\">\n    484 F.3d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ).

Certainly Dr. Brader's request to use his vacation days constitutes protected activity under this standard.
