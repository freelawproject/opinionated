Loskutoff, in which Defendant sold Plaintiff the rights to a lease of a cell phone tower. At the time of the deal, Plaintiff says it believed that the lease had two streams of rental income. In fact, at the time of the purchase, the lease had only one stream of rental income. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knew that the second stream of rental income had been terminated and fraudulently misrepresented and concealed this information from Plaintiff in order to close the deal. In his answer, Defendant asserted fourteen affirmative defenses and a counterclaim for rescission of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment of Defendant's affirmative defenses and his counterclaim. ECF 92. The Court heard oral argument on January 7, 2019. For the reasons that follow, the Court DEFERS RULING ON Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to Defendant's fourth affirmative defense\n   and GRANTS the motion as to the remainder of Defendant's affirmative defenses and his counterclaim for rescission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Michael Loskutoff is the sole trustee of the Michael John Loskutoff Trust dated November 20, 1992 (the \"Trust\"). Saba Decl. ISO Mot., Ex. C, ECF 92-4. The Trust owns a parcel of land at 1391 Geneva Dr. in Sunnyvale, California (\"the Property\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 19:1-13, ECF 92-3. On July 1, 1996, Defendant leased a portion of the land to Spring Spectrum, L.P. (\"Sprint\") for Sprint to construct a cell phone tower on the Property, which remains on the Property today.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D, ECF 92-5;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 19:1-13, ECF 92-3. The tower is approximately 100 feet tall, located on the back of the property, and enclosed by a locked fence to which Defendant does not have a key.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 22:10-23:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several changes were made that affected the rents paid under the lease over the next fifteen years. In September 2002, Defendant and Sprint amended the lease to allow Sprint to enter into a sublease (or co-location agreement) with AT &amp; T Wireless (\"AT &amp; T\"), which would allow AT &amp; T to use the cell tower, and to increase Sprint's rents by $ 2,000 monthly. Saba Decl. Ex. F, ECF 92-7. Under the terms of the amended lease, Sprint entered into a sublease with AT &amp; T. The amended lease did not require Sprint to inform Defendant if AT &amp; T terminated its sublease with Sprint, and Defendant never had any interaction with or received any rents directly from AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Loskutoff Decl. ISO Opp. \u00b6 4, ECF 93-2. In February 2007, CCGS Holdings, LLC (\"Crown Castle\") informed Defendant that due to a merger, it would begin managing the cell phone tower for Sprint, though the lease agreement remained unchanged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G. In March 2011, Sprint paid Defendant $ 10,000 to again amend the agreement, this time to extend the lease duration, increase the rent, and provide Sprint an option to obtain a $ 1.2 million easement or to match a purchase offer from any other interested party-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a right of first refusal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. J at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By October 2007, Defendant was receiving an annual rent of $ 48,374.10 for the lease from Sprint, with $ 21,342.80 attributable to Sprint and $ 27,031.30 attributable to AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. H, ECF 92-9. On April 1, 2010, Defendant received an annual rent check of $ 54,742.63 for the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. I, ECF 92-10. On April 1, 2011, he received annual rents of $ 56,942.73.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. K, ECF 92-12. On April 1, 2012, he received $ 59,220.44.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. L, ECF 92-13. In April 2013, he received $ 61,589.26.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. M, ECF 92-14. But, in April 2014, he received only $ 28,260.30, less than half the amount received in 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P, ECF 92-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The 2014 rent was significantly lower because on October 25, 2013, AT &amp; T had notified Crown Castle that it would be terminating its sublease of the tower on December 31, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. N &amp; O, ECF 92-15, 92-16. Sprint, however, did not terminate its lease with Defendant; the lease remains in effect today. Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 11; Ballesteros Decl. ISO Opp. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2, ECF 93-1. On April 23, 2014, after receiving this reduced check, Defendant contacted Crown Castle's Landowners Help Desk, which is a resource for landowners to receive help from Crown Castle and allows Crown Castle to log the interaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Q at 9:14-10:4, ECF 92-18;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. R (\"Egercic Decl.\") at 6:5-8, ECF 92-19. Crown Castle employee Denise Egercic spoke to Defendant and created the following log after the call ended: \"Received a call from LL [Landlord] Mike .... He was inquiring why his check ... was so\n   much less than normal. It appears that AT &amp; T terminated and was discovered through a rent recon. It appears that we received notice from AT &amp; T however the LL indicated that he was not notified. Forward to James Laque for assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. S, ECF 92-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 5, 2014, Defendant emailed Crown Castle employee Ryan Hull asking him to \"verify who is on the Sprint poll for this site [at 1391 Geneva Drive]. My records show Sprint, Clear Wire and AT &amp; T.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. T, ECF 92-21. Mr. Hull responded with \"I show Sprint and Clearwire on the tower. I don't show AT &amp; T as being installed on the tower any longer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant responded on May 16, 2014 by asking \"When did AT &amp; T came [sic] off the tower?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later in May 2014, Defendant began the process of selling the Sprint lease to Plaintiff. A separate company, Telecom Lease Advisors, LLC (\"TLA\") performed the due diligence process for Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13. Sometime before May 28, 2014, Defendant spoke to John Mondragon, the broker for the eventual lease sale between Plaintiff and Defendant, about the possibility of Plaintiff purchasing the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 100:1-102:25. During that conversation, Defendant did not mention that there was an issue receiving the 2014 AT &amp; T rent, and he told Mr. Mondragon that he was receiving money from both Sprint and AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:14-25; 103:7-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 28, 2014, Mr. Mondragon sent Defendant a lease-purchase application to fill out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. X, ECF 92-25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Y at 33:4-35:10, ECF 92-26. Defendant filled out the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. W, ECF 92-24;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 90:12-21. The application stated that Crown Castle was the tenant and the other carriers on the site were Sprint, Clearwire &amp; AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. W at 3. It also stated that the lease was in full force and effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the application, Defendant certified that the information in the application was true and agreed to provide any later-received information that might change any of his answers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The application did not indicate that AT &amp; T either actually or potentially was no longer on the lease. In the same email, Mr. Mondragon also sent a proposed term sheet for a sale of the lease for $ 925,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. X;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Y at 33:4-35:10. The schedule to the term sheet indicated that the Property had two rental income streams of $ 27,173 and $ 34,416, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. X. Defendant provided these numbers to Mr. Mondragon in advance of receiving the term sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 4, 2014, Plaintiff and Defendant signed the final term sheet, which indicated the two rental streams.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Z, ECF 92-27. When the final term sheet was executed, Defendant did not advise Plaintiff that there might be a potential issue with the AT &amp; T rent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 106:17-20. Crown Castle does not provide third parties with information about the properties they manage; it is the obligation of the landlord to provide any such details. Saba Decl., Ex. Q at 51:6-52:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In late July 2014, Defendant emailed his attorney Frank Maiorana about the agreement, saying, in part, \"I have an agreement with AT &amp; T but I can not honestly tell you they are on the cell tower or off the cell tower. They do not give me notice as to who is on or off the tower.\" Loskutoff Decl., Ex. 6. Defendant indicated Plaintiff had told him AT &amp; T was on the tower, but he was unsure whether AT &amp; T would need to notify him if they had terminated, so he sought guidance from Mr. Maiorana on whether he needed indemnification for\n   who was on the site or to have Plaintiff do due diligence to determine AT &amp; T's status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Maiorana responded with \"You make no representations or warranties in the agreements about AT &amp; T or that they are on the space.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant again followed up saying he was \"still concerned about AT &amp; T\" and asking Mr. Maiorana if AT &amp; T's status on the site would be subject to Plaintiff's due diligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 7. Mr. Maiorana assured him that Plaintiff was conducting its own due diligence and Plaintiff did not make any representations or warranties to Plaintiff concerning AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 7, 2014, Crown Castle sent Defendant a letter that stated \"[d]uring the period of December 1, 2013 to March 21, 2014, payments were inconsistent with the lease due to license termination\" and sought $ 11,471.97 from Defendant for Crown Castle's overpayment of rents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. AA, ECF 92-28. An exhibit to the letter shows that Crown Castle paid lump sums for two rent streams on April 2013 (for the year between April 2013 and April 2014), but that the charges for one of those streams ended on December 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant never provided Plaintiff with a copy of the letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 117:12-119:7. Defendant did not otherwise inform Plaintiff prior to the closing that AT &amp; T had not paid its 2014 rent or that he owed money to Crown Castle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:1-8. Also, prior to closing, Defendant provided Plaintiff with copies of the 2012 and 2013 rent checks but did not provide Plaintiff with a copy of the reduced 2014 rent check.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:13-25;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. V at 18:2-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 14, 2014, Defendant and Plaintiff signed a final purchase agreement, in which Plaintiff acquired the lease and Defendant received $ 925,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. BB, ECF 92-29. The sale closed on August 15, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. CC, ECF 92-30. The final purchase agreement included a \"Mutual Indemnification Provision\" and a \"Dispute Resolution\" provision whereby the parties agreed to waive the right to a jury trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. BB \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sometime after closing, Plaintiff discovered that no rent was being paid on the AT &amp; T sublease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Y at 35:11-35:20. On March 14, 2016, Defendant received a letter from Plaintiff seeking rescission of the contract. The letter stated that Plaintiff planned to take legal action for the above-described events and detailed that AT &amp; T was no longer on the lease as of November 30, 2013. Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 17, Ex. 9. In early April 2016, Defendant reached out to the Crown Castle Help Desk about AT &amp; T's termination of its sublease, and a Crown Castle employee responded saying he didn't \"see anything in the lease which required Crown to provide notice of ATT's decommission from the site,\" but he was following up with others to see if notification was sent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18, Ex. 10. Defendant responded asking when AT &amp; T was removed from the site, and after being told AT &amp; T had been removed on November 30, 2013, he asked whether AT &amp; T was discontinued the same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record does not reflect that he received a response. Plaintiff filed this suit on April 29, 2016. ECF 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant never received a notice of termination from AT &amp; T. Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 1 at 83:10-84:10. Likewise, Crown Castle never provided written confirmation to Defendant that AT &amp; T had terminated the sublease, though it customarily confirmed with its clients when there was a termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 10 at 17:8-12;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at 83:17-19; Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Throughout the transaction, Plaintiff conducted due diligence for the transaction. Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 3 at 17:16-18:4. Plaintiff is in the business of purchasing leases like the one at issue here. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7. As part of this due diligence, the\n   due diligence checklist on the transaction term sheet included \"Proof of Payments (last 3 months)\" and \"Confirmation of Lease Economics.\" Saba Decl., Ex. X. An email between Plaintiff's employees in early June 2014 indicates that getting a copy of the 2014 rent check for the lease was a \"first priority.\" Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 4. However, Plaintiff never received a copy of the 2014 rent check before closing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at 115:13-17, Ex. 6 at 18:12-23; Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Compl., ECF 1. On June 22, 2016, the case was reassigned to this Court. ECF 15. On July 5, 2016, Defendant answered the Complaint, asserting fourteen affirmative defenses and a counterclaim for rescission based on mutual mistake. Defendant asserted the following affirmative defenses (as interpreted by the Court):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   1.

On October 27, 2016, Tower Company Five LLC (\"Sprint\"), by its attorney in fact Global Signal Acquisitions II LLC (which Defendant had misidentified as Crown Castle) and STC Five LLC, answered the third-party Complaint and asserted three counterclaims for breach of contract, mistaken receipt, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. ECF 53. On November 28, 2016, Defendant answered Sprint's counterclaim. ECF 57.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff seeks summary judgment of all of Defendant's affirmative defenses and his counterclaim for rescission.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. The Court first holds that there are two key genuine issues of material fact relevant to the present motion: (1) whether Defendant knew that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease prior to closing the deal with Plaintiff; and (2) whether Plaintiff was negligent in conducting its due diligence. The Court then turns to each of Defendant's affirmative defenses and his counterclaim and GRANTS IN PART AND DEFERS RULING ON IN PART Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Genuine Issues of Material Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether Defendant Knew that AT &amp; T Had Terminated Its Sublease Is a Disputed Issue of Material Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff argues that several of Defendant's affirmative defenses are barred because Defendant knew that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease and fraudulently withheld that information from Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 11-12. Thus, whether\n   Defendant knew that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease at the time the deal with Plaintiff closed is an important question of fact here. At bottom, Plaintiff argues that Defendant knew that AT &amp; T was no longer on the lease based on his actions between April 2014 (when he received the reduced check) and August 14, 2014 (when the deal closed). The Court disagrees and holds that whether Defendant knew that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease is a genuine issue of material fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant did not have any agreement with AT &amp; T directly, the lease did not require Sprint to inform Defendant if AT &amp; T terminated its lease, and Sprint never sent a written termination letter to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saba Decl., Ex. F; Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7; Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 1 at 83:17-19. Defendant also testifies that he was never told that AT &amp; T was off the lease until March 2016.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Saba Decl., Ex. B at 58:17-59:20; 71:15-72:15, 73:13-77:15; 93:18-94:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In April 2014, Defendant received a rent check that was approximately half as large as the checks he had received in the previous four years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saba Decl., Exs. I-P. After receiving this check, Defendant called the Crown Castle Help Desk to ask about the discrepancy, at which time he spoke with Ms. Egercic. Ms. Egercic logged the call, saying \"it appears AT &amp; T terminated\" and \"it appears that we received notice from AT &amp; T however LL [Defendant] indicated he was not notified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. S. Plaintiff asserts that Ms. Egercic testified at her deposition that she told Defendant on this call that AT &amp; T was no longer on the tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. R at 7:25-8:3. But Ms. Egercic also testified that she did not have any independent recollection of the phone call and was instead answering based solely on the text of the log.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 10 at 8:11-13; 14:12-15:5. The log itself does not actually state that she told Defendant that AT &amp; T was not on the lease. And, as discussed more below, over the course of the next several months (and indeed years) on several occasions Defendant made several communications regarding whether AT &amp; T was still on the lease, from which the Court may infer in favor of the nonmovant that Defendant was uncertain of AT &amp; T's status. Given these facts, the Court finds there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ms. Egercic told Defendant that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant then emailed with Ryan Hull of Crown Castle on May 5, 2014 to verify who was using the cell tower. Saba Decl., Ex. T. As with Ms. Egercic, there is no definitive evidence that Mr. Hull told Defendant that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease. What Mr. Hull said was, \"I don't show AT &amp; T as being installed on the tower any longer,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , to which Defendant responded questioning when AT &amp; T came off the tower.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Hull never responded to this email. A reasonable jury could infer that Defendant did not know that AT &amp; T terminated its sublease because Mr. Hull never said so definitively and never responded to Defendant's follow-up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Throughout the next several months, Defendant interacted with Plaintiff's employee, Mr. Mondragon, through at least one phone call, the application for the lease sale with Plaintiff, and the signing of the final term sheet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. X-Z. There is no evidence that Defendant somehow learned of AT &amp; T's status throughout that time. In fact, Defendant testified that Mr. Mondragon told him that AT &amp; T\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   still on the tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 1 at 116:11-13. And in late-July 2014, Defendant had conversations with his attorney, Mr. Maiorana, in which he expressed his concern that AT &amp; T was not on the lease, stating, in part, \"I have an agreement with AT &amp; T but I can not honestly tell you\n   they are on the cell tower or off the cell tower. They do not give me notice as to who is on or off the tower.\" Loskutoff Decl., Ex. 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 7. Thus, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Defendant knew by this point that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, on August 7, 2014, Crown Castle sent Defendant a letter describing that it had overpaid Defendant for the previous year's rent and showing that one of the two rent streams for the lease had ended in November 2013. Saba Decl., Ex. AA. However, the letter did not explicitly state that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease. Defendant also testified that he thinks he received this letter after the closing on August 14, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B at 114:10-115:3. Thus, there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether this letter informed Defendant before the closing that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that in April 2016, after receiving Plaintiff's notice of litigation, Defendant followed up with Crown Castle to determine when AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 18, Ex. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, the Court cannot infer that Defendant knew that AT &amp; T had terminated the sublease merely because (1) he may have told Mr. Mondragon that AT &amp; T was on the lease; (2) he signed the purchase application saying AT &amp; T was on the lease; (3) he failed to provide the 2014 rent check to Plaintiff; or (4) he otherwise did not inform Plaintiff that AT &amp; T had terminated the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 11-12. Whether any of these actions indicate that Defendant knew about AT &amp; T's status is a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 1 at 116:1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Thus, there are disputed issues of material facts as to whether Defendant knew before the closing that AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease. Given the above facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant did not know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether Plaintiff Was Negligent in Conducting Its Due Diligence Is a Disputed Issue of Material Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Plaintiff (through its agent TLA) negligently conducted its due diligence, such that it should have discovered that AT &amp; T was no longer on the lease. Defendant submits expert testimony stating that Plaintiff's due diligence \"fell below the standard of care because they failed to obtain a copy of the 2014 rent stream or an estoppel confirming the rent payment.\" Opp. at 9 (citing Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 7 at 57:22-58:22, 72:15-21, 74:1-18, 75:19-76:8, 76:24-77:9, 101:19-102:1). Defendant argues that TLA is in the business of purchasing these types of leases, such that it has vast experience in closings such as these. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7. Indeed, the due diligence checklist on the transaction term sheet included \"Proof of Payments (last 3 months)\" and \"Confirmation of Lease Economics,\" indicating that TLA contemplated securing the 2014 rent check. Saba Decl., Ex. X. Likewise, Defendant references the email between Plaintiff's employees in early June 2014 that indicated that getting a copy of the 2014 rent check for the lease was a \"first priority.\" Ballesteros Decl., Ex. 4. However, Plaintiff never received a copy of the 2014 rent check before closing.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 at 115:13-17, Ex. 6 at 18:12-23; Loskutoff Decl. \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff counters that it did not have access to the tower to confirm whether AT &amp; T was still on it. Reply at 6 (citing Saba Decl., Ex. B, at 22:10-23:9; 55:7-55:12; 142:19-144:13). Plaintiff also avers that it is common practice not to receive all pay stubs in a transaction and instead to rely on representations and warranties in the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saba Decl., Ex. V at 18:2-19:25,\n   ECF 92-23. According to Plaintiff, that is why it reasonably relied on the 2013 pay check and Defendant's representations and warranties in the agreement, as well as Defendant's statements to Mr. Mondragon that AT &amp; T was still on the tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 11; Reply at 7. Plaintiff also reiterates that it believes Defendant intentionally withheld the 2014 check.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646842\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/83/1075/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Defendant failed to inform Plaintiff at any time that AT &amp; T was no longer on the tower. Mot. at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Given this conflicting evidence, the Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff conducted its due diligence negligently. While Plaintiff says it is common practice not to receive all pay stubs, Defendant's expert says such a practice would be wholly insufficient. The express provisions of the term sheet contemplated Plaintiff confirming the lease payments, and Plaintiff's employees called getting the 2014 check a first priority. Plaintiff also did not get an estoppel from Defendant to mitigate any issues that might result from not receiving the 2014 rent check. Even in light of any alleged misrepresentation by Defendant, a reasonable jury could find on this evidence that Plaintiff was negligent in conducting its due diligence.

Defendant's arguments and Plaintiff's opposition thereto make clear that this is really a dispute over the comparative fault affirmative defenses, discussed below. Likewise, to the extent Defendant argues that the defense is appropriate because Plaintiff's reliance on Defendant's alleged misrepresentations was not justifiable, the defense is simply a guise for Defendant's argument that Plaintiff has failed to prove an element of its claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zivkovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440823\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/1080/#p1088\">\n    302 F.3d at 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant did not have an opportunity to substantively respond to these objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Based on the limited briefing on this issue, the Court cannot say for certain whether Defendant's intended use of this evidence runs afoul of Federal Rule of Evidence 408. The Court recognizes that various courts have held that statements during settlement discussions may be admissible for the purpose of demonstrating a failure to mitigate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Emelianenko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2013176755\">\n    2011 WL 13176755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 ;\n   <em>\n    Hutton v.

However, it seems that Defendant intends to use this evidence to prove that Plaintiff should have rescinded the agreement-a use that appears distinguishable\n   from other cases admitting such evidence and that appears to contravene the purposes of Rule 408. Because this is the only evidence Defendant submits in support of this defense, resolution of the defense turns on this evidentiary dispute. As such, this issue is more appropriately considered through a motion in limine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mastec N. Am., Inc. v.

It will be Defendant's responsibility to submit a motion in limine to obtain admission of the settlement discussions, which must include a more developed discussion of his theory of a failure to mitigate that is in line with an exception to FRE 408. If the Court rules that this evidence is inadmissible on a motion in limine, Defendant's failure-to-mitigate defense will have no supporting evidence, and the Court will summarily dismiss the affirmative defense at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Indeed, the fact that Mr. Mondragon told Defendant that AT &amp; T was still on the tower is evidence that Plaintiff believed AT &amp; T\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   on the tower, not that Plaintiff knew AT &amp; T had terminated its sublease. Perhaps if additional evidence existed to support the notion that Plaintiff knew of AT &amp; T's status, then Mr. Mondragon's statement might indicate that Plaintiff was trying to mislead Defendant, but absent any such evidence, no reasonable jury could find that Plaintiff knew of AT &amp; T's status before closing and attempted to mislead Defendant as to that status. Moreover, even if Defendant had submitted evidence to support the argument that Plaintiff acted knowingly and that he was misled, Defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was injured by the transaction, as discussed in more detail with respect to Defendant's rescission claim.

Affirmative Defense No. 8: Comparative Fault: Fault of Others\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Defendant's eighth affirmative defense alleges \"[t]hat plaintiff's damages, if any exist, were caused by the negligence and/or fault of other persons, corporations, and entities including both parties and non-parties to this action whether named or not named and that Defendant's liability, if any, should be reduced accordingly.\" Ans. at 8. Defendant raises a similar affirmative defense in his fourteenth affirmative defense, which alleges, in part, that plaintiff was contributorily negligent. To avoid duplication of the defenses, the Court interprets Defendant's eight affirmative defense to apply only to non-parties-that is, that Defendant's liability should be reduced due to the fault of others (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , non-parties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The problem here is that there is no \"other\" against whom comparative fault may operate. The only relevant party would be Plaintiff's due diligence agent TLA. The parties implicitly and explicitly recognize that TLA conducted its due diligence as Plaintiff's agent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opp. at 8, 15, 22 (referring to Plaintiff's agents); Mot. at 13, 14 (stating that Plaintiff conducted due diligence without referring to TLA). Under California law, the comparative fault of an agent is imputed to the principal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Council of Cal. Advisory Comm. Civil Jury Instruction No. 3702 (setting forth the elements for \"Affirmative Defense - Comparative Fault of Plaintiff's Agent,\" and requiring that if the defendant can prove the agent was negligent and acted within the scope of its duties, the plaintiff's claim is reduced by the percentage of the agent's responsibility). Thus, because Plaintiff does not dispute that TLA acted as its agent, any negligence on the part of TLA is more appropriately considered as negligence by Plaintiff. The Court discusses the comparative fault standards as to Plaintiff below with respect to Defendant's fourteenth affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant does not argue that TLA is more appropriately considered a \"joint tortfeasor\" (or co-defendant, in a sense).

Cal. May 31, 2012) (declining to strike affirmative defense of comparative fault because the court could not hold at the pleading stage that the plaintiff's reliance was not preposterous or irrational). Courts in this district have read\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"[i]n cases ... which arise from an allegation of deceit, the question of whether the plaintiff's behavior is intentional or negligent is subsumed under the element of reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    F.D.I.C. v.

In that case, as in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected the defendants' argument that comparative negligence should apply because the plaintiffs negligently relied on the defendants' misrepresentations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=180%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Based on these cases, this Court concludes that the affirmative defense of comparative fault is not appropriate here. First, just as with Plaintiff's other claims for deceit, the affirmative defense of comparative fault appears to be merely duplicative of Defendant's argument that Plaintiff fails to satisfy its burden of proving the element of reasonable reliance. Second, as discussed, Defendant's evidence demonstrates, at most, that Plaintiff was negligent in conducting its due diligence; he does not sufficiently prove that Plaintiff's reliance was \"preposterous or irrational.\" As such, even if the affirmative defense were appropriate here under\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has shown that Defendant cannot satisfy\n   <em>\n    Van Meter\n   </em>\n   's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendant's attempts to argue to the contrary are unavailing. The Court of Appeal in\n   <em>\n    Kohn\n   </em>\n   held that\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   's rejection of comparative fault in business transaction cases applies only between the plaintiff and the defendant, not between multiple defendant tortfeasors.\n   <em>\n    Kohn\n   </em>\n   recognized that\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   applies when the comparative fault is meted between a plaintiff and a\n   defendant, stating \"[a]t most,\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that as long as the plaintiff is not aware of the true state of facts his negligence in not ascertaining them will not be compared with the negligence of the defendant in making the misrepresentation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2107715\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/142/323/#p330\">\n    142 Cal.

Here, Defendant seeks to use the affirmative defense against a plaintiff, not a joint tortfeasor, so\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Likewise, Section 552A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts does not dictate a contrary result. First, it relates to contributory negligence, not comparative fault. Second, Defendants do not cite any California cases adopting Section 552A, as opposed to Section 552. And third, subsuming an affirmative defense of comparative fault into a claim that a plaintiff has not proven the element of justifiable reliance appears to comport with \"ordinary rules of negligence\" contemplated by Section 552A-that is, when a plaintiff is negligent, he may not be able to prove that he reasonably relied on the misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds that Defendant's affirmative defense of comparative fault cannot be raised as to any of Plaintiff's four causes of action. Thus, the Court GRANTS summary judgment on Defendant's fourteenth affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    15. Counterclaim: Rescission (Mutual Mistake)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Defendant also asserts a counterclaim for rescission, in which he alleges that \"LLB and Loskutoff, through no fault of their own, were both mistaken as to the status of the ATT rent stream during the due diligence period and at the time of execution of the Purchase Agreement.\" Ans. at 12, \u00b6 24. California Civil Code \u00a7 1689 allows a party to rescind a contract \"[i]f the consent of the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with him, was given by mistake.\" A mistake of fact is \"a mistake, not caused by the neglect of a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake, and consisting in: [ (1) ] An unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact past or present, material to the contract; or, [ (2) ] Belief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract, which does not exist, or in the past existence of such a thing, which has not existed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1577.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Here, the purported fact about which the parties were mistaken is AT &amp; T's termination of the sublease. The Court has already determined that there is no evidence that Plaintiff knew that AT &amp; T had terminated the sublease. Where the mistake is mutual (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   both parties are mistaken), the defendant must prove \"that both parties were mistaken\" and that the defendant \"would not have agreed to enter into the contract if [he] had known about the mistake.\" Council of Cal.

Opp. at 23-25. At the hearing on the motion, Defendant also argued that the transaction injured him because he gave up his rights to the lease and the associated future rent streams.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 100 at 25: 18-19. And he argues he has not waived the right to argue rescission because he did not know about AT &amp; T's termination until 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court can summarily reject Plaintiff's arguments that Defendant did not make a mistake and that he waived his rescission claim because the Court has already determined that disputed issues of material fact exist as to whether and when Defendant knew about AT &amp; T's termination status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   However, the Court agrees with Plaintiff's argument that Defendant has failed to point to evidence demonstrating that the transaction injured him in any way or that Defendant would not have agreed to enter into the contract had he known about the mistake. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

Cal. Dec. 10, 2015) (holding plaintiff could not show that settlement adversely impacted him because he received $ 1,000 and could not show that the settlement unfairly benefitted the defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Here, Defendant received $ 925,000 from Plaintiff because Plaintiff allegedly believed that the lease had two rent income streams. Had the parties known at the time of the transaction that the tower only had one rent income stream, Defendant almost certainly would not have received as much money in the transaction. Thus, Defendant ostensibly\n   <em>\n    benefited\n   </em>\n   from the parties' mistake, not suffered from it. It strains credulity to say that Defendant would not have entered into the agreement had he known AT &amp; T had terminated the sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Defendant argues he was injured because he now faces litigation because of the mistake, and because he lost the opportunity for future rent streams from the\n   transaction. As to the latter, Defendant entered into an arms' length transaction with Plaintiff in which he seemingly decided that the future income from the tower with two rent streams was less valuable than the $ 925,000 he received in return. To say that the tower would somehow have been more valuable to him had he known it had only\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   income stream again is simply not plausible. And Defendant does not otherwise argue that the transaction was unconscionable. As to the litigation expenses, Defendant does not cite a single case in which a party demonstrated injury for the purposes of mistake merely because the mistake subjected him to litigation. Indeed, if litigation expenses alone were sufficient to constitute injury for this claim, any party to a lawsuit raising a mistake claim would satisfy this element, rendering the element a nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Because Defendant has failed to demonstrate that a reasonable jury could conclude the transaction injured him, he fails to satisfy an essential element of his rescission counterclaim.
