At the second step, however, the Court finds that outstanding issues remain, and that further administrative proceedings would be useful, specifically, on how much weight to assign plaintiff's testimony, and what limitations to assess based on them.

The dictionary meaning of \"involved\" is \"complicated\". Webster's New Int'l Dictionary 1191 (3d ed.2002). Furthermore, the definition of \"complicated\" is \"not simple\". Id. at 465. Thus, \"uninvolved\" means \"simple\". The modifier \"but uninvolved\" must be considered when interpreting the definition of Level Two reasoning.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Abrew v.

Considering the entire phrase, \"detailed but uninvolved\", I find that although the instructions may be detailed, they may also be simple. A task that includes \"detailed, but uninvolved\" instructions may consist of a number of steps, none of which are complex. Therefore, a claimant who is limited to \"simple, routine tasks and instructions\" is capable of performing a job requiring Level Two reasoning.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     Patton v.

First, the ALJ faulted Matsumoto's opinions because he is not a \"mental health specialist.\" Tr. 24. However, general practitioners and non-specialists may opinion on a wide array of medical areas, including mental health.\n    <em>\n     E.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Crane v. Shalala\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7627402\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/251/#p254\">\n     76 F.3d 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 254 (9th Cir. 1996) ;\n    <em>\n     Sprague v.

Also, only a portion of Matsumoto's opinions concerned mental health. Most concerned physical limitations, on which Matsumoto is indisputably qualified to opine. This was not a germane reason to discount his opinions. Second, the ALJ broadly stated that \"the totality of the medical evidence is inconsistent with the stated limitations,\" and cited various swathes of medical evidence. Tr. 24. However, the ALJ's vague and conclusory characterization of Matsumoto's opinions as inconsistent with \"the totality\" of the medical evidence, without specifics or further explanation, is not a valid reason to discount his testimony.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Revels v. Berryhill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265457\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/648/#p665\">\n     874 F.3d 648\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 665-66, 668 (9th Cir. 2017) ;\n    <em>\n     Popa v.

However, because the ALJ provided other, legitimate bases for discounting Matsumoto's opinions, any error here was harmless.\n    <em>\n     Molina\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3748749\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1104/#p1111\">\n     674 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1112 &amp; n.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
