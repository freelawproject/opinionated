These motions have been fully briefed. For the reasons explained below, this Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Century's motion and will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Dunham's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff James Davis grew up shooting a variety of firearms-including shotguns, rifles, and pistols. One particular variety of firearms familiar to plaintiff is the bolt-action rifle, which he learned to used when he was 13 or 14 years old. Plaintiff has owned, cleaned, and hunted with bolt-action rifles since at least 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 14, 2015, plaintiff purchased a Mosin-Nagant Model 91/30 bolt-action rifle from Dunham's store in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Dunham, for its part, had purchased the rifle from Century-an importer of vintage firearms. When sold to plaintiff, the rifle came with a manual and a white tag warning that it was not newly manufactured and, therefore, must be inspected by a qualified gunsmith before being used. Plaintiff does not recall whether the white tag was attached to the rifle at the time of purchase, but he admits receiving it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Mosin-Nagant has a unique history and profile. It is a magazine-fed, five-shot bolt-action military rifle developed by Imperial Russia (now the Russian Federation) sometime in the 1890s. Manufacturing of it was discontinued in the 1960s, and it has since gained popularity with firearm collectors and enthusiasts. It also has a unique safety design. Rather than traditional \"on/off\" levers, the Mosin-Nagant utilizes a knob on the bolt's cocking piece that can disengage the fire control and lock the bolt into a closed position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vintages rifles, such as the one plaintiff purchased, often come packed in greasy substance called \"cosmoline\" that prevent them from degrading. Thus, when plaintiff returned home from Dunham's shop, he read over the manual and set about dissembling and cleaning the rifle's components. As plaintiff dissembled his rifle, he removed the bolt from the receiver and \"broke it down even further removing [the] firing pin and striker spring\" so that all pieces could be cleaned. Satisfied that all components were \"spotless,\" plaintiff explains that he reassembled the rifle in \"reverse order\" and had no problems putting the pieces back together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, plaintiff took his Mosin-Nagant out with him to hunt deer. Plaintiff acknowledges he did not test or sight the rifle beforehand, but explains that he had shot a Mosin-Nagant before that was \"extremely accurate\"-thus trusting the rifle would do well without prior preparations. Plaintiff eventually spotted a deer and successfully fired a single round, hitting the deer without killing it. Plaintiff then attempted to fire a second round to kill the deer. This time, however, plaintiff states he immediately felt \"an intense pain coming from right below [his] right eye\" and as he put his hand to his face he could feel that it was \"covered in blood.\" The parties agree that, on the second shot, the rifle's safety knob was not fully lowered causing the bolt to be in a partially-locked position. This resulted in the bolt \"explod[ing] backwards into plaintiff's face.\" Two defense experts opine that the incident occurred as a result of plaintiff improperly reassembling the firing pin the night before while cleaning it-opinions that plaintiff does not refute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of his injury, plaintiff filed a six-count complaint against Dunham and Century that was later removed to this Court. Counts I, II, and III are directed at Dunham for negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty, respectively. Counts\n   IV, V, and VI are directed at Century, also for negligence, strict liability and breach of warranty, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dunham had previously moved to dismiss the counts against it under Missouri's \"innocent seller\" statute-Section 573.762, RSMo. While acknowledging the issues involved presented a \"close call,\" this Court ultimately denied Dunham's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

On the other hand, if the danger was known only to a select few- such as vintage gun enthusiasts or specialty gun shops primarily trading in vintage firearms-this vague allegation by itself cannot arise to the level of suggesting Dunham, specifically, knew or had reason to know of a dangerous condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6885228\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/454/341/#p347\">\n    454 S.W.3d at 347-348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo.

Instead, plaintiff focuses on Dunham's failure to warn of the rifle's \"dangerous propensities when the rifle was put to its normal and intended use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A strict liability failure-to-warn claim (as contrasted with a negligent failure-to-warn claim) focuses upon the product rather than the conduct of the manufacturer or seller.\n   <em>\n    Spuhl v.

App. E.D. 1990). Given that the focus is upon the product and not the seller or the seller's conduct, the innocent seller statute would seem to bar plaintiff's strict liability claim if that was all that remained at issue in this case. In this respect, plaintiff's strict liability claim would be against Dunham merely because of its status as a seller of the product-at-issue, having no concern over whether Dunham engaged in additional conduct beyond that of a seller. Indeed, as\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   points out, Section 537.762 seeks to protect a seller except against \"its own negligence or other conduct other than its status as a seller,\" which a strict liability claim does not concern itself with.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11829904\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/177/#p181\">\n    965 S.W.2d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, as will be explained, Dunham did not provide a warranty-or at least not one that would apply to plaintiff's particular injury. As such, there is no \"negligence or other conduct other than [Dunham's] status as a seller\" for which a strict liability failure-to-warn claim can piggyback on.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11829904\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/177/#p181\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMahon v.

Where it is unclear who the manufacturer of the product-at-issue was, or where it is otherwise unclear that a total recovery can be had against the parties remaining in suit, it is error to apply the innocent seller statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11829904\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/965/177/#p181\">\n    965 S.W.2d at 183-184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, of course, Dunham is neither the manufacturer nor designer of the Mosin-Nagant. In the absence of the true manufacturer / designer as a party-defendant in this suit, perhaps Century, as the only accessible up-stream defendant, can satisfy a total recovery in plaintiff's favor should he win at trial. But, many of Century's arguments are similarly based on the idea that it, too, had no duty to plaintiff since it neither manufactured nor designed the Mosin-Nagant. In fact, Dunham mostly adopts Century's arguments. All in all, it is unclear-and Dunham makes no effort to explain-what might transpire for purposes of Section 537.762.2 should the Court grant Dunham protection as an innocent seller. Accordingly, Dunham is given innocent seller status, but the protection of that status is contingent on a full recovery from Century in the event Century is found liable. The motion for summary judgment on count II is, therefore, denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

In the event of an accident discharge, no injury can occur if the barrel is pointed in a safe direction.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff seizes upon the second sentence for asserting liability against Dunham. But, for whatever legal ramification that sentence may have, it is not a warranty-or, at minimum, is not a warranty applicable to plaintiff's asserted theory of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Indeed, \"[a] warranty is a statement or representation made by the\n   seller of goods ... having reference to the\n   <em>\n    character, quality, or title\n   </em>\n   of the goods ... on which it is intended that the buyer shall rely in making the purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

The elements for a breach of express warranty claim are that: (1) the defendant sold a good to the plaintiff; (2) the seller made a statement of fact about the kind or quality of the good; (3) the statement of fact was a material factor inducing the buyer to purchase the good; (4) the good did not conform to the statement of fact; (5) the non-conformity injured the buyer; and (6) the buyer notified the seller of the non-conformity in a timely fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Renaissance Leasing, LLC v.

But, it is difficult to surmise how the above statement makes any express reference to quality. Instead, the statement appears to be more of an instructional warning against careless handling than an express warranty as to the particular quality of the rifle. Moreover, in the same document there is a disclaimer of \"all warranties\" that also includes language by Dunham that the rifle has been in storage, packed in grease and oil for many years, and must be inspected before use-suggesting Dunham made clear to plaintiff (who admits to not having the gun inspected) that the rifle did not possess a ready-to-use quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even to the extent the statement could be construed as some sort of warranty, it does not have a causal relationship to the injuries suffered by plaintiff. As Dunham points out, plaintiff has done nothing to show how elements four (non-conformity of the statement of fact) and five (injury caused by the non-conformity) can be demonstrated at trial. The facts of this case do not pertain to an accidental discharge in which injury resulted from the barrel of the gun even though it was pointed in a safe direction; instead, despite plaintiff's attempt to paint the picture that the gun \"exploded,\" the undisputed facts indicate only that the bolt mechanism of the rifle blasted back into plaintiff's face (having nothing to do with the barrel or what direction it was pointed) during an intentional discharge of the rifle. This is a result altogether different than what is embraced by the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In short, the statement by Dunham cannot reasonably be interpreted to act as a warranty covering the injuries suffered by plaintiff. Therefore, summary judgment will be granted to Dunham on count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Count IV-Negligence Against Defendant Century\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's negligence claim is that because the rifle can be fired \"out of battery,\" it has a \"design flaw,\" \"is dangerous,\" and Century, therefore, had a duty to \"warn[ ] potential purchasers of the known dangers.\" Century counters, citing the \"Missouri strict liability statute,\" that \"the product was not in a defective condition when it was sold [because] [p]laintiff created the 'defective' condition himself when he reassembled the rifle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Distinctions between negligence and strict liability aside, the parties spend the majority of their briefing arguing about design-related aspects of the rifle-such as whether it has an \"adjustable firing pin.\" Adjustable or not, both defendants' experts seems to agree that the rifle\n   can become \"extremely dangerous\" when \"in the condition of an improperly adjusted firing pin,\" which permits the \"rifle's bolt self-engaging feature [to be] circumvented.\" This is a rifle, plaintiff argues, that is known to be dangerous because its safety features are susceptible to being circumvented through misassembly. This problem, plaintiff maintains, gives rise to a duty to warn and to provide adequate cleaning and assembly instructions. Ultimately, these are matters to be decided by the fact-finder, and summary judgment is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Count V-Strict Liability Against Defendant Century\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's strict liability failure to warn claim is predicated on the same facts as plaintiff's negligent failure to warn claim. That is, \"there are no warnings provided anywhere with the subject rifle that warns of the dangers of the adjustable firing pin or ability of the gun to fire out of battery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The elements of a strict liability failure to warn claim are: (1) the defendant sold the product in question in the course of its business; (2) the product was unreasonably dangerous at the time of sale when used as reasonably anticipated without knowledge of its characteristics; (3) the defendant did not give adequate warning of the danger; (4) the product was used in a reasonably anticipated manner; and (5) the plaintiff was damaged as a direct result of the product being sold without an adequate warning.\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

The key issue in a failure to warn case is whether the information included with the product \"effectively communicates to the consumer or user the dangers that inhere in the product during normal use and the dangerous consequences that can or will result from misuse or abnormal use of the product.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9966660\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/707/371/#p382\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, \"a warning, no matter how well stated or placed, is inadequate if it has no reasonable likelihood of reaching a foreseeable user[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

App. W.D. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Century's first defense is that it did, in fact, provide an adequate \"white tag\" warning, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"WARNING: If this is a used or surplus firearm, it is not new, therefore, it must be inspected by a qualified gunsmith before firing.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   And also a user manual that further warned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Ensure bolt head is properly installed before attempting to fire this rifle. Failure to do so will result in property damage and personal injury.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It is Century's position that plaintiff simply failed to heed these warnings; therefore, \"the alleged failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of his subsequent injuries.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Under these circumstances, however, this Court cannot award summary judgment in favor of Century. Foremost, the parties disagree whether the white tag warning and the user manual encompass the particulars that led to plaintiff's injury. Century points to its manual, for example, that says improper bolt-head installation may lead to injury, but it is plaintiff's primary theory that the actual instructions given to ensure proper assembly- notwithstanding the manual's general warning-were inadequate. Indeed, plaintiff states that he \"disassembled and reassembled the rifle in accordance with the instruction manual,\" but nonetheless suffered injury from a mechanical failure with the bolt mechanism the next day. Ultimately, a factual dispute lies at the base of their arguments about whether the warnings\n   given were sufficient to instruct against the dangers that befell plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pitman v. Ameristep Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272559\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/1053/#p1060\">\n    208 F.Supp.3d 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062 (E.D. Mo. 2016) (factual dispute regarding adequacy and detail of warnings and instructions precluded summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition, because the parties agree that plaintiff's injury resulted following an attempt to reassemble his Mosin-Nagant after cleaning it, it is not altogether clear what effect Century's white tag warning (urging inspection by a gunsmith) would have had were it heeded by plaintiff. As the Court understands plaintiff's argument, the design of the rifle is such that user errors are possible when reassembling the rifle. Thus, even had a gunsmith inspected the rifle, it is plausible to believe plaintiff may have returned home, cleaned his rifle, and committed the same assembly error notwithstanding the inspection. Century asserts that it was likely a gunsmith would have noticed the mis-assembly issues upon inspection, but that assumes the inspection followed\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   plaintiff attempted to clean the rifle and reassemble it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Century's second defense is the so-called \"state-of-the-art defense\" under Section 537.764, RSMo. This acts as a \"complete defense\" in a strict liability failure to warn claim when \"the dangerous nature of the product was not known and could not reasonably be discovered at the time the product was placed into the stream of commerce.\" \u00a7 537.764.1, RSMo. Thus, the question is whether the dangerous condition was \"scientifically knowable\" at the time the product entered into the stream of commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Yazoo Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505840\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/26/81/\">\n    26 F.3d 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 n.2 (8th Cir. 1994). Century wants to focus on Imperial Russia's conduct at the early, developmental stages of the Mosin-Nagant in an attempt to push the timeline as far back as the late 1890s or early 1900s. But, the parties appear to agree that manufacturing of the rifle was not discontinued until the early 1960s-more than half a century. These two bookends, in themselves, tell this Court nothing about when, specifically, the rifle entered into the stream of commerce. And Century provides no law to suggest that a product enters into the stream of commerce when a sovereign government first manufactures a military weapon for its own internal use. Moreover, there are no facts present to indicate when Russia first began selling the rifle to other governments, military groups, or to the public-at-large. Even if such facts were provided, it is also unclear that inter-governmental transactions-to the extent they might be relevant-would be deemed \"commercial\" under Missouri state law. Without knowing the particular timeframe for which to apply Section 537.764, Century's state-of-the-art defense is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Count VI-Breach of Implied Warranty Against Defendant Century\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint makes clear that count VI arises under \u00a7 400.2-314 RSMo., which pertains to a warranty mandatorily implied by statute. Thus, to the extent the complaint and the parties' briefings discuss the effects of alleged express warranties arising from Dunham's safety notice (which wouldn't apply to Century in any event) or Century's user manual, such discussions are irrelevant for purposes of count VI. The only dispute, then, appears to be whether plaintiff can prove the Mosin-Nagant sold to him was not \"merchantable\" when sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Section 400.2-314 creates an implied warranty of merchantability, which \"warrants that goods must be at least fit for the ordinary purposes of which such goods are used.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Renaissance Leasing, LLC. v.

Said differently, Section 400.2-314 ensures a product lives up to \"minimum level of quality,\" or, simply, \"merchantable.\"\n   <em>\n    Hope v. Nissan North Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316465\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/68/#p91\">\n    353 S.W.3d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91 (Mo.

Mo. Jul. 12, 2013). Thus, the elements of a merchantability claim under Section 400.2-314 are: (1) a merchant sold the good; (2) the good was not \"merchantable\" at the time of the sale; (3) the plaintiff or his property suffered injury and damages; (4) said injury and damages were caused by the defective nature of the good; and (5) the seller had notice of the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Ragland Mills, Inc. v.

App. S.D. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As noted, the only dispute is over element two: whether the Mosin-Nagant was \"merchantable\" at the time it was sold to plaintiff. Again, Century argues it has been established \"that the [rifle] was not defective when it was sold by Century [and that] it was plaintiff who created the dangerous condition by improperly reinstalling the firing pin.\" But, as explained above, it is not altogether clear that the rifle was not unreasonably dangerous when sold in relation specifically to its bolt mechanism, firing pin, and the warnings/instructions provided regarding reassembly after cleaning. Even if plaintiff had misassembled the rifle after cleaning it, liability attaches to foreseeable misuse.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314674\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/365/226/#p235\">\n    365 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   237 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nesselrode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9966660\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/707/371/#p382\">\n    707 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   381 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Century's conclusion that the rifle sold to plaintiff was \"not defective\" does not defeat count VI. What makes a product \"merchantable\" is a broad concept, encompassing a number of aspects such as fitness for ordinary use, adequacy of packaging and labeling, and conformity of any affirmations of fact made on any labels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 400.2-314(2)(c), (e), (f). Again, there is conflicting expert testimony suggesting the rifle has \"no defects\" yet can become \"extremely dangerous\" when \"improperly adjust[ing the] firing pin.\" There is also plaintiff's argument that documentation provided by Century was either inaccurate, insufficient, or simply non-existent in elucidating the dangers inherent in cleaning and reassembling the Mosin-Nagant's bolt mechanism. Accordingly, the Court believes the issue of merchantability is sufficiently disputed and, therefore, declines to grant summary judgment to Century on count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Under Rule 10(b), \"if doing so would promote clarity, each claim founded on a separation transaction or occurrence ... must be stated in a separate count[.]\" Fed. R. Civ.

The Court will not do so, here. However, plaintiff's complaint-including count III-suffers many of the criticisms of a \"shotgun pleading\" and, in considering count III here on summary judgment, it will be treated solely as a claim for breach of an express warranty notwithstanding any opaque references to Section 400.2-314.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
