Philly Auto contends that the City demolished the building without notice and a hearing, depriving it of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and substantive due process under the Fourth Amendment. The City maintains that because the building posed an imminent threat to public safety, an emergency existed, requiring quick action. Thus, the dispositive question is whether the City's demolishing the building was to alleviate an imminently dangerous condition or was arbitrary.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment. Philly Auto claims that there was no emergency justifying the City's failure to provide due process. It contends that the City acted pursuant to a policy or custom, exposing it to municipal liability. The City contends that it acted pursuant to emergency powers that allow it to demolish a building immediately and without notice if necessary for public safety. It denies that it has any policy or custom of demolishing buildings without notice outside of an emergency.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  There are disputed issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. Foremost, there is the question of whether the building's condition created an imminent danger to public safety. This calls for a factual determination. There is also a question of whether the City has a policy or custom of demolishing buildings without notice. Thus, we shall deny the motions for summary judgment.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Fire and Notice to Philly Auto\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A fire occurred at Philly Auto's warehouse located at 4200 Torresdale Avenue in Philadelphia overnight on Friday, April 28, to Saturday, April 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The roof collapsed and the walls partially collapsed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Michael Farley, a Unit Inspector with the City's Department of Licenses and Inspections (L &amp; I), arrived at the property on the day of the fire on April 29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He ordered an emergency demolition of the rear wall because it was in danger of collapse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Determining that the property was \"imminently dangerous,\" meaning that he believed that it would collapse in the next six months, he posted notice to that effect on the front door.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice remained on the door until at least May 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Philly Auto, which is owned by Alex Landa and Roman Gamburg, also owns a car dealership two blocks away at 4530 Torresdale Avenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the day of the fire, Byron Bonilla, a finance manager there, went to the property to view the damage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   He was advised that the City would remove some, and possibly all, of the rear wall.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bonilla informed Gamburg and Landa of the fire on Sunday, April 30, and Monday, May 1, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 1, two days after the fire, the City generated a \"Final Notice of Violation and Order - Imminently Dangerous Building\" (the May 1 Notice) addressed to Landa's home in Los Angeles, the address registered with the City for communications concerning the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The May 1 Notice advised that L &amp; I had inspected the property on April 29 and \"declared it Imminently Dangerous, in whole or in part.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It instructed Philly Auto to retain an engineer to inspect the property and to make repairs in accordance with the engineer's written recommendations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Philly Auto failed to do so, it warned, the City would demolish the property and bill Philly Auto for the cost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The May 1 Notice informed Philly Auto that it could appeal the \"Imminently Dangerous\" designation in writing to the Boards Administration Unit within five days.

The answer to this question depends on the resolution of credibility and contradictory facts, all matters within the province of the jury. The jury could find the fact that Gallagher would have delayed the demolition if Philly Auto had contacted him inconsistent with his assertion that an emergency existed. Likewise, it could find that Philly Auto's alleged failure to act improperly factored into his decision to proceed to demolition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bullard v.
