STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a 48 year-old woman with a GED and some specialized schooling. [Administrative Record (\"AR\") 248, 285] She seeks judicial review of SSA's decision denying her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. Pl.'s Br., ECF No. 13 at 1-2. Plaintiff filed her application for disability insurance benefits in June 2014 alleging that her disability began in September 2009 and her application for supplemental security income in September 2014 alleging that her disability began in February 2013. [AR 221, 225]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The applications were initially denied on October 30, 2014. [AR 156, 160] After Plaintiff's request for review, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") conducted an evidentiary hearing and issued a written ruling on October 18, 2016. [AR 32-45, 51-98] In that ruling, the ALJ denied Plaintiff's application on the basis that she was not disabled because, considering her age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, Plaintiff could perform jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy. [AR 44]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The SSA Appeals Council subsequently denied Plaintiff's administrative request for review of the ALJ's determination, making SSA's denial final for the purpose of judicial review. [AR 1-4];\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.981\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.1481. Plaintiff timely filed her Complaint with this court seeking review of SSA's final decision. ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's claims on appeal relate to her mental health and her neck, back, and arm. Her injuries mainly stem from an assault that occurred in 2009 where she was severely injured in her home. [AR 828-30]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A month after the assault, Plaintiff visited the Summit Medical Clinic where she was examined by Todd Knauf, PA. [AR 659-61] Plaintiff noted numerous maladies including: memory loss; severe, infrequent headaches; severe neck pains; numbness and tingling in her right arm; and trouble sleeping. [AR 659] Mr. Knauf noted that\n   Plaintiff had a decreased range of motion in her neck and appeared mildly distressed. [AR 660] He assessed Plaintiff with severe neck pain, severe headaches, numbness and tingling in her right arm, and right arm pain. [AR 660-61] A neurologist diagnosed her with a concussion. [AR 673]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March and June 2010, Mr. Knauf added diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorder and advised her to seek counseling. [AR 683, 690] In December, Plaintiff presented symptoms of chronic nausea and headaches and acute vomiting and Mr. Knauf ordered an MRI of her brain. [AR 701-02] Plaintiff returned a few weeks later, reporting another assault and was diagnosed with cervicalgia and lumbago-neck and lower back pain. [AR 707] A radiology report from that month read that Plaintiff had mild degenerative changes in her cervical and lumbar spine. [AR 888-89]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2011, Plaintiff complained of continued fatigue and depression, but was afraid to take depression medication prescribed to her. [AR 718] An MRI showed minimal changes when compared to a 2009 MRI. [AR 354] In May, Mr. Kanuf diagnosed Plaintiff with vertigo. [AR 730] In July, Plaintiff began therapy at Aspen Pointe with Lyndsay Ross, PsyD writing that Plaintiff felt as though she was having a nervous breakdown and social anxiety. [AR 360]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2012, Dr. Ross noted that Plaintiff had been feeling more emotionally stable, but reported continued issues with family. [AR 464] That same month, Plaintiff reported to Mr. Knauf moderate right arm pain that did not limit daily activities and chronic depression. [AR 742] In March, Pratheep Arora, MD of Summit Medical Clinic prescribed Plaintiff Xanax for anxiety and noted acute anxiety due to familial issues. [AR 404] In August, Dr. Ross wrote that Plaintiff reported that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   she has been avoiding problems in her life by isolating inside her house and avoiding social contact as well as several of her responsibilities. She reports her depression has decreased somewhat in intensity over the past 6 months, but that her anxiety and irritability are still very high. She states that she feels the way she did two years ago when she first initiated mental health treatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [AR 470]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October, Plaintiff visited Summit Medical Center, where her medicine for depression and anxiety was increased and she was prescribed medicine for muscle spasms in her shoulder. [AR 410] One month later, Plaintiff continued to experience neck and shoulder pain and was ordered to have an X-ray of her neck. [AR 411-12]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2013, Plaintiff presented to Maninder Bali, MD that she had stress dealing with people, poor memory when anxious, and excessive worrying. [AR 475] Dr. Bali noted a restricted affect, better mood, and an otherwise unremarkable psychiatric exam, but increased Plaintiff's prescription for Zoloft, continued her on Xanax, and started her on Prasozin. [AR 476-77] In March, Plaintiff reported to Dr. Bali that she was fired from her job and that she had severe pain in her neck. [AR 481] Dr. Bali increased her Zoloft prescription. [AR 483]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April, Plaintiff reported continued pain in her neck and Dr. Arora ordered an MRI of her cervical spine. [AR 415] That MRI showed mild to moderate disc degeneration in parts of her spine and severe disc degeneration in other parts \"with mild cord flattening by disc osteophyte.\" [AR 352-53]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In May, shortly after the MRI, Dr. Bali noted that Plaintiff still had depression and low energy with severe pain in her neck and back that made \"her daily work\n   impossible to be done.\" [AR 488] Dr. Bali added a prescription for Wellbutrin. [AR 490] Through June and July, Plaintiff continued her pain management with Dr. Arora. [AR 420-23]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In August, Dr. Bali wrote that Plaintiff had nightmares related to the anniversary of her assault and that post-traumatic stress disorder made her unable to work. [AR 495] In September and December 2013 and March 2014, Plaintiff reported to Dr. Bali that she had no concerns and her mood was stable and Dr. Bali renewed her medication. [AR 502, 504, 509, 515]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June, Plaintiff saw Jay Balestrieri, NP, who noted neck and arm pain. [AR 379] In July, Dr. Bali noted that Plaintiff was \"[q]uite depressed\" and increased her medication. [AR 523] In August, Plaintiff had an X-ray of her right shoulder with no remarkable findings, but that pain continued into September. [AR 584, 765] Dr. Bali wrote that Plaintiff was still doing well on her medication regime, but added an adjunct to assist with obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. [AR 608] After Plaintiff had an MRI on her shoulder, Mr. Knauf assessed her with cervicalgia and cervical radiculopathy. [AR 768]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Victor Nwanguma, MD performed a consultative exam on Plaintiff. [AR 589] Dr. Nwanguma wrote that Plaintiff was awake, alert and in no acute distress. [AR 590] He diagnosed Plaintiff with \"[c]ervical spinal stenosis, chronic with right upper extremity radiculopathy.\" [AR 592] He provided a functional assessment where he wrote that Plaintiff \"may have frequent limitation performing activities requiring use of the right upper extremity due to radiculopathy from cervical spinal stenosis ;\" limited her to carrying 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently; and suggested occasional limitation with reaching, handling, fingering, and feeling. [AR 592-93]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In November, Plaintiff reported continued shoulder and neck pain alongside dizziness. [AR 772] Dr. Arora added medicine for the dizziness. [AR 773] A lumbosacral spine X-ray lead to an impression of mild spondylosis and facet joint arthropathy. [AR 776] Dr. Arora assessed Plaintiff with cervical radiculopathy. [AR 777]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In December, Plaintiff saw Dr. Bali and cried throughout the interview, where she noted stress regarding her family and asked for medicine to control her insomnia. [AR 612-14] Mr. Knauf assessed Plaintiff was spinal stenosis in her cervical region and restarted her on hydrocodone. [AR 786]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In January and May 2015, Plaintiff reported no concerns to Dr. Bali and she planned on continuing her regimen. [AR 619-21, 626] Plaintiff again reported to Mr. Knauf neck and shoulder pain and Mr. Knauf assessed her with cervical degenerative disc disease. [AR 790] In March she was assessed with spinal stenosis in her cervical region and in April, she was assessed with cervicalgia. [AR 795]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In June 2015, Plaintiff established care with Value Care Health Clinic, where it was noted that her depressive disorder was chronic but well controlled and that her cervical spine stenosis was chronic and unchanged. [AR 897] Plaintiff reported it to be stable, but it was noted that she had slight right arm and hand weakness. [AR 899-900] Through July and August, Plaintiff's pain continued, but was controlled, and additional MRIs were ordered. [AR 901-09] In September, Plaintiff began therapy after being retraumatized when she witnessed an assault. [AR 114] Tracy Kinsley, LPC noted an unremarkable mental status exam. [AR 114-15] Ms. Kinsley saw Plaintiff over the next few months and showed some improvement, but eventually stopped going. [AR 126] In September, Dr.\n   Bali reported that Plaintiff was stable, but was sleeping poorly. [AR 632]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In December, Michael McKisic, MD evaluated Plaintiff and wrote that she had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   an MRI demonstrating central canal neural foraminal stenosis, most notably at C5-C6, but also at C6-C7. This is not causing any cord compression or signal change in the cord. The C5-C6 stenosis is more on the right. Her cervical spine is straight and very slightly kyphotic. In terms of her neurologic examination, she is essentially intact, except for some slight numbness to pinprick over the lateral aspect of her right forearm and dorsum of her hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [AR 927]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Bali wrote that Plaintiff planned to have surgery for her diagnosis of cervical stenosis and that she felt \"very depressed all the time.\" [AR 638] At Value Care Health Clinic, Plaintiff reported that she was unable to walk or stand for long periods of time. [AR 910] She was diagnosed with lumbago and X-rays were ordered, which showed advanced degenerative disc disease. [AR 913, 919]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In February 2016, Plaintiff reported to Dr. Bali that she was feeling great on her current regimen. [AR 644] In March, Plaintiff was seen again by Dr. McKisic who noted her symptoms were worsening and suggested a two-level discectomy and fusion surgery. [AR 947] However, Plaintiff eventually stated that she was afraid to have surgery and was referred to physical therapy. [AR 914-16] In May, Dr. Bali noted that Plaintiff's obsessive behaviors were increasing and she modified her medication. [AR 652]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In December, Anthony Ricci, PhD performed a psychology evaluation on Plaintiff. [AR 20-30] Dr. Ricci concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Based on her clinical presentation. history, and screening psychological testing, it is my opinion within a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that Jessica Medina is continuing to manifest unresolved, and probably consolidated, mild PTSD features associated with the assault in 2009. There are chronic and acute elements in her presentation with trauma rekindling as a major consideration in light of her vulnerability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [AR 29] Dr. Ricci stated it was \"very evident\" that Plaintiff required surgery regarding her neck and arm issues and opined that Plaintiff needed psychological assistance involving her decisions regarding the surgery. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Dr. Ricci concluded that Plaintiff was significantly impaired in her ability to perform daily activities and routines and that without improvement she would not be able to perform competitive employment tasks.

[AR 42] The ALJ recounted Plaintiff's mental impairment allegations and reviewed Dr. Bali's records. The ALJ wrote that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [I]n January 2013, the claimant reported a better mood, but had a constricted affect. Dr. Bali noted she had normal speech, goal-oriented thought process, no abnormalities in thought content or perceptions, and fair insight, judgment, and cognition. [She] further indicated that the claimant was not gravely disabled. The claimant reported on February 20, 2013 that she had low level[s] of depression until her anxiety and irritability increase[d], which increase[d] her symptoms of depression. She rated her anxiety 7/10. She also stated that she quit working because she did not want to be around others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [AR 42 (internal citations omitted) ] The ALJ added that \"[a]s to her mental impairments, the claimant has not sought counseling since May 2014, which is not consistent with disabling symptoms.\" [AR 43]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff disputes this reasoning by pointing to Dr. Bali's explanation of her treatment history with Plaintiff. Plaintiff's counsel interviewed Dr. Bali, where she confirmed that she had been Plaintiff's psychiatrist for one-and-a-half to two years. [AR 101] She stated that Plaintiff's conditions were unpredictable because she would see improvement in mood, but Plaintiff's \"depression and her insomnia are something very difficult to treat, and she has failed some [medications].\" [AR 102] Dr. Bali noted that she thought that Plaintiff was truthful in her statements and she explained her diagnoses. [AR 101-02] She added Plaintiff's condition was a \"like a cycling process\" where Plaintiff would do well, but then she would be severely depressed for a few months. [AR 104]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff also points out that she has indeed sought counseling past 2014.

My review of the records, noted\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   highlight that this fluctuation did indeed occur. This fact, coupled with Plaintiff's additional counseling past the date mentioned by the ALJ, means that the ALJ should reconsider the weight he gave to Dr. Bali's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    2.

[AR 42] The ALJ supported this decision by noting that the exam accompanying the statement \"only noted moderate tenderness, which is inconsistent with an inability to work for more than two hours at a time.\" [AR 42-43]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, the exam report was more thorough than that. Plaintiff presented to Mr. Knauf with dizziness, described as \"lightheadedness, faintness, a spinning sensation and loss of balance.\" [AR 772] Additionally noted was Plaintiff's description of neck and shoulder pain.

[AR 768] Multiple X-rays and MRIs were ordered and neck and joint pain were consistently noted. [AR 765-77] Weeks after Mr. Knauf's statement, Mr. Knauf noted that Plaintiff had numbness and tingling in both hands related to cervical radiculopathy. [AR 777]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To summarily give no weight to Mr. Knauf's statement without further explanation of the context surrounding his statement leads me to believe the weight given to the ALJ was not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Plaintiff contests the reliability of Dr. Enright's opinion because Dr. Enright did not perform a psychological interview, consultation,\n   or any psychiatric or psychological testing of Plaintiff. ECF No. 16 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The ALJ gave great weight to Dr. Enright's opinion, as he was \"the only medical source to review the entire medical record and listen to the claimant's testimony.\" [AR 43] The ALJ noted Dr. Enright's analysis of Plaintiff's mental impairments and further noted that Dr. Enright \"declined to assess the claimant's functional limitations, citing the lack of objective findings in Dr. Bali's notes.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In her Reply, Plaintiff explains the fault in the ALJ's reasoning. ECF No. 24 at 1-4. During the hearing, in his explanation to the ALJ on his evaluation of Plaintiff's mental impairments, Dr. Enright stated that he read the entire record. [AR 84] Then, he stated that he disregarded Plaintiff's counsel's interview with Dr. Bali as it \"looks like some kind of testimony from [Dr. Bali]...but that's not a medical record.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Dr. Enright went on to speak about Dr. Bali's treatment notes and explained that sufficient information did not exist that would allow Dr. Enright to \"understand the level of severity with regard to functional limitation.\" [AR 85] Dr. Bali's interview with Plaintiff's counsel could well provide context that would have modified Dr. Enright's analysis of Dr. Bali's medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Since the ALJ gave great weight to Dr. Enright's opinion, but Dr. Enright explicitly did not review a contextual piece of evidence from Dr. Bali, the ALJ must reconsider the weight he gave to Dr. Enright's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Dr. Ricci's examination occurred in December 2016 and the ALJ wrote his decision on October 18, 2016. [AR 20, 45] The Appeals Council rejected Dr. Ricci's opinion because it occurred after the ALJ's decision and as such did \"not relate to the period at issue\" and did \"not affect the decision about whether [Plaintiff was] disabled beginning on or before October 18, 2016.\" [AR 2] Plaintiff contends that the Appeals Council rationale for rejecting the opinion was improper as it is common that medical testing may occur after a hearing date but relate back to times relevant to the claim.
