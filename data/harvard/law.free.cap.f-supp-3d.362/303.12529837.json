BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed an application for disability benefits under Title II on March 31, 2014, alleging disability beginning October 1, 2007. (Tr. 22). After his application was denied initially and upon reconsideration (Tr. 278, 286, 287), Plaintiff requested a hearing (Tr. 295). A hearing was held on November 16, 2016 (Tr. 22, 41, 342). On March 29, 2017, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (Tr. 19). Plaintiff's request for review by the Appeals Council was denied on December 4, 2017. (Tr. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The ALJ established that Plaintiff met the insured status requirement through June 30, 2013 and had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date of October 1, 2007. (Tr. 24). Then, the ALJ found Plaintiff had severe impairments of learning disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, narcissistic personality traits, history of substance abuse, and variously diagnosed mood disorder (depressive disorder /mood disorder/schizoaffective disorder ). (Tr. 24). The ALJ determined that none of these impairments nor any combination of the impairments met or medically equaled a per se disabled medical listing under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1. (Tr. 25). The ALJ then found that Plaintiff had the Residual Functional Capacity (\"RFC\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [T]o perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following nonexertional limitations: he is capable of performing simple routine, repetitive tasks. He should not perform fast-paced\n   or production rate work. He should have few if any workplace changes. He can have occasional interaction with the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Tr. 26). The vocational expert (\"VE\") testified that an individual with Plaintiff's RFC could not perform his past relevant work as a loan officer, DOT. No. 186.267-018; security guard, DOT. No. 372.667-034; general laborer, DOT. No. 519.686-010; and telephone sales person, DOT. No. 299.357-014. (Tr. 33). In response to a hypothetical that factored in Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, the VE testified that an individual with these limitations could perform jobs in the national economy and listed jobs, which exists in significant numbers in the national economy. (Tr. 33-34). Thus, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled, as defined in the Social Security Act. (Tr. 34). Plaintiff has exhausted all administrative remedies and now appeals. (Doc. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 405(g) of Title 42 of the United States Code provides judicial review of the Social Security Commissioner's denial of social security benefits. When examining a disability determination, a reviewing court is required to uphold the determination when an ALJ has applied correct legal standards and the ALJ's factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ;\n   <em>\n    Westmoreland Coal Co., Inc. v.

In her decision, the ALJ explained that she considered that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Plaintiff] reported he had a small group of friends with whom he interacted occasionally (citing Exhibit 1F/22). During vocational testing in 2008, [Plaintiff's] history of occasional troubles with interpersonal interactions on past jobs was noted, but none were observed during the evaluation. It concluded the [Plaintiff] needed an environment where he needed guidance, but was allowed to work independently (citing Exhibit 14F). The [Plaintiff] does not have a criminal history involving inappropriate interactions with others. Dr. Gay commented that at the conclusion of his inpatient treatment in March 2013, they saw 'a dramatic improvement in the patient's symptoms;' [Plaintiff] was calm, cooperative, and pleasant, interacting appropriately with staff and peers and having much improved grooming and hygiene. [Plaintiff's] underlying mild grandiosity 'may have still been present at the time of discharge, but certainly it was much improved' (citing Exhibit 3F/24). Dr. Almeida regularly commented that [Plaintiff] was always polite with her (citing Exhibit 3F). These comments show that when [Plaintiff] is compliant with is medication regimen and not abusing substances, he interacts better.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Tr. 25). While the Court recognizes that it is not necessary for an ALJ to address interactions with each category of individuals in her RFC determination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206249692\">\n    2018 WL 6249692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8, the ALJ's decision fails to explain why the requirement that Plaintiff be in an environment where he can receive guidance but work independently does not translate into a limitation on interacting with coworkers or supervisors. As it is currently articulated, the ALJ's decision does not resolve this potentially conflicting evidence, and it is not the Court's role to do so.\n   <em>\n    Hays\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541573\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/1453/#p1456\">\n    907 F.2d at 1456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Commissioner argues that the ALJ included a limitation in the RFC that directly accounted for her step-three finding, and that Plaintiff has failed to establish that further limitation in the RFC was warranted.

Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Commissioner, the ALJ specifically referenced evidence that Plaintiff needed an environment where he had guidance but would be allowed to work independently. (Tr. 25). However, these limitations are not accounted for in the RFC, and the ALJ's narrative discussion does not explain their omission. Without further explanation, the Court is \"left to guess about how the ALJ arrived at [her] conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mascio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074218\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/632/#p634\">\n    780 F.3d at 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the decision must be remanded to specifically address the question of whether Plaintiff needs limitations in his interactions with supervisors and coworkers or provide an explanation for why that is not necessary, including citing to specific evidence in the record.
