Andrews, United State District Judge\n   Presently before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. (D.I. 70). I have considered the parties' briefing. (D.I. 71, 78, 91). I heard oral argument on December 21, 2018. (D.I. 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 31, 2018, Plaintiff Cabela's brought an action against Matthew Highby, Molly Highby, and Highby Outdoors, LLC (collectively \"Defendants\") in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. (D.I. 1 \u00b6 1). Defendants removed the case from the Court of Chancery to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Cabela's has voluntarily dismissed without prejudice its claims against Highby Outdoors. (D.I. 17). I denied Defendants' motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to transfer to the District of Nebraska. (D.I. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cabela's brings claims for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets under the Nebraska Trade Secrets Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants Mr. and Mrs. Highby are former employees of Cabela's and the founders of Highby Outdoors. Both left Cabela's shortly after its merger with Bass Pro Group LLC (\"Bass Pro\"). (D.I. I \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5). Cabela's contract claims stem from two agreements-a Proprietary Matters Agreement (\"PMA\") and a Confidential Severance Agreement and General Release (\"Severance Agreement\"). (D.I. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 38-43). Each Defendant signed a PMA in exchange for company stock while employed (D.I. 1-1, exs. 1-2), and a Severance Agreement upon termination of employment (D.I. 1-1, exs. 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cabela's now moves for a preliminary injunction based on alleged violations of the PMA and misappropriation of trade secrets. (D.I. 70, 71). Specifically, Cabela's seeks to enjoin Defendants from violating the noncompetition, nonsolicitation, and confidentiality provisions of the PMA. (D.I. 70). The relevant sections of the PMA provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Access\n   </em>\n   .

Employee will not ... perform services within the United States of America or Canada for a Competitor that are the same as or similar to the services Employee performed for Company during the eighteen (18) month period immediately prior to the termination of Employee's employment. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Competitor\" of Company shall mean Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Sportsman's Warehouse, The Sportsman's Guide, Orvis, Dick's Sporting Goods, The Sport's Authority, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Scheels, L.L. Bean, Lands' End, REI, Academy, Amazon.com, Field &amp; Stream, Wholesale Sports, Sail, Le Baron, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Canadian Tire, The Fishin' Hole, Northwest Company, or any other multi-state, multi-province, and/or multi-channel retailer engaged in the sale of products and/or services associated with hunting, fishing, or camping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Restrictions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Tolling\n   </em>\n   .

Wellman\n   </em>\n   , is proceeding before the Delaware Court of Chancery. Like the Highbys, several defendants in\n   <em>\n    Wellman\n   </em>\n   are former Cabela's employees who signed a PMA in exchange for company stock. I believe the PMAs in\n   <em>\n    Wellman\n   </em>\n   are substantively identical to the PMAs in this case. Cabela's moved for preliminary injunction based in part on breach of the same PMA provisions at issue in this case. The Court of Chancery granted the motion in part, enjoining the defendants from violating the PMA nonsolicitation and confidentiality provisions.\n   <em>\n    Cabela's LLC v. Wellman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205309954\">\n    2018 WL 5309954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Del. Ch.

Cabela's Is Not Barred by Acquiescence or Estoppel from Asserting the PMA Against Defendants\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Defendants argue that Cabela's was aware of their plans to open a competing business and is therefore barred from asserting the PMA against Defendants by the doctrines of acquiescence and estoppel. (D.I. 78 at 17-18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \"A claimant is deemed to have acquiesced in a complained-of-act where he: has full knowledge of his rights and the material facts and (1) remains inactive for a considerable time; or (2) freely does what amounts to recognition of the complained of act; or (3) acts in a manner inconsistent with the subsequent repudiation, which leads the other party to believe the act has been approved.\"\n    <em>\n     Klaassen v.

The party claiming estoppel must show that he \"lacked knowledge or the means of obtaining knowledge of the truth of the facts in question; relied on the conduct of the party against whom estoppel is claimed; and suffered a prejudicial change of position as a result of his reliance.\"\n    <em>\n     Waggoner v.

Defendants assert that Mr. Highby openly discussed his intent to pursue Highby Outdoors while still employed at Cabela's. He claims to have contacted his supervisor Ed Larson (D.I. 79-1, Ex. 11 at 48:12-14, 50:14-23, 55:9-13), Cabela's Director of Inventory Mark Onstott (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 60:14-23), Bass Pro General Merchandise Manager Dean Snelson (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ), and Cabela's head of HR (also Mr. Highby's sister) Sarah Kaiser (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ), all of whom allegedly encouraged him to go ahead with the business. (D.I. 78 at 5-6). Moreover, Mr. Highby asserts that Mr. Larson informed him that the PMAs would no longer be enforced following the Bass Pro merger. (D.I. 78 at 5; D.I. 79-1, Ex. 11 at 47:11-20, 51:13-52:18). Mr. Highby also reached out to Cabela's Director of Real Estate Steven Krajewski about leasing land from Cabela's to open Highby Outdoors. Mr. Krajewski denied the request on the basis that Bass Pro would not lease a Cabela's building \"to any competitor,\" but did not specifically oppose the operation of Highby Outdoors. (D.I. 78 at 6; D.I. 79-1, Ex. 21).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Defendants rely heavily on Mr. Highby's testimony.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    As Cabela's notes, much of that testimony is inconsistent with other parts of the record. Mr. Larson denies both having encouraged Mr. Highby to develop a competitive business (D.I. 91-2, Ex. 63 at 25:7-11), and having informed Mr. Highby that the PMAs would not be enforced post-merger (D.I. 96, Ex. 64 at 47:21-48:22). Mr. Snelson testified that Mr. Highby only told him about his intent to open a business \"making pallets,\" which would not compete with Bass Pro/Cabela's. (D.I. 91-2, Ex. 59 at 22:14-24:14). Ms. Kaiser testified that she does not recall Mr. Highby ever contacting her to discuss a competitive business while he was still at Cabela's (D.I. 91-2, Ex. 58 at 50:24-51:9), and that she first learned about Highby Outdoors after Mr. Highby had left the company (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 54:13-16). Mr. Onstott has not been deposed. (D.I. 91 at 7 n.9; D.I. 107 at 31:1-4).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Based on the present record, it seems unlikely that Defendants will be able to meet their burden of showing either acquiescence or estoppel. It is unclear whether Mr. Highby actually sought approval for a competing business, let alone that approval was granted or acquiesced to. Mr. Highby's testimony is largely rebutted by the testimony of those he claims to have sought approval from, namely Mr. Larson,\n    Mr. Snelson, and Ms. Kaiser. Therefore, Cabela's has shown it is likely to succeed against Defendants' acquiescence and estoppel defenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     2. The PMA is Governed by Nebraska Law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The PMA includes a Delaware choice-of-law provision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Delaware follows the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (\"the Restatement\").\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     Coface Collections N. Am. Inc. v. Newton\n    </em>\n    , 430 Fed. App'x 162, 167 n.7 (3d Cir. 2011) ;\n    <em>\n     Wellman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205309954\">\n     2018 WL 5309954\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7. Under section 187(2) of the Restatement, the parties' choice of law will control an agreement unless (a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice, or (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which would be applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. The parties only dispute whether the second exception applies. (D.I. 71 at 9; D.I. 78 at 13).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The parties agree that absent the Delaware choice-of-law provision, Nebraska law would govern the PMA. (D.I. 71 at 8-9; D.I. 78 at 13). Thus, under section 187(2)(b) of the Restatement, Nebraska law applies if (i) application of Delaware law would be contrary to a fundamental policy of Nebraska, and (ii) Nebraska has a materially greater interest than Delaware in the PMA. I believe the PMA meets both elements and is thus governed by Nebraska law. For the reasons discussed below, I find both the noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions of the PMA invalid and unenforceable under Nebraska law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     a.

While Cabela's is correct that Nebraska law recognizes the protection of confidential information as a legitimate business interest, I think the PMA noncompetition restrictions go beyond what is reasonably necessary to protect that interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brockley v.

Section 1 of the PMA specifically addresses \"Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.\" (D.I. 1-1, Ex. 1 \u00a7 1). Section 7, the noncompetition provision, adds substantially more restrictions-with broad geographic bounds (U.S. and Canada), the provision essentially prohibits all work in the industry for eighteen months following termination. (\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5240506\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/241/449/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 7). I do not see why such restrictions are necessary, in addition to the nondisclosure provisions, to adequately protect Cabela's confidential information. Cabela's does not identify any circumstances that would warrant heightened protections. Thus, I find the noncompetition provision unenforceable under Nebraska law. Yet, I do not think it is so expansive as to be \"oppressive to an employee,\" and thus it would be enforceable under Delaware law.

In\n    <em>\n     Ascension\n    </em>\n    , the court applied California law despite a Delaware choice-of-law provision, because California policy, enshrined in statute, provides that \"every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20356002\">\n     2015 WL 356002\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 &amp; n.4 (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016600\">\n     Cal.

I disagree. As discussed in\n    <em>\n     Wellman\n    </em>\n    , Nebraska's policy is also set out in statute, which states, \"Any contract ... in restraint of trade or commerce shall be unlawful.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205309954\">\n     2018 WL 5309954\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059-1603\">\n     Neb.

Further, also noted in\n    <em>\n     Wellman\n    </em>\n    , Cabela's fails to support its proposition that a \"fundamental policy\" must be enshrined in statute, as opposed to clearly expressed through the common law.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2059-1603\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ; (D.I. 71 at 12 n.3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    I find the court's reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Wellman\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Ascension\n    </em>\n    persuasive. While Delaware's interest in freedom to contract is also related to a \"fundamental policy,\" it is a more general interest than Nebraska's. Enforcing the noncompetition provision of the PMA, which almost exclusively relates to events occurring in Nebraska, would be directly contrary to Nebraska's policy against contracts in restraint of trade. I believe Nebraska's interest in upholding that specific policy, in conjunction with the many facts tying this case to Nebraska, is both material and greater than Delaware's general interest in enforcing a choice-of-law provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Therefore, the PMA meets both elements of the section 187(2)(b) exception and Nebraska law applies.

However, I appreciate that it is difficult, looking forwards, to define what information will and will not be confidential over the course of employment. Nebraska law appears to recognize a broad interest in protecting confidential information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gaver\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=856%20N.W.2d%20121\">\n     856 N.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    131-31 ;\n    <em>\n     Boisen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2896346\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/neb/222/239/\">\n     383 N.W.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    34 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wellman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205309954\">\n     2018 WL 5309954\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *10 (upholding the PMA confidentiality provisions under Nebraska law).

Defendants Likely Breached the Confidentiality Provisions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Cabela's argues that Defendants had broad access to confidential information while employed. (D.I. 71 at 17). Access\n    alone, however, does not show that Defendants improperly disclosed or used such information. Cabela's provides evidence of two instances where Mr. Highby allegedly misappropriated Cabela's confidential information to develop Highby Outdoors. Both instances relate to information sent to Mr. Highby's personal email address. Defendants respond that there is no evidence that Mr. Highby used any of that information in breach of the PMA because, upon termination, he deleted all Cabela's information from his personal email, in accordance with Cabela's policy. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; D.I. 78 at 20 n.7). In the alternative, Defendants argue that such information \"is now valueless due to the passage of time and Bass Pro integration.\" (D.I. 78 at 7-10, 21-22).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    First, Cabela's argues that Mr. Highby \"requested and received forecasts for Highby Outdoors product categories, prepared by Cabela's employees while they were still employed by Cabela's and had access to Cabela's data.\" (D.I. 71 at 18). The record shows that Cabela's employees Wade Meier and Kendra Mitchell sent, to Mr. Highby's personal email address, three-year projections for Highby Outdoors of monthly sales figures for ammunition and cutlery, respectively. (D.I. 91-2, exs. 54, 55).\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    Both Mr. Meier and Ms. Mitchell later left Cabela's and joined Highby Outdoors. (D.I. 91-2, Ex. 51 at 29:8-13, Ex. 52 at 61:1-7). The emails were sent on March 28, 2018, shortly before Mr. Highby left Cabela's. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; D.I. 1-1, Ex. 4). Mr. Larson compared those figures to projections generated from Cabela's internal database and found that they matched within tenths of a percentage point. (D.I. 72 \u00b6\u00b6 2-5). Defendants claim that the three-year projections were not based on Cabela's confidential information. (D.I. 78 at 21-22). Mr. Meier testified that the data he sent Mr. Highby was a \"random guess\" at what business could be for Highby Outdoors. (D.I. 79-1, Ex. 23 at 67:2-69:5). Ms. Mitchell testified that she only had access to Cabela's backwards-looking data, as opposed to forward-looking projections. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    , Ex. 32 at 18:15-19:9).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Second, Cabela's asserts that two days prior to his departure, Mr. Highby forwarded from his Cabela's email to his personal email \"information for Cabela's merchandise regarding performance versus projected demand.\" (D.I. 71-2, Ex. 28). Defendants argue that Mr. Highby had a long-standing practice of forwarding emails to his personal address for ease of access while traveling. (D.I. 107 at 44:1-18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    I think Cabela's is likely to succeed on its breach of confidentiality claim, at least with respect to the three-year projections.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    It is hard to believe that one could generate data within tenths of a percentage point of the data generated from Cabela's internal database, without access to the confidential information in that database. I do not think Mr. Meier and Ms. Mitchell's testimony to the contrary is persuasive. I am also not persuaded by Defendants' argument that such information is \"valueless\" due to the passage of time and merger with Bass Pro. Cabela's remains a separate operating entity post-merger. (D.I. 107 at 64:21-65:6). Although\n    competition \"changes over time,\" I do not think Defendants are likely to show that the three-year projections generated in March of 2018 are now \"valueless\" simply due to the passage of time. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 78 at 7-8).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Defendants do not dispute that Mr. Meier and Ms. Mitchell generated the projections for Highby Outdoors. (D.I. 78 at 21-22;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    D.I. 79-1, Ex. 23 at 67:2-69:5; D.I. 91-2, Ex. 52 at 66:9-67:7). The fact that Mr. Highby deleted the information from his personal email account, if true, does not necessarily mean that he is no longer able to use to information to benefit Highby Outdoors. The proximity between the timing of the emails and Mr. Highby's departure from Cabela's, as well as the fact that both Mr. Meier and Ms. Mitchell are now employed by Highby Outdoors, supports Cabela's theory that Mr. Highby sought and will use the projections for his new competing business. Therefore, I find that Cabela's is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim for breach of confidentiality under the PMA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Cabela's Is Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits of its Trade Secrets Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    To succeed on a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, Cabela's must show:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    (1) the existence of a trade secret or secret manufacturing process; (2) the value and importance of the trade secret to the employer in the conduct of his business; (3) the employer's right by reason of discovery or ownership to the use and enjoyment of the secret; and (4) the communication of the secret to the employee while he was employed in a position of trust and confidence and under circumstances making it inequitable and unjust for him to disclose it to others or to use it himself to the employer's prejudice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     Richdale Dev.

Cabela's trade secrets claim is essentially the same as its breach of confidentiality claim. Cabela's argues that the confidential information that Defendants allegedly took and used also constitute trade secrets. (D.I. 71 at 20). Cabela's does not identify the existence of particular trade secrets. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-22).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Cabela's conclusory statement that whatever confidential information Defendants may improperly use or disclose also includes trade secrets is insufficient to meet its burden for misappropriation of trade secrets. Therefore, Cabela's has failed to show a likelihood of success on its trade secrets claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

Cabela's has also provided evidence that Highby Outdoors is meant to be a direct competitor. (D.I. 71-1, Ex. 2 at HBY-0000010 (Highby Outdoors business plan naming Cabela's and Bass Pro as competitors) ). Thus, in light of\n    <em>\n     Fres-co\n    </em>\n    and related Third Circuit caselaw, I think Cabela's has shown an imminent threat of misuse of the three-year projections sufficient to support a likelihood of irreparable harm absent an injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    It is important to note, however, the magnitude of the likely harm. The specific harm at issue-based on use of the three-year projections-is unlikely to result in substantial injury to Cabela's. The information relates to two specific categories of goods (ammunition and cutlery) and are estimates based on backwards-looking data. (D.I. 91-2, exs. 54, 55). Whatever value the projections have will inevitably decrease over time. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 78 at 7-8). Therefore, I find that Cabela's has shown a likelihood of irreparable, but minimal, harm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     C. The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Defendants assert that, as a practical matter, an injunction will put Highby Outdoors out of business. (D.I. 78 at 24). Defendants have leased office space and hired employees-expenses that they cannot afford if they are enjoined from starting operations. (D.I. 107 at 55:69 (stating that Highby Outdoors would fail within nine months) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Cabela's argues that Defendants are free to pursue other avenues of business, and to allow Defendants to continue with Highby Outdoors in violation of the PMA denies Cabela's the benefit of its bargain. (D.I. 71 at 24-25). Cabela's has a legitimate business interest in preventing the disclosure or misuse of its confidential information. Defendants voluntarily agreed to the PMA confidentiality terms and received valuable stock in return. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; D.I. 1-1, exs. 1-2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    There is a strong public interest in upholding contractual agreements.\n    <em>\n     Ride the Ducks of Phila., LLC v.

Cabela's has the right to enforce the PMA confidentiality provisions but may not use those provisions to obtain the benefits of the void noncompetition provision. An injunction based on the threatened breach of confidentiality is particularly concerning because, unlike the PMA noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions, the confidentiality provisions are not time limited. Further, Defendants do not have access to new confidential information, and the value of any information they do have will decrease over time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    On balance, I think the harm to Cabela's from possible misuse of the three-year projections is outweighed by the public interest in ordinary competition and the likelihood that an injunction would prevent Defendants from ever operating Highby Outdoors. Therefore, I find Cabela's has failed to establish that a preliminary injunction should be granted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
