SUMMARY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute arises from the foreclosure sale of property to satisfy a homeowners' association lien. Before the Court are Defendant SFR Investments Pool 1, LLC's (\"SFR\") motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 109); Plaintiff Bank of New York Mellon's (\"BONY\") motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 110); and Defendant Log Cabin Manor Homeowners Association's (\"HOA\") motion for partial summary judgment (ECF No. 115). The Court has reviewed the various joinders, responses, and replies thereto. (ECF Nos. 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 120, 121, 122, 123.) Because the Court agrees with SFR that the foreclosure sale at issue extinguished BONY's interest in the property, the Court grants SFR's and the HOA's motions for summary judgment and denies BONY's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deed of Trust History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Victoria J. Arboleda and Joaquin Valdez (\"Borrowers\") purchased property (\"Property\") located within the HOA at 8106 Making Memories Place, Las Vegas, NV 89131 on August 1, 2006. (ECF No. 110 at 3.) The Borrowers executed a note (\"the Note\") and first deed of trust (\"DOT\") in exchange for $ 285,660. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The DOT was assigned to BONY on November 29, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. HOA Lien and Foreclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Borrowers failed to pay HOA assessments, and the HOA recorded a notice of delinquent assessment lien on August 31, 2010, alleging that $ 513.02 was due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The HOA recorded a notice of default and election to sell under the HOA's lien through its agent, Allesi &amp; Koenig, LLC, on March 31, 2011, alleging that $ 1,824.88 was due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bank of America, N.A.-servicer of the loan at the time for the DOT beneficiary-paid the HOA $ 1,824.88. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The HOA subsequently released its lien. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The HOA recorded a new notice of delinquent assessment lien on March 8, 2012, through its agent Nevada Association Services (\"NAS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The HOA recorded a notice of default on April 24, 2012, alleging that $ 1,954.41 was due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The HOA recorded a notice of foreclosure sale on July 1, 2014, alleging that $ 3,344.53 was due to the HOA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The notice represented that the sale (\"HOA Sale\") would occur on July 25, 2014, but the HOA Sale was postponed and the HOA actually foreclosed on August 29, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113 at 22.) SFR purchased the Property at the HOA Sale for $ 49,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Complaint &amp; Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   BONY filed the Complaint on October 20, 2015, asserting the following claims: (1) quiet title/declaratory judgment against SFR; (2) injunctive relief against SFR; (3) violation of procedural due process against the HOA and SFR; (4) tortious interference with contract against the HOA; (5) breach of the duty of good faith against the HOA; (6) wrongful foreclosure against the HOA; and (7) deceptive trade practices against the HOA. (ECF No. 1 at 6-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SFR counterclaimed for quiet title. (ECF No. 14 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

SFR &amp; BONY'S MOTIONS (ECF NOS. 109, 110)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court addresses the issues raised in SFR and BONY's respective summary judgment motions collectively. SFR argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on its counterclaim for quiet title because the HOA Sale extinguished the DOT. (ECF No. 109 at 14.) BONY argues in its response as well as in its own motion for summary judgment that the HOA Sale was invalid because the statute governing the HOA Sale is unconstitutional and, alternatively, that it is entitled to equitable relief. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 110, 112.) The Court considers the constitutionality of the statute governing the HOA Sale- NRS \u00a7 116.3116 -before turning to BONY's request for equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Constitutionality of NRS \u00a7 116.3116\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   BONY argues that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , facially unconstitutional, and unconstitutional as applied, rendering the HOA Sale void. (ECF No. 110 at 5-10;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ECF No. 112 at 4-12.) SFR argues that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 is constitutional and further argues that BONY lacks Article III standing to challenge the constitutionality of NRS \u00a7 116.3116 on due process grounds. (ECF No. 109 at 8-13; ECF No. 113 at 6, 10-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   SFR argues that BONY lacks Article III standing to challenge NRS \u00a7 116.3116 on due process grounds because BONY received actual notice of the HOA Sale. (ECF No. 109 at 12; ECF No. 113 at 6.) But in the relevant cases that SFR cites, the plaintiffs challenged the method of notice-not the adequacy of the notice's content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehner v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525572\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/1187/#p1190\">\n    685 F.2d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1190 (9th Cir. 1982) (plaintiff argued that oral notice of foreclosure as opposed to written notice violated due process);\n   <em>\n    Wiren v.

Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (no challenge to notice's content). The difference is important because an individual who challenges the method of notice despite receiving actual notice \"has clearly been accorded due process in the application of the statute as to him personally.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1029056\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/542/757/#p762\">\n    542 F.2d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, BONY contends it has not personally received due process because the notice required under NRS \u00a7 116.3116 (via incorporation of NRS \u00a7 107.090 ) is inadequate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 112 at 9.) Accordingly, the Court finds SFR's argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Bourne Valley\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   BONY seems to base its argument about the constitutionality of NRS \u00a7 116.3116 in part on a Ninth Circuit decision that no longer controls:\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley Court Tr. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 110 at 2; ECF No. 112 at 2.) There, the Ninth Circuit found that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 violated mortgage lenders' due process rights by requiring mortgage lenders to \"opt in\" to receive notice of an HOA's intent to foreclose on a lien.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n    at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appellee argued that NRS \u00a7 116.3116 actually mandated notice to all junior lienholders-not just those who opted in-by incorporating the notice provision of NRS \u00a7 107.090, but the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected that argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n    at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit reasoned that reading the notice provision of NRS \u00a7 107.090 into NRS \u00a7 116.3116\"would impermissibly render the express notice provisions of Chapter 116 entirely superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350971\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1154/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Nevada Supreme Court had a different take on the interplay between NRS \u00a7 116.3116 and NRS \u00a7 107.090.

But NRS \u00a7 116.3116 indicated that the HOA's lien might have superpriority status, as evidenced by the Nevada Supreme Court's decision to that effect in\n   <em>\n    SFR Invs. Pool 1 v.

(ECF No. 110 at 4-5; ECF No. 112 at 6.) But at least in the abstract, notice of the time and place of the sale provides lenders with an opportunity to inquire about the amount of the superpriority lien. And even if the notice did not contain contact information for the HOA, lenders in theory could attend the foreclosure sale and inquire as to the amount of the superpriority lien. While as a practical matter HOAs tended to refuse to identify the superpriority amount when asked,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank N.A. v.

Notice of the time and place of the foreclosure sale does just that. Accordingly, the Court rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   BONY further argues that the sale violated due process as applied, asserting the same arguments that support its facial challenge. (ECF No. 110 at 8; ECF No. 112 at 8.) The Court questions whether BONY's argument actually constitutes an as-applied challenge to NRS \u00a7 116.3116 as opposed to a claim for violation of due process arising under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   but need not decide the issue because BONY's \"as-applied\" arguments fail for the same reasons as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   BONY additionally argues that adequate notice in the foreclosure context must include \"the reasons that the mortgage is in default\" and \"the amount that is due and owing\" (ECF No. 112 at 9), but the case BONY cites included no such holding. In\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Fed. Nat'l Mortg.

The Court finds this argument unpersuasive because the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   was predicated on an incorrect interpretation of Nevada law. In light of the Nevada Supreme Court's clarification of the correct interpretation of NRS \u00a7 116.3116,\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   simply has no force or effect as to the constitutionality of NRS \u00a7 116.3116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Equitable Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   BONY further argues that equitable relief is warranted. (ECF No. 110 at 10.) The Nevada Supreme Court has held that \"courts retain the power to grant equitable relief from a defective foreclosure sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Shadow Wood Homeowners Ass'n v. New York Cmty.

For instance, a court may set aside a sale where there is inadequacy of price as well as proof of slight evidence of fraud, unfairness, or oppression.\n   <em>\n    Nationstar Mortg., LLC v. Saticoy Bay LLC Series 2227 Shadow Canyon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20P.3d%20641\">\n    405 P.3d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643, 648 (Nev. 2017) (also stating inadequacy of price \"should be considered with any alleged irregularities in the sale process to determine whether the sale was affected by fraud, unfairness, or oppression\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Adequacy of sales price aside, BONY has not demonstrated fraud, unfairness or oppression. BONY first argues that the sale was unfair because the HOA represented in the covenants, conditions, and restrictions (\"CC&amp;Rs\") that the foreclosure sale would not extinguish the first\n   DOT. (ECF No. 110 at 10-11.) While a mortgage protection clause alone is insufficient evidence of unfairness to warrant setting aside an HOA foreclosure sale,\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon v. SFR Invs. Pool 1, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:17-CV-256-JCM-NJK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201002611\">\n    2018 WL 1002611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Nev. Feb. 21, 2018), BONY further argues that the HOA misrepresented the date of the HOA Sale. (ECF No. 110 at 11-12.) SFR argues that the foreclosure sale was lawfully postponed and adduces a \"certificate of postponement\" asserting that a representative of NAS appeared at the noticed time and place for the HOA Sale and announced the postponement to August 29, 2014. (ECF No. 113 at 22 (citing ECF No. 113-7 at 9).) BONY produces no evidence to dispute SFR's evidence of lawful postponement, and the Court disagrees with BONY that postponing the sale constitutes evidence of fraud, unfairness, or oppression. Accordingly, the Court denies BONY's request for equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Default Judgment Against the Borrowers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   SFR argues that it is entitled to summary judgment against the Borrowers. (ECF No. 109 at 19.) BONY does not object. (ECF No. 112 at 11.) The Court finds that default judgment is proper. SFR has satisfied the procedural requirements for default judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b). The Clerk properly entered defaults against the Borrowers under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) because the Borrowers failed to appear after having been properly served. (ECF Nos. 54, 55.) SFR has also satisfied the factors for obtaining default judgment articulated in\n   <em>\n    Eitel v. McCool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552461\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/1470/#p1471\">\n    782 F.2d 1470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1471 (9th Cir. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remaining Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court rejects as moot SFR's arguments about BONY's right of redemption (ECF No. 109 at 18) and BONY's prudential standing (ECF No. 113 at 6.) The Court also rejects as moot BONY's arguments about the conclusive deed recitations (ECF No. 112 at 10) and SFR's bona fide purchaser status (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Disposition of SFR &amp; BONY's Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As discussed above, the Court rejects BONY's challenges to the constitutionality of NRS \u00a7 116.3116 and to validity of the HOA Sale. The Court thus grants summary judgment in favor of SFR on all BONY's claims against it-quiet title/declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and violation of procedural due process-because the HOA Sale was valid and extinguished BONY's interest in the Property. SFR acquired title to the Property pursuant to the HOA Sale free and clear of the DOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Additionally, SFR's second counterclaim for preliminary and permanent injunction will be dismissed \"as the Court follows the well-settled rule that a claim for injunctive relief standing alone is not a cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204682334\">\n    2018 WL 4682334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    V. THE HOA'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF NO. 115)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   BONY advanced the following claims against the HOA: violation of procedural due process; tortious interference with contract; breach of the duty of good faith; wrongful foreclosure; and deceptive trade practices. (ECF No. 1 at 6-13.) The HOA moves for summary judgment on each of these claims except the claim for violation of procedural due process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 115 at 3.) The Court grants summary judgment on all of BONY's claims against the HOA, including the claim for violation of procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although the HOA did not move for summary judgment on BONY's claim for\n   violation of procedural due process, the Court will grant summary judgment on this claim sua sponte in light of the Court's findings as to the effect of the HOA Sale in extinguishing BONY's interest in the Property. Sua sponte summary judgment is appropriate because BONY had reasonable notice that the sufficiency of its claim would be at issue in the context of its summary judgment briefing relating to its claims against SFR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LN Mgmt.

(ECF No. 123 at 5.) The Court agrees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 121 at 5.) Moreover, BONY's claim seems to be premised on the HOA Sale having been \"intentional and wrongful,\" but the Court's findings do not support this argument. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To the contrary, because the HOA Sale was conducted pursuant to a statute- NRS \u00a7 116.3116 -that withstands BONY's constitutional challenge, BONY cannot assert that the HOA Sale was wrongful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Regarding BONY's claim for breach of the duty of good faith under NRS \u00a7 116.1113, the HOA argues that BONY lacks standing to pursue such a claim under NRS \u00a7 116.4117(2). (ECF No. 123 at 6.) NRS \u00a7 116.4117(2) limits who may bring a civil action for failure to comply with Chapter 116 to HOAs, a unit's owner, and a class of unit's owners. Given that BONY does not argue that it is among these groups entitled to bring suit for violation of Chapter 116 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 121 at 4-5), the Court agrees with the HOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Regarding BONY's claim for wrongful foreclosure, the HOA argues that BONY cannot prevail because it cannot show that the debtor was in default.

The Court agrees with the HOA because BONY concedes that it cannot satisfy an element of its claim and because the Court's findings do not support BONY's argument that the HOA foreclosed wrongfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding BONY's claim for deceptive trade practices, the HOA argues that BONY cannot prevail on its claim because NRS Chapter 598 only applies to goods and services-not real estate loan transactions. (ECF No. 123 at 7.) BONY responds that the HOA provided services in the form of enforcing a general plan for the maintenance, care, use, and management of the HOA neighborhood. (ECF No. 121 at 6.) The Court agrees with the HOA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of New York Mellon v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motions before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   It is therefore ordered that SFR's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 109) is granted.
