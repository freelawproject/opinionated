The Court, having reviewed the Motions and responses, and being otherwise advised in the premises, concludes that only Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Phillip Gray (\"Gray\") alleges that while he was a driver for Defendant Uber, Inc. (\"Uber\"), a passenger accused him of sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the accusation, Uber immediately deactivated Gray's account. Gray then filed a Complaint against Uber and the passenger. Gray alleges that Uber violated his constitutional rights because he was unable to respond to the harassment accusations before Uber suspended his account. According to Gray, Uber also told other companies and individuals about the accusation. So, Gray accuses Uber of defamation. Gray seeks one million dollars in actual and punitive damages. He also asks the Court to order Uber to produce the name and contact information of the unknown passenger who accused him of sexual harassment. Uber moves to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal policy favors arbitration over litigation.\n   <em>\n    Seaboard Coast Line R.

Uber argues that a valid agreement between Uber and Gray existed. And Gray does not dispute this fact. Instead, Gray argues that he opted out of arbitration. He also argues that Uber released him from the contract when it deactivated his account, and that Uber breached the contract which makes the contract \"null and void.\" Dkt. 12, p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By alleging that he opted out of the Arbitration Provision, Gray challenges whether an agreement to arbitrate exists.

Tonti stated that, based on Uber's records, Gray accepted the Services Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.

According to Tonti, when a driver decides to opt out of the Arbitration Provision, Uber keeps the opt-out notice in an electronic file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Uber's records reflect that Gray did not opt out of arbitration within thirty days of his acceptance of the Services Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gray submitted an affidavit stating that he opted out of the Services Agreement's Arbitration Provision \"over 3 years ago.\" Dkt. 12-1.

This Court has previously held (in relation to an identical Arbitration Provision) that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The Delegation Clause at issue here provides that \"disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   shall be decided by an Arbitrator and not by a court or judge.\" ... adjudication of Plaintiffs' attacks on the Arbitration Provision should be left to the arbitrator because it is clear and unmistakable that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Suarez v.
