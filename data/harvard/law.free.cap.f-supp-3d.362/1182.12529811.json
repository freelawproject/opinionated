In the interests of efficiency and judicial economy, all such Motions are adjudicated via this omnibus Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Nature of the Case.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter consists of multiple consolidated putative class action complaints purporting to assert claims for damages and equitable remedies arising from plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   use of a hair coloring product, Clairol Balsam Color (the \"Product\"). The four named plaintiffs whose claims are presently in play are Breonna Franks, Tara Taylor, Diane Bowden, and Carrie Bowens, all of whom are represented by the same or substantially the same counsel. Each plaintiff alleges that she sustained physical injuries (such as itching and burning of the scalp, hair loss and hair damage) arising from her use of the Product. On that basis, each plaintiff asserts substantially similar claims, including causes of action for unjust enrichment, violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, fraud, and negligent design/failure to warn. Certain plaintiffs also bring claims for violation of the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Named defendants include Coty Inc., The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, The Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing Company, Inc., The Proctor &amp; Gamble Distributing, L.L.C. and Procter &amp; Gamble Hair Care, L.L.C., each of which is alleged to have had some role in developing, designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distributing and/or selling the Product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background Facts.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Product and its Packaging.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The packaging of the Clairol Balsam Color hair dye product that plaintiffs used is significant to the claims and defenses presented here. The box in which the Product was distributed and marketed for retail sale contained various instructions, warnings and disclosures, including the following: (i) on the box top, a warning stating \"CAN CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS FOLLOW THE SAFETY WARNINGS;\" (ii) on the top flap of the box, an instruction to \"FOLLOW SAFETY WARNINGS, PERFORM THE SKIN ALLERGY TEST 48 HOURS BEFORE COLORING;\" (iii) on the side of the box, under the heading \"IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS,\" statements that \"HAIR CARE PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS, WHICH IN RARE CASES CAN BE SEVERE,\" that \"TATTOOS MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF ALLERGY TO THIS PRODUCT,\" and that the user should \"CONDUCT A SKIN ALLERGY TEST 48 HOURS PRIOR TO EACH APPLICATION, EVEN IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED COLORING PRODUCTS BEFORE,\" as well as an instruction \"\n   <em>\n    DO NOT USE\n   </em>\n   THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY REACTION TO HAIR COLOR PRODUCTS OR HAVE SENSITIVE, IRRITATED OR DAMAGED SCALP;\" (iv) on the side of the box, a directive to \"READ AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY;\" and (v) on the side of the box, a\n   statement reading \"CAUTION: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS INGREDIENTS THAT MAY CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND A PRELIMINARY TEST ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING DIRECTIONS SHOULD FIRST BE MADE.\" (Doc. 137, Exh. B.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The outside of the box also contained a section with the heading \"Questions?\" along with a telephone number, website, and mailing address for \"the Expert Color Consultants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Inside the box, the consumer would find a bottle of Developing Lotion, a bottle of Permanent Color, a pair of disposable gloves, and a leaflet. (Doc. 137, Exh. C, D, E.) The leaflet enumerated the steps for application and use of the Product in \"an easy coloring experience.\" More importantly, for purposes of this litigation, the leaflet contained safety information and instructions as to the proper use of the Product. Under the heading \"IMPORTANT: SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS,\" the leaflet repeated the warnings from the box that hair colorants can cause allergic reactions, which may be severe; that tattoos may increase the risk of allergy to the Product; that the consumer should not use the Product if she had experienced any reaction to hair color products or had a sensitive scalp; and that a skin allergy test must be conducted 48 hours prior to each application. (Doc. 137, Exh. C.) The leaflet also contained detailed \"SKIN ALLERGY TEST INSTRUCTIONS,\" which involved placing a small amount of Product in the bend of one's elbow and leaving it there for 48 hours to see if any adverse reaction occurs, along with a directive that \"IF A RASH, REDNESS, BURNING OR ITCHING DOES OCCUR YOU MAY BE ALLERGIC. STOP. YOU\n   <em>\n    MUST NOT\n   </em>\n   USE THIS PRODUCT.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Elsewhere, the leaflet directed consumers to \"rinse immediately and discontinue use\" in case of any stinging, burning or rash during the coloring process; instructed them \"DO NOT color your hair again before consulting a doctor;\" and advised them to \"SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION\" in the event of rapidly spreading skin rash, swelling to the eyes or face, blistering, and/or skin or scalp weeping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The bottle of Permanent Color also contained a prominent warning on the label. That warning stated as follows: \"CAUTION: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS INGREDIENTS WHICH MAY CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND A PRELIMINARY TEST ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING DIRECTIONS SHOULD FIRST BE MADE.\" (Doc. 137, Exh. E.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiff-Specific Facts Regarding Product Use and Injuries.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff Breonna Franks first used the Product in 2013, when a high-school classmate told her about it. (Franks Dep. (doc. 139, Exh. A), at 52-54.) Franks testified that she read the \"Important Safety Warnings\" portion of the box before purchasing the Product at a Walmart in Mississippi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59.) Franks did not attempt to perform the skin allergy test because she \"didn't know how to do it;\" however, Franks failed to make any telephone calls to defendants or anyone else to inquire about it or otherwise to seek help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-60.) The first time Franks used the Product, \"it just started burning real bad,\n   the back of my head,\" so she washed it out because she \"couldn't wait no longer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) Two weeks later, Franks noticed that her hair was falling out when she combed it or ran her hands through it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61.) Despite this adverse reaction, Franks continued to use the Product every four to six weeks when \"the color was leaving out of\" her hair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43.) Each time she used the Product, Franks experienced itching and burning of her skin, and her hair falling out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.) Nonetheless, she continued to apply the Product and did not consult a doctor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) Franks never attempted to perform the skin allergy test described on the box and leaflet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) She has never received medical treatment for alleged injuries sustained through her use of the Product. (Doc. 139, Exh. G.) And she has received treatment for alopecia (hair loss) from a dermatologist dating back as far as 2012, with her treating physician opining in 2015 that her alopecia was the result of braiding her hair too tightly. (Franks Dep., at 25-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Tara Taylor has been using hair coloring products twice per year for more than 20 years, but was originally using a non-Clairol product that never gave her problems or caused reactions. (Taylor Dep. (doc. 140, Exh. A), at 9-11.) At some indeterminate point, she switched to using the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Taylor had a reaction to an unknown hair coloring product approximately three years ago, when she experienced swelling in her lymph nodes for two days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) When using hair coloring products, Taylor always tests them by placing some of the product on her wrist for an hour to see if anything happens; however, those tests never yielded any positive indication of allergic reaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.) Taylor purchased the Product from a Family Dollar store in Louisiana on or about October 18, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-36.) Taylor had used the Product before, and had previously read the warnings and instructions on the box. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, 26.) She has tattoos, and was aware of the warning on the box that tattoos could increase the risk of allergy from use of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Taylor applied the Product on October 19, 2016, after performing a skin test as previously described. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) The following day, Taylor's head began itching and she developed blisters and weeping sores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.) On the morning of October 21, 2016, Taylor awakened to discover that one side of her face was swollen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) By the time she reached the emergency room that day, her condition had worsened to the point where her eyes were swollen shut. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 22, 2016, Taylor returned to the emergency room for treatment of the painful swelling on her face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) During these visits, Taylor was diagnosed with contact dermatitis and tinea capitis, which is ringworm of the scalp. (Richardson Dep. (doc. 140, Exh. G), at 13, 22-23.) She was prescribed medications, and within a week and a half the swelling had subsided. (Taylor Dep., at 53.) However, approximately two days after her second emergency room visit, Taylor lost all her hair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.) It has grown back, but not completely, so Taylor wears wigs to cover the lingering areas of baldness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Taylor's treating physician has no opinion as to whether the hair dye (as opposed to the tinea capitis ) caused her hair loss, or what specific ingredients or components actually triggered her reaction. (Richardson Dep., at 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff Diane Bowden used hair coloring products for approximately 20 years, coloring her hair whenever she \"saw the gray.\" (Bowden Dep. (doc. 141, Exh. A), at 20-21.) She used different brands and different products during that period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) On two occasions prior to January 2016, Bowden experienced an itching sensation on her head after applying a hair coloring product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27.) In January 2016, Bowden (an Alabama resident) used the Product for the first and only time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) When she purchased the product, Bowden did not read any writing on the box other than the color. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 48.) She did not review the leaflet inside the box before using the Product, although she had \"looked at them in the past\" with respect to other hair coloring products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 48.) Bowden did not perform a skin allergy test before applying the Product to her head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) While the Product was still in her hair, Bowden's head started burning, so she rinsed it out with water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-43.) She \"can't remember\" whether rinsing out the Product from her hair caused the burning sensation to stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.) She experienced no other immediate physical manifestations of a reaction to the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Bowden, \"shortly after this\" (perhaps one or two weeks later), her hair \"started falling out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46.) Bowden's hair \"still sheds\" today whenever she combs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) She has never sought medical treatment for any issues relating to her use of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, plaintiff Carrie Bowens has been using hair coloring products dating back to the late 1970s. (Bowens Dep. (doc. 142, Exh. A), at 22.) At no time prior to 2016 did Bowens ever have any adverse reaction to a hair color product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.) The first time Bowens ever used the Product was in January or February 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Before purchasing the Product at a Walmart in Alabama, Bowens read the safety warnings, instructions, and ingredients printed on the box. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) She also read the warnings on the bottle before using the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73.) Prior to applying the Product, Bowens did a patch test by placing a small quantity of the Product near the bend of her arm for one and a half days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.) When she experienced no symptoms of a reaction, Bowens colored her hair the following day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.) She felt an itching and burning sensation on her head after applying the Product, so she washed it out 15 minutes later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-55.) At that time, Bowens was unaware of whether the Product was the cause of the reaction, so she used the Product again a couple of months later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51, 53-55, 61.) Once again, within 15 minutes, Bowens experienced itching and burning, so she washed the Product out of her hair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64.) According to Bowens, she still experiences itching (but not burning) on her head today. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-65.) Upon each of these two applications of the Product, Bowens experienced temporary hair thinning; however, it has grown back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54, 66.) Bowens has not colored her hair again with anything other than a hair rinse following her second use of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68.) She received no medical treatment for any injuries arising from her use of the Product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Summary Judgment Standard.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted only \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.

Motions to Strike.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Antecedent to reaching the merits of the numerous pending Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court considers a pair of Motions to Strike filed by defendants during the course of the summary judgment briefing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion to Strike Expert Opinions.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Among their filings in opposition to defendants' myriad Motions for Summary Judgment, plaintiffs submitted a 12-page document styled \"Expert Report: Clairol Randall I. Tackett, PHD\" (doc. 156, Exh. B) and a six-page document that purports to be the \"expert review and report\" of Ernest N. Charlesworth, MD (doc. 156, Exh. C.) In response, defendants filed an Objection and Motion to Strike (doc. 157), in which they argue that the Tackett and Charlesworth exhibits must be stricken because (i) \"[n]either of these documents is sworn and neither is in the form of an affidavit;\" and (ii) \"neither is made under penalty of perjury and neither comports with the requirements for submission of a declaration.\" (Doc. 157, \u00b6 3.) Review of those exhibits confirms that defendants' characterization is accurate. They are unsworn documents that bear the identifying characteristics of neither affidavits nor declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nonetheless, defendants' argument overlooks the well-established proposition that material may properly be considered on summary judgment so long as it is capable of being reduced to admissible form.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rule 56(c)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P. (\"A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\");\n   <em>\n    Brannon v.

Accordingly, the contents of those reports are properly considered for summary judgment purposes, notwithstanding their unsworn status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Objection to Exhibits B and C is\n   <strong>\n    overruled\n   </strong>\n   , and their Motion to Strike \"Expert Opinions\" (doc. 157) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs' Briefs.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In their second Objection and Motion to Strike, defendants take aim at three aspects of plaintiffs' responses to the Motions for Summary Judgment. First, defendants contend that \"[i]n the various filings, Plaintiffs, in wholesale fashion, fail to cite to the record\" to support certain purportedly factual statements that are not contained in the record at all. (Doc. 158, at 2.) Second, defendants object to what they call \"opinions, allegations, and conclusory statements and ... arguments of counsel\" contained in portions of plaintiffs' summary judgment filings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Third, defendants assert various objections to what they characterize as \"unverified expert reports and unauthenticated citations to literature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Each of these strands of argument shall be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As an initial matter, defendants object and seek to strike portions of plaintiffs' summary judgment briefs that purport to make factual statements without accompanying record citations. Defendants are correct that a litigant on summary judgment must provide pinpoint citations to the record to support statements of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil L.R. 56(b) (\"The non-movant's brief must include ... all facts relied upon, each supported by a specific, pinpoint citation to the record.\"); Rule 56(c)(1)(A), Fed.R.Civ.P. (\"A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by ... citing to particular parts of materials in the record.\"). On summary judgment review, a court cannot simply accept counsel's\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   for an unsupported factual statement in a brief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ely v.

To the extent that plaintiffs have asserted facts in their briefs without factual support or citation to the record, the appropriate course of action is to disregard those statements. Striking them from the briefs would advance no constructive purpose.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirksey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203189242\">\n    2016 WL 3189242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 n.6 (\"the Court will not strike Exhibit T from the summary judgment record\" where \"Movants provide no explanation for why the draconian step of striking this exhibit (rather than simply exercising judicial discretion not to consider it) is an appropriate remedy here\"). Accordingly, the Motion to Strike (doc. 158) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to unsupported factual statements in plaintiffs' briefs; provided, however, that the Court will not consider any such statements in adjudicating the Rule 56 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, defendants lodge objections to, and seek to strike, portions of plaintiffs' summary judgment briefs in which counsel offer self-serving opinions and conclusory statements. According to defendants, in many places in their briefs, plaintiffs' counsel engage in \"improper argument\" that they do not even \"attempt to pass as facts.\" (Doc. 158, at 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This objection is quite similar to the \"unsupported fact\" objection addressed\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' counsel cannot create genuine issues of material fact by making speculative, conclusory, unsupported statements in their summary judgment briefs. Once again, however, striking sections of those briefs as improper argument would be inefficient, unhelpful and accomplish nothing. So while defendants' objection is well-taken as to at least certain passages in plaintiffs' summary judgment briefs, the Motion to Strike is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to plaintiffs' counsel's \"improper opinions, allegations, and conclusory statements.\" (Doc. 158, at 8.) Where the Court encounters such statements in plaintiffs' briefs, it will not consider them in adjudicating the summary judgment motions. No further relief is necessary to protect defendants from any improper argument by plaintiffs' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, defendants' Motion to Strike sets forth objections to plaintiffs' expert reports of Randall Tackett and Ernest Charlesworth, which defendants characterize as \"unverified expert reports\" with \"unauthenticated citations to literature.\" (Doc. 158, at 13.) Insofar as defendants\n   complain that the Tackett and Charlesworth reports are unsworn, this argument is redundant of that previously presented and rejected in the context of defendants' other Motion to Strike (doc. 157). The Court declines to re-plow that ground here. To the extent that defendants object that literature cited in the Tackett and Charlesworth reports has not been authenticated and is hearsay, defendants' Motion to Strike is deficient because it fails to take into account Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. On its face, that rule allows experts to base opinions on facts or data of which the expert is aware and provides that \"[i]f experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted.\" Rule 703, Fed.R.Evid. Moreover, the rule provides that if the facts or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the expert may still disclose them to the jury if their probative value outweighs their prejudicial effect. These features of Rule 703 would appear to negate defendants' objections to plaintiffs' expert reports' citations to materials like the Personal Care Products Council's Consumer Commitment Code, FDA regulations, and the \"Practice Parameters\" on contact dermatitis promulgated by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters. Defendants have advanced no persuasive argument that the \"basis evidence\" provision of Rule 703 would not allow these aspects of plaintiffs' expert reports to be reduced to admissible form at trial, and therefore to be properly considered on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirksey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203189242\">\n    2016 WL 3189242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"If the contents of those articles can be presented in admissible form via expert testimony through the 'basis evidence' mechanism of Rule 703, however, then the admissibility\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of the underlying articles is of no consequence.... [T]here is no indication ... that the pertinent aspects of Exhibits F, G and NN cited in Kirksey's summary judgment filings cannot be reduced to admissible form at trial via Rule 703.\"). Accordingly, defendants' Objection to plaintiffs' expert reports is overruled, and the Motion to Strike is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as it relates to the objected-to portions of those reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Analysis of Issues Concerning Plaintiffs' Class Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Before reaching issues and arguments focused on particular plaintiffs, the Court examines defendants' \"Motion for Summary Judgment on Certain Class Claims\" (doc. 136). Through this Motion, defendants take aim at the viability of certain classwide claims, including all plaintiffs' Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act class claims; the Alabama plaintiffs' putative class claims under the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act; the claims of Mississippi putative class members for negligent design, negligent failure to warn, fraud or breach of warranty; and the claims of Louisiana putative class members for negligent design, negligent failure to warn, fraud, unjust enrichment or breach of warranty. Defendants state that, as to this particular Rule 56 Motion, \"the claims upon which relief was sought [were] limited to purported class claims\" (doc. 159, at 1), rather than individual plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After defendants filed this Motion, plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification (doc. 143). On its face, the Rule 23 Motion was confined to the claims of plaintiffs Diane Bowden and Carrie Bowens - the two Alabama plaintiffs - and sought only \"class certification of their claims that Defendants ... violated the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\" (Doc. 143, at 1.) No other plaintiffs moved for class certification, and class certification was not sought as to any other claims. As such, defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Certain Class Claims is\n   <strong>\n    moot\n   </strong>\n   as\n   to the purported class claims under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act; the Mississippi subclass claims for negligent design, negligent failure to warn, fraud and breach of warranty; and the Louisiana subclass claims for negligent design, negligent failure to warn, fraud, unjust enrichment and breach of warranty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The lone issue remaining from the Motion for Summary Judgment on Certain Class Claims is whether defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the class claims asserted under the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-19-1\">\n    Ala.

(Doc. 159, at 4-6.) But the issue here is not the meaning or interpretation of the ADTPA.

Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Count II).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In Count II of her Complaint, Franks alleged that defendants had violated the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"MMWA\"), by failing to comply with written warranties as to the Product. Specifically, Franks points to defendants' statements and descriptions on the Product's packaging, website and marketing materials, such as that defendants are \"hair color experts,\" that the Product \"softens hair\" and contains a \"luxurious formula\" that is \"infused with conditioning botanicals,\" and that use of the Product is \"an easy coloring experience.\" (Doc. 44, at 34.) The theory animating plaintiff's MMWA claim is that all of these statements are written warranties, and that defendants' breaches of same amount to a violation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on Count II on the grounds that federal jurisdiction is lacking. On its face, the MMWA provides that no claim brought in federal district court by a consumer for breach of a warranty under the Act \"shall be cognizable ... if the amount in controversy of any individual claim is less than the sum or value of $ 25,\" or \"if the amount in controversy is less than the sum or value of $ 50,000 (exclusive of interests and costs) computed on the basis of all claims to be determined in this suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(A)-(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   There appears to be no record evidence that might support a reasonable inference that Franks' MMWA claim is valued at $ 25.00 or higher or that Franks' claims in the aggregate are valued at $ 50,000 or higher. Plaintiff has made no effort to show otherwise, particularly given that the alleged breach of written warranty relates to\n   a hair coloring product that appears to have cost $ 5.00 or less, and that Franks never sought medical care or treatment relating to her alleged injuries arising from use of the Product. In the absence of any showing by plaintiff, or other reason to believe, that any of these statutory prerequisites is satisfied, defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is properly\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Breach of Warranty/Fraud/Negligent Design/Failure to Warn (Counts III - VI).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants also seek summary judgment on Franks' common-law claims of negligent design, negligent failure to warn, breach of warranty and fraud, as pleaded in Counts III through VI of her Complaint. Defendants' threshold argument is that all of these claims are precluded by the Mississippi Products Liability Act (the \"MPLA\"), which applies to \"any action for damages caused by a product, including, but not limited to, any action based on a theory of strict liability in tort, negligence or breach of implied warranty, except for commercial damage to the product itself.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 11-1-63. Substantial case law supports defendants' position that the MPLA applies to the claims raised by Franks in Counts III through VI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   That said, courts confronting Mississippi common-law claims similar to those asserted by Franks have not found that such claims must be summarily dismissed (as defendants here advocate); rather, courts have deemed such claims to be subsumed by, analyzed under, and subject to the requirements of the MPLA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v.

To the extent Franks brings claims on a theory of defective design,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendants note that the MPLA requires a plaintiff to prove both that (i) defendants knew or reasonably should have known \"about the danger that caused the damage,\" and (ii) \"[t]he product failed to function as expected and there existed a feasible design alternative that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 11-1-63(f). Defendants argue that Franks' design-defect claims fail under the MPA because the record is devoid of evidence of a feasible design alternative, and because the product would not have failed to function as expected had Franks read the product warnings and instructions. Mississippi case law supports defendants' position that these are elements of a defective-design claim under the MPLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Franks states in conclusory fashion that \"there is an abundance of significant, probative evidence supporting her claims,\" and directs the Court's attention generically to the \"strong, uncontroverted opinions supporting her case\" found in the reports of her experts, Tackett and Charlesworth. (Doc. 153, at 16.) She does not identify any specific opinions from her experts about feasible design alternatives, instead waving her hand at the record and suggesting that the answer lies somewhere therein. That is not how the Rule 56 process works.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil L.R. 56(b) (\"The non-movant's brief must include ... all facts relied upon, each supported by a specific, pinpoint citation to the record.\"). Franks cannot shift to this Court the burden of sifting through the record to endeavor to locate specific supporting facts and to develop appropriate arguments on her behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the failure-to-warn portion of Counts III through VI, the MPLA provides that \"[a]n adequate product warning or instruction is one that a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have provided with respect to the danger and that communicates sufficient information on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking into account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to an ordinary\n   consumer who purchases the product.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 11-1-63(c)(ii). \"In Mississippi, a warning may be held adequate as a matter of law where the adverse effect was one that the manufacturer specifically warned against.\"\n   <em>\n    Dykes v. Husqvarna Outdoor Products, N.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4024311\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/869/749/#p760\">\n    869 F.Supp.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (S.D. Miss. 2012) (citations omitted). Moreover, \"[i]nadequate warnings cannot serve as the proximate cause of injuries where adequate warnings would have resulted in the same injuries. Where a plaintiff claims inadequate warnings, the defendant must be allowed to introduce evidence which would tend to persuade a jury that, even if the warnings had been adequate, the plaintiff would not have heeded them.\"\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. Volkswagen of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9025116\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/904/1077/#p1094\">\n    904 So.2d 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094 (Miss. 2005). Simply put, \"where a plaintiff complains that a given warning was defective, the plaintiff must have read and relied upon the defective warning to complain of it.\"\n   <em>\n    Mine Safety Appliance Co. v. Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860553\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/442/#p452\">\n    171 So.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 (Miss. 2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   These principles underscore the infirmities in Franks' failure-to-warn claims under the MPLA. Franks conceded that she had never attempted the skin allergy test as she was specifically directed to do in the Product's warnings and instructions; therefore, any claim that the skin allergy test instructions were defective in some manner is inconsequential to her claims because she did not heed the instructions that were given to \"PERFORM THE SKIN ALLERGY TEST 48 HOURS BEFORE COLORING.\" Franks also acknowledged that, despite experiencing an itching and burning sensation the first time she used the Product, she continued to use it every four to six weeks for a period of three years, all in derogation of defendants' unambiguous warnings stating \"\n   <em>\n    DO NOT USE\n   </em>\n   THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY REACTION TO HAIR COLOR PRODUCTS.\" And defendants' warnings repeatedly cautioned Franks that use of the Product \"MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS, WHICH IN RARE CASES CAN BE SEVERE,\" which of course is exactly what happened. These facts demonstrate the following: (i) Franks failed to heed the warnings that were given, thereby negating the purported inadequacy of those warnings as the proximate cause of her injuries; and (ii) Franks' conduct in ignoring certain directives demonstrates that she did not rely on the warnings that were given, so she cannot be heard to complain that such warnings were inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Franks' claims for breach of implied warranty (Count IV), fraud (Count V), and negligent design/failure to warn (Count VI) are predicated on a defective-design or failure-to-warn theory. For the reasons stated, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all such claims and causes of action under the MPLA analytical framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Notably, defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment does not specifically challenge the viability of Franks' claims for breach of express warranty (Count III). As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Count III is subsumed by and analyzed under the MPLA. The statute provides for liability where \"[t]he product breached an express warranty or failed to conform to other express factual representations upon which the claimant justifiably relied in electing to use the product.\" Miss. Code \u00a7 11-1-63(a)(i)(4). Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment analyzes both the design-defect and failure-to-warn claims under the MPLA, but offers no argument that Franks' breach-of-express-warranty claim is not cognizable under subsection (a)(i)(4) of the MPLA. (Doc. 139, at 12-16.) As such, summary judgment is inappropriate as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiff Tara Taylor.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff Tara Taylor, the lone Louisiana named plaintiff, is not pursuing class claims against defendants; however, she has asserted individual claims for unjust enrichment (Count I), violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Count II), breach of warranty in violation of Louisiana Civil Code Articles 2475, 2520, and 2524 (Count III), fraud (Count IV), and negligent design/failure to warn (Count V). In their Motion for Summary Judgment on Claims of Plaintiff Tara Taylor (doc. 140), defendants seek summary judgment on all of Taylor's claims, on the grounds that (i) plaintiff's claims are preempted by the Louisiana Products Liability Act, and could not be pleaded in cognizable fashion under the Act, in any event; (ii) plaintiff's claims are time-barred; (iii) plaintiff's fraud and breach-of-warranty claims fail for lack of reliance; and (iv) Count II fails for lack of federal jurisdiction over the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Repetitive Issues Governed by Section VI.A.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Multiple aspects of the parties' memoranda briefing the Rule 56 Motion as to Taylor's claims are identical or substantially similar to those presented in their memoranda of law submitted on the Rule 56 Motion as to Franks' claims. Rather than reiterating what has already been written, the Court will simply adopt the relevant portions of Section VI.A. of this Order (addressing the Franks summary judgment motion) as applying with equal force to the Taylor summary judgment motion. The issues addressed in this manner include the following: (i) Taylor's arguments that there has been \"very little merits-based discovery\" and that she is \"entitled to conduct full merits-based discovery before being compelled to respond to this Summary Judgment petition;\" (ii) analysis of Taylor's claim under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Count II); and (iii) discussion of Taylor's evidence concerning feasible alternative design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Timeliness of Complaint.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants contend that all of Taylor's claims are time-barred. In particular, defendants rely on Louisiana authority establishing that a claimant has one year \"from the day injury or damage is sustained\" in which to bring claims under the LPLA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Zurich Ins.

She testified that on October 20, 2016, she experienced physical manifestations of an adverse reaction to the Product on her head, including itching, blisters and weeping sores. Based on that evidence, defendants have a compelling argument that the one-year prescriptive period began to run for Taylor on\n   October 20, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that October 20, 2016 was the date on which injury was sustained and the alleged defect manifested itself). Yet Taylor did not file her Complaint until October 23, 2017, more than one year later and therefore beyond the applicable prescriptive period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In response, Taylor advances three arguments, none of which are persuasive. First, Taylor maintains that the prescriptive period should be deemed to commence on October 21, 2016, which was the day she awakened with a swollen face, received medical treatment, and was diagnosed with contact dermatitis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, the legal standard is that the claimant has one year \"from the day injury or damage is sustained\" or from the date \"the defect manifests itself.\" Taylor applied the Product on October 19, 2016, and the very next day experienced severe symptoms, including blisters on her head that were \"leaking.\" Under any reasonable application of the standard, Taylor sustained her injury - and the alleged defect in the Product manifested itself - no later than October 20, 2016, when these symptoms appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, Taylor invokes the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem agere nulla currit\n   </em>\n   , which is Latin for \"a prescription does not run against one who is unable to act.\" \"Under Louisiana law,\n   <em>\n    contra non valentum\n   </em>\n   prevents the commencement of the running of prescription when the plaintiff does not know nor ... reasonably should know of the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Firefighters' Retirement System v.

On this record,\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   cannot save Taylor's claims from the running of the prescriptive period. Again, one day after applying the Product, Taylor experienced a severe reaction, including blisters and weeping sores on her head. She knew or reasonably should have known the facts upon which her cause of action was based no later than that date, October 20, 2016; therefore, the prescriptive period commenced then, and her Complaint is untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Third, Taylor suggests that the prescriptive period could not have begun on October 20, 2016 because she did not know \"that the Product contained PPD and/or the true nature of the dangers associated with PPD, and/or that the Product's 'skin allergy test' is woefully inadequate ... until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she had been diagnosed with 'contact dermatitis.' \" (Doc. 154, at 26.) Again, the legal standard is when she became aware of the facts upon which her claims are based. Those facts, at their most fundamental, are her use of the Product and her ensuing adverse reaction on October 20. Surely those facts were sufficient to place her on notice that the Product was defective, such that she might have a viable LPLA claim against defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   That said, this argument is sufficient to toll the prescriptive period (at least, for summary judgment purposes) as it relates to Taylor's failure-to-warn claims, as discussed in footnote 23,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For all of these reasons, the Court finds that Taylor's claims (with the exception of her inadequate warning claim under the LPLA) are time-barred by operation of the one-year prescriptive period that applies to claims under the LPLA. Defendants are therefore entitled to summary judgment on all claims and causes of action asserted by Taylor, other than Taylor's claim of inadequate warning pursuant to the LPLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

With respect to Taylor's claim of defective design, the LPLA expressly requires as an element of such a claim that the plaintiff prove \"[t]here existed an alternative design for the product that was capable of preventing the claimant's damage.\" La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.56. Such proof generally requires expert testimony or technical evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broussard v.

As discussed in the context of the Franks summary judgment motion in \u00a7 VI.A.3.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff's evidence of alternative design is wholly inadequate\n   to carry her burden of proof on this essential element of her claim. Accordingly, Taylor's design-defect claim is unsustainable, as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   With respect to Taylor's inadequate-warning claim, the LPLA allows for liability where \"the product possessed a characteristic that may cause damage and the manufacturer failed to use reasonable care to provide an adequate warning of such characteristic and its danger to users and handlers of the product.\" La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.57(A). No warning is required where the consumer \"already knows or reasonably should be expected to know of the characteristic of the product that may cause damage and the danger of such characteristic.\" \u00a7 9:2800.57(B)(2). Taylor theorizes that defendants' warnings were inadequate as to \"the risks and potential dangers of using the defective Product as directed by Defendants.\" (Doc. 86, at 52.) As discussed, the Product as sold came with extensive warnings and instructions as to potential dangers of using it as directed. For example, the box warned that the Product \"MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS, WHICH IN RARE CASES CAN BE SEVERE;\" that the Product \"CONTAINS INGREDIENTS THAT MAY CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS;\" and that the consumer should not use the Product \"IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED ANY REACTION TO HAIR COLOR PRODUCTS\" or \"HAVE SENSITIVE, IRRITATED OR DAMAGED SCALP.\" The trouble for plaintiff is that Taylor's own testimony showed that she disregarded the warnings and instructions given, inasmuch as she used the Product even though she had previously had a reaction to another hair color product; she had an existing condition of scalp irritation; and she failed to perform a skin allergy test in a manner even approximating that described by the instructions. Because Taylor did not follow the existing warnings and instructions, she cannot establish causation (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that her injuries would not have occurred if more detailed or extensive warnings had been given).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinson v.

Summary judgment is warranted on Taylor's inadequate-warning claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, defendants seek summary judgment on Taylor's claim for breach of express warranty. Under the LPLA, defendants can be liable for the Product's failure to conform to an express warranty \"if\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the express warranty has induced the claimant or another person or entity to use the product\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and the claimant's damage\n   was proximately caused because the express warranty was untrue.\" La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.58 (emphasis added). Even assuming that the statements identified by Taylor's Complaint fall within the statutory definition of an \"express warranty\" (which is debatable, at best), this claim fails as a matter of law because the summary judgment record lacks any evidence that such express warranties induced Taylor to use the Product. Taylor makes no showing that she was induced to use the Product by warranties on the packaging; rather, she testified that she came to use it because she was working at Family Dollar, \"putting the stuff on the shelves,\" and thereby \"discovered the Balsam hair color.\" (Taylor Dep., at 21.) There is zero evidence that any express warranties induced Taylor to use the Product; therefore, her breach-of-express-warranty claim under the LPLA is not, and cannot be, viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to the claims of plaintiff Tara Taylor is due to be\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

Each of Bowden and Bowens is an Alabama plaintiff who filed a Complaint asserting claims of unjust enrichment (Count I), violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Count II), breach of express warranty (Count III), breach of implied warranty (Count IV), violation of the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act (Count V), fraud (Count VI) and negligent design/failure to warn (Count VII). (Docs. 25-1, 29-1.) Bowden and Bowens have moved for class certification as to their claims under the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act (Count V), but not for any of their other causes of action. In their summary judgment briefs, Bowden and Bowens acknowledge that each of them \"has procedurally waived her right to seek redress under any of her Complaint's other legal claims.\" (Doc. 155, at 15-16; doc. 156, at 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment\n   are\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts I, II, III, IV, VI and VII of Bowden's and Bowens' Complaints, and all such claims are\n   <strong>\n    dismissed\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The only question, then, is whether Bowden's and Bowens' claims under the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208-19-1\">\n    Ala.

Code \u00a7 8-19-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (27). As framed in the Complaints, Bowden's and Bowens' ADTPA claims center on allegations that defendants misled and deceived the public by \"advertis[ing], market[ing], and [selling] the Product as being a safe hair dyeing product,\" while concealing information about the Product's risks of injury, failing to call attention to the Product's dangerous propensities, and otherwise engaging in false, misleading, and/or deceptive practices in marketing, advertising, and selling the Product. (Doc. 29-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 155-56; doc. 25-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 150-51.) Defendants seek summary judgment on these ADTPA claims on the grounds that (i) they are barred by the statute of limitations; and (ii) the record establishes that defendants engaged in no deceptive or misleading acts or practices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

As to Bowden, the record reflects that she experienced an adverse reaction upon using the Product in January 2016, but did not file her Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama until February 28, 2017. (Doc. 29-1, at 1, 29.) Bowden also offers a Declaration in which she avers that the first time she\n   \"learned about the problems with the hair dye and the false and misleading nature of the labeling\" was when she met with counsel \"in late January or early February of 2017,\" mere weeks before filing her Complaint. (Bowden Decl. (doc. 155, Exh. G), \u00b6 3.) As to Bowens, the record reflects that she first used the Product in January or February 2016, and experienced an adverse reaction at that time, and that she filed her Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama on March 1, 2017. Bowens also submitted a Declaration in which she avers that the first time she \"learned about the problems with the hair dye and the false and misleading nature of the labeling\" was when she met with counsel \"in late January or early February of 2017,\" shortly before filing her Complaint. (Bowens Decl. (doc. 155, Exh. H), \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   After careful review of the parties' arguments, the Court finds that a jury question is presented as to whether Bowden and Bowens discovered or reasonably should have discovered the acts and practices which are the subject of their ADTPA claims within one year before their February 28, 2017 and March 1, 2017, complaint filing dates, respectively. Again, on summary judgment, Alabama law provides that courts can decide the issue of discovery of a claim as a matter of law \"only in cases where the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    actually knew\n   </em>\n   of facts that would have put a reasonable person on notice of fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050307\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/39/1061/#p1082\">\n    39 So.3d at 1082-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court cannot unequivocally find on this record that Bowden and Bowens possessed such knowledge as of February/March 2016. To be sure, plaintiffs knew they had experienced an adverse reaction to the Product. But did they actually know what labeling information, warnings and directions had been placed on the Product at that time? Did they have actual knowledge that the Product's \"true, unreasonably dangerous nature\" was more extreme than the warnings and directions on the packaging would suggest? Did they have actual knowledge that \"use of the Product posed a significant risk of chemical burns, ... particularly among African Americans,\" such that there should have been specific warnings on those matters? These and other allegations are pleaded in the Complaint as the theory animating these plaintiffs' ADTPA claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 29-1, at \u00b6 155; doc. 25-1, at \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In short, the appropriate question on summary judgment under the Alabama standard for determining when a claim was discovered is whether plaintiffs had actual knowledge as of January/February 2016 that the warnings on the Product were misleading or deceptive. The Court cannot make such a finding as a matter of law on this record; therefore, the timeliness\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   of these ADTPA claims is not an issue subject to resolution on summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Substantive Merits of ADTPA Claims.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the ADTPA claims asserted by Bowden and Bowens are predicated on the argument that the warnings contained on the Product were deceptive and misleading because they omitted information about the danger of the Product and the severity of the risk of using it. Notably, that theory is bolstered\n   by opinions of plaintiffs' expert Randall L. Tackett, Ph.D. In his report, Tackett offered the opinion that \"[t]he current labeling is inadequate and misleading. It does not sufficiently warn consumers of the dangers of the hair dyes. The recommended self skin testing described on the label and in the instructions is inadequate in reducing the risk of using the products.\" (Doc. 155, Exh. B at 12.) Tackett's report also offers supporting facts and reasoning for this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   These opinions create genuine issues of fact as to whether plaintiffs were \"in anyway [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] deceived or mislead [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] as to the relative safety of the product\" (doc. 142, at 22), thus defeating defendants' argument that \"the specificity and redundancy of the warnings and instruction provided\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) negates all of plaintiffs' claims predicated on deceptive, misleading or inadequate warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition to their unsuccessful argument that the warnings were adequate, non-deceptive and non-misleading as a matter of law, defendants adopt the position on summary judgment that this ADTPA theory fails on the merits upon a plaintiff-specific analysis. Plaintiff Diane Bowden testified in her deposition that she did not read any of the writing on the box (except to confirm the color of the dye) when she purchased the Product for the first and only time in January 2016. She further conceded that she did not review the leaflet inside the Product's box. As defendants correctly observe, these admissions pose an insuperable obstacle to Bowden's ability to maintain a claim of deceptive/ misleading labeling under the ADTPA. As the Alabama Supreme Court has held, \"a plaintiff who does not read an allegedly inadequate warning cannot maintain a negligent-failure-to-adequately-warn action unless the nature of the alleged inadequacy is such that it prevents him from reading it.\"\n   <em>\n    E.R.

Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Bowden's ADPTA cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   By contrast, plaintiff Carrie Bowens testified that she\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   read the safety warnings, instructions, and ingredient list on the Product box, as well as the warnings on the permanent color bottle. While these facts (which are accepted as true for summary judgment purposes) would appear fatal to any \"read-and-heed\" argument for dismissal of Bowens' ADTPA claim, defendants nonetheless maintain that they are entitled to summary judgment because Bowens \"did not follow the manufacturer's instructions before using the Product,\" such that she \"cannot establish that was misled ... or that any alternative warnings of [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] instructions would have prevented the alleged injury.\" (Doc. 142, at 25.) In so arguing, defendants cite the following three record facts: (i) she performed the skin allergy test for \"[a]bout a day and a half\" rather than the 48 hours instructed in the Product's leaflet; (ii) she failed to perform a \"strand test;\" and (iii) she wore a shower cap over the Product for the entire 15 minutes it was in her hair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) As to the first point, the Court finds that a jury question is presented as to whether Bowens substantially complied with the instructions for the skin allergy test, particularly given the paucity of evidence that the additional half day would have made any difference; as well as the absence of any authority cited by defendants to show that Alabama's \"read-and-heed\" doctrine mandates strict compliance with all product instructions. On this record, the Court cannot say as a matter of law that Bowens' performance of a skin allergy test for 36 hours rather than 48 hours destroys any causal link between the allegedly misleading and deceptive warnings and her injury. As to the second point, defendants' Product did not identify the \"strand test\" as a warning or a safety instruction, but simply characterized it as a tool \"to determine optimal timing and color results.\" (Doc. 142, Exh. C.) Accordingly, a reasonable jury could find that Bowens' failure to perform the strand test says nothing about her willingness to read and heed specific safety warnings on the Product, and therefore does not bear on the issue of proximate causation. As to the third point, defendants point to no evidence anywhere that Bowens' use of a shower cap was somehow noncompliant with the safety instructions and warnings on the Product. For all of these reasons, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Bowens' ADTPA claim for deceptive and misleading warnings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Second, insofar as Franks might believe that she is unable to respond to the Motion for Summary Judgment without additional facts, her recourse was to seek relief under Rule 56(d), which may allow for additional time to conduct discovery before adjudication of a summary judgment motion where \"a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\" Rule 56(d), Fed.R.Civ.P.

For example, in Count III, she alleged that \"the Product suffers from latent and/or inherent design and/or manufacturing defects that cause substantial Injuries, rendering the Product unfit for its intended use and purpose.\" (Doc. 44, at 38 \u00b6 130.) In Count IV, she alleged that the Product \"is unreasonably dangerous and unfit for the ordinary purpose for which it was used.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 40 \u00b6 141.) In Count V, she alleged that \"the Product is not a safe hair dyeing product\" because \"it is composed of caustic ingredients including PPD.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 43 \u00b6 162.) And in Count VI, she alleged that defendants had \"[n]egligently design[ed] a Product with serious safety hazards and risks.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 47 \u00b6 177(d).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Guy v.

B, at 12.) This opinion does not appear to have been fleshed out with supporting facts anywhere in his report. Even if it had, merely asserting that there are \"safer\" products available does not satisfy this element. The MPLA unambiguously provides that \"[a] feasible design alternative is a design that would have to a reasonable probability prevented the harm without impairing the utility, usefulness, practicality or desirability of the product to users or consumers.\" \u00a7 11-1-63(f)(ii). Tackett's conclusory opinion says nothing about whether those alternative products would have satisfied this statutory definition as to either prevention of harm or usefulness of the Product.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    If October 21, 2016 were the commencement date, then Taylor's Complaint would be timely because October 21, 2017 and October 22, 2017 were a Saturday and Sunday, respectively, such that the one-year period would have expired on October 23, 2017, the exact date on which she filed her Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    In arguing otherwise, plaintiff cites evidence that Taylor is a high-school dropout with no expertise in dermatology or toxicology, and that she \"does not even know what dermatitis is.\" (Doc. 154, at 24, 27.) But Taylor did not need a scientific background, an understanding of medical terminology, or a high school diploma to be aware of the facts on which her claims are based as of October 20, 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The inadequate-warning claim is, or may be, situated differently than Taylor's other claims for purposes of applying the one-year prescriptive period under Louisiana law. As to failure to warn, Taylor's theory is that the warnings on the packaging, label, and insert of the Product were insufficient because the Product was far more dangerous than those materials specified. There appear to be genuine issues of material fact as to when Taylor knew, or should have known, of the purported divergence between the hazards identified in the packaging and the severity of the actual hazards posed by the Product. Merely having an adverse reaction to the Product would not necessarily furnish Taylor with notice of the insufficiency of the warnings or give her reason to know that those printed warnings understated or glossed over the true dangers of the Product, as she now claims. Accordingly, summary judgment is inappropriate on timeliness grounds as to that discrete aspect of Taylor's Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    It also bears noting that the LPLA requires a plaintiff bringing a defective-design claim to prove that \"[t]he likelihood that the product's design would cause the claimant's damage and the gravity of that damage outweighed the burden on the manufacturer of adopting such alternative design and the adverse effect, if any, of such alternative design on the utility of the product.\" La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 9:2800.56(2). The summary judgment record is devoid of any evidence raising a reasonable inference that Taylor could satisfy the risk/utility element of such claim at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    In her opposition brief, Taylor hints that she may be pursuing a redhibition claim against defendants under Louisiana law. (Doc. 154, at 20-21.) This suggestion cannot rescue her Complaint from summary judgment for several reasons. First, the Complaint on its face does not state a claim for redhibition, and the time for amending the pleadings has long since expired, with no showing of good cause by Taylor for not amending her Complaint in a timely manner under the applicable Scheduling Order. Second, redhibition claims are also subject to a one-year prescription period, such that any redhibition claim asserted by Taylor herein would be time-barred. La. Civ. Code art. 2534(B) (\"The action for redhibition against a seller who knew, or is presumed to have known, of the existence of a defect in the thing sold prescribes in one year from the day the defect was discovered by the buyer.\"). Third, the elements of a redhibition claim under Louisiana law are that \"the buyer must prove that a defect in the thing renders its use so inconvenient that he would not have bought it had he known of the defect; that the defect existed at the time of the sale, but was not apparent; and that the seller had the opportunity to repair the defect.\"\n    <em>\n     Jackson v. European Service, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12672506\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/246/743/#p749\">\n     246 So.3d 743\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 749 (La.App. 2 2018). The \"defect\" in the Product was or should have been apparent to Taylor by virtue of the many warnings on the packaging about the risk of allergic reaction, including severe allergic reaction, and about the fact that the Product's ingredients may cause skin irritation. Moreover, there is no evidence that defendants were given an opportunity to repair the defect. For all these reasons, Taylor cannot overcome summary judgment by invoking the possibility of a claim for redhibition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Plaintiffs' concession on this point appears dictated by the terms of the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%208-19-15\">\n     Ala.

An election to pursue the civil remedies prescribed in this chapter shall exclude and be a surrender of all other rights and remedies available at common law, by statute or otherwise, for fraud, misrepresentation, deceit, suppression of material facts or fraudulent concealment arising out of any act, occurrence or transaction actionable under this chapter.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    In their summary judgment briefs, Bowden and Bowens object that defendants' Motions failed \"to assert any argument or offer any evidence regarding the substantive merits of [their] ADTPA claims,\" such that \"Defendants Rule 56 petition is fatally defective and due to be denied.\" (Doc. 155, at 14; doc. 156, at 14.) But defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment contain considerable discussion of the evidence (or lack of evidence) that defendants engaged in misrepresentations, suppression of material facts, or deception. Those concepts - albeit labeled by defendants as grounds for dismissing non-ADTPA claims - are equally applicable to the Rule 56 analysis of the ADTPA claims; therefore, the Court will consider them here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Another way to put it is like this: Bowden and Bowens have sued defendants under the ADTPA, claiming that the Product was far more dangerous than the warnings and instructions on the Product indicated. What actual knowledge did Bowden and Bowens have as of February/March 2016 that such was the case? They knew they had used the Product and they knew they had sustained adverse reactions. But did they know that the Product was more dangerous than defendants' warnings had led them to believe? The Court has no information before it that would allow a conclusive answer to that question on summary judgment; therefore, the timeliness issue is properly submitted to the jury.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    In particular, Tackett sets forth as supporting information the following: (i) seven chemicals contained in the Product's ingredients list are known to produce toxic effects, such as severe skin burns, skin corrosion, blisters, and more; (ii) the ingredient p-phenylenediamine (or PPD) can accumulate in the skin, has a significant potential for causing hypersensitivity to the skin, and may impair renal function; (iii) the Product's label did not identify the specific injuries that the caustic chemicals in its ingredient list could cause, and said nothing of the risk of PPD accumulation in the skin; (iv) studies show that PPD's adverse effects are far more prevalent in African-Americans than in whites in the United States, yet defendants offered no such warnings; and (v) the skin allergy test described on the Product's packaging was basically a sham because skin on the scalp may react differently than skin on the elbow, self-testing may lead to misleading and false negative results, and the average consumer lacks the expertise to perform this test and analyze its results properly. (Doc. 155, Exh. B.) Plaintiffs' expert Ernest N. Charlesworth, M.D., offered opinions explaining why the self-test directed on the Product's packaging was deeply flawed and \"deviate[d] from what a medical specialist in dermatology or allergy would advocate for patients with a potential for allergic contact dermatitis as a screen for hair dye allergy.\" (Doc. 155, Exh. C, at 3.) A fair reading of these expert opinions is that the skin test described in the Product's insert and packaging is misleading and deceptive because it is falsely portrayed as a reliable method for an unsophisticated consumer to test for allergic reaction to the Product.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    In so concluding, the\n    <em>\n     E.R. Squibb\n    </em>\n    Court reasoned that proximate causation was necessarily lacking in a scenario where the plaintiff did not read the purportedly inadequate warning, to-wit: \"Here, nothing in the nature of Squibb's inadequate warning prevented plaintiff from reading it. Plaintiff could have read this allegedly inadequate, unspecific warning as easily as he could have read an adequate, specific warning. And, no amount of specificity would have protected this plaintiff, because he would not have read a warning. Thus, the presumed inadequacy of Squibb's warning did not proximately cause plaintiff's injury.\"\n    <em>\n     E.R. Squibb\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7606348\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/477/963/#p971\">\n     477 So.2d at 971\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    In a separate section of their principal brief, defendants assert that summary judgment is appropriate for lack of causation because Bowens has not shown that the Product injured her. (Doc. 142, at 27-28.) Genuine issues of material fact preclude the relief defendants seek. After all, Bowens' evidence is that she experienced itching and burning on her scalp within 15 minutes after applying the Product. This evidence raises a reasonable inference that the Product caused Bowens' injuries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    On this last point, Franks' Complaint predicated federal jurisdiction solely on\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), based on allegations that there were more than 100 class members, the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $ 5,000,000, and at least one class member is a citizen of a state different from at least one defendant. (Doc. 44, at 8.) But Franks is no longer pursuing class claims, and her only individual claims still in play are creatures of state law, not federal law. Under the circumstances, it would appear that dismissal of Franks' action without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction is appropriate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
