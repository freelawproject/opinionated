The Secretary of the Interior established the Royalty Committee to provide advice on issues related to the leasing of energy and mineral resources on Federal and Indian lands. (Doc. 25 at 15.) According to Western, \"Rather than pursue its task with the full and transparent participation of [the public], the Committee operates in secret and works to advance the goals of only one interest: the extractive industries that profit from the development of public gas, oil, and coal.\" (First Amend. Compl., Doc. 14 at \u00b6 2.) Defendants seek to dismiss Western's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Doc. 24.) Western seeks to preliminarily enjoin Committee operations, including activities conducted by its subcommittees and working groups. (Doc. 17.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schindler Decl., Doc. 35-1 at \u00b6 5.) Additionally, all members of the Committee were told that no \"[Committee]-related work should occur during the shutdown, including any informal collaboration among non-federal members of the Committee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) All subcommittee meetings were also cancelled for the duration of the shutdown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) However, Western has pointed to news articles indicating certain leasing work was to continue despite the shutdown, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 36 at 4 (citing \"Trump Administration Working on Arctic Oil Leases Despite Shutdown,\"\n   <em>\n    Reuters\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 9, 2019) ) ), raising some question as to continued operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Present Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Western is a Montana-based organization self-described as \"a regional network of grassroots community organizations,\" that seeks \"to build sustainable environmental and economic communities that balance economic growth with public health and stewardship of land, water, and air resources.\" (Doc. 14 at \u00b6 17.) In its original complaint, Western named as defendants the Department of the Interior; the Bureau of Land Management; Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior; Vincent DeVito, Counselor for Energy Policy to the Secretary of the Interior; and Brian Steed, Deputy Director of Policy and Programs for the Bureau of Land Management. (Doc. 1.) Western alleges that the Royalty Commission was established in violation of FACA (Count 1) and that its operation violates FACA's requirement that it: (1) provide public notice of its meetings and publicly disseminate its materials (Count 2); (2) ensure that its membership be \"fairly balanced\" (Count 3); and (3) exercise independent judgment without inappropriate influences from special interests (Count 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 2, 2018, Defendants moved to dismiss Western's original complaint, arguing that (1) Western lacked standing, (2) Counts 3 and 4 are non-justiciable, and (3) Counts 1 and 2 fail to state a claim. (Doc. 12.) On November 23, 2018, Western filed its First Amended Complaint, replacing Defendant DeVito with Scott Angelle, Director of the Bureau of Safety &amp; Environmental Enforcement. (Doc. 14);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). Although Western added factual information, the First Amended Complaint contains the same four claims as the original complaint. In light of Western's amended pleading, Defendants' motion to dismiss, (Doc. 12), was denied subject to renewal, (Doc. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 28, 2018, Western filed a motion for preliminary injunction, asking the Court to enjoin any further Committee and subcommittee meetings and operations-specifically the one scheduled for January 31, 2019-until Defendants comply with FACA's implementing regulations. (Doc. 17.) On December 17, 2018, Defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss combined with their response to Western's motion. (Doc. 24.) The grounds for dismissal were substantially the same as those argued in Defendants' previous\n   motion. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25.) On January 10, Defendants unsuccessfully sought to stay proceedings in light of the lapse in appropriations. (Doc. 34.) In that filing, Defendants indicated that the January 31 Committee meeting was cancelled, and other Committee operations were suspended during the lapse. (Doc. 35.) Western argues, however, that certain subcommittee and working group work is slated to continue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties take a fundamentally different view of the nature of FACA. Western's allegations, and the basis for its pending motion, rest on the principle purpose behind its enactment: the requirement that advisory committee work be both efficient and transparent. Defendants, on the other hand, base their arguments on the minimum required to comply with the text of the Act. While the dichotomy of these approaches is not dispositive, it highlights a troubling trend within the current administration's view of governing and the rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The survival of the majority of Western's claims depends on whether or not the Bureau of Land Management's (\"BLM\") implementing regulations under 43 C.F.R. subpart 1784 apply to the Royalty Committee. Because they do not, and FACA alone does not provide an adequate basis for judicial review, all but two of Western's claims are dismissed as non-justiciable under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because a court must assess its subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to a claim before ruling on the merits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruhrgas AG v.

And, this interest goes beyond that of public access to records and committee materials. For example, \"legislative history makes clear[ ] the 'fairly balanced' requirement [as alleged in Count 3] was designed to ensure that persons or groups directly affected by the work of particular advisory committee would have some representation on the committee.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Anti-Hunger Coal. v.

It seems that it does. If the concrete interest at stake is participation in and oversight for advisory committees, creating unnecessary committees that cut the public out of the process or having an allegedly one-sided committee are direct threats to that interest. Specifically, when an advisory committee is unnecessarily established or \u00a7 5's \"fairly balanced\" or \"inappropriately influenced\" requirements are ignored and groups directly affected by the work of the committee lack representation, \"persons having a direct interest in the committee's purpose suffer injury-in-fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Anti-Hunger Coal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1870554,5710356\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/711/1071/\">\n    711 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1074 n.2. And, Western has alleged that the actions of the Committee have interfered with Western's ability to provide services to its members, frustrating it goals. (Doc. 14 at \u00b6 20);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.

Thus, Western\n   has alleged procedural injury sufficient to confer organizational standing as to Counts 1, 3, and 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   That said, Western's informational and functional injury arguments do not contribute to a finding of standing. Western argues injury exists because it has been denied information about the Committee's composition and membership. In doing so, Western relies on BLM regulation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201784.2-2\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 1784.2-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c), which requires members of advisory committees to disclose direct or indirect interest(s) (including of spouses) involving land administered by the BLM. However, as discussed below, the Royalty Committee is not governed by the BLM regulations. Thus, this alleged injury does not provide a basis for standing. Additionally, Western alleges injury related to Counts 3 and 4 insofar as the Committee's actions impair Western's ability to function as an organization. Western argues that \"Defendants have disrupted [Western]'s operations by denying [it] and likeminded representatives even a single seat on the Committee.\" (Doc. 31 at 18.) While Western may have a good argument under\n   <em>\n    National Anti-Hunger Coalition\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    , see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1870554,5710356\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/711/1071/\">\n    711 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1074 n.2 (finding that organizations that sought but were denied membership on committee in which they had a direct interest suffered an injury in fact), as of the writing of this Order, Western's application for membership is pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049943\">\n    83 Fed.

Contrary to Western's argument, the Court cannot make a prediction about whether or not the Committee will deny it. This type of speculative injury does not provide a basis for standing.

Thus, while Defendants may be able to show\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-1.145\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-1.145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not apply at summary judgment or trial, Western states a claim under Count 2 as it relates to subcommittees and working groups. Further, Western's allegations also extend to the Committee itself, which undisputedly must provide the access and materials outlined in FACA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14 at \u00b6\u00b6 107, 108.) To the extent Defendants argue all Committee information and materials have been provided, that assertion remains disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Western further cites the Department's Manual, which extends the provisions of FACA \"to subcommittees and subgroups of advisory committees established or utilized by the Department.\" (308 DM 2.11, Ex.

Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A plaintiff is required to show \"that irreparable injury is\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   in the absence of an injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , 555 U.S. at 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \"[i]rreparable harm may be caused by activities broader than those that plaintiffs seek to enjoin.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Nat'l Marine Fisheries Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516486\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/803/#p819\">\n    886 F.3d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (9th Cir. 2018). \"There must be a sufficient causal connection between the alleged irreparable harm and the activity to be enjoined, and showing that the requested injunction would forestall the irreparable harm qualifies as such a connection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516486\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/803/#p819\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Western alleges irreparable harm on three fronts: (1) lost opportunity to influence Committee policymaking; (2) lost opportunity to understand and disseminate information related to Committee proceedings; and (3) environmental harm to Western's members. According to Western, \"[e]very day that the [Committee] operates in secret and without public input is an irreparably lost opportunity for the public to understand and comment on the nation's most important royalty policies.\" (Doc. 18 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Given that the only remaining claims are Counts 1 and 2, the only harm at issue is participation in and access to materials from the Committee as well as its subcommittees and working groups. Because it is unclear that these groups will continue to operate during the lapse, it is difficult to ascertain harm. That absence of information\n   also makes it difficult to say that Western has not been provided with the relevant documentation for a specific meeting.\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Comm. for Civil Rights Under Law v. Presidential Advisory Comm'n on Election Integrity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264327\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/54/#p69\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (D.D.C. 2017) (assessment of harm limited to what materials must be made available\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to meeting at issue). Further, Defendants indicate that the Committee posts all the materials that will be considered at each meeting on its website, \"including any recommendation from one of [its] subcommittees.\" (Doc. 25 at 17.) Thus, while\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [t]here may be other documents that could, in theory, further facilitate this public debate, ... based on the information presently available, it appears that the principal documents have or will be disclosed, and the public and Plaintiff will have a substantial opportunity to debate and provide input with respect to the work of the Commission. Accordingly, the harm that would flow from the failure to disclose\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   materials,\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the [relevant] meeting, is at this time too speculative to warrant injunctive relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Lawyers' Comm. for Civil Rights Under Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264327\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/54/#p69\">\n    265 F.Supp.3d at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Western conceded at oral argument that it has been able to participate in Committee meetings and provide feedback on proposals made by subcommittees and working groups to the larger Committee. While there may be a question as to whether Western should have access to more materials related to the operation of subcommittees and working groups, its current ability to participate in the process indicates it will not be irreparably harmed by continued operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In the absence of irreparable harm and in light of Western's undisputed ability to presently participate in Committee work, neither the equities nor the public interest favors an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Based on the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. 24) is GRANTED as to Counts 3 and 4 and DENIED as to Counts 1 and 2. Western's motion for preliminary injunctive relief (Doc. 17) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Defendants' original motion challenged Western's standing to bring all four claims. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docs. 12, 13.) It is now undisputed that Western has standing for its informational challenge (Count 2).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pub. Citizen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215707\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/440/#p446\">\n     491 U.S. at 449\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215707\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/440/#p446\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that two advocacy organizations' failure to obtain information subject to disclosure under FACA \"constitutes sufficiently distinct injury to provide standing to sue\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Because Western has standing under this theory, associational standing is not addressed. However, Defendants likely have the better argument that Western's allegation that \"its members are injured by policies encouraging the irresponsible leasing of public minerals nearby their properties,\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    by the [Committee]'s failure to consider policies that would ameliorate localized environmental destruction,\" (Doc. 31 at 21-22), is too speculative given the nature of the Committee and its work. Western does not show the harms identified can be linked to the unlawful creation of the Committee (Count 1) or biased, unbalanced membership (Counts 3, 4). Absent a more specific proposal in a more specific area, it seems that the members do not have standing to sue in their own right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
