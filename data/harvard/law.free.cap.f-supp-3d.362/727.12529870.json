INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action arises out of a decision by the U.S. Census Bureau, a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, to include a question regarding citizenship status on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire. The census surveys the number of persons in each household and in so doing, collects certain demographic information about those persons. While questions relating to citizenship have historically been part of the census process, not since 1950 has the decennial census asked whether each respondent is a citizen of the United States. Plaintiffs in these two related cases contend the decision to deviate from modern practice violates both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Plaintiffs in 18-cv-1865 are the State of California, by and through Attorney General Xavier Becerra, County of Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles, City of Fremont, City of Long Beach, City of Oakland, City of Stockton, and Los Angeles Unified School District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in 18-cv-2279 are City of San Jose and Black Alliance for Just Immigration (\"BAJI\"). Plaintiffs in each of the complaints in general contend that the inclusion of a citizenship question operates by design to depress an accurate count of certain immigrant communities residing in the United States. Defendants in both matters are Wilbur Ross, in his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce; the U.S. Department of Commerce; Ron Jarmin, in his official capacity as Acting Director of the U.S. Census Bureau; and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss all claims asserted against them. For the reasons set forth below, the motions to dismiss are denied in their entirety. First, plaintiffs have standing to challenge the decision by Secretary Ross to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Second, that decision is not insulated from judicial review as defendants insist. Third, assuming, as is required at the pleading stage, that all facts asserted in the operative complaints are true, plaintiffs have stated claims for relief under both the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution and the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The purpose of the \"actual Enumeration\" is to guide the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on their respective populations. Art. 1, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. The federal government also relies on census data to determine how to distribute billions of dollars in funding each year, including funds for Medicaid, Medicare Part B, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"), the State Children's Health Insurance Program (\"S-CHIP\"), and the Highway Planning and Construction Program.

The Secretary's stated justification was that the information was needed to provide DOJ with census-block-level data to assist in enforcing the VRA. A.R. at 1313. Based on a purported review of the Bureau's history of collecting citizenship information on the decennial census, the Secretary concluded that \"the citizenship question has been well tested.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    at 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the Secretary's request, the Census Bureau presented three alternatives for providing the data requested by DOJ: Option A called for continuing the status quo and providing DOJ with ACS citizenship data at the census-block-group level instead of the block level requested by DOJ; Option B provided for the placement of the ACS citizenship question on the decennial census; and Option C involved obtaining the requested information from existing federal administrative-record data.

A.R. at 1313-14. In particular, the Chief Scientist and Associate Director\n   of Research and Methodology at the Bureau, Dr. John M. Abowd, conducted analysis showing that addition of a citizenship question would have a negative effect on the accuracy and quality of the 2020 Census and would negatively impact response rates from non-citizen households. A.R. at 1277, 1279-82. The Secretary acknowledged that a \"significantly lower response rate by non-citizens could reduce the accuracy of the decennial census and increase costs for non-response follow up operations,\" but concluded that \"neither the Census Bureau nor the concerned stakeholders could document that the response rate would in fact decline materially\" as a consequence of his reinstating a citizenship question. A.R. at 1315. He noted that \"while there is widespread belief among many parties that adding a citizenship question could reduce response rates, the Census Bureau's analysis did not provide definitive, empirical support for that belief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    at 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Secretary Ross further offered the unadorned assumption that reduced census participation would be primarily limited to those individuals who may decline to participate regardless of whether the census includes a citizenship question.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants make four arguments in support of their motion to dismiss, two that are generally applicable to all claims advanced by the plaintiffs, and two that are specific to certain of those claims. First, defendants argue plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the Secretary's decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census. Plaintiffs' claimed injuries are loss of representation in Congress and in the Electoral College, and decreased federal funding due to reduced response rates of their residents. Defendants take the position these injuries are too speculative to confer Article III standing, and are not fairly traceable to the Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, defendants contend plaintiffs' challenge is unreviewable under the political question doctrine. According to defendants, the Constitution textually commits the \"[m]anner\" of conducting the census to Congress, and contains no judicially discoverable or manageable standards for determining which demographic questions may be included on the census form. Resolution of this case would, according to defendants, require a court order dictating the form and content of the decennial census, a policy determination defendants believe is ill-suited to judicial resolution and is expressly committed to the political branches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   With respect to plaintiffs' APA claim specifically, defendants contend the Secretary's actions are not subject to judicial review because the decision at issue is committed to agency discretion by law. Congress has authorized the Secretary to conduct the decennial census \"in such form and content as he may determine,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This broad delegation of authority, defendants argue, leaves a court with no meaningful standard to apply when evaluating the Secretary's choice to include certain demographic questions on the decennial census form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, defendants assert that plaintiffs' Enumeration Clause claim fails because the Secretary's decision is consistent with longstanding historical census practice of asking about citizenship and other demographic information. Success on plaintiff's theory, defendants argue, would call into question the constitutionality of asking any type of demographic question that lacks a direct relationship to the counting of the population and may cause some individuals not to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As defendants see it, the conjectural nature of plaintiffs' theory is evidenced by the lack of \"definitive, empirical\" evidence regarding the effect of adding a citizenship question to the decennial census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. at 1316;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1315-18.

A.R. at 1317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the pleading stage, plaintiffs are not required to prove facts supporting each element of the standing inquiry. Here, plaintiffs plausibly allege that the introduction of a citizenship question to the census will depress response rates, particularly\n   among immigrants and relatives of immigrants who may feel trepidation identifying themselves or others as non-citizens. Several factual allegations support this claim. As the FAC notes, since at least 1980, the Census Bureau has recognized that \"any effort to ascertain citizenship will inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count.\" FAC \u00b6 37 (citing\n   <em>\n    Fed.

In an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in 2016, four former Census Bureau Directors appointed by presidents of both parties expressed their belief that \"a one-by-one citizenship inquiry would invariably lead to a lower response rate to the Census in general,\" including a \"reduced rate of response overall and an increase in inaccurate response.\" FAC \u00b6 5; Brief of Former Directors of the U.S. Census Bureau as Amici Curiae in Support of Appellees at 23-26,\n   <em>\n    Evenwel v.

In 2017, the Bureau itself conducted a study that concluded there is \"an unprecedented groundswell\" of concern that could \"present a barrier to participation in the 2020 Census\" and have a \"disproportionate impact on hard-to-count populations,\" particularly immigrants and non-English speakers. FAC \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Most recently, defendant Jarmin acknowledged in a congressional hearing that the inclusion of a citizenship question would cause more than a \"minimal\" decline in 2020 Census participation, and that the decline \"would be largely felt in various sub-groups, in immigrant populations [and] Hispanic populations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jarmin Testimony starting at 1:39, response at 1:44:10; 1:50:35, response at 1:50:48. He also reported that the \"best approach\" recommended by the Census Bureau staff to obtain the information sought by DOJ \"would be to use administrative records rather than adding a citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205675832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   starting at 1:19:10, response at 1:21:30. Taken together, these allegations satisfy plaintiffs' burden to plead facts demonstrating injury that is likely to occur and not merely a conjectural possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants' other arguments also go to issues of proof. They contend plaintiffs cannot establish the probability of an undercount occurring due to the \"extensive procedures\" deployed by the Census Bureau to address non-responses and to obtain accurate data for those households that decline to respond.

Thus, defendants insist, plaintiffs cannot show use of the citizenship question alone will reduce self-response rates, or that an undercount will be higher in California. Once again, there is no requirement, at this juncture, that plaintiffs produce \"definitive, empirical\" evidence regarding the effect of adding a citizenship question to the census in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that California's population includes large numbers of immigrants and non-citizens relative to other states and that logically, an appreciable undercount of those particular subgroups will have an outsized impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 40; San Jose Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 85, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants next target the alleged connection between the projected undercount of the population and the risk plaintiffs will lose representation or funding as a consequence. Plaintiffs allege that an increased\n   undercount will impact the number of representatives California has in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College and will decrease their share of federal funds under a variety of federal programs. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 40-47. Because apportionment is a complex process that involves ranking states based on their population to determine priority for seats,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2 U.S.C. \u00a7 2a(a) ; https://wwww.census.gov/population/apportionment/about/computing.html, defendants insist that the impact on California's representation is merely hypothetical. While it may be, as defendants assert, that undercounts in other states will offset the effect on California in the final apportionment calculation, that is a determination on the merits. Defendants cannot defeat plaintiffs' as yet to be proven assertions about California's projected loss of congressional representation with equally unproven assertions regarding a lack of impact. The cases defendants offer to the contrary were decided on motions for summary judgment, where the parties' offers of proof were given due consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to funding related concerns, defendants acknowledge that the court in\n   <em>\n    National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty v.

Defendants, however, maintain these cases are distinguishable because they involved post-census challenges to counting methodologies, and none of them involved a challenge to the mere inclusion of a question on the census form. As with apportionment of representatives, defendants point out that allocation of funds under the programs cited by plaintiffs is \"not generally proportional to population, but is a function of multiple factors including, often, the populations of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   states.\" Mot. at 16 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205305\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (public transportation funding);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206337\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 6337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (education funding);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201301\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8)(A) (Medicaid funding) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants' attempts to distinguish the numerous cases finding standing where plaintiffs have alleged loss of funding are unpersuasive. First, the distinction between post-census challenges to calculation methodologies and pre-census challenges to the inclusion of a census question is of no consequence with respect to the nature of the injury alleged. All three of the above referenced census challenges were, as here, filed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the relevant decennial census was completed and\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   any alleged loss of funding could have taken place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as explained above with\n   respect to defendants' challenge to plaintiffs' allegations regarding apportionment, disputes about whether California will\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   lose federal funding are not proper for determination on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, defendants argue that even if plaintiffs can show Article III injury, their allegations are insufficient to bring them within the zone of interests protected by the Constitution's Enumeration Clause, which \"has no relation to, and was intended to, ensure that federal grant monies flow equally to all individuals.\" Mot. at 17. On the contrary, plaintiffs have alleged loss of funding and inadequate representation flowing from the Secretary's alleged failure to conduct an \"actual Enumeration\" as required by the Constitution.

I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. Defendants take the position that the command to conduct an \"actual enumeration\" presents a judicially cognizable question that courts have routinely answered, while the latter command regarding the \"manner\" of conducting the census presents a nonjusticiable political question reserved for Congress and by delegation, to the Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the phrase \"in such a Manner\" modifies the phrase \"[t]he actual Enumeration shall be made,\" defendants argue the text of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has full and exclusive control over the manner in which the decennial census is conducted. The census questionnaire, they reason, is synonymous with the \"form\" of the census, and it is the \"method\" by which an \"actual Enumeration\" is conducted. In defendants' telling, the decision to include a citizenship question concerns only the \"manner\" in which the Secretary performs the information-gathering function of the census. It does not, in their view, implicate questions of \"whom to count, how to count them, or where to count them.\" Mot. at 18. Thus, defendants read plaintiffs' challenge as directed at the \"way of performing or executing\" the census, a determination Congress has reserved to itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   These arguments fail for at least four reasons. First, while there is no question the language of the Constitution accords great deference to Congress, and by delegation to the Secretary, with respect to the methodology by which the decennial census is conducted, defendants offer no cases supporting a sharp dividing line between\n   reviewable actions implicating the \"Enumeration\" prong and unreviewable actions implicating only the \"Manner\" prong. Courts have routinely held that the Enumeration Clause does not textually commit exclusive, non-reviewable control over the census to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The latter considerations, which defendants concede are subject to judicial review, could reasonably be interpreted as describing different \"ways\" of \"performing or executing\" the census.

Judicially Manageable Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants characterize the decision to add a citizenship question as a policy decision regarding census procedures. In this case, defendants assert, the Secretary balanced the need for citizenship information against the cost and effectiveness of efforts to mitigate non-responses, the possibility of lower response rates, the cost of increased non-response follow-up, and the completeness and cost of administrative records.

Every census since then has collected demographic information beyond the number and location of inhabitants. Although no census since 1950 has asked ever respondent to report citizenship status, questions relating to citizenship have appeared on a long-form questionnaire sent to portions of the population from 1960 through 2000. Thus, it is clear that the mere asking of a question about citizenship on the census form is consistent with the historical conduct of the census.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p17\">\n    517 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744021\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/1/#p17\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that historical practice is a critical factor in examining an alleged violation of the Enumeration Clause). As discussed at oral argument in this matter, counsel for defendants could not point to any case where the constitutionality of a citizenship question was the subject of litigation. That said, the fact remains not only has Congress itself directed the inclusion of demographic questions on the census (before such determinations\n   were delegated to an agency), but the handful of lower courts to have entertained challenges to the Secretary's power to collect demographic information via the census questionnaire have rejected them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525715\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/766/#p796\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d at 801-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Yet plaintiffs do not frame their objection to the citizenship question as an inherent disagreement with citizenship as a proper subject for the census, nor is theirs a challenge to the general proposition that the Secretary is empowered by Congress to collect demographic information through the decennial census. The long history of demographic questions appearing on the census questionnaire, including questions regarding place of birth and immigration status, confirms that the specific act of including a citizenship question on the census is not, by and of itself, beyond the Secretary's authority under the Enumeration Clause. At oral argument, counsel for plaintiffs also made clear that they were not taking the position that every single past census that included a citizenship question was constitutionally defective. In other words, plaintiffs do not ask for a determination on whether the Constitution categorically prohibits the Secretary from asking census respondents about their citizenship, only whether he is precluded under these particular facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs agree that the standard for evaluating a challenge under the Enumeration Clause is an objective one-that is, the Secretary's actions either satisfy the constitutional mandate or they do not. Because the Constitution instructs the Secretary to count the population, plaintiffs urge the proper focus of the Court's inquiry is on the\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of asking a question about citizenship in the\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   decennial census taking. For that reason, plaintiffs argue, a question that chills participation in the census process today might not necessarily have been chilling in 1950. Indeed, the operative complaints are replete with examples of government policies, actions, and rhetoric within the last year that would tend to make non-citizens and their family members potentially afraid to divulge their household's citizenship status to a federal agency. These government activities logically shape the impact of asking a citizenship question on the 2020 Census questionnaire specifically. Thus, it is plaintiffs' position that the decision to ask a citizenship question in 2020 is reviewable under the Enumeration Clause without implicating the constitutionality of other demographic questions in general, or past iterations of the citizenship question in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Although a close question, plaintiffs' claim under the Enumeration Clause may proceed past the pleading stage. First, defendants' assertion, in their papers and at oral argument, that the Secretary's exercise of discretion to add questions to the census questionnaire is\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   subject to constitutional scrutiny, is overbroad. Second, although the census has included questions relating to citizenship and other demographic characteristics throughout its history, the constitutionality of asking about citizenship in particular has never been actually tested. Third, the Supreme Court has identified a \"strong constitutional interest in accuracy,\"\n   <em>\n    Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/#p474\">\n    536 U.S. at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/#p474\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and entertained challenges to the mechanics of conducting the decennial census-i.e. statistical adjustment to the initial census count, allocation of persons counted, procedures to tabulate survey responses, etc.-under that standard. The conclusion drawn from the aforementioned points is that while the content of the census questionnaire, including the specific questions that appear on it, is nearly always committed to the Secretary's sound discretion, there may be a rare question that is so uniquely impactful\n   on the process of counting itself, that it becomes akin to a mechanics-of-counting-type challenge, which is plainly reviewable under the Enumeration Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Here, plaintiffs aver that the citizenship question on the 2020 Census questionnaire is one such question. They argue it is unusually sensitive in light of the current political climate, that the question will have a material impact on the census count, that the effects will be unevenly distributed, and that the resulting undercount will be significant enough to affect the reapportionment of representatives among the states. Thus, while each and every question on the census need not be related to the goal of actual enumeration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldridge v.

Given these facts as alleged in the operative complaints, which must be taken as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs make a sufficient showing that the Secretary's decision to add a citizenship will undermine the \"strong constitutional interest in accuracy\" of the census,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/#p474\">\n    536 U.S. at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255253\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/452/#p474\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and thus violate the Constitution's actual enumeration command.
