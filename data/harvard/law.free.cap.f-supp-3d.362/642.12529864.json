The devices are designed to \"provide pacing therapy to support slow heart rhythms, and electrical shock or pacing therapy to treat fast heart rhythms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. If the defect occurs, the affected defibrillator could malfunction and cause serious health complications, including death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.

Plaintiff is what is referred to as a \"third-party payor\" (TPP) of medical expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Specifically relevant here, plaintiff, on behalf of its beneficiaries, paid for the cost of implanting the recalled devices and may be required to pay costs incurred in removing and replacing the devices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the complaint, St. Jude became aware of the battery defect as early as 2011, but failed to report or further investigate the problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 83-89.

In August 2016, St. Jude decided to recall the defective devices and worked with the FDA to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-02. On October 10, 2016, the FDA issued a Class I recall of 251,346 St. Jude devices sold in the United States and manufactured before May 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.

The court dismissed the case, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over St. Jude and that venue was improper because the central events in the case occurred outside of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    ASEA/AFSCME Local 52 Health Benefits Trust v.

Plaintiff alleges that by not timely disclosing the battery defect, St. Jude caused it and other proposed class members to needlessly pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the defective devices and their replacement costs.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants first argue that this action should be dismissed because plaintiff, as a TPP, lacks standing to recover for its plan participants' injuries.

Univ. of Minn.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11402196\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/797/#p801\">\n    304 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801 (8th Cir. 2002) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Causal Connection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff lacks standing because plaintiff's alleged injury is not fairly traceable to defendants' conduct. Defendants assert that the causal chain is too attenuated because there is a multi-step \"winding\" sequence of intervening events. Specifically, defendants argue that plaintiff's causal chain hinges on the following hypothetical events: (1) St. Jude disclosed the defect right away, (2) physicians and the public would have learned about the defect, (3) the FDA would have investigated the defect and issued a recall, (4) physicians would have stopped implanting devices in the proposed class members' plan participants, and (5) plaintiff would not have incurred costs associated with the defective devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But the connection between the wrongdoing and the injury is in fact straightforward: St. Jude put a defective product on the market that plaintiff paid for and must pay to replace. Even acknowledging that certain interim steps occurred before plaintiff paid for the defective devices, the fact is that plaintiff did pay for them and will pay for costs associated with replacing them. In other words, plaintiff has been directly harmed by St. Jude's alleged misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This conclusion is in accord with\n   <em>\n    Kinetic Co. v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674516\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/672/933/\">\n    672 F.Supp.2d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. 2009), which involved nearly identical allegations regarding battery defects in Medtronic's implantable cardiac defibrillators. In\n   <em>\n    Kinetic\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected the same standing arguments defendants make here. As to causation, the court concluded that the \"causative chain is not complicated\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Medtronic's failure to advise the FDA or the physicians who prescribed the device led doctors to continue to select, and insurers to continue to pay for, potentially defective devices without knowing of the potentially-catastrophic risk. Had Medtronic timely disclosed the risks it knew its product presented, insurers might have refused to pay for the original device or the costs to implant it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674516\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/672/933/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674516\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/672/933/\">\n    at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same is true here. As a result, the allegations are sufficient to establish causation for purposes of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

An injury is \"particularized\" when it \"affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   An injury is \"concrete\" when it \"actually exist[s].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff has not suffered an injury to a legally protected interest because they did not deal directly with plaintiff. The court disagrees. As discussed above, the fact that there were interim steps between defendants' conduct and plaintiff's injury does not sever the connection between the two occurrences. Plaintiff alleges that it has been financially harmed due to defendants' concealment of the battery defect, and that harm reflects the economic reality of our health insurance system. In\n   <em>\n    Kinetic\n   </em>\n   , the court emphatically rejected the same argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   But when Medtronic blithely asserts that the third-party payors - which ultimately reimbursed the physicians or hospitals which held the device in inventory - are barred from any recovery, it is wrong. It is wrong, because this cost is simply the last falling domino in a long line started by Medtronic. And when it falls, it injures the third-party payors. Medtronic cannot be protected against its own harm by marketing its products through intermediaries. Each intermediate player has been made whole. It ill-befits Medtronic - and the law will not allow it - to attempt to shield itself from its ultimate and true financial victim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674516\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/672/933/\">\n    672 F.Supp.2d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court also rejects that argument, and concludes that plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to confer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants next argue that plaintiff's claims should be dismissed as premature because there has been no determination that their conduct harmed any patients or, by extension, plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over an action if the action is not ripe for resolution.\n   <em>\n    Dakota, Minn. &amp; E.

As to negligence - based in part on the allegation that Medtronic continued to sell the defective lead after it received approval to sell a modified lead - the court held that the claim was preempted because the FDA allowed Medtronic to sell the unmodified lead and, thus, any obligation to discontinue those sales would impose a state requirement that \"would be 'different from or in addition to' the federal requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, to the extent the negligence claim was based on Medtronic's failure to timely file adverse events reports with the FDA, the court determined that the claim was impliedly preempted under \u00a7 337(a) as a private party's attempt to enforce the MDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n    at 1205-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that the plaintiffs' manufacturing defect claim - based on the allegation that Medtronic failed to comply with FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) - was preempted because the plaintiffs \"failed to identify any specific federal requirement in the PMA approval for the Sprint Fidelis Leads that forms the basis for an unpreempted parallel claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n    at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, with respect to the breach of express warranty claims, which were premised on representations that the leads \"were safe, effective, fit and proper for their intended use,\" the court concluded that to prevail, the plaintiffs were required to \"persuade a jury that Sprint Fidelis Leads were not safe and effective, a finding that would be contrary to the FDA's approval of the PMA Supplement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n    at 1207-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Kinetic Co., Inc. v.

Minn. Apr. 19, 2011), the court dismissed Kinetic's state-law claims (relevant here, violation of Minnesota's consumer fraud act, unjust enrichment, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and misrepresentation by omission) as preempted. Kinetic alleged, as plaintiff\n   does here, that Medtronic manufactured and sold ICDs with defective batteries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Relying heavily on\n   <em>\n    Sprint Fidelis\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that all but one of the claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which were based on \"allegations that Medtronic failed to disclose the defects in the devices and that Medtronic affirmatively misrepresented the safety and effectiveness of the devices,\" were preempted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. In holding that the claims were expressly preempted under \u00a7 360k, the court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Kinetic seeks to hold Medtronic liable for failing to include additional warnings - specifically, a warning about the devices' battery problems and resulting high risk of failure. But Kinetic admits that there is no federal requirement that Medtronic disclose this information to doctors or patients. Because there is no such requirement under the FDCA, Kinetic is seeking to use state law to impose requirements on Medtronic that are \"different from, or in addition to,\" the requirements imposed by the FDCA .... Kinetic cannot do this under \u00a7 360k.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court further held that Kinetic's claim that Medtronic violated federal regulations by failing to timely disclose the battery problems to the FDA was impliedly preempted as \" 'an attempt by private parties to enforce the MDA.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sprint Fidelis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789842\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/1200/#p1204\">\n    623 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1205-06 ). As in\n   <em>\n    Sprint Fidelis\n   </em>\n   , the court also concluded that Kinetic's claim that Medtronic falsely represented and warranted the safety of the devices was preempted because to prevail Kinetic would have to establish that the devices were unsafe, which would contradict FDA approval of the device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Pinsonneault v.

The court specifically held that the proposed claims would be expressly and impliedly preempted for the reasons set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sprint Fidelis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kinetic\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3938412\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/953/1006/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3938412\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/953/1006/\">\n    at 1015-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court is unpersuaded that this case is factually or legally distinct from the above cases so as to require a different result.
