Subsequently, Buckeye engaged G &amp; M to sample soil and groundwater at the Site and at the Neighboring Properties. Strayton Dep., Ex. H at 3. In 1991, G &amp; M collected ground and groundwater samples from the Neighboring Properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   Roth Report at 6-7. These samples contained aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, and other pesticides.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   G &amp; M implemented Method 8080 when analyzing the soil and ground water samples.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 20, 1992, Specialty entered an agreement with the OEPA and Buckeye, allowing access to the Neighboring Properties to investigate and remediate the contaminations.

('Respondent'), its officers and directors in their corporate capacity, agents, assigns, and successors in interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   1992 Director Orders at 1. In the 1992 Director Orders, the OEPA determined that Buckeye used pesticides at the Site until at least 1987. 1992 Director Orders at \u00b6 3. Those pesticides included chlordane, aldrin, heptachlor, and dieldrin. 1992 Director Orders at \u00b6 3. The 1992 Director Orders state \"[Buckeye] disposed of hazardous wastes at the Facility, and has placed or caused to be placed industrial\n   wastes or other wastes in a location where they cause or threaten to cause pollution of the waters of the state.\" 1992 Director Orders at \u00b6 10. The 1992 Director Orders would terminate upon Buckeye: (i) proving to the OEPA that all tasks had been completed, (ii) paying the OEPA's oversight costs, and (iii) demonstrating that the remaining contamination met the OEPA's acceptable risk levels. 1992 Director Orders at 12; Ex. 13, Ltr. To John E. Breen from D. Tjoelker, June 21, 1996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By 1992, John E. Breen was managing Buckeye's environmental issues. Strayton Aff. at \u00b6 6. He negotiated the 1992 Director Orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   John E. Breen also hired and oversaw environmental consultants, ordered samples and forwarded the results to the OEPA, ensured the Neighboring Properties were accessible, arranged for remedial equipment and supplies, and worked with Buckeye's insurance carriers to pay for remedial work outlined in the 1992 Director Orders. Pl.'s Ex. 11, J. E. Breen Letter to OEPA, June 8, 1992; Pl.'s Ex. 12, J. E.

Roth Report at 7. Based on the results of those samples, G &amp; M submitted an interim action report (the \"Interim Remedy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In December 1992, G &amp; M presented its investigatory results and Interim Remedy to the OEPA. Strayton Dep., Ex. H. G &amp; M confirmed the presence of pesticides in soil and groundwater at the Neighboring Properties but concluded that the groundwater contamination posed no threat to human health or the environment at 39 of the 44 lots in the neighboring subdivision, which were therefore suitable for residential development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13; 40-41. G &amp; M determined that contamination levels at Lots 40, 42, and 43\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   exceeded residential levels, but that the contamination would naturally degrade to acceptable levels by 1996.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. G &amp; M recommended that if Specialty planned to develop the 39 unaffected lots, it should enhance the vegetative growth at Lots 42 and 43 to minimize any potential exposure at the non-contaminated lots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. The Interim Remedy also recommended that Buckeye sample the soil in two to four years to determine whether the level of pesticide contamination was actually decreasing, and to ensure the integrity of the cover material placed over the contamination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 24, 1993, the OEPA approved G &amp; M's Interim Remedy with a revised \"Recommended Remedial Actions\" section, which recommended revegetation at the contaminated area, unless affected lots were to be developed, in which case installation of a soil cover was recommended to eliminate potential exposure to the hazardous substances. Trabue Ex. 10, Ltr. to J.E. Breen from D. Tjoelker (ECF No. 118-14). Upon the OEPA's approval of the Interim Remedy, Specialty agreed to notify Buckeye before selling or developing the four lots with pesticide contamination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 25, 1995, Specialty sold the entire 38-acre tract, except for lots 39, 40, 42, and 43.

Tjoelker, Dec. 5, 1995 (ECF No. 118-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In May 1995, the OEPA sent a letter (\"May 1995 Letter\") to John E. Breen to\n   document telephone conversations on the development properties occurring at the Site and the Neighboring Properties Trabue Ex. 12, Ltr. to J. E. Breen from D. Tjoelker (ECF No. 118-17). The May 1995 Letter outlined Buckeye's obligations under the 1992 Director Orders, including the requirement that Buckeye or its officers implement the remedial actions described in the Interim Remedy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter also notified Buckeye that it had 30 days to submit a workplan for the design and installation of a soil over the contaminated portion of the Neighboring Properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the May 1995 Letter reminded Buckeye that the OEPA would evaluate the sampling data, quality assurance, and laboratory reports, once the OEPA received that information from Buckeye.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the letter notified Buckeye that if the pesticide contaminant concentrations met acceptable residential risk goals, then Buckeye would not be obligated to implement the soil cover that the OEPA previously recommended.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 29, 1995, John E. Breen sent the OEPA a remedial action plan for the Neighboring Properties. Pl.'s Ex. 13, May 1995 Ltr. from J. E. Breen (ECF No. 116-2). On June 7, 1995, John E. Breen sent the test results soil samples to the OEPA. Roth Report at 9. A &amp; L Great Lakes Laboratories (\"A &amp; L\") performed the laboratory analysis using Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 9, 1995, the OEPA sent John E. Breen a letter, which expressed the OEPA's concern regarding A &amp; L's improper FDA methodology and explained that the proper methodology is the EPA-approved Method 8080.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, on June 12, 1995, the OEPA collected soil samples from the Neighboring Properties for comparison with the samples that John E. Breen had previously sent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ross Analytical Services, Inc. analyzed the soil samples for the OEPA using Method 8080 and determined that maximum concentrations of pesticides still exceeded remedial goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a letter dated June 21, 1996, the OEPA notified Buckeye that a developer, H.R. Ransom, intended to pursue residential development of Lot 42. Trabue Ex. 13 at 1 (ECF No. 118-17). The letter also explained that future soil sampling plans were required within two to four years and that Buckeye was obligated to submit a sampling plan and the name of the selected lab.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Further, the OEPA notified Buckeye that while the Neighboring Properties' uncontaminated lots underwent residential development, Buckeye was required to ensure the integrity of the cover material and to implement landscaping and vegetation actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the OEPA updated Buckeye on the status of the 1992 Director Orders, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   To date, Buckeye Terminix has completed the field investigation, risk assessment, and investigation report. Implementation of the remedy is ongoing. The cover material is in place and vegetation activities are yet to be completed. Final termination of the order ... will occur once Buckeye Terminix has shown that all tasks of the statement of work and payment of Ohio EPA oversight costs have been completed and certified in writing.

The 2003 Report detailed the results of soil sampling and chlordane analysis of Lot 42 in 1992, 1995, and 2002. Trabue Ex. 18 (ECF No. 118-22). Upon reviewing the 2003 Report, the OEPA notified John E. Breen that the OEPA denied the soil sampling results because Buckeye and its consultants implemented the unapproved FDA analytical method, rather than Method 8080 (or the updated 8081A). Trabue Ex. 19 (ECF No. 118-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In December 2003, the OEPA collected soil samples from the Neighboring Properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The maximum concentrations that the OEPA detected still exceeded permissible levels.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While collecting soil samples, investigators discovered a partially buried 55-gallon drum, which contained trace amounts of hazardous substances.

Procedural Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On August 18, 2016, the State sued Defendants for various claims related to waste contamination. The State has moved for summary judgment against several Defendants, which, for clarity, the Court has organized into four groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, against John G., John E., and Janice Breen (the \"Breens\"), the State alleges counts one (cost recovery under CERLCA), two (failure to comply with an order), three (operation of a hazardous waste facility without a permit), four (failure to have a closure plan), five (failure to remove hazardous waste in accordance with an approved closure plan), six (unpermitted discharges of industrial wastes and/or other wastes into waters of the state), seven (causing or contributing to soil contamination and/or water pollution), eight (statutory nuisance), nine (common law nuisance), and ten (ultrahazardous activity). The State moves the Court to enter summary judgment in its favor against the Breens on counts one, two, three, four, and five. The Breens filed a memorandum in opposition to the State's motion. The Breens also filed their own Motion for Summary Judgment regarding all ten counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, against Trabue, the State alleges counts one, three, four, five, eight, nine, and ten. With its Motion for Judgment on\n   the Pleadings, Trabue proved grounds for dismissal of counts three, four, five, and ten. Now before the Court are crossmotions for summary judgment by the State and Trabue. The State moves the Court to enter summary judgment in its favor against Trabue on count one. Trabue, on the other hand, moves the Court to enter summary judgment in its favor on all remaining counts against it (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one, eight, and nine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Third, in its Complaint the State alleges all ten counts against Buckeye, which has never made an appearance in this case. The State now moves for summary judgment against Buckeye on counts one, two, three, four, and five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Fourth, against Dick, the State alleges counts one, three, four, five, eight, nine, and ten. The Court later dismissed counts three and ten. In its Motion for Summary Judgment, the State does not move against Dick. Currently pending before the Court is a Joint Motion to Enter Consent Decree between the State and Dick, which Trabue opposes. The Court does not address that motion in this opinion. The motions for summary judgment filed by Trabue, the Breens, and the State are now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In other words, the State contends that John E. Breen operated Buckeye when it disposed of hazardous substances. Specifically, the State contends that John E. Breen:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   had the authority to ensure compliance-he hired contractors, directed sampling, communicated with Ohio EPA, paid invoices to Ohio EPA, and sought reimbursement from insurance companies. He knew what was required for compliance; and he knew that the remedy was not complete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Pl.'s Reply Brief at 2 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In response, John E. Breen concedes he began working for Buckeye around 1991. But because the State agrees that no disposal occurred after 1987, he contends, all his compliance actions on behalf of Buckeye are irrelevant. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There is no dispute that from about 1991 to 2004, John E. Breen hired environmental\n   consultants, directed sampling analysis, and oversaw the removal of a 55-gallon drum. But although John E. Breen actively directed operations related to remedying the pollution at the facility, the State has not offered evidence that he conducted operations at the time of any hazardous disposal. For example, the State asserts that John E. Breen operated Buckeye Terminix from 1992 to 2004, yet also admits that there is no proof of a hazardous release at the facility after 1987.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. S.J. at 16.

Breen at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Therefore, because John E. Breen never conducted operations having to do with decisions about compliance with environmental regulations at the time of any hazardous disposal, he is not a PRP under section 9607(a)(2) of CERCLA. Thus, regarding count one, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   John E. Breen summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     b. Buckeye\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In 2002, John G. and John E. Breen ceased operating Buckeye and sold its assets. In 2007, the State of Ohio cancelled Buckeye's standing. Buckeye has not entered an appearance in this case. On that basis, the State previously moved the Court to enter default judgment against BTX Enterprises. (ECF No. 114). The Court denied that motion. (ECF No. 130).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Now the State moves for summary judgment against Buckeye, arguing that Buckeye is liable for response costs since it operated at the Site from 1980 until 2002. There is no dispute that during that time Buckeye operated its business, stored its trucks and chemicals, used and handled the hazardous materials still present in the environment, and installed then later removed the underground storage tank for pesticide-contaminated water. Additionally, the State asserts that Buckeye is liable because the company signed the 1992 Director Orders, thereby accepting responsibility and promising to remedy the contamination at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Although Buckeye released hazardous substances at the facility, the Court cannot hold Buckeye liable. Sister courts around the Sixth Circuit have consistently refused to hold defunct corporations liable for response costs under CERCLA. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Distler\n   </em>\n   , the court determined a corporation that had dissolved nine years earlier and a shareholder to whom corporate assets had been distributed could not be held liable under CERCLA for federal government's response costs in cleaning up hazardous waste that corporation had previously released.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss because the government offered \"no convincing authority to support its position that a corporation which has completely wound down and distributed its assets can be held liable under CERCLA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7392029\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/741/643/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7392029\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/741/643/\">\n    at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School Dist. v.

Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the State summary judgment against Buckeye on count one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     c.

There is also no dispute that Buckeye caused all the contamination at the Neighboring Properties and the Site. The State claims that Trabue, as the current owner of the Neighboring Properties, is strictly liable as a PRP because Buckeye dumped chlordane that migrated to three of Trabue's parcels, where it remains. But the State never argues whether the elements of a prima facie CERCLA violation apply to Trabue. Instead the State concludes that \"through strict liability, Trabue Dublin is jointly and severally liable for the State's response costs under CERCLA.\" Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In response, Trabue refutes that it is a PRP under any section of CERCLA. To support this argument, Trabue relies on\n   <em>\n    Alprof Realty LLC v.

The Court finds Trabue's argument persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   First, Trabue has established it is not a PRP under section 9607(a)(1) because Trabue does not own\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   operate a hazardous waste facility. To be held liable under section 9607(a)(1) requires current ownership and active participation in the hazardous release.\n   <em>\n    Brighton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11704662\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/153/307/#p313\">\n    153 F.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (an operator is one who must have \"performed some affirmative acts ... before they can be held responsible\"). The State concedes Trabue never conducted any operations related to the disposal of hazardous substances at the facility. The State also agrees that Buckeye was the sole cause of the contamination at the Site and the Neighboring Properties. Therefore, Trabue is not a PRP under section 9607(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Second, Trabue has also established that it is not a PRP under section 9607(a)(2), which imposes liability on \"any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Trabue purchased the Neighboring Properties from its parent company, Specialty, in 2010. The State has never contended that anyone disposed of hazardous wastes at the Site or Neighboring Properties since 1987. Thus, section 9607(a)(2) does not apply to Trabue. Accordingly, Trabue is not a PRP.

Breen, and Buckeye failed to comply with the 1992 Director Orders, thereby violating Ohio Revised Code sections 3734.11(A) and 3734.13. Section 3734.13(C) lists numerous civil penalties a court may impose on a person who violates \"a term or condition of a[n] ... order.\" Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 3734.13(C). The issue is whether the State has established there is no dispute of material fact that the Breens and Buckeye violated the 1992 Director Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The 1992 Director Orders required Buckeye and \"its officers and directors in their corporate capacity, agents, assigns, and successors in interest\" to remediate the contamination at the Site and Neighboring Properties. The 1992 Director Orders required the bound parties to complete \"investigatory field work, reporting requirements and implementation of any remedial action found necessary....\" Finally, the 1992 Director Orders \"shall be satisfied when [Buckeye] demonstrates in writing and certifies to Ohio EPA's satisfaction that all activities required under these Orders (including any additional tasks which OEPA determined to be necessary in accordance with the provisions of these Orders and payment of oversight costs) have been completed and Ohio EPA approves such certification in writing.\" 1992 Director Orders at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The State concedes that the Breens initially complied with the 1992 Director Orders by capping the contamination with soil, establishing vegetation, and performing some sampling. Pl.'s Mot. for S.J. at 18. The State argues, however, that the Breens did not perform all required follow up actions to ensure that the remedies were effective.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the State argues the 1992 Director Orders still apply to Buckeye and the Breens because they never requested the OEPA to terminate the 1992 Director Orders. For that reason, the State contends, Buckeye and the Breens are still bound by the Orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court must determine whether Buckeye, John G. Breen, and John E. Breen are bound by the 1992 Director Orders. The Court looks to Ohio Revised Code section 1701.88 for guidance, since count two is a state law claim. Section 1701.88 establishes the powers of an Ohio corporation after dissolution and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (B) The ... cancellation of the articles of a corporation ... shall not eliminate or impair any remedy available to or against the corporation or its directors, officers, or shareholders for any right or claim existing, or liability incurred, prior to the dissolution, if ... [a]ny person before five years after the date of the dissolution or within the time limits otherwise required by ... any other provision of law, whichever is less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   O. R. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701.88(B). Accordingly, section 1701.88(B) limits the period a dissolved Ohio corporation can be liable for any existing claim or right against it to five years after the corporation's dissolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Here, the Ohio Secretary of State cancelled Buckeye's articles of incorporation on February 6, 2007. Breen Dep. at 30:12-17; Breen Dep., Ex 7. Therefore, remedies available against Buckeye and its directors, officers, and shareholders for any right existing prior to its dissolution were no longer cognizable against Buckeye after February 6, 2012. To be clear, this statute only limits Buckeye's capacity to sue or be\n   sued based on its corporate status. Accordingly, the Court must address whether individuals can be held personally liable for violating an environmental enforcement action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The State relies on\n   <em>\n    Ohio ex rel. DeWine v. Muncy\n   </em>\n   , where this Court refused to dismiss the State of Ohio's claim alleging the defendant, the previous President and owner of a defunct company, failed to comply with an Ohio EPA Director Final Findings and Order agreement, No. 3:15-cv-376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201177617\">\n    2017 WL 1177617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D. Ohio March 30, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Muncy\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that the defendant was bound by the requirements of the Order because, as President and owner of the company that entered the agreement, he knew his duties to act, ignored the Ohio EPA's warnings, and had the requisite authority to implement the requirements of the Order. The Court finds\n   <em>\n    Muncy\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   John E. and John G. Breen negotiated and agreed to the 1992 Director Orders. Therefore, they knew what the Orders required. In fact, after selling and winding up Buckeye in 2002, John E. Breen continued communicating with the OEPA about follow-up testing and remediation. Moreover, around 2004, John E. Breen hired consultants to test soil samples from the facility and sent those results to the OEPA. But when the OEPA immediately notified the Breens that the analysis method was insufficient, the Breens ignored the OEPA's requests and notices that additional tests were required. In 2008, the OEPA again notified the Breens that additional sampling was necessary and that the original remedies had failed. Again, the Breens refused to act or respond. Strayton Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; Breen Dep. 54:17-22. Therefore,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Additionally, the State points out that courts around Ohio have imposed liability and civil penalties on individuals who violated an environmental statute, even when the person was also an officer or employee of a corporate defendant.

Breen both served as officers and directors of Buckeye from at least 1992 to around 2002. John E. Breen oversaw sampling and remedial measures, which included capping the contamination with soil, establishing vegetation, and serving as Buckeye's primary contact with the OEPA. In the same manner, John G. Breen signed the 1992 Director Orders as the President of Buckeye and oversaw the operations and finances of Buckeye until he and John E. Breen organized its asset sale in 2002. Further, John\n   G. and John E. Breen split the proceeds of that sale between themselves. Therefore, the Breens actively participated in negotiating, executing, and then following the 1992 Director Orders. Further, they had the authority and finances to comply with the 1992 Director Orders, but instead chose to ignore the OEPA. Conversely, no such evidence has been presented against Janice Breen.

In its Complaint, the State claims that the contamination at or near the Site and Neighboring Properties \"has or is threatening to damage members of the public including neighboring property residents who may come into contact with the contaminated soil and ground water.\" Pl.'s Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 130-31. In other words, the State claims that Trabue is liable for common law and statutory nuisance because hazardous substances at the Neighboring Properties threaten trespassers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Trabue first argues that the statute does not apply because it was never intended to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, which are comprehensively regulated under section 3734. Moreover, Trabue contends that, even if the statute did apply, the State's claim must fail because undisputed facts demonstrate that there is no current threat to the public or neighboring property owners, and that the State's witnesses have conceded the absence of any threat to the public. In that regard, Trabue argues that the pesticides at the Neighboring Properties only potentially threaten a trespasser and that a landowner owes no duty to a trespasser, except to refrain from willful, wanton, or reckless conduct that will likely injure the trespasser. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Here, the parties agree the Neighboring Properties still have hazardous substances exceeding levels appropriate for residential use. Yet the lots composing Neighboring Properties are not used for residential purposes-they remain undeveloped. Moreover, the State and Trabue's experts have concluded that the remaining pesticides at the Neighboring Properties do not pose a threat to nearby residents. Therefore, the only members of the public potentially threatened\n   by exposure to those hazardous substances are hypothetical trespassers. This is fatal to the State's claim because trespassing is not a public right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Trabue summary judgment on counts eight and nine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
