On October 24, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Response to [Defendant's Motion] and a Reply in Support of [Plaintiff's Motion] (\"Plaintiff's Response\") [ECF No. 57]. Both Plaintiff and Defendant have also included statements of material facts within their respective motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has considered the parties' submissions, the record, and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a coverage dispute between Plaintiff, an insurance company, and Defendant, its insured. On May 17, 2018, Clyde Salmon filed an amended complaint against Defendant and Alan Tibaldeo\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in state court, seeking damages for injuries stemming from an automobile accident that occurred on May 29, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 2; State Court Complaint [ECF No. 47-1] ). Salmon was injured when a car operated by Tibaldeo backed into him in the loading zone of the Jade Condominium in Sunny Isles, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 2). The State Court Complaint alleges one claim for relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Defendant, and includes the allegation that Tibaldeo injured Salmon while \"operating [a] vehicle in the course and scope of his employment with [Defendant] and/or as an agent of [Defendant].\" (State Court Compl. \u00b6 8 (alteration added);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff insures Defendant through a commercial general liability policy (the \"Policy\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 3). The Policy affords coverage for bodily injury caused by accidents, subject to certain exclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). One such exclusion is the \"auto exclusion,\" which states the Policy does not apply to \" '[b]odily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, 'auto' or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added) ). The Policy contains a number of definitions for an \"insured,\" but the only relevant definition provided by the parties includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"... your \"employees\", other than either your \"executive officers\" (if you are an organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability\n   company) or your managers (if you are a limited liability company) but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Policy defines an \"employee\" as including \"leased worker\" but not a \"temporary worker.\" (Def.'s Mot. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Count I of the Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff has no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant with respect to any damages alleged in the state court case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. 6). Count II is directed to Tibaldeo. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Under Florida law, \"[t]he duty to defend must be determined from the allegations in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Fla. Ins. Guar. Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931132\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/908/435/#p443\">\n    908 So.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (Fla. 2005) (citations omitted). In other words, the duty to defend \"is determined solely by the allegations against the insured, not by the actual facts, nor the insured's version\n   of the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Irvine v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7465790\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/630/579/#p579\">\n    630 So.2d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579-80 (Fla. 3d DCA 1993) (citation omitted). Therefore, it is the case that \"[w]hen the actual facts are inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint, the allegations in the complaint control in determining the insurer's duty to defend.\"\n   <em>\n    Baron Oil Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7615182\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/470/810/#p814\">\n    470 So.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985) (alteration added; citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court rejects Defendant's contention it should look beyond the four corners of the State Court Complaint on the basis determination of the duty to defend \"strictly by looking at the pleading, particularly conclusory pleading, and [putting] blinders on as to what it actually knows, is unfair.\" (Def.'s Mot. 16 (alteration added) ). Defendant cites no case or legal authority for its position the Court should ignore binding Florida law, and the Court will not disregard the requirements set forth by Florida's courts - regardless of whether or not these requirements are \"unfair.\" The Court thus considers only the State Court Complaint and the language of the Policy in determining whether Plaintiff has a duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The language of the Policy precludes coverage for injuries resulting from automobile accidents when the automobile is driven by an insured. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 3). Thus, if Tibaldeo is an insured, then the auto exclusion applies and Plaintiff has no duty to defend Defendant from the allegations in the State Court Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwriters at Lloyd's of London v. McCaul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8349531\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/949/1137/#p1140\">\n    949 So.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (Fla. 3d DCA 2007) (holding an auto exclusion bars coverage if \"the insured's alleged liability arose from the use of its vehicle\"). The State Court Complaint alleges Tibaldeo was either an \"employee\" or an \"agent\" of Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Court Compl. \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because the auto exclusion only bars coverage for injuries caused by insureds, Plaintiff has a duty to defend Defendant if Tibaldeo is not an insured under at least\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   of the State Court Complaint's theories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westmoreland v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11867786\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/176/#p180\">\n    704 So.2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997) (\"[W]here a complaint alleges facts that are partially within and partially outside the coverage of an insured's policy, the insurer is not only obligated to defend, but must defend the entire suit.\" (alteration added; internal quotation marks and citations omitted) ). In other words, if both employees\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   agents are insureds under the Policy, the auto exclusion applies and Plaintiff has no duty to defend - but if either employees\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   agents do not qualify as insureds under the Policy, Plaintiff must defend the entire suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11867786\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/176/#p180\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Employees are clearly defined as insureds under the Policy, and therefore excluded from coverage by the auto exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 3; Def.'s Mot. 4). Thus, the only question in this case is whether an agent of Defendant counts as an insured under the Policy, triggering the auto exclusion. The parties provide two competing cases on this question. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Discover Property and Casualty Insurance Company v. Lexington Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 7-8), which held if the driver of the vehicle \"were an agent rather than an employee, he would not be an insured, but the auto exclusion would apply via respondeat superior.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795508\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/664/1296/#p1303\">\n    664 F.Supp.2d 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303 (S.D. Fla. 2009). Defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Luhman v. Covington Specialty Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. 5), which held \"[b]ecause an agent would not fit within the policy exclusion, there might be coverage - which means [Plaintiff] had a duty to defend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No. 16-20044-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20850178\">\n    2017 WL 850178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 2, 2017) (alterations added). According to Plaintiff, \"\n   <em>\n    Luhman\n   </em>\n   got it wrong and\n   <em>\n    Discover\n   </em>\n   got it right.\" (Pl.'s Reply 5). Defendant disagrees, arguing\n   <em>\n    Luhman\n   </em>\n   relied on \"the precedential value of a Florida Appellate Court decision,\" while\n   <em>\n    Discover\n   </em>\n   did not. (Def.'s Reply 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant. The\n   <em>\n    Discover\n   </em>\n   court reasoned the auto exclusion applied to the acts of agents because \"[t]he act of an employee or agent of a corporation is the act of the corporation itself\" under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , and the corporation was itself an insured.\n   <em>\n    Discover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795508\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/664/1296/#p1303\">\n    664 F.Supp.2d at 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration added). Yet, if an employee or agent of a corporation is considered an insured so long as the corporation itself is defined as an insured, the Policy's definition of \"insured\" as including \"your employees\" (Pl.'s Mot. 3) is \"rendered superfluous, violating the premise that the judiciary seeks to provide meaning to every contractual term.\"\n   <em>\n    BioHealth Med. Lab., Inc. v. Cigna Health &amp; Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407328\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/706/521/#p524\">\n    706 F. App'x 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524 (11th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Had Plaintiff wanted to exclude coverage for agents of Defendant, it should have defined agents as insured persons under the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court agrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Luhman\n   </em>\n   . The State Court Complaint frames its allegations in the alternative - that Tibaldeo operated the vehicle \"in the course and scope of his employment with [Defendant]\n   <strong>\n    and/or as an agent\n   </strong>\n   of [Defendant.]\" (State Court Compl. \u00b6 8 (alteration added; emphasis added) ). Faced with such alternative positions taken in pleadings, \"Florida [c]ourts have applied similar 'auto exclusions' and have found that there is, or can be, a distinction between an employee and an agent under such policies, where allegations of employees in the complaint would exclude coverage, whereas allegations of an agency relationship would not.\"\n   <em>\n    Luhman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20850178\">\n    2017 WL 850178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (alteration added). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Category 5 Mgmt. Grp., LLC v. Companion Prop. and Casualty Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   , the policy \"defined 'insured' as including appellant and its employees\" but did not mention agents.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014983\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/20/#p24\">\n    76 So.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011). Because the policy defined \"insureds\" as employees but not agents, the court found language in the complaint indicating \"a more generalized principal-agent relationship ... fairly brought the suit outside the automobile exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7014983\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/76/20/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Discover Properties\n   </em>\n   , a federal case, cannot overcome Defendant's citations to\n   <em>\n    Luhman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Category 5\n   </em>\n   because the Court is \"bound to adhere to decisions of the state's intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state's highest court would decide the issue otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v.
