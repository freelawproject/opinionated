(\"Apple\"). Plaintiff asserts a multitude of claims relating to Apple Watches, which allegedly contain a defect that causes the Watches' screen to crack, shatter, or detach. Before the Court is Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint. ECF No. 35 (\"Mot.\"). Having considered the parties' submissions, the relevant law, and the record in this case, the Court GRANTS Apple's motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Apple first began to sell its Watches in April 2015, when Apple introduced its\n   First Generation of Watches. ECF No. 28 at \u00b6 2 (\"AC\"). Since then, Apple has released the Series 1, Series 2, and the Series 3 Watches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff complains that the Series 1, Series 2, and Series 3 Watches contain a defect because the Watch screens are cracking, shattering, or detaching from the Watch bodies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. Plaintiff claims that \"Apple has actively concealed and failed to disclose the Defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff, a Colorado resident, purchased his Series 2 Stainless Steel 38mm Apple Watch on or about December 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 47. He did so after reviewing Apple's promotional materials for Series 2 Watches, which advertised the Watch as a good compliment to sporting activities such as swimming, running, and biking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. However, on or about March 9, 2018, the screen on Plaintiff's Watch detached from the Watch body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Plaintiff took his broken Watch to an Apple Store in Lone Tree, Colorado, where Apple Store employees informed Plaintiff that the damage was not covered by the limited warranty and that he had to pay $ 249 to repair the Watch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff declined to have his watch repaired, explaining that \"[i]n the event that Plaintiff decides to have the repair done, he (as do other members of the Class) would still run the risk of future harm as the repaired Watch would also be prone to the same Defect described herein.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that his experience \"is identical to the experiences of thousands of Apple Watch owners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Plaintiff cites consumer complaints posted on Apple's online forum to suggest that Apple had knowledge of the alleged defect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50, 53 (\"[C]onsumers' complaints at Apple Stores, to Apple Support, and online leave no doubt that Apple is fully aware of the Defect.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff notes that Apple provides a limited warranty for purchasers of the Watch, which covers the \"product against manufacturing defects beginning on the original purchase date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. The warranty is one year for most models of the Watch, including the one that Plaintiff purchased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apple warrants the Watches \"against defects in materials and workmanship when used normally in accordance with Apple's published guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. The limited warranty also \"disclaims all statutory and implied warranties, including without limitations, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   n.7 (linking to \"Apple One (1) Year Limited Warranty\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

ECF No. 21. Instead of responding to Apple's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff amended his complaint on August 31, 2018. ECF No. 28. The Court denied Apple's motion to dismiss as moot on September 5, 2018. ECF No. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Apple filed the instant motion to dismiss on September 28, 2018. ECF No. 35.

These allegations of an alleged defect do not satisfy Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Punian\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's batteries had the \"potential to fail, leak, and/or damage Plaintiff's electronics.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201029607\">\n    2016 WL 1029607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.

Plaintiff argues that because he alleges that Apple's Watches \"all contain the same defect and/or flaw,\" this is sufficient to support the materiality of the defect. Opp. at 7 (citing AC at \u00b6 3). Plaintiff's argument misses the mark. The sufficiency of the identification of the alleged defect-not the materiality of the alleged defect-is at issue. Plaintiff's pleading cannot meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard simply by alleging that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Watches contain a material defect without identifying the defect. Under Ninth Circuit law, Plaintiff must specify what causes the Apple Watch screens to detach, crack, or shatter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

In the instant case, none of the alleged misrepresentations about the waterproof nature of the Watch, the brightness of its screen, the dual-core processor, and so on relate to the \"omitted\" information: that the Watch screen may detach, crack, or shatter because of the alleged defect.

However, Plaintiff's allegation does not show Apple's knowledge of the defect in the Series 1, 2, and 3 Watches because the First Generation Watches are distinct from and preceded the Series 1, 2, and 3 Watches.

Thus, Plaintiff's breach of express warranty claim fails because Plaintiff does not fall within the express warranty period.

Moreover, this express contract limits what types of legal theories under which a plaintiff may recover. AC at \u00b6 35 n.7 (\"EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS WARRANTY AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, APPLE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONDITION,\n   <em>\n    OR UNDER ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added) ).

Thus, because the Apple limited warranty expressly prohibits direct, special, incidental, or consequential damages under \"any other legal theory,\" such as unjust enrichment, Apple's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is GRANTED. Granting Plaintiff a second opportunity to amend the complaint would be futile because the limited warranty expressly prohibits advancing unjust enrichment as an alternate theory of recovery.
