(Compl., ECF No. 2.) His Amended Complaint serves as the operative pleading in this case. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 38.) Mr. Truman alleges the Orem City Defendants engaged in various misconduct, including some that resulted in his initial conviction on charges of domestic violence homicide and obstruction of justice in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the conviction, Mr. Truman hired new counsel who conducted additional investigation into the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 392-95, 401-409.) Mr. Truman's new counsel filed an amended motion for a new trial detailing instances of police and prosecutorial misconduct and\n   other alleged legal errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 396-97.) The court granted Mr. Truman's amended motion for a new trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 411.) At the second trial, the jury found Mr. Truman not guilty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 424.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As relevant to the Motion currently before the Court, attorney Ronald J. Yengich represented Mr. Truman up to and including that initial jury trial. (Mot. to Quash Subpoena, ECF No. 39.) Some of Mr. Truman's claims allege the Orem City Defendants withheld and or failed to disclose evidence in violation of the Due Process Clause and\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 401-409, 516-526, ECF No. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In defending this action, the Orem City Defendants subpoenaed documents from Mr. Yengich's file on the first criminal case. (Subpoena, ECF No. 44-1.) Third party Mr. Yengich moved to quash the subpoena based on the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. (Mot. to Quash Subpoena, ECF No. 39.) The Orem City Defendants opposed the Motion to Quash, arguing that in this case, Mr. Truman waived the attorney-client privilege and work product protection by asserting that the Orem City Defendants withheld evidence in violation of the Due Process Clause and\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . (Opp'n to Mot. to Quash 1-2, ECF No. 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 15, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the Motion to Quash. (ECF No. 46.) The Court denied in part, granted in part, and requested further briefing on the Motion. (Order Denying in Part &amp; Granting in Part Mot. to Quash (ECF No. 39), ECF No. 50.) The Court denied the Motion to Quash \"insofar as Mr. Yengich must produce the documents within the scope of the subpoena to [Mr. Truman's] current counsel\" and granted the Motion \"insofar as Mr. Yengich need not provide such documents directly to [the Orem City] Defendants' counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1.) The Court further ordered Mr. Truman to provide a privilege log to the Orem City Defendants by June 22, 2018, and instructed the parties to brief the issue of the scope of the waiver of the attorney-client privilege and work product protection after production of the privilege log. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Orem City Defendants filed their Memorandum on the scope of the waiver, (Orem Defs.' Mem. re Scope of Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege &amp; Attorney Work Product Protection (\"Mem.\"), ECF No. 53), which Mr. Truman opposed, (Mem. in Opp'n to Orem Defs.' Mem. re Scope of Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege &amp; Attorney Work Product Protection (\"Opp'n\"), ECF No. 60). The Orem City Defendants subsequently filed a Reply, (Orem City Defs.' Reply Mem. re Scope of Waiver of Attorney-Client Privilege &amp; Attorney Work Product Protection (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 61), and the Court heard further oral argument on the remaining part of the Motion, taking it under advisement, (ECF No. 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After considering the briefing, arguments of counsel, and applicable law, the Court finds Mr. Truman did not waive the attorney-client privilege and work product protection with respect to materials relevant to the withholding of information from Mr. Yengich and Mr. Truman. However, the privilege log needs supplementation. Therefore, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the remainder of the Motion to Quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Orem City Defendants contend Paragraphs 401 to 409 and 516 to 526 of the Amended Complaint make the allegations of withholding that waive the privilege and protection. (Mem. 12, ECF No. 52.) As explained below, the Court finds Mr. Truman's allegations make some privileged and/or protected materials relevant by asserting\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims in this case. However, \"by enacting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Congress concluded that private enforcement\n   of individual rights is in the public interest. This important public policy will not be advanced by presenting a party with the Hobson's choice of either dropping its claim or revealing all confidential communications related to a criminal defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Greater Newburyport Clamshell All. v.

Applying the relevant tests for waiver of the attorney-client privilege and disclosure of work product, the Court declines to find waiver or require disclosure and GRANTS the Motion to Quash as to the privileged and protected materials. The Court also declines to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of certain documents on the privilege log as the Orem City Defendants request because the Orem City Defendants made the request on the premise of waiver, which the Court has rejected. The Court DENIES the Motion to Quash to the extent that it ORDERS Mr. Truman to review the materials withheld for compliance with this Order, produce additional materials as appropriate, and supplement his privilege log to meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In October 2012, Mr. Truman's wife, Heidy Truman, died from a gunshot wound to the head, inflicted at their Orem, Utah home. (Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, ECF No. 38.) Only Mr. Truman and Mrs. Truman were home at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26.) After an investigation, in July 2013, the State of Utah charged Mr. Truman with a domestic violence homicide and obstruction of justice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 374.) As relevant to the Motion currently before the Court, Mr. Truman asserts in his Amended Complaint that during their investigation, his new counsel discovered facts that the Orem City Defendants withheld from Mr. Truman and Mr. Yengich prior to the first trial including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Evidence regarding the measurements of the house and hallway where Mrs. Truman was found and who made them;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 A 96-slide PowerPoint given to Dr. Leis, the medical examiner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Evidence of and the lack of testing of gunshot residue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 An attempt to claim or freeze insurance benefits by Janet Wagner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Mrs. Truman's relationship with her family and her mental state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 A forensic consultant team's conclusion that they could not ascertain how or where Mrs. Truman was shot or Mr. Truman's location at that time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Evidence related to Mr. Truman's call to Mrs. Truman prior to the 911 call;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Exculpatory statements from financial planner John Engh regarding the Trumans' financial situation, statements from first responders about the location of the black handled gun, and others Mr. Truman contends were withheld;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Police reports noting Mr. and Mrs. Truman's lack of financial trouble.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 401-04, 406-07, 516, 524.) Alleging that the Orem City Defendants suppressed evidence bearing on these issues, Mr. Truman asserts a claim against the Orem City Defendants for \"Withholding Exculpatory Evidence\" in violation of the Due Process Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 516-17, 524, 526.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Specifically, Mr. Truman alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) His new counsel discovered that the first responders incorrectly measured the Truman house and the location of Mrs. Truman's body. The Orem City Defendants allowed the medical examiner and others to rely on the erroneous information and then withheld evidence concerning the faulty measurements and a 96-slide PowerPoint given to the medical examiner\n   containing the faulty measurements, and attempted to cover-up the measurement errors, (Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 401, 403, 524(a), (g) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) Mr. Truman's new counsel discovered that gunshot residue samples taken from Mr. and Mrs. Truman's hands the night of the shooting were not sent for testing before the first trial and that the Orem City Defendants failed to disclose to Mr. Yengich that they had not sent the samples for analysis and lost or destroyed other gunshot residue samples, (Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 406, 524(b), (j) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (3) New counsel also discovered that the Orem City Defendants knew and failed to disclose that Mrs. Truman's mother, Janet Wagner, attempted to claim and/or freeze Mrs. Truman's life insurance, (Am.

Compl., \u00b6 524(d) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (5) At the second trial, the Orem City Defendants disclosed that they had hired a forensic consulting team to review the case prior to the first trial, and the team determined they could not draw any conclusions about Mr. or Mrs. Truman's locations but did find the blood spatter on Mr. Truman's shirt consistent with giving CPR, (Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 329-331, 341-42, 524(e) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (6) New counsel discovered that the Orem City Defendants withheld telephone records showing Mr. Truman's call to Mrs. Truman before the gunshot was not a completed call, that the call went to voicemail, and that Mrs. Truman accessed her voicemail three minutes before Mr. Truman called 911, (Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 407, 524(f) );\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (7) New counsel discovered that the Trumans' financial planner, John Engh, told the police that Mr. Truman did not have a financial motive to kill Mrs. Truman and that officers and first responders identified the location of the black handled gun, but the Police failed to disclose this evidence, (Am.

(Mem. 1, ECF No. 53; Opp'n 2, ECF No 60.) However, the Orem City Defendants argue that the \"at-issue\" waiver test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Seneca Insurance Company, Inc. v.

Whether the attorney said we will argue X or we will not argue X matters not to a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. Rather all that matters is that the attorney knew about X. Thus Mr. Truman has not waived his attorney-client privilege as to legal advice or legal strategy on any of these topics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Further, as noted above, to the extent Mr. Truman's counsel obtained knowledge of facts from anyone other than Mr. Truman, the attorney-client privilege does not protect those facts from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus the only potential attorney-client privileged information at issue are those facts shared by Mr. Truman with his counsel in confidence.

The Orem City Defendants contend that all of this information is vital to their defense. (Mem. 6-9, ECF No. 53.) Mr. Truman argues that other sources can provide the information sought from Mr. Yengich since the Orem City Defendants know what disclosures they made (or did not make) to Mr. Truman and his counsel. (Opp'n 3-4, ECF No. 60.) The Orem City Defendants contend that because Mr. Truman's attorney's knowledge of allegedly withheld facts presents a defense to the \u00a7 1983 claims, that knowledge is vital to their defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The privileged information that the Orem City Defendants seek is not vital to their defense. As addressed above, if Mr. Yengich knew about the information and evidence that Mr. Truman claims his new counsel only discovered after his first trial, then the Orem City Defendants can defeat the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims. For example, if Mr. Yengich knew Dr. Leis had relied on incorrect dimensions of the Truman home and the location of Mrs. Truman's body, the Orem City Defendants can use such evidence to defeat Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims on this point. Similarly, if Mr. Yengich knew Mr. Engh had stated that Mr. Truman had no financial motivation to kill Mrs. Truman or that Mrs. Truman's family really did not have a lot of contact with Mrs. Truman, the Orem City Defendants can likewise use such evidence to defeat Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim on those issues, as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quintanilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11566277\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1139/#p1149\">\n    193 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1149 ;\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201840343\">\n    2013 WL 1840343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Additionally, if Mr. Yengich had the phone records showing Mr. Truman's phone call to Mrs. Truman before her shooting went to voicemail\n   or knew that the Orem City Defendants had not completed the gun residue testing, the Orem City Defendants can use that evidence to help defeat Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims on these points too. However, all of that evidence reflects facts not protected by the attorney-client privilege\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   told to Mr. Yengich by Mr. Truman in confidence. At this point, the Orem City Defendants have every right to depose Mr. Truman under oath about what he knew about these facts and when without inquiring into whether he told Mr. Yengich. If Mr. Truman knew of these facts, the Orem City Defendants have their defense, and Mr. Yengich's knowledge becomes irrelevant to their defense. If Mr. Yengich knew these facts, but Mr. Truman did not or learned of them from his attorney, they are not protected by the attorney-client privilege. \"Facts are discoverable, the legal conclusions regarding those facts are not.

As a result, whether the Court applies the\n   <em>\n    Hearn\n   </em>\n   test or the advice of counsel test, Mr. Truman has not waived his attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. WAIVER OF WORK PRODUCT PROTECTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Nonetheless, Mr. Truman claims work product protection-not attorney-client privilege-for the majority of documents sought by the Orem City Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Highlighted Priv. Log, ECF No. 53-2.) The Orem City Defendants argue that Mr. Truman waived work product protection with respect to facts and opinions bearing on his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims. (Mem. 11-15, ECF No. 53.) While arguing that Mr. Truman waived opinion work product protection as to all\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims (Reply 4, ECF No. 61), the Orem City Defendants focus their opinion work product waiver argument on Mr. Truman's allegations concerning his inconsistent statements and threatening behavior the night of the shooting and his allegation that the Orem City Defendants withheld information concerning Mrs. Truman's mental state and relationship with her family, arguing that these allegations place Mr. Yengich's opinions and impressions on these topics squarely at issue. (Mem. 13-15, ECF No. 53.) They claim with these allegations Mr. Truman implies that Mr. Yengich misunderstood important opinions and mental impressions thereby placing Mr. Yengich's opinions and mental impressions on those topics at issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Truman does not address waiver of fact work product separately but argues that no waiver of opinion work product occurred. (Opp'n 5-6, ECF No. 60.) The Court DENIES the Orem City Defendants' Motion because they failed to meet their burden as to the work product materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Regarding Mr. Truman's alleged inconsistent statements and threatening behavior the night of the shooting, these allegations raise questions of fabrication, not withholding, of evidence. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 408, 409, 521, ECF No. 38.) As set forth above, fabrication claims do not implicate Mr. Truman or Mr. Yengich's knowledge the way\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims do. Therefore, these fabrication claims do not support a claim for an exception to the work product protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Without a showing that substantially equivalent evidence is not available elsewhere, the Court cannot find a basis for disclosure under Federal Rule 26(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   For example, if Mr. Yengich spoke to Mr. Engh in preparation for trial, and Mr. Engh repeated his statements about the Trumans' financial condition to Mr. Yengich, the Orem City Defendants could use that work product as a defense to any claim for the withholding of Mr. Engh's statements to the police. However, presumably the Orem City Defendants could contact Mr. Engh and ask him if he talked with Mr. Truman or Mr. Truman's legal team about the Trumans' financial condition in connection with the first criminal case.

However, where the Orem City Defendants have not shown that substantially equivalent evidence is unavailable elsewhere, the Court declines to order production of Mr. Yengich's work product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Opinion Work Product\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Orem City Defendants also specifically request opinion work product. (Mem. 12-15, ECF No. 53.) Within the umbrella of work product protection, opinion work product-which reflects the mental impressions, conclusions, and legal theories of an attorney-generally receives greater protection than fact work product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qwest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089688\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1179/#p1184\">\n    450 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Work product can be opinion work product, which some courts have held to be absolutely privileged, or non-opinion work product, i.e., fact work product, which may be discoverable under appropriate circumstances.\");\n   <em>\n    Anaya v.

This type of work product receives less protection than opinion work product. Opinion work product is, basically, the mental impressions of the attorney.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Texaco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024384\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/208/329/#p334\">\n    208 F.R.D. 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (N.D. Okla. 2002) ). Federal Rule 26(b)(3) provides that a court \"must protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party's attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Orem City Defendants have failed to show a substantial need for the opinion work product reflecting Mr. Yengich's mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, and legal theories. For example, Mr. Yengich's mental impressions and opinions concerning Mr. Engh are not relevant to\n   Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims. What is relevant is what Mr. Yengich and Mr. Truman knew about Mr. Engh, and in particular, whether they knew Mr. Engh believed Mr. Truman lacked a financial motive to kill his wife. In addition, whether Mr. Yengich knew that the Orem City Defendants did not test the gunshot residue presents an objective inquiry-either he knew they did so or he did not know-and making that determination does not require inquiry into his mental impressions and opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Further, Mrs. Truman's family relationships and mental state do not directly implicate any of Mr. Yengich's legal opinions and conclusions. Mr. Yengich is an attorney, not a psychiatrist or doctor qualified to opine on the reasons that may have motivated Mr. Truman's behavior the night of the shooting. Likewise, Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims do not implicate Mr. Yengich's opinions as to Mrs. Truman's family relationship and mental state. Only Mr. Yengich's knowledge of such information is even relevant to Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims. Specifically, if Mr. Yengich knew about these facts and did not raise them at trial, the knowledge of the facts proves the Orem City Defendants' defense to the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. Whether Mr. Yengich made a strategic choice not to put on those facts or simply misinterpreted those facts does not add or detract from the Orem City Defendants' defense. Simply put, what Mr. Yengich objectively knew about the facts and evidence relating to Mr. Truman's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims has relevance to the Orem City Defendants' defense of those\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims, not his subjective opinions, mental impressions, and legal strategy. Accordingly, the Court finds no basis to compel production of Mr. Yengich's opinion work product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    V. PRIVILEGE LOG\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Orem City Defendants noted that Mr. Truman provided a deficient privilege log, particularly objecting to the lack of identification of subject matter. (Mem. 1, 3, ECF No. 53.) As noted above, Mr. Truman bears the burden of establishing the applicability of either the attorney-client privilege or work product protection.\n   <em>\n    Peat, Marwick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638622\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/540/#p542\">\n    748 F.2d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Truman's privilege log is confusing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Priv. Log, ECF No. 53-1.) In some cases, whether Mr. Truman claims simply the attorney-client privilege or also the work product protection over a document remains ambiguous. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638622\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/540/#p542\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at doc. # s YENGICH003545, 3561, 3565, 3576, and 4362\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Highlighted Priv. Log at same doc. # s, ECF No. 53-2.) Further, in some instances the file name would appear to supply sufficient indication of the subject matter to allow review, for example where the file name is \"Presentence Report\" and it contains two documents listed as \"Correspondence with client\" and \"Handwritten note.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Priv. Log at doc. # s YENGICH003597, 3607, ECF No. 53-1.) But in other instances, the file name does not provide sufficient guidance as to subject matter to allow the Orem City Defendants or the Court to see the basis for assertion of privilege, such as where the file name is \"Miscellaneous\" and the document title is \"Draft letter to Truman family with handwritten notes/revisions\" or \"Handwritten attorney notes\". (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638622\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/540/#p542\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at doc. # s YENGICH004360, 4380, 4389, 4390, 4392.) Additionally, in the current procedural posture (the underlying case being final) some descriptions need to include more information. For example, when a description states the document relates to \"witnesses,\" the description should include the specific witnesses' names, and when it relates to an expert, it should include the expert's identity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , YENGICH002737, 2738, 4187, 4189, 4194, 4356, 4643.) The Court also notes that many of the documents lack a specific author's name, such\n   as the above \"Handwritten note\" or \"Handwritten attorney note\". (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638622\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/540/#p542\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at doc. # s YENGICH004360, 4380, 4389, 4390, 4392.) Without identification of the author, the privilege log falls short of the requirements of Federal Rule 26(b)(5)(A). In addition, where the log identifies a non-privileged or protected document with handwriting or highlighting on it, the log entry should specify the document and identify where else in the production or in public the Orem City Defendants can locate that document, i.e. by document number for produced documents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"638622\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/748/540/#p542\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at doc. # s YENGICH002742, 2776, 3039.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   With the tests this Court intends to apply outlined and the issues focused, counsel for Mr. Truman must now to supplement the privilege log to include the information necessary to allow the Orem City Defendants to look at the log and understand the basis for the privilege or protection assertion for each document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Based on the above analysis, the Court enters the following Order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   1. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the remaining portion of the Motion to Quash (ECF No. 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   2. The Court DENIES the portion of the Motion to Quash that applies to non-privileged or protected documents. Mr. Truman's counsel must review withheld documents to determine whether they contain non-privileged or non-protected material as outlined in this Order. If they do contain such material, Mr. Truman's counsel must produce all portions of documents containing such material and may redact portions of documents that remain protected. The privilege log should include all such redacted documents, with the bases for redaction discussed above. Mr. Truman's counsel must complete these actions by March 22, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   3. The Court DENIES the portion of the Motion to Quash that seeks to avoid production of a privilege log. Mr. Truman's counsel must produce to the Orem City Defendants a supplemental privilege log that includes sufficient detail to allow the Orem City Defendants to perceive clearly the basis for the privilege or protection claims by March 22, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   4. The Court GRANTS the remainder of the Motion to Quash.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
