Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants CDK Global, LLC (\"CDK\") and Reynolds and Reynolds Company (\"Reynolds\") provide Dealer Management System (\"DMS\") software and services to automobile dealerships throughout the United States, including in Illinois. [198 (Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.] In addition to providing DMS services, CDK and Reynolds also provide data integration services (\"DIS\") indirectly to dealerships throughout the United States, including in Illinois. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs are automobile dealerships across the country who are purchasing and/or who have purchased DMS services from CDK or Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-50.] Plaintiffs purport to bring this class action against Defendants CDK and Reynolds for alleged violations of the Sherman Act and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.] Plaintiffs allege that Defendants unlawfully colluded and conspired to restrain and/or eliminate competition by charging supracompetitive prices in the markets for: (1) DMS software services; and (2) DIS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The DMS Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The DMS, sometimes described as the \"central nervous system\" for dealerships, is an enterprise software system designed specifically for automobile dealerships. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.] The DMS functions as the dealerships' central database and repository of all its operational information, including information regarding sales, financing, inventory management (both vehicles and parts), repair and service, accounting, payroll, human resources, marketing, and car manufacturer certifications. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 61.] The physical storage of the data is either onsite at the dealerships, at private data centers operated by the DMS provider, or with cloud-based data storage companies. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61.] The DMS includes a database and data storage component that allows dealerships to enter and store data in real time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Switching DMS providers is difficult, expensive, and disruptive to a dealership's business. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.] Changing DMS providers requires entirely new hardware and software. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] It can cost as much as $ 50,000 up front to change DMS providers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] It typically takes dealerships a year or more to prepare for changing DMS providers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In November 2016, CDK's CEO acknowledged that \"switching DMS providers can be very difficult. It [is] quite a process [to] change and takes time, which is part of the reason that many dealers are hesitant to switch.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.] Switching DMS providers is not only a costly and lengthy procedure, it is also extremely risky. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67.] Dealers store vital data on their DMSs, and access to their data is crucial to the daily operation of their business. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] DMS providers control access to dealers' DMSs and can restrict or deny access to the DMSs, severely\n   crippling the dealers' businesses as retribution for changing DMS providers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CDK and Reynolds are in the business of providing DMS software and services to dealerships like Plaintiffs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.] Together they control approximately 75 percent of the United States DMS market measured by the number of franchised automobile dealerships using their systems, with CDK controlling approximately 45 percent of the DMS market and Reynolds controlling approximately 30 percent of the DMS market. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The remaining 25 percent is divided among other smaller DMS providers that typically service smaller dealerships in niche submarkets. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2 n.1.] CDK and Reynolds have even higher market shares when measured by revenue, with CDK having approximately $ 2.2 billion in total annual revenue and Reynolds having approximately $ 1.7 billion in total annual revenue. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both CDK and Reynolds have previously indicated that dealers own the data on their DMSs. For example, Steve Annen (CDK's former CEO) stated, \"I don't know how you can ever make the opinion that the data is yours to govern and to preclude others from having access to it, when in fact it's really the data belonging to the dealer. As long as they grant permission, how would you ever go against that wish?\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74.] Howard Gardner (CDK's Vice President of Data Strategy) has stated that CDK \"has always understood that dealerships own their data and enjoy having choices on how best to share and utilize that data with others.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Matt Parsons (CDK's Vice President of Sales and Marketing) has stated, \"We're not going to limit the ability of a dealer to give an ID to someone else to, in essence, dial into their system. That is the dealer's right. We have no right to tell them they can't do that.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Similarly, Reynolds spokesman Tom Schwartz stated that \"[t]he data belongs to the dealers. We all agree on that.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The DIS Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CDK and Reynolds also provide DIS separate from their DMS offerings. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.] CDK's data integration service is known as Third Party Access (\"3PA\"), and Reynolds's data integration service is known as Reynolds Certified Interface (\"RCI\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. \u00b6 71.] Although 3PA and RCI only provide DIS for Defendants' respective DMSs, CDK also owns two independent data integrators-Digital Motorworks (\"DMI\") and IntegraLink-that provide DIS with respect to data stored on others' DMSs (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Reynolds) as well. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.] DIS are critical to the proper functioning of dealerships. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. \u00b6 5.] DIS enable dealers and third-party software application providers (also known as vendors) to extract, organize, and integrate the dealers' data on their DMSs into a usable format. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To effectively run their dealerships, dealers engage vendors to provide necessary services such as inventory management, customer relationship management, warranty services, repair orders, and electronic vehicle registration and titling. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] For example, a dealer might engage a vendor to electronically register new automobiles upon sale. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73.] In providing services to dealers, vendors need to access and utilize DMS data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] A single dealership typically uses multiple vendors, with each vendor requiring access to the dealership's data stored on its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Vendors generally engage DIS providers that charge vendors for their services. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.] Although vendors have the dealers' authorization to access and utilize the data on their DMSs, vendors generally cannot obtain access to the data in a usable format directly from dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.] To access and utilize dealer data, vendors engage\n   data integrators to extract, format, and organize the data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The data integrators access the data stored on the DMS and convert it into a form suitable for the specific service provided by the vendor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Historically, the DIS market was active, with numerous DIS providers competing to provide affordable, secure, and reliable access to DMS data for dealerships and vendors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.] In 2006, Reynolds began selectively and sporadically blocking data integrators from accessing dealer data on the Reynolds DMS by disabling data integrators' dealer-created login credentials. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.] CDK differentiated itself and the CDK DMS from Reynolds by publicly touting the openness of its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] CDK repeatedly vowed (including in public statements by its CEO and top marketing officers) that it would not block independent data integrators from accessing dealer data on its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] CDK marketed its \"open\" system directly to dealers and issued press releases stressing that it \"believes in the fair competitive environment and does not use its leverage through supply of the dealer management system to reduce competition through the restriction of data access.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.] CDK was successful in marketing its \"open\" DMS to dealers as a competitive advantage over the Reynolds DMS, and dealers purchased DMS services from CDK based in large part on CDK's public representations about the openness of its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As a result, CDK gained market share from Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In 2013, Reynolds began vigorously blocking data integrators. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79.] CDK, however, continued to allow open access to its DMSs and to compete with Reynolds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite CDK's success in wresting market share away from Reynolds, its biggest competitor in the DMS market, competition between Reynolds and CDK suddenly ceased in 2015. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80.] Plaintiff alleges that this was the result of horizontal agreements between CDK and Reynolds to restrain competition in the DMS and DIS markets. Specifically, CDK and Reynolds agreed to cooperate in closing their respective DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81.] In February 2015, CDK and Reynolds entered into three written agreements: (1) the Data Exchange Agreement or \"Wind Down\" Agreement; (2) the 3PA Agreement; and (3) the RCI Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Data Exchange Agreement provides that CDK is to wind down its data integration business on Reynolds's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.] In other words, CDK would stop providing services to dealers relating to the third-party integration of data stored on Reynolds's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] At the same time, Reynolds agreed not to block CDK's access to Reynolds's DMS during the wind-down period, which lasts until 2020. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] During that wind-down period, Defendants agreed that CDK could continue to extract dealer data from Reynolds's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84.] At the same time, under \u00a7 4.2 of the Data Exchange Agreement, CDK was to notify its vendor clients of its intent to wind down its data integration related to Reynolds's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Under \u00a7 4.4 of the Data Exchange Agreement, CDK was to assist and cooperate with Reynolds's efforts to communicate with CDK's vendor clients and transition them to RCI. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In connection with that effort, CDK agreed to provide Reynolds with full information about the vendors CDK served, including their names, DMS numbers, store numbers, branch numbers, user logins, specific data access provided by CDK, data interfaces, the frequency of the data provided, the deadlines for data delivery, and the format of the data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.] The Data Exchange Agreement also includes a \"Prohibition on Knowledge Transfer and DMS Access\" provision, whereby CDK and Reynolds each agreed not to provide DIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   with respect to data on the other's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The two other written agreements made by Defendants in February 2015 were (1) the 3PA Agreement; and (2) the RCI Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87.] These two agreements, collectively referred to as the \"Data Integration Agreements,\" provided CDK and Reynolds reciprocal access to each other's DIS programs-the 3PA and RCI programs, respectively. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In the agreements, Reynolds received five free years of 3PA access. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88.] Reynolds also agreed to access CDK's DMS exclusively through 3PA, and further agreed that it would not \"otherwise access, retrieve, license, or otherwise transfer any data from or to a CDK system (including, without limitation, pursuant to any 'hostile interface') for itself or any other entity\" or contract with any third parties to access the system. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Data Integration Agreements also provided that CDK and Reynolds would deny data integrators access to each other's DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants agreed to force vendors to use Defendants (or their affiliates) to access their respective DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 171.] As evidence of this agreement, the complaint references an April 2016 conversation between Dan McCray (CDK's Vice President of Product Management) and Stephen Cottrell (CEO of Authenticom, a competing data integrator), in which Mr. McCray stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [W]e've entered into an agreement with Reynolds and Reynolds, okay? That agreement specifically says that we're going to support each other's third party interfaces, and we're working collaboratively to remove all hostile integrators from our DMS system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.] Similarly, in March 2015, Robert Schaefer (Reynolds's Vice President of OEM Relations, Data Services, and Security) told Mr. Cottrell: \"We've made agreements with the other major DMS providers to support each other's third-party access agreements and to block independent integrators such as Authenticom.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants have claimed that their agreements with each other serve an important business justification: the need to protect their systems and the data on those systems from cybersecurity threats. However, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' security justification is pretextual. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 153-64.] Plaintiffs allege that \"Automotive News reported that '[a] vendor executive who asked not to be named called the data-access cost a surcharge under the guise of data security.' \" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 155.] Along the same lines, a CDK employee has made statements indicating that the security justification really was a \"message\" used by Defendants to justify increased fees, stating \"[i]f we are going with security as our message, I feel we MUST incorporate language into our contract * * * I feel a discussion around what these additional security items will be is warranted-once we have agreement on these security items it will help us update the managed data services agreement and further refine our message to the market.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 156.] Plaintiffs have identified similar statements indicating that the claimed security justification was pretextual. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 157-64.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that CDK and Reynolds have been able to impose massive price increases on vendors as a result of their agreements. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 134.] These increased fees are passed on to dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Vendors have acknowledged that they pass increased data integration fees on to dealers. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135.] For example, a vendor informed a dealer that it was raising the fees it charged the dealer by $ 500 a month as a result of CDK's higher integration fees. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141.] Plaintiffs also allege that the agreements between\n   CDK and Reynolds have decreased the functionality of their DMSs. The dealers' ability to freely access their own data on their DMSs through third-parties was an important feature of their DMSs and their functionality. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 148.] Through their unlawful conduct, however, Defendants eliminated this feature, thereby restraining competition and increasing prices paid by the dealers for their DMSs. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 149.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Alleged Exclusive Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that CDK began canceling and renegotiating its 3PA vendor contracts to impose exclusive dealing provisions on vendors shortly after entering the Data Exchange Agreement. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111.] These new 3PA contracts (also referred to as the \"Managed Interface Agreements\") required vendors to use 3PA if they wished to integrate CDK DMS data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] To ensure that vendors signed on to the new contracts, CDK sent an initial letter to dealers warning that access to its DMS by third-party integrators would cease. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112.] Subsequently, in September 2015, CDK sent dealers a letter indicating that it \"intend[ed] to remove the majority of unauthorized third party [sic] access methods by Dec 31, 2016.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112.] CDK employees were instructed that if any vendor failed to migrate to 3PA by December 31, 2016, the vendor's access to CDK's DMS would be disabled. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs allege that vendors agreed to the Managed Interface Agreements under threat of losing access to necessary data. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Managed Interface Agreements contained provisions explicitly prohibiting vendors from obtaining dealer data from anyone other than CDK. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114.] The contracts were entered on a vendor-by-vendor basis, not an application-by-application basis, so if a vendor wanted to use CDK's integration services for one application, the vendor also had to use CDK's product for all of its other applications. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The contracts states: \"Vendor agrees that it will, beginning on the date CDK certifies the use of the first Application with the CDK Interface System, access data on, and provide data to, CDK Systems exclusively through the Managed Interface System [a.k.a. 3PA] * * * [and] will not (i) * * * transfer any data from or to a CDK System * * * or (ii) contract with * * * any third party * * * to * * * transfer any data from or to a CDK System.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Managed Interface Agreement also includes what Plaintiffs characterize as a price-fixing agreement, which provides that a vendor \"shall never indicate in any way to any CDK Vendor Client that any increase in any price charged by [v]endor to any CDK Vendor Client is in reaction to, or in any other way associated with, any modification in the price charged by CDK hereunder with respect to [v]endor's use of the CDK Interface System.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.] The contract also states that the vendor \"shall not include any 'interface' fee, DMS access fee or any other similar fee related to the use of the CDK Interface System in any of its invoices to its customers [dealers] or otherwise include any direct or indirect indication to its customers (in its invoices or otherwise) of the fees charged by CDK hereunder.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In a March 3, 2016 internal email, one CDK employee stated, \"CDK's position is that the vendor should include the integration in the price of their product as a cost of doing business and not something they line item with the dealer. Line iteming of integration fees along with claims of high DMS fees by vendors (most of them exaggerated) only leads to questions from our dealers about what CDK actually charges for integration.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Reynolds Arbitration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Six named Plaintiffs (collectively the \"Reynolds Dealers\") signed agreements\n   that oblige them to resolve certain claims against Reynolds in Dayton, Ohio. Relevant to this order is a binding arbitration provision included in every Reynolds Dealers' contract. The provision states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Any disputes between us related directly or indirectly to an Order\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   will be settled by binding arbitration * * * under the American Arbitration Association Rules * * * It does not matter whether the controversy is based on contract, tort, strict liability, or other legal theory. * * * The arbitration will be held in Dayton, Ohio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [255-9, at 12.] Both CDK and Reynolds moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims in favor of arbitration pursuant to this arbitration agreement or, in the alternative, dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim. Defendant Reynolds subsequently withdrew its motion.

To begin, CDK did not assert its intent to arbitrate at the \"earliest feasible\" time. CDK argues that it moved to compel arbitration at the earliest possible opportunity-when it filed its opening motion to dismiss. However, CDK earlier could have asserted its intent to arbitrate, just as Reynolds has done throughout this lawsuit. The first dealership class action,\n   <em>\n    Teterboro Automall, Inc. v. CDK Global, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:17-cv-08714 (D.N.J.), was filed on October 19, 2017. Although Reynolds asserted its intent to arbitrate when it and CDK moved for transfer and consolidation of the cases against them, CDK did not make any similar reservation. \"[W]hen a party chooses to proceed in a judicial forum, there is a rebuttable presumption that the party has waived its right to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Kawasaki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844145\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/988/#p994\">\n    660 F.3d at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Along the same lines, CDK participated in discovery without making clear that its participation in discovery was not a waiver of its now-claimed right to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Kawasaki Heavy Indus., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844145\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/988/#p994\">\n    660 F.3d at 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no waiver where the defendant \"mentioned its desire to arbitrate at every turn\"). While it may not be necessary for a defendant expressly to reserve its right to arbitrate whenever it participates in discovery, in light of CDK's failure to assert its intent to arbitrate until July 2018, CDK acted inconsistent with the intent to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, although a showing of prejudice is not required in order to find waiver, it is relevant.\n   <em>\n    Kawasaki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3844145\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/988/#p994\">\n    660 F.3d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, CDK argues that the Reynolds dealers would not be prejudiced as a result of CDK's delay in asserting its intent to arbitrate, but it is difficult to see how litigating a complex class action and participating in extensive discovery in court only to have litigation come to a halt would not be prejudicial to Plaintiffs. CDK argues that the Reynolds Dealers were not prejudiced because discovery from the dealers is relevant to many claims and issues raised in other MDL cases. [378, at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Dickinson v. Heinold Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181943\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/661/638/#p641\">\n    661 F.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (7th Cir. 1981) ).] However, CDK-not the Plaintiffs-are parties to the other MDL cases. Thus, although it may have been necessary for CDK to participate in discovery regardless of whether it arbitrated its claims against the Reynolds Dealers, the Reynolds Dealers would not have had to participate in discovery (at least as a party). Given CDK's substantial delay in invoking its intent to arbitrate, forcing the Reynolds Dealers to arbitrate now would be highly prejudicial. Accordingly, even if CDK could invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel to force the Reynolds dealers to arbitrate their claims, CDK waived its right to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As the Seventh Circuit recently summarized,\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   \"forbids a customer of the purchaser who paid a cartel price to sue the cartelist, even if his seller-the direct purchaser from the cartelist-passed on to him some or even all of the cartel's elevated price.\"\n   <em>\n    Motorola Mobility LLC v.

Plaintiffs argue, however, that Defendant erroneously conflates their status as indirect purchasers in the DIS market with their status as direct purchasers in the DMS market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' horizontal conspiracy claim (Count I) is-at least to some extent-based on alleged anticompetitive conduct in the DMS market, as Plaintiffs allege that its DMS lost functionality and is worth less as a result of CDK's agreements with Reynolds. Defendant argues that this alleged diminution in value and functionality is just the flip side of the purported inability to access data integration in the DIS market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiffs allege misconduct in the DMS market resulting in harm in the DMS market. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that CDK and Reynolds, competitors in the DMS market, agreed not to compete with each other in certain respects (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , permitting third-party DMS access) resulting in DMSs with less value and inferior functionality. Plaintiffs therefore allege anticompetitive conduct in the DMS market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiffs seek to recover alleged supracompetitive prices passed through vendors, however, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick.\n   </em>\n   Although Plaintiffs argue that their exclusive dealing claim based on vendor contracts relates to alleged anticompetitive conduct in the DMS market, Plaintiffs exclusive dealing claim is based on their status as indirect purchasers in the DIS market. Indeed, in arguing that it sufficiently has alleged substantial foreclosure, as necessary to state a claim for exclusive dealing under federal law, Plaintiffs argue that they sufficiently have alleged substantial foreclosure in the DIS market. Similarly, Plaintiffs' Section 2 claims are based on alleged monopolistic conduct by Defendant in the DIS market-not the DMS market. As noted by the Seventh Circuit, in relation to the DMS market, \"neither Reynolds nor CDK is a monopolist.\"\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v.

Thus, Plaintiffs' exclusive dealing claim based on vendor contracts and Plaintiffs' Section 2 monopoly claim are barred by\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick.\n   </em>\n   The Court grants Defendant's motion to dismiss Count II and Count V. Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to bring a horizontal conspiracy claim based on agreements to restrain competition in the DIS market, Plaintiffs' horizontal conspiracy claim fails under\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   and Plaintiffs may not proceed under that theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that vendors have passed on overcharges directly to dealers. Thus, unlike\n   <em>\n    DFA I\n   </em>\n   , the causal link between the alleged anticompetitive conduct and the antitrust injury is not attenuated.

With respect to the DMS market, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant and Reynolds are \"horizontal competitors\" that both possess \"dominant positions\" in the DMS market. [198, at \u00b6\u00b6 170, 177.] Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant and Reynolds agreed to restrain competition in that market by agreeing to \"reduce the functionality of CDK's DMS (including dealerships' ability to freely access their DMS data through authorized persons).\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 171; see also \u00b6\u00b6 148-49 (Dealerships' ability to access their data on DMS through third parties \"was an important feature of the DMS and its functionality,\" and Defendants unlawfully \"eliminated this feature of the DMS and its functionality.\").] With respect to the DIS market, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants agreed that CDK would stop hostilely accessing Reynolds's DMS. Defendants also agreed that they would not assist in the hostile access of one another's DMSs. Still, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' allegations of a horizontal conspiracy are insufficient to state a claim for a number of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are wrong about what the challenged agreements provide. Focusing on the language of the written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds, Defendant argues that the \"agreements merely wind-down CDK's hostile access to Reynolds's DMS.\" [266, at 33.] According to Defendant, \"[t]hey do not divide any market, restrain any competition, or say anything about CDK's or Reynolds's third-party access policies (which either company could change tomorrow).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523415\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/772/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266541\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1019/#p1025\">\n    874 F.3d at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"nothing in the 2015 agreements forbade CDK itself from allowing access to its own data integration system\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To be sure, the 2015 written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds do not expressly require that Defendant and Reynolds block third-party access on their own DMSs. Yet, as noted by Judge St. Eve in the\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   case, the agreements do \"effectively require that CDK stop hostile access of Reynolds DMSs (for a period, at least) and, more importantly, expressly prohibit [Defendant and Reynolds] from assisting in the hostile access of one another's DMSs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt.

Ill. 2018). The anticompetitive effects of this \"partial ceasefire\" and \"mutual forbearance between two rivals\" were not limited to the DIS market. The alleged horizontal agreement is between two competitors in the DMS market. CDK and Reynolds-\"horizontal competitors\" and possessors of \"dominant positions\" in the DMS market-agreed to restrain competition in that market by agreeing to \"reduce the functionality of CDK's DMS (including dealerships' ability to freely access their DMS data through authorized persons).\" [198 (Compl.), \u00b6\u00b6 170-71.] Evidence of \"retardation of innovation and subsequent decrease in the quality of [products] potentially available to consumers, if believed, could qualify as a harm to competition and consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Aventis Envtl.

Plaintiffs allege such a decrease in the quality of the products they purchased from Defendant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Furthermore, the alleged agreements between Defendant and Reynolds are not necessarily limited to the 2015 written agreements. Plaintiffs claim that Defendant's executives admitted to an agreement between Defendant and Reynolds to block third-party access of their respective DMSs. For example, in April 2016, CDK's Vice President of Product Management, Dan McCray, told Authenticom's CEO Stephen Cottrell:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [W]e've entered into an agreement with Reynolds and Reynolds, okay? That agreement specifically says that we're going to support each other's third party interfaces, and we're working collaboratively to remove all hostile integrators from our DMS system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [198 (Compl.), at \u00b6 101.] CDK's argument that Plaintiffs only have alleged an agreement to wind-down CDK's hostile access to Reynolds's DMS therefore fails, as it ignores Plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations of a horizontal agreement beyond the written agreements between Defendant and Reynolds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Authenticom\n   </em>\n   matter, Defendant argued that the court should disregard these allegations because the best evidence of CDK's and Reynolds's agreement is their written contracts. Judge St. Eve found that argument unpersuasive, concluding that the argument \"backfire[d]\" because it \"suggests that [CDK and Reynolds] (or at least their executives) thought that the 2015 Agreements aimed to 'block' third-party integrators.\" [176, at 29.] CDK argues that conclusion was erroneous because using allegations of oral statements to inform the meaning of a written contract would upend the established contractual cannon that oral evidence may not supplement a fully integrated, written agreement. [266, at 37 n.13 (citing 11 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 33:1 (4th ed. 2018) ).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, to the extent the statements made by Defendant's and Reynolds's executives refer to the 2015 written agreements, the Court agrees that they indicate that the\n   <em>\n    aim\n   </em>\n   of those agreements was to block third-party integrators. The Court would not expect that CDK and Reynolds would identify that intent in the text of the contract, but that does not mean the parties' statements regarding their intent is being used to interpret the parties' obligations under the contract. Indeed, although the Seventh Circuit recognized that the 2015 written agreements \"do not explicitly state that defendants will work together to eliminate third-party data integrators, the agreements have that effect\n   * * * After the agreements, there is little room in the market for third-party integrators.\"\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v.

Wis. 2017). Regardless, as Judge St. Eve also noted, in order to accept Defendant's argument, the Court would have to infer that Defendant's and Reynolds's executives were referring to the written agreements-as opposed to an extracontractual agreement-requiring that the Court make an inference in Defendant's favor, which the Court cannot do at the motion to dismiss stage. Furthermore, to the extent that the statements made by CDK's and Reynolds's executives are not reflected in the agreement, it reasonable can be inferred that there was an extracontractual agreement between CDK and Reynolds. Again, the Court would not expect CDK and Reynolds to memorialize all aspects of the alleged anticompetitive agreement in their written agreements. The Court must make this reasonable inference at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' Section 1 horizontal conspiracy claim fails because Plaintiffs merely have alleged parallel conduct. \"Tacit collusion, also known as conscious parallelism, does not violate section 1 of the Sherman Act.

Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged substantial foreclosure because (1) there are no allegations that Defendant's vendor contracts foreclosed Plaintiffs from a substantial share of any market, and (2) any argument that hostile integrators are excluded by the contracts \"would fail because hostile integrators are still able to deal with DMS providers covering a sizeable portion of the market for car dealership DMS services.\" [266, at 38-39.] In its response brief, Plaintiffs appear to concede the former argument, focusing on allegations that the foreclosure caused by the agreements raised prices for data integration services, which Plaintiffs allege were passed onto Plaintiffs. [198 (Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 149-155, 157, 161.] Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack antitrust standing to challenge the foreclosure of independent integrators such as Authenticom.

[198 (Compl.), at \u00b6 2.] With the two dominant DMS providers agreeing to block independent data integrators, CDK and Reynolds have been able to charge supracompetitive prices for data integration services. [198 (Compl.), at \u00b6\u00b6 144, 185.] Vendors are forced to pay supracompetitive prices for data integration services because they need to be able to service dealers who have CDK or Reynolds as their DMS providers. Vendors are likely only willing to pay such prices because competitors like Authenticom are foreclosed from competing for that business.

With respect to the DIS market, the Court recognizes that there are other parties that have been more directly\n   harmed by the alleged misconduct by Defendant. Still, it cannot be true that state antitrust claims are categorically barred whenever other parties have been more directly harmed.

Again, given that the causal link between the alleged misconduct and Plaintiffs' claimed harm is short, the Court finds it likely that damages can reasonably be apportioned among Plaintiffs and others more directly harmed. Discovery ultimately may reveal that such apportionment cannot be done with reasonable accuracy. However, there is no indication based on the information before the Court that is the case here. Accordingly, taking all of the\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   factors into account, the Court concludes that Plaintiff sufficiently has alleged proximate causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Supreme Auto Transp., LLC v.

This very case provides an example: many if not all\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   repealer states would have allowed Supreme Auto's original complaint to go forward. That first complaint alleged injury based on the purchase of steel rods and similar items from distributors who, in turn, had purchased those same items from the defendants. The original complaint involves an indirect purchase (and so would be barred by\n   <em>\n    Illinois Brick\n   </em>\n   at the federal level) where the alleged injury is still fairly traceable to the defendant steel manufacturers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   The amended complaint is a different story. It alleges that plaintiffs purchased steel only insofar as it was one among many components of other more complex products, all of which have gone through numerous manufacturing alterations and lines of distribution. In many of these products, steel is not even a primary or necessary ingredient. We cannot imagine-and plaintiffs have not told us-how one might tackle the task of tracing the effect of an alleged overcharge on steel through the complex supply and production chains that gave rise to the consumer products at issue here.

[378, at 25.] Still, in\n   <em>\n    Supreme Auto\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit relied on the fact that the defendant's product \"was not even a primary or necessary ingredient\" in the purchased product and that defendant's product had \"gone through numerous manufacturing alterations and lines of distribution.\" Although DIS is not a component part of the vendor services purchased by Plaintiffs, it certainly is a necessary ingredient to such services. Furthermore, there is only one link in the chain (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , vendors) between dealers and data integrators. The Court recognizes that the allegations of proximate cause in this case fall somewhere in between the allegations in the original and amended complaints in\n   <em>\n    Supreme Auto.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, the allegations here are enough to establish at the motion to dismiss stage that Plaintiffs' claimed harms are fairly traceable to the alleged misconduct by Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish proximate causation at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Defendant argues that Plaintiffs similarly have not alleged a specific harm to consumers. However, unlike\n   <em>\n    Apprentice\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs are not competitors with Defendant. Furthermore, Defendant's argument assumes that Plaintiffs are not \"consumers\" under the ADTPA. Without any argument or authority addressing whether Plaintiffs are \"consumers\" under the ADTPA, the Court cannot determine whether Plaintiffs sufficiently have alleged a consumer-oriented act. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim under the ADTPA (Count XXXIII) for failure to allege sufficient consumer ties without prejudice to raising the argument in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' claim under the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act (\"GFBPA\"), however, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs have not alleged that they are consumers as the term is used under that statute.

Pa. July 13, 2016) (\"[T]he New Mexico statute does not require a plaintiff to plead grossly unequal bargaining power.\"). The Court finds the reasoning of the latter category cases to be more persuasive. A plaintiff may state a claim under the New Mexico Act by pleading that defendant either acted in a way that \"(1) [took] advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of a person to a grossly unfair degree; or (2) result[ed] in a gross disparity between the value received by a person and the price paid.\" N.M. Stat. \u00a7 57-12-2(E) (2016). Nothing in the statute or in caselaw from New Mexico limits consumer protection claims to those involving grossly unequal bargaining power.

Failure To Allege Specific Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' claim under the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practices Act (Count XLII) should be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to identify the specific aspects of the statute that they contend CDK violated. In support of that argument, Defendant cites to a case from the District of Nevada in which the court granted a motion to dismiss a Nevada Deceptive Practices Act claim with leave to amend where the plaintiffs failed to identify \"which kinds of violations are alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204830497\">\n    2013 WL 4830497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Nev. Sept. 9, 2013). However, it is not clear from that opinion whether the plaintiffs in that case failed to cite to the specific statutory provision or failed substantively to identify the challenged conduct. Defendant appears to read\n   <em>\n    Zappos\n   </em>\n   as taking the former position, as Defendant does not argue that Plaintiffs' factual allegations are insufficient. To the extent that\n   <em>\n    Zappos\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that plaintiffs must cite the specific statutory authority on which it relies to state a claim, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Zappos\n   </em>\n   unpersuasive in light of Seventh Circuit case law making clear that \"[p]laintiffs need only plead facts, not legal theories, in their complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves ex rel.
