On February 4, 2019, Jolley, with agreement of U.S. Bank, requested a hearing on its Motion to Remand. ECF No. 28.

Jolley argues that U.S. Bank could first ascertain that the case had become removable on October 3, 2018, when counsel for U.S. Bank received the proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order from SIWPC and\n   consented to it. Mem. Supp. at 5.

U.S. Bank contends that the e-mail and attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order were insufficient for it to ascertain that the case had become removable. Resp. at 3-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   U.S. Bank argues that the earliest it could have learned that SIWPC was a nominal party was \"on or about November 8, 2018 (but no earlier than November 5, 2018),\" when it received a cover letter and copy of the Agreed Nominal Party Order for signing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. U.S. Bank insists that \"the case was not removable until the proposed Nominal Party Order was entered by the state court on November 19, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. U.S. Bank does not argue the cover letter and copy of the Agreed Nominal Party Order for signing, received from SIWPC with a request to forward on to Jolley, do not constitute \"other paper\" under \u00a7 1446.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Similarly, U.S. Bank does not argue the e-mail and attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order, received and responded to on October 3, 2018, do not constitute \"other paper\" under \u00a7 1446.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For support of its argument, U.S. Bank cites\n   <em>\n    In re: Lumber Liquidators Chinese-Manufactured Flooring Products Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation (\"In re: Lumber Liquidators\")\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-cv-02639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012516789\">\n    2015 WL 12516789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. Oct. 22, 2015). In that case the plaintiffs filed an Amended Petition in state court, \"in which plaintiffs first made class action allegations that established grounds for removal to federal court based on federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act ('CAFA').\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Although the plaintiffs filed the Amended Petition on March 4, 2015, they were required to obtain leave of court to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The state court granted the plaintiffs leave to file the Amended Petition on March 10, 2015, and the defendants were served with the Amended Petition on March 13, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants filed a Notice of Removal on April 7, 2015, and the federal court concluded that the defendants' Notice of Removal was timely because \"the statutory period to file a Notice of Removal based on the Amended Petition was not triggered until the Amended Petition became an operative pleading, which occurred, at the earliest, on March 10, 2015, the day that the Louisiana state court granted the plaintiffs['] motion for leave to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The case at bar is clearly distinguishable. Unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    In re: Lumber Liquidators\n   </em>\n   , who needed new allegations in an Amended Petition to become operative to assert federal jurisdiction, nothing prevented U.S. Bank from filing a Notice of Removal on the basis of Jolley's Complaint prior to entry of the Agreed Nominal Party Order and asserting that SIWPC is a nominal party whose citizenship could be disregarded before the Agreed Nominal Party Order was entered in state court. To the extent, if any, that Jolley did not agree with the Defendants that SIWPC is a nominal party, the parties could have litigated SIWPC's nominal party status in federal court on a motion to remand from a timely filed notice of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, the Agreed Nominal Party Order has no impact on the operative pleading, Jolley's Complaint, as it does not substantively alter the claims in Jolley's Complaint to provide a basis for federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreed Order at 1-2. Jolley's Complaint does not seek monetary relief against SIWPC, nor does it allege that SIWPC has breached its fiduciary duty as trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-35. The Agreed Nominal Party Order simply clarified and confirmed that \"there is neither\n   individual monetary relief sought against SIWPC herein nor liability alleged against it in the litigation of this matter,\" Agreed Order at 1, such that SIWPC's citizenship would not be considered in determining whether the parties are completely diverse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navarro Sav.

However, the entry of the Agreed Nominal Party Order was not necessary to put U.S. Bank on notice that this case was removable. Therefore, U.S. Bank's Notice of Removal filed on December 4, 2018, is untimely because the Notice of Removal could have been filed within thirty days from U.S. Bank's receipt of service of Jolley's Complaint on July 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To the extent, if any, that Jolley's Complaint was insufficient to put U.S. Bank on notice that SIWPC might be a nominal party whose citizenship could be disregarded, U.S. Bank was permitted to file its Notice of Removal \"within 30 days after receipt ... of a copy of an ... other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3).

The October 3, 2018 e-mail and attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order are \"other paper\" under \u00a7 1446(b)(3) because those documents are information that was received by the defendant. Therefore, U.S. Bank's thirty-day period to file a Notice of Removal commenced, at the latest, on October 3, 2018, when it received \"other paper from which it\n   <em>\n    may first be ascertained\n   </em>\n   that the case is one which is or has become removable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the Fourth Circuit does\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    not require courts to inquire into the subjective knowledge of the defendant\n   </em>\n   , an inquiry that could degenerate into a mini-trial regarding who knew what and when.

This is apparent from the four corners of the October 3, 2018 e-mail and the proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order that was attached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Supp., Ex. A at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the October 3, 2018 e-mail, counsel for SIWPC wrote: \"My client is still interested in having the 'Nominal Party' Order entered. I am attaching same here for Robert's review and endorsement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Counsel for SIWPC further requested that Robert Michael, counsel for U.S. Bank, \"add [his] signature block (assuming [he] ha[s] no objections to the Order).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order clearly indicates that it deems SIWPC to be a nominal party to the suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (\"SIWPC is hereby deemed to be a nominal party.\"). Therefore, it is apparent from the four corners of the October 3, 2018 e-mail and the attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order that the case\n   was removable on the ground that SIWPC could be considered a nominal party whose citizenship could be disregarded. Counsel for U.S. Bank confirmed that he received this notice, and agreed, that SIWPC could be considered a nominal party when he replied to the e-mail on October 3, 2018: \"I have no objection to the Order which clarifies SIWPC's role in the matter as nominal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, the inquiry here is whether the e-mail and attached proposed Agreed Nominal Party Order gave\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of this ground for removal, not whether U.S. Bank realized on October 3, 2018, that it could file a notice of removal asserting SIWPC is a nominal party whose citizenship is disregarded. Therefore, October 3, 2018, is the date upon which U.S. Bank could have first ascertained that the case had become removable on the ground that SIWPC is a nominal party whose citizenship could be disregarded. Accordingly, U.S. Bank's Notice of Removal filed more than thirty days later on December 4, 2018, is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   that the case at bar was not timely removed, Jolley's Motion to Remand is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and this case is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to the Circuit Court for the City of Chesapeake for further proceedings. Further, because the court resolves Jolley's Motion to Remand on the ground of timeliness, the court does not reach Jolley's other grounds for remand. Finally, Jolley's Motion for Show Cause Order Against U.S. Bank, ECF No. 8, and U.S. Bank's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 6, are rendered\n   <strong>\n    MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    For consistency in citations throughout this Order of Remand, the initial citation of a document will include the ECF No. of that document, with all subsequent citations being only to the document itself without citation to the ECF No.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    notes 2 and 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    ECF No. 1 is U.S. Bank's Notice of Removal.

The first citation to a document from Exhibit A will include both the citation to the document itself, as well as to ECF No. 1-1 with the ECF page numbers for that complete document. Subsequent citations to a document from Exhibit A will be only to the document itself and will not include citation to ECF No. 1-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    ECF No. 18 is the Memorandum in Support of Motion to Remand to State Court. ECF No. 18-1 is Exhibit A to the Memorandum in Support and is not the same Exhibit A referenced in footnote 2. Given the duplicative use of Exhibit lettering in the parties' filings, the court has endeavored to ensure accuracy of the cites, as well as to alleviate confusion of duplicative letters.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    note 2 and\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    note 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    ECF No. 4 is Exhibit C to the Notice of Removal and consists of ten (10) pages.
