Courts reviewing claims alleged to be foreclosed by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) have generally found that \"the provision only applies to the 'narrower category of decisions where Congress has taken the additional step to specify that the sole authority for the action is in the [Secretary]'s discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Liu v. Novak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690273\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/509/1/#p7\">\n    509 F.Supp.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (D.D.C. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alaka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3349480\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/88/#p95\">\n    456 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   95 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Courts have thus refused to apply the jurisdictional bar in two sets of circumstances. First, courts have entertained claims under sections of the INA that do not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   provide for agency discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3349480\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/88/#p95\">\n    456 F.3d at 101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that grant of authority to \"decide\" and \"determin[e]\" whether alien should benefit from withholding of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) did not specify discretion to the Attorney General, and thus that decision to deny withholding of removal was not unreviewable under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) ). And second, even when a section of the INA provides that the ultimate decision is in the executive's discretion, courts have considered claims relating to statutory eligibility for relief, which is often a precursor for the ultimate discretionary decision.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mejia Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5895514\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/1137/\">\n    562 F.3d at 1143-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that while ultimate decision to grant temporary protected status was discretionary, \"the director of USCIS is required to make many decisions based on his legal interpretation of an alien's statutory eligibility ... before exercising his discretionary authority,\" and review of those statutory eligibility decisions was not precluded by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, neither circumstance is at issue here. \u00a7 1157(c)(1) leaves the admissibility of refugees to \"the [Secretary of Homeland Security's] discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201157\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Courts to have reviewed the issue have also indicated that Congress expressly provided for agency discretion in \u00a7 1157(c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kucana v.

Reply at 2, and as recognized by these courts, the language of \u00a7 1157(c)(1) clearly invokes the jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   And this case is not one where Plaintiffs ask for review of a statutory eligibility determination or of another non-discretionary decision, as the plaintiff did in\n   <em>\n    Mejia Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   . Neither are Plaintiffs challenging the government's failure to act.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523156\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/1045/#p1071\">\n    288 F.Supp.3d at 1071-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (contrasting plaintiffs' claims that the Secretary of Homeland Security \"fail[ed] to act on refugee applications\" with circumstances where a plaintiff would \"challeng[e] a denial of refugee admission,\" and noting that pursuant to \u00a7 1157(c)(1), \"the Secretary may have discretion over what the decision will be, but not over whether a decision will be made\"). Here, Plaintiffs ask this Court to reverse \"the wrongful denial of [their] Applications for Refugee Resettlement in the U.S. 'as a matter of discretion for security related reasons.' \" Compl. at 2-3 (quoting Notice of Ineligibility at 2). They specifically request that this Court \"[o]rder Defendants to reopen and approve Plaintiffs' Applications and issue the corresponding visas to ... Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars the review of that discretionary decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, the APA's section providing for reviewability of agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law cannot save Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs argue that \"Defendants' argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction ... ignores the issue of a decision found to be arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of agency discretion\" pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). Pls.' Mem. Opp'n at 5. But \u00a7 706(2)(A) only applies if the Court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' APA claims.
