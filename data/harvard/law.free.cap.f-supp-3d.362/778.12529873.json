WHITE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Now before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary adjudication. Defendants XPO CNW, Inc. and XPO Logistics, Inc. (\"Defendants\") move for summary adjudication of the second cause of action for intentional interference with contract, the third cause of action for elder abuse, and Plaintiff's claims for punitive damages. Plaintiff Christopher O'Brien, acting as trustee of the Raymond F. O'Brien Revocable Trust, seeks partial summary judgment of his first cause of action for breach of contract. Having carefully reviewed the parties' papers, considered\n   their arguments and the relevant legal authority, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants' motion for summary adjudication and GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 1958 through 1995, Raymond O'Brien (\"O'Brien\") served first as controller, and ultimately as a President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board of Directors for Consolidated Freightways, Inc. (\"the Company\"). In 1997, the Company changed its name to CNF, Inc. and then again in 2006 to Con-Way, Inc. The Company was acquired by XPO Logistics, Inc. (\"XPO\") in November 2015 and then changed its name again to XPO CNW, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to his retirement from CEO of the Company in 1987, O'Brien received a number of letters thanking him for his many years of service and offering him an office, secretary, and car service after his retirement (\"the Agreement\"). Plaintiff accepted this offer and continued to receive these benefits from 1987 through 1988. In addition, from 1988 through 1995, O'Brien continued to serve on the Board of Directors and the Company continued to provide a secretary, car service, and on-site office. From 1995 through 2006, the Company continued to provide the full-time secretary and car service, but the office was moved off-site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the Company changed its name to Con-Way, Inc. in 2006 and through 2011, it continued to provide O'Brien with a secretary, car service, and his own off-site office. In 2011, O'Brien's secretary retired and he proposed, as way to reduce costs, to forego his full-time secretary, car service, and office, and instead agreed that the Company would pay him $ 6,000 a month for the remainder of his life (\"the Modified Agreement\"). Since that time, from 2011 through November 2015, O'Brien sent regular monthly invoices and the Company sent the $ 6,000 each month to O'Brien. In 2015, the Company merged with XPO Logistics, Inc. and the monthly payments were included in the \"employee benefits\" section of a Disclosure Letter that accompanied the merger agreement. However, beginning in December 2015, the Company refused to make the monthly payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   O'Brien filed this action in May 2016 in an effort to recover the $ 6,000 monthly retirement compensation he says he was owed. O'Brien passed away in February 2017, and his son, Christopher O'Brien, acting as trustee of the family trust, continued this action to recover the amounts the trust contends are still due. Plaintiff claims the trust is owed $ 107,268.49 for contract damages ($ 90,000 of missed payments in addition to prejudgment interest). Plaintiff moves for partial summary judgment on his first cause of action for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants move for summary adjudication on the causes of action, for intentional interference with contract and elder abuse, and for punitive damages. The Court shall address the Plaintiff's motion first as the other causes of action rely in part upon the existence of a contract for their premise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court shall address additional specific facts in the remainder of its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wenger Decl. Ex. A (O'Brien Depo.) at 30:14-31:4; Ex. C (O'Brien Depo.) at 164:9-14; Ex. E (Scott Depo.) at 18:22-24; Moffitt Decl. \u00b6 9.) O'Brien agreed to return, at reduced salary, and in 1991, stepped down from the position as CEO, but remained a board member and continued to consult for the Company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moffitt Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. C; Kennedy Decl. \u00b6 4; Wenger Decl. Ex. A (O'Brien Depo.) at 31:14-21, Ex. C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (O'Brien Depo.) at 163:10-166:5.) At this time, Moffitt, then acting as CEO, confirmed the existence of the earlier Agreement reached in 1987. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moffitt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, Exs. A, B; Wenger Decl. Ex. A (O'Brien Depo.) at 82:21-83:12, 84:3-22, 97:22-98:1.) O'Brien continued to serve on the Board from 1991 to 1995, and the Company continued to make available an office, secretary and car service. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Kennedy Decl. \u00b6 3; Moffitt Decl. Ex. D; Wenger Decl. Ex. N.) In 1995, O'Brien stepped down as Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Company, through its CEO Moffitt, again confirmed the earlier agreement for an office, secretary and car service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moffitt Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the end of 2005, the Company's cost to provide these benefits was high and the value of the continued benefits to O'Brien were low. O'Brien and Kennedy agreed to modify the original Agreement and instead to pay O'Brien $ 6,000 per month as long as he lived. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wenger Decl. Ex. A (O'Brien Depo.) at 47:17-48:8, 55:18-56:11; 58:13-59:10, 62:24-25, 110:15-113:8; Ex. C (O'Brien Depo.) at 130:23-132:1, 193:24-197:4; Ex.

Beginning in 2006 and through November 2015, these monthly invoices were received and paid in a timely manner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer \u00b6 14 (Dkt.

In the merger agreement, Con-Way, Inc. informed XPO that it had a \"continuing financial obligation\" to O'Brien of $ 6,000 per month, listed as a separate retirement benefit. The payments were purposefully disclosed in the merger agreement papers so as not to be disregarded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Egan Decl. Ex.

On October 31, 2015, the merger closed and Con-Way, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of XPO and changed its name to XPO CNW, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wenger Decl. Ex H (Krull Depo.) at 92:2-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the beginning of November 2015, Gordon Devens, who was then acting as General Counsel, Senior Vice President for the Company, determined after conducting an examination of the relevant paperwork, disclosures, and invoices, that the Company did not owe a legal obligation to O'Brien to continue the monthly payments of $ 6,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Devens Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) Although Devens made a delayed payment for the month of November 2015, he thereafter discontinued the payments altogether beginning in December 2015 without communicating his reasons why for several\n   months. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Egans Decl. Ex.

In addition to his continued offer to provide consulting services, O'Brien agreed to forego the office benefits originally provided to him in exchange for reduced monthly payments. There is, again, no indication in the record that the parties failed to understand the terms or consideration granted in the Modified Agreement. The Modified Agreement, also adhered to for nearly ten years, set the terms for consideration and payment of monthly invoices for the rest of O'Brien's lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants contend that, upon the merger and further investigation conducted by Devens, the Company concluded that there was no legal obligation to continue payments to O'Brien. Defendants argue that the terms are vague and the payments constitute merely a gift acknowledging O'Brien's past service without any reciprocal consideration. Again, the Court is not persuaded that the terms of the Modified Agreement were insufficiently definite to enable the Court or the parties to \"ascertain the parties obligations and to determine whether those obligations have been performed or breached.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Rockridge Trust v.

Cal. 2013) (internal citations omitted). Although Defendants characterize the consultation services offered by O'Brien and the lifetime of an elderly man as \"eternity,\" the Court finds O'Brien provided adequate consideration of his consultation services and waiver of earlier-provided benefits. Also, at the age of 65 when the original agreement was formed (and at 93 when the Company terminated payments), the term of the agreement is not for eternal duration. Further, the fact that both the original and modified contract's terms had been fully actualized for nearly 30 years favors the determination that the terms were sufficiently definite and approved by the Company's course of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Employers Reinsurance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3994922\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/161/906/#p920\">\n    161 Cal.

Plaintiff argues that while Devens claims he was acting upon XPO's behalf (while the contract was with Con-Way, Inc.), Plaintiff proffers evidence that Devens was also senior legal counsel at Con-Way, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wenger Decl. Ex. G (Devens Depo.) at 73:14-74:22.) Accordingly, there remains a dispute of fact regarding whether Devens was acting as stranger to the original contract, or on behalf of the interested party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that XPO had no knowledge of the contract, as Devens had \"reasonably determined ... that no legally enforceable agreement existed.\" (Opp. Br. at 12.) The Court has found that a valid agreement existed, and regardless, the existence of the history of payments and course of conduct, including Devens' own decision to pay the November 2015 invoice, and corporate disclosures indicates that XPO certainly had knowledge of the existence of the disputed agreement and had made an independent determination not to honor it as a legally binding contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lastly, Defendants contend because XPO has an ownership interest in Con-Way, XPO's conduct was privileged. The mere fact that XPO had an ownership interest in Con-Way does not automatically establish privilege, however. Rather, the affirmative defense of privilege only applies if (1) that person does not act with improper means, and (2) acts to prevent his ownership interest from being prejudiced by the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sade Shoe Co. v.

The only remaining question is a factual dispute over Defendants' motive. Although Devens contends that he engaged in a good faith investigation regarding the Company's obligation to continue payments, he also admits that he neglected to inform O'Brien of the Company's position that there was no valid contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wenger Decl. Ex. H (Devens Depo.) at 88:16-92:21, 107:8-13, 148:9-12, 159:5-161:2.) The evidence establishes that the Company was aware of the earlier agreements and had independently and without disclosure to O'Brien determined after years of payments, that the agreements were not binding. The Court finds that the motive is a question of fact to be determined by a jury. Because there remain disputed facts concerning the state of mind, the contextual circumstances, and defendant's motive in stopping payments, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action for elder abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Again, the Court finds that the question of Defendants' motive is subject to dispute and the question whether the facts would support \"an award of punitive damages is for the trier of act, since the\n   degree of punishment depends on the peculiar circumstances of each case.\"\n   <em>\n    Spinks v.
