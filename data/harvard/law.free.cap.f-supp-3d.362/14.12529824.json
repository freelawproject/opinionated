Here, the Plaintiffs do not explain why-and indeed it is hard to see how-this information would shed light of the FBI's performance of its statutory duties. The D.C.

The Hardy Declaration makes it clear that the FBI's redactions occurred only after a careful page by page, line by line review of the information and a determination whether any of the information was reasonably segregable and thus available for disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. \u00b6 46.
