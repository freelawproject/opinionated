Gonzalo P. Curiel, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 15, 2018, Plaintiff Theresa Brooke (\"Plaintiff\") filed a verified first amended complaint against Defendants Kashl Corporation (\"Kashl\") and Radisson Hotels International, Inc., alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, and the California Disabled Persons Act. (ECF No. 6.) Plaintiff's suit has generated two motions, both presently before the Court. The first is Kashl's Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction (ECF No. 9), which Plaintiff opposes (ECF No. 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second is Kashl's motion requesting an order declaring plaintiff a vexatious litigant (ECF No. 3), which has not been opposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the Court finds the motion to dismiss suitable\n   for adjudication without oral argument. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Kashl's motion to dismiss,\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff to show cause why she should not declared a vexatious litigant, and\n   <strong>\n    DEFERS\n   </strong>\n   ruling on Kashl's motion requesting an order declaring plaintiff a vexatious litigant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Kashl is an Oregon corporation which does business as Radisson Hotel San Diego Rancho Bernardo (\"Radisson Rancho Bernardo\"), located at 11520 Western Bernardo Court, San Diego, California 92127. The Radisson Rancho Bernardo is a public accommodation which offers public lodging services. Kashl, along with co-defendant Radisson Hotels International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, co-operates the website for the Radisson Rancho Bernardo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff resides in Pinal County, Arizona and ambulates with the aid of a wheelchair due to loss of a leg. (ECF No. 6, at 2.) Although Plaintiff lives in Arizona, she and her husband \"are avid travelers to California,\" and she \"makes frequent trips to San Diego.\" (ECF No. 6, at 4, 5). On or about October 30, 2018, Plaintiff was in San Diego and went to the Radisson Rancho Bernardo to book a room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) However, Plaintiff alleges that when she pulled up to the passenger loading zone, there was no marked access aisle between the loading zone and the curb from which she could navigate her way to the entrance of the hotel in her wheelchair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that it is a violation of Section 503.3 of the 2010 ADA Standards of Accessible Design (\"2010 Standards\") for a public accommodation not to have an access aisle at least 60 inches wide, and that the lack of such an access aisle at the Radisson Rancho Bernardo caused her to be deterred from returning to the hotel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result of encountering that barrier, Plaintiff did not book a room at the Radisson Rancho Bernardo in October 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Thereafter, Plaintiff communicated with Kashl with respect to the alleged Section 503.3 non-compliance. According to Plaintiff, counsel for Kashl advised Plaintiff that her claim was not factually accurate, and stated that \"[t]here is no passenger loading zone to remediate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff, apparently relying on this representation, returned to the hotel on or about December 11, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff indicates that she was in San Diego that week for settlement conferences and a brief vacation to visit local attractions, like the nearby Naval base. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to this second visit, Plaintiff accessed the website maintained for the Radisson Rancho Bernardo and found that she was unable to book an accessible room or suite, allegedly in violation of 28 C.F.R. 36.302(e)(1). During the drive to the hotel, Plaintiff phoned ahead to book a room and was advised that there were in fact no accessible rooms for rent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that this was a violation of section 224.5 of the 2010 Standards. When Plaintiff arrived at the hotel, she re-encountered the original accessibility barrier at the passenger zone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Again deterred, Plaintiff did not lodge at the Radisson Rancho Bernardo and instead found a different hotel at which to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of these events, Plaintiff claims she is \"extremely embarrassed and insulted at the lack of access at Defendant's hotel and on Defendants' website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.).\n   </em>\n   Notwithstanding these incidents, Plaintiff maintains that \"if the barriers are removed, she will lodge at Defendant's hotel and/or revisit the hotel to obtain access to the Defendant's property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7.) To wit, Plaintiff avers that she \"will make a third visit to the hotel and hopefully be able to lodge there in March, which is\n   when she and her husband will be returning to San Diego again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a complaint which was superseded by her verified first amended complaint, filed December 15, 2018. (ECF No. 6.) This first amended complaint alleged violations of Title III of the American with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012102\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and the regulations implementing the ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2046.101\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 46.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; the California Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Civil Code sections 51, 52, and the California Disabled Persons Act, California Civil Code sections 54 - 54.3. The first amended complaint sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , statutory damages, declaratory relief, attorney's fees, and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 4, 2018, Kashl filed a motion (1) seeking dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for Plaintiff's lack of standing to pursue injunctive relief under the ADA, and (2) requesting an order declaring Plaintiff a vexatious litigant. (ECF No. 3.) Although the part of that motion which sought to dismiss Plaintiff's original complaint was mooted by virtue of Plaintiff's amended complaint, the latter portion pertaining to whether Plaintiff ought be declared a vexatious litigant remains pending before the Court. (ECF No. 8.) Later, on December 20, 2018, Kashl filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's first amended complaint, reiterating the arguments made in their earlier Rule 12(b)(1) motion as to Plaintiff's lack of standing. (ECF No. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The two live motions before the Court revolve around a singular set of contentions. At bottom, Kashl contends that Plaintiff is a serial ADA litigant who, despite professing an intent to return to non-ADA compliant public accommodations, has no such plans, and is abusing both the ADA statute and the court system as a way to extract \"nuisance settlements\" from an incredibly high number of hotels and other businesses in Arizona and California. (ECF No. 9-1, at 2.) Kashl posits that the 605 ADA complaints Plaintiff has filed in the California federal courts since 2016, coupled with the fact that she lives over 400 miles away from the Radisson Rancho Bernardo, belie her claim that she actually intends to return to patronize the hotel, and that she is suffering a continuous injury as a result of any alleged ADA non-compliance at the Radisson Rancho Bernardo (or any other property sued, for that matter).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, taken in the aggregate,\n   Kashl insists that Plaintiff's litigation history presents a tale of systematic extortion which warrants both dismissal of the action in the instant case, as well as a global pre-filing order restricting Plaintiff from further ADA claims within the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition to Kashl's motion to dismiss did not address the 605 other lawsuits she has filed in the California district courts. Instead, Plaintiff asks the Court to focus only on whether she has made a sufficient showing of a concrete plan to return to the Radisson San Bernardo. (ECF No. 13, at 2.) Plaintiff points out that, though she need not have personally visited the hotel to establish a sincere likelihood of returning there in the future, her attempts to lodge at the Radisson San Bernardo in October and December of 2018 are good faith proof of her anticipated return in March of 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With the parties' contentions in mind, the Court will turn first to the motion to dismiss, and then the motion to declare Plaintiff a vexatious litigant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. 12(b)(1) Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows defendants to seek dismissal of a claim or action for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) is appropriate if the complaint, considered in its entirety, fails to allege facts on its face that are sufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    In re Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/981/#p984\">\n    546 F.3d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 984-85 (9th Cir. 2008). Although the defendant is the moving party in a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiff is the party invoking the court's jurisdiction. As a result, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the case is properly in federal court.\n   <em>\n    McCauley v.

In other words, injury is imminent when a plaintiff \"is threatened with harm in the future because of existing or immediately threatened non-compliance with the ADA.\" The Ninth Circuit recently clarified that a plaintiff need not personally encounter a barrier in order to be injured. Instead, \"[i]t is the plaintiff's 'actual knowledge' of a barrier, rather than the source of that knowledge, that is determinative.\"\n   <em>\n    Civil Rights Educ. &amp; Enf't Ctr. v. Hosp.

With respect to Plaintiff's past patronage, Kashl contends that Plaintiff's visits were \"insincere[ ]\" because Plaintiff came by only to search for other alleged barriers. (ECF No. 9-1, at 7.) In addition, Kashl objects that Plaintiff has no genuine or \"concrete plans to return\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   564 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that a serial plaintiff's extensive litigation history, such as Plaintiff's, can undermine her professed intent to return. Finally, Kashl suggests that Plaintiff's trips to California are not frequent enough to confer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At the outset, the Court must note that even Kashl's own cited authorities indicate that the four aforementioned factors \"are not definitive.\"\n   <em>\n    Gastelum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202388047\">\n    2018 WL 2388047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. For example, the fact that \"the public accommodation being sued is far from the plaintiff's home\" is not dispositive, as the Ninth Circuit has \"found actual or imminent injury sufficient to establish standing where plaintiff demonstrates an intent to return to the geographic area where the accommodation is located and a desire to visit the accommodation if it were made accessible.\"\n   <em>\n    D'Lil v.

A verified complaint is submitted under pain of perjury, and may be used as an opposing affidavit so long as the allegations are based on personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v.

Because in resisting a factual attack on jurisdiction the Court must credit Plaintiff's competent evidence as much as it would credit that proffered by a party resisting summary judgment under Rule 56, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden of demonstrating an intent to return to the Radisson San Bernardo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This case bears similarity to\n   <em>\n    Best Western\n   </em>\n   , where the Ninth Circuit found sufficient evidence that the plaintiff, D'Lil intended to return to the Best Western Encina, located in Santa Barbara. There,\n   the Ninth Circuit held that D'Lil had amply demonstrated her intent to return based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , her testimony that she had a history of making trips to the Santa Barbara area, visited approximately 1-3 times a year, and because she had testified to three upcoming trips.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127838\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1031/#p1037\">\n    538 F.3d at 1037-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . D'Lil declared that she \"would like to return and use the subject Best Western Encina on a spontaneous, but full and equal basis,\" and explained that her preference for the hotel was \"based on the hotel's proximity to downtown, its accessibility from the freeway, and its amenities, including lush gardening and fresh country linen quilts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127838\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1031/#p1037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127838\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1031/#p1037\">\n    at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (some quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The factors compelling standing in\n   <em>\n    Best Western\n   </em>\n   are equally applicable here. That Plaintiff did not proffer any personal anecdotes about the Radisson Rancho Bernardo's fresh country linen quilts or exquisite horticulture, is in part, the Court surmises, because according to her allegations, she was deterred from booking a room with the hotel due to its structural barriers. Nonetheless, she has averred that she wants to stay at the Radisson Rancho Bernardo because she visits the area often and wishes to \"diversify her lodging during her visits\" to San Diego. (ECF No. 6, at 6.) And, she has expressed a concrete desire to return to the Radisson Rancho Bernardo in March of this year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) This expression of intent is bolstered by Plaintiff's sworn testimony that she visits San Diego frequently, and that she and her husband are both \"avid travelers to California.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) While Plaintiff's sworn assertions are not as robust as the testimony offered in\n   <em>\n    Best Western\n   </em>\n   , they are nonetheless sufficient to carry Plaintiff across the standing threshold, at least at this juncture.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiedler v. Ocean Properties, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3600455\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/683/57/#p71\">\n    683 F.Supp.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71-73 (D. Me. 2010) (holding, in a close-call decision, that the plaintiff's sworn affidavit testimony stating that he intended to vacation and stay at the defendant's hotel if and when it was brought into ADA compliance \"minimally sustain[ed] his burden\" of establish standing for the purposes of summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   None of Kashl's contentions detract from this conclusion. First, Kashl seems to argue that no legitimate intent to return can be predicated upon a past trip to a public accommodation if that trip was solely motivated by an intent to pursue ADA litigation. (ECF No. 9, at 6.) However, governing caselaw provides that \"motivation is irrelevant to the question of standing under Title III of the ADA.\"\n   <em>\n    CREEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275539\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1093/#p1099\">\n    867 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, Kashl protests that Plaintiff has not identified what, if anything, draws her to the Rancho Bernardo Radisson, as opposed to any other hotel in the San Diego area. Kashl invokes the decision in\n   <em>\n    Parr v. L &amp; L Drive-Inn Restaurant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11517656\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/96/1065/\">\n    96 F.Supp.2d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Haw. 2000), where the plaintiff proved his concrete plans to return in part because he had \"developed a taste for [defendant] L &amp; L's food.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11517656\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/96/1065/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11517656\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/96/1065/\">\n    at 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, as other courts have observed, a special predilection for the service of any particular public accommodation is not dispositive. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Del Taco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the district court read the facts of\n   <em>\n    Parr\n   </em>\n   as establishing a sufficient, but not necessary, condition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8908273\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/396/1107/#p1115\">\n    396 F.Supp.2d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (\"Mr. Harris need not love Del Taco food in order to sue any Del Taco restaurant. Mr. Harris could have demonstrated his intent to return in any number of ways.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, Kashl points to the welter of Plaintiff's other ADA filings, in this judicial district and beyond, as belying a legitimate intent to return to any of the 605 hotels sued in the Californian district courts. (ECF No. 9, at 6.) But, Plaintiff's\n   professed intentions to visit the other hotels-sincere or otherwise-are not before this Court. For the purposes of this Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the Court is only concerned whether Plaintiff has adduced enough support for the proposition that she is likely to return to the Radisson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Best Western\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127838\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1031/#p1037\">\n    538 F.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"whether or not D'Lil visited the hotels in Redding [i.e., hotels which D'Lil sued but never returned to] says little about her intent to visit the Best Western Encina,\" and cautioning courts against using past ADA litigation history to impugn credibility and sincerity of intent to return). And as explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this she has sufficiently done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, Kashl takes issue with the veracity of Plaintiff's sworn statements. Pointing to Plaintiff's extensive litigation history, Kashl asks the Court to \"find that Plaintiff's and her counsel's litigation history undercuts her credibility and belies a legitimate intent to return to the subject Hotel.\" (ECF No. 9-1, at 9.) Kashl invites the Court to interrogate the sincerity and honesty of Plaintiff's professed intent to return. The Court acknowledges Kashl's concerns as well-taken. Indeed, there is much in the record before the Court which suggests that Plaintiff is not being entirely candid when she says she intends to come to the Rancho Bernardo Radisson in March, and that she also has an intent to return to any number of other hotels she has sued in the San Diego area. However, \"[i]f [Plaintiff] is going to be disbelieved on the issue of standing, it should be in the context of factfinding, not in the context of [a Rule 12(b)(1) motion].\"\n   <em>\n    Fiedler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3600455\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/683/57/#p71\">\n    683 F.Supp.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to \"draw conclusions about Mr. Fiedler's credibility,\" and to \"disbelieve his statements about his past practices and his present intentions\" upon a motion for summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Kashl's motion to dismiss for lack of standing is accordingly\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Kashl urges that Plaintiff's multitudinous filings of ADA claims in the California district courts has been vexatious, ingenuine, and abusive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Kashl takes issue with Plaintiff's serial litigation against hotels and other entities, pointing out that Plaintiff has alleged the same fact patterns, implausible intents to return, and claimed similar injuries in each instance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Kashl contends that Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel are \"part of [a] scheme of systematic extortion,\" similar to the one identified by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Molski v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Kashl filed the motion requesting order declaring plaintiff a vexatious litigant on December 4, 2018 in conjunction with its motion to dismiss Plaintiff's original complaint. The Court set a briefing schedule which calendared a hearing on February 1, 2019 for both motions, and ordered that any opposition from Plaintiff must be filed\n   on or before December 19, 2018. (ECF No. 5.) Plaintiff amended her complaint as a matter of right on December 15, 2018, which, as reflected in the Court's December 17, 2018 order (ECF No. 8), mooted Kashl's pending motion to dismiss and took the motion off of the February 1, 2019 calendar. At that point, the Court also advised that the original hearing date for February 1, 2019 would not be vacated altogether because Defendant's motion to declare Plaintiff a vexatious litigant was unaffected by Plaintiff's amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion to declare her a vexatious litigant before the court-prescribed filing deadline. Failing to do so not only violated Civil Rule 7.1(f)(3)(a)'s requirement that Plaintiff either oppose the motion or file a statement of opposition, but also brought her within the purview of Civil Local Rule 7.1(f)(3)(c), which provides that failure to timely oppose a motion may constitute consent to granting the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People of the State of California v. Manos\n   </em>\n   , No. 15CV1048-LAB (BGS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2012672152\">\n    2015 WL 12672152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D. Cal. June 11, 2015). This failure to oppose was remarked upon by Kashl, who asked the Court to grant its motion in light of Plaintiff's silence. (ECF No. 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While in certain circumstances the Court has construed the failure to oppose as consent to grant the motion, the Court is not prepared to do so in this instance. As the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized, \"[r]estricting access to the courts is ... a serious matter,\" especially because it implicates \"a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Ringgold-Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152081\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/1057/#p1061\">\n    761 F.3d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Delew v.

The Court\n   <strong>\n    defers\n   </strong>\n   ruling on Kashl's motion requesting order declaring plaintiff a vexatious litigant in light of Plaintiff's failure to oppose. (ECF No. 3.) In the meantime, the Court\n   <strong>\n    orders Plaintiff to show cause\n   </strong>\n   why she should not be labeled a vexatious litigant by\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     February 1, 2019\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .
