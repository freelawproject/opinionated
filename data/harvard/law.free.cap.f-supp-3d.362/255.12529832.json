(\"Merck\") to compel each individual plaintiff to arbitration and to\n   stay these proceedings pending such arbitrations. For the reasons which we explain in the pages which follow, the motion shall be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As averred in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Sugartown Pediatrics, LLC and Schwartz Pediatrics S.C.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this lawsuit \"challenges Merck's anticompetitive vaccine bundling scheme whereby Merck leverages its monopoly power in multiple pediatric vaccine markets to maintain its monopoly power in the Rotavirus Vaccine Market and, consequently, to charge supracompetitive prices to purchasers of its rotavirus vaccines.\" (Consol. Am. Compl., \u00b6 2). In essence, Plaintiffs allege that as to its RotaTeq Rotavirus vaccine, instead of lowering the price which it was charging when it held 100% of the Rotavirus market, Merck responded to the entry of GlaxoSmithKline's competing vaccine, Rotarix, by adding an \"exclusionary RotaTeq Bundled Loyalty Condition to its [buying] contracts, thereby bundling RotaTeq with its other pediatric vaccines.\" (Consol. Am. Compl., \u00b6 s112, 114-115). In so doing, Plaintiffs aver that Merck penalized any of its customers who would buy Rotarix from GSK by forcing them to pay substantially higher prices for all of the vaccines in the Merck Bundle, including those for which Merck is the sole seller. (Consol. Am. Compl., \u00b6 116). Plaintiffs allege that they suffered anti-trust injury because they, like most physicians, practices and hospitals, purchase the vaccines which they administer to their patients through Physician Buying Groups (\"PBGs\") and Merck has effectively co-opted the PBGs to impose and enforce its anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct with the result that they and the proposed class members have repeatedly paid artificially inflated prices for rotavirus vaccines since Rotarix entered the market and continuing through the present. (Consol. Am. Compl., \u00b6 s 117-120, 145-149).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   By the motion that is now before us, Merck seeks to stay this matter and compel Plaintiffs to submit its claims to arbitration on the basis of arbitration clauses contained within Merck's contracts with the three Physician Buying Groups through which Plaintiffs purchased their vaccines. Those clauses are virtually identical in all three of the contracts at issue and read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the performance, construction, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement shall, if not resolved through negotiations between the parties, be submitted to mandatory binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1\n   <em>\n    et. seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs rejoin that this matter should\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be submitted to arbitration because they were not signatories to any agreements directly with Merck and the agreements which\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   entered into with the Physician Buying Groups of which they were members did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contain any such clauses requiring submission of any of their disputes to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    A.
