BRACK, SENIOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Petrona Gaspar-Miguel's appeal from the judgment and conviction entered by Magistrate Judge Gregory B. Wormuth on August 27, 2018. (Doc. 35.) Defendant was found guilty of illegal entry without inspection in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Doc. 37 at 119.) She appeals\n   her conviction on the ground that the Magistrate Judge incorrectly applied the law regarding the definition of \"entry\" and the doctrine of official restraint, and under a correct application of the law the evidence does not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that she entered the United States. The issue of whether continuous government surveillance constitutes official restraint in criminal immigration proceedings has not been squarely addressed by the Tenth Circuit. It has also recently become a pivotal issue in many criminal entry and reentry cases in this District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' arguments, the history of the doctrine, and all relevant case law, the Court finds that continuous surveillance by law enforcement during the crossing of an international border does not constitute constructive official restraint. Thus, the judgment of the United States Magistrate Judge finding Defendant guilty of entry without inspection in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n   <strong>\n    is affirmed\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts Preceding the Charge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Petrona Gaspar-Miguel is a citizen of Guatemala. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96.) On June 17, 2018, Defendant was arrested after crossing the international boundary line between the United States and Mexico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45.) That afternoon, Border Patrol Agent Stephen Salcido was on \"line watch duty\" in Sunland Park, New Mexico, monitoring the area for illegal entries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) At approximately 12:20 p.m., Agent Salcido was watching the border area through binoculars when he \"observed some movement moving northbound from the international boundary line.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Agent Salcido referred to the area he was observing as \"the end of the fence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The fence runs along the international border in Sunland Park but ends near Mount Cristo Rey because the terrain in that area prevents the fence from continuing up the mountain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Agent Salcido \"observed the tail-end of some movement coming across the end of the fence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) He then \"relayed that to [his] partners in the field and they responded and encountered some individuals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When asked to clarify, Agent Salcido reiterated that he saw the movement \"coming around the end of the fence there and moving in a northbound direction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On direct examination, when asked if \"it [would] be fair to say that [he] maintained constant surveillance on the individuals[,]\" Agent Salcido responded, \"yes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Agent Salcido alerted other agents by radio that several individuals had crossed the international border, Border Patrol Agent Roberto Tellez responded to the location and apprehended three individuals, including Defendant and her son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) Through his binoculars, Agent Salcido observed Agent Tellez drive up to the individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) A \"[c]ouple of minutes\" elapsed between Agent Tellez receiving the radio message and reaching the individuals who were, by that time, in the United States and approximately 50-75 yards north of the border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.) The individuals did not run from Agent Tellez or attempt to escape. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.) Each of the three individuals told Agent Tellez that they were citizens of Guatemala, did not have documents to stay in the United States legally, and had just crossed the border illegally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.) Border Patrol Agent Victor Ramirez then responded to the scene in a transport van and transported the individuals to the Santa Teresa Border Patrol Station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the station, Agent Ramirez began processing Defendant, which included collecting and recording her biographical information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48.) Agent Ramirez determined that she had never been deported nor did she have any other immigration or criminal history in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-79.) The next day, Border Patrol Agent Robert De Anda finished processing Defendant at the station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-64.) Based on their conversation, Agent De Anda \"stamped 'credible fear claim' on her paperwork.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) This indicated that, following the conclusion of any criminal proceedings against Defendant, she would be interviewed by an asylum officer regarding her claim of credible fear in Guatemala. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant testified that she feared for her life in Guatemala because she had a child with a married man and the man's wife threatened her and her son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91.) Defendant also testified that the man's wife had paid someone to sexually assault her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant paid an individual to guide her and her son to the U.S.-Mexico border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96.) \"My goal was to enter the United States and ask for help.... [S]ince I didn't know where one enters, that's why I entered like that during the day, so that they could find me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92-93.) Defendant testified that she did not try to elude agents at the border: \"I didn't try to hide. I crossed in broad the [sic] daylight and I did not hide and I did not run. I thought, thank God that they're here, they found me.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93.) Defendant's brother is a United States citizen who lives in Kentucky, and she stated that if she were permitted to remain in the United States she would like to live and work in Kentucky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bench Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was charged with improper entry without inspection, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), for \"enter[ing] and attempt[ing] to enter the United States at a time and place other than as designated by Immigration Officers.\" (Doc. 1 at 1.) The Honorable Gregory B. Wormuth, United States Magistrate Judge, held a bench trial and motions hearing in the matter on August 27, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37.) After the parties elicited the facts surrounding Defendant's border crossing and subsequent apprehension as described above, Defendant moved for a directed verdict based on the official restraint doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant asserted that because the agents had kept her under constant surveillance while she crossed the border, she was under constructive official restraint the entire time and thus had not \"entered\" the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"[T]he Government [ ] failed to prove Ms. Gaspar was guilty of entry into the United States without inspection and the proper charge was attempted entry without inspection.\" (Doc. 40 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 98-99.) Defendant next argued that attempted improper entry is a specific intent crime, and thus the Government had not met its evidentiary burden for that charge either because the evidence showed that she had the specific intent to seek asylum, not the specific intent to enter the United States illegally and evade law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 37 at 98-99; 40 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government disputed the application of the official restraint doctrine in the Tenth Circuit and argued that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant met the three elements necessary for a conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) : (1) she was a citizen of Guatemala without authorization to enter the United States; (2) she entered or attempted to enter the United States; and (3) she entered the United States at a time or place other than as designated by immigration officers. (Doc. 37 at 111-12.) Though the Government asserted that it does not believe the official restraint doctrine applies in this District to define \"entry\" in criminal immigration cases, it argued in the alternative that, even if the Court accepted the official restraint doctrine and concept of surveillance as official restraint and proceeded on a theory of attempted entry, the evidence proves that Defendant had the specific intent to evade law enforcement and travel to Kentucky to reunite with her brother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both parties noted that, the week before, United States Magistrate Judge Stephen R. Vidmar acquitted a defendant charged with entry without inspection on the theory that the defendant had been under Border Patrol surveillance the entire time he crossed the international border. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100-01);\n   <em>\n    see also United States v. Akana-By Komlan Adjeodar\n   </em>\n   , 2:18-po-02620-CG, Tr. Bench Trial at 6:3-12:19 (Aug. 24, 2018). In that case, Judge Vidmar opined that the Tenth Circuit would likely adopt the doctrine of official restraint.\n   <em>\n    Adjeodar\n   </em>\n   , 2:18-po-02620-CG, Tr. Bench Trial at 6:3-9:20. At the close of Defendant's bench trial, however, Judge Wormuth rejected the idea of surveillance as official restraint, explaining that he was \"not persuaded in any fashion that surveillance, particularly surveillance unknown to an individual, can constitute official restraint within any meaning of that word.\" (Doc. 37 at 117.) He held that, as a result, the undisputed evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant's actions met all three required elements of the crime of entry without inspection in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19.) Defendant was convicted and sentenced to time served. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on September 6, 2018. (Doc. 35 at 1.) Defendant argues that, if the official restraint doctrine is properly applied, she is not guilty of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which makes it a crime to \"enter[ ] or attempt[ ] to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers.\" She asserts that her appeal should be granted for two reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   First, she did not \"enter\" the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 1325(a) because she was under official restraint from the time of her entry until her arrest. Second, she did not \"attempt\" to enter the United States because she did not have the specific intent to enter the United States free of official restraint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. 40 at 10.) As previously stated, only the first theory-that Defendant did not \"enter\" the United States-is properly before the Court on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues that \"[f]or immigration purposes, 'entry' is a term of art requiring not only physical presence in the United States but also freedom from official restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Argueta-Rosales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253901\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1149/#p1158\">\n    819 F.3d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1158 (9th Cir. 2016) ).) Citing cases from nine circuits that have defined \"entry\" in the immigration context, she asserts that \"all the courts that have decided what conduct comprises an 'entry' have concluded that physical presence in the country is required, as well as freedom from official restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (collecting cases).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant also argues that \"[t]he law is well-settled that surveillance, whether known or unknown to the defendant, is sufficient to constitute official restraint that prevents an 'entry' within the meaning of the immigration laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) For this proposition, Defendant cites various civil immigration decisions (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (collecting cases) ), as well as\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gonzalez-Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11407320\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/594/\">\n    309 F.3d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2002), a case affirming that in the Ninth Circuit, surveillance constitutes constructive official restraint in criminal immigration proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 40 at 12.) She then argues that, while the Tenth Circuit has not explicitly adopted the concept of surveillance as official restraint, the Tenth Circuit will likely do so based on its reasoning in the unpublished decision\n   <em>\n    United States v. Encinas-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and Judge Vidmar's conclusions in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Adjeodar.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11407320\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/594/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Encinas-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , No. 99-2064,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20547972\">\n    1999 WL 547972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.N.M. July 28, 1999) ;\n   <em>\n    Adjeodar\n   </em>\n   , 2:18-po-02620-CG).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Government argues in response that the Tenth Circuit has declined to adopt the doctrine of official restraint and associated concept of surveillance as constructive official restraint, and should not do so now. (Doc. 44 at 7.) The Government makes five distinct arguments against application of the official restraint doctrine in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20547972\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) First, it argues that the concept of official restraint as an element of \"entry\" was a civil immigration concept that should never have been applied in the criminal context. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-13.) Second, the Court should not adopt the doctrine of official restraint because \"Congress expressly excised 'entry' from the [Immigration and Nationality Act] to destroy the entry fiction[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16) Third, the Ninth Circuit's continued interpretation of the official restraint doctrine in the criminal context to include continuous surveillance is radical and cuts against \"Congress's express intent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fourth, the Government argues that the Tenth Circuit and federal courts in the District of New Mexico have \"declined to apply\" the doctrine of official restraint and constructive surveillance in criminal entry and reentry cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20547972\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 19-21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Encinas-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20547972\">\n    1999 WL 547972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

May 14, 2008) ).) Finally, the Government argues that adopting the doctrine of official restraint through surveillance in the criminal immigration context can and will produce absurd results, from discouraging \"vigilant border surveillance\" to overburdening the Tenth Circuit with \"a never-ending current of cases asking precisely which types of surveillance qualify as restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This appeal requires the Court to answer two questions: (1) does the definition of \"entry\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) require freedom from official restraint? and (2) if so, does continuous surveillance by law enforcement personnel constitute constructive official restraint?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government's argument in this appeal rests in large part on the idea that \"freedom from official restraint\" was only ever meant to be considered an element of \"entry\" in\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   immigration proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 7-13, 18-19.) This argument has been advanced by other opponents of the official restraint doctrine, including Judge Bybee of the Ninth Circuit in his dissent in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Argueta-Rosales\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

Official restraint, after all, was designed to answer the question whether an alien in custody ... was to be afforded minimal procedural rights or plenary rights\"). According to the Government, then, when Congress amended the INA to remove the technical definition of \"entry\" and the distinction between civil exclusion and deportation proceedings, it meant to excise the elusive question of what constitutes \"entry\" from all immigration statutes, both civil and criminal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 13-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Pub. L. No. 104-208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%203009\">\n    110 Stat. 3009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (September 30, 1996). The IIRIRA made various amendments to the INA, including changes aimed at ensuring that whether an alien had perfected their \"entry\" into the United States was no longer the pivotal factor in determining what procedural protections they would receive in civil immigration proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 13-14.) In doing so, the IIRIRA replaced the term \"entry\" in the definitions section of the INA with the term \"admitted.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) As the Government explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The IIRIRA sought, among its various aims, to terminate future litigation over entry as the lynchpin for determining the procedural due process rights of aliens. The House Judiciary Committee, in its report on the bill, explicitly stated as much, reporting that it \"intended to replace certain aspects of the current 'entry doctrine,' under which illegal aliens who have entered the United States without inspection gain equities and privileges in immigration proceedings that are not available to aliens who present themselves for inspection at a port of entry.\" H.R. REP. 104-469, pt. 1 at 225. To that end, the committee sought to convert the \"pivotal factor in determining an alien's status\" to a determination of \"whether or not the alien has been lawfully admitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Government asserts that this legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to eliminate the \"entry\n   fiction\" in all respects. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) However, the language it relies on actually indicates that the House Judiciary Committee sought to eliminate only \"certain aspects of the current 'entry doctrine' \"-the aspects in which the distinction had been used in civil proceedings \"in determining an alien's status.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting H.R. REP. 104-469, pt. 1 at 225).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court agrees with the Government and Congress that the manner in which the \"entry doctrine\" evolved had created manifest unfairness in civil removal proceedings prior to 1996. Aliens who successfully completed an unlawful entry by evading law enforcement were afforded the full panoply of procedural due process rights under the INA, while those who either failed to evade inspection or never attempted to evade law enforcement in the first place were more quickly deported without due process protections. In the criminal context, however, as the Government helpfully points out, the issue of due process protections was never the purpose of defining \"entry.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (\"In criminal proceedings, that distinction is mere chimera, as aliens receive the same panoply of constitutional due process protections as any U.S. citizen.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Instead, the need to define the term \"entry\" in the criminal context arises not when determining what procedural rights to provide defendants, but in determining when and how to charge individuals accused of violating the law. In cases where an individual physically crossed onto American soil at an official port, checkpoint, or the like, but is apprehended before having the chance to continue on into the country at large, the official restraint doctrine logically dictates that they have not unlawfully \"entered\" the United States in violation of our nation's criminal immigration statutes but may still have attempted \"entry.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826212\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/96/\">\n    740 F.3d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant could not have \"entered\" while in handcuffs);\n   <em>\n    Vasilatos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"557636\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/209/195/\">\n    209 F.2d at 196-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant \"entered\" when he was allowed to pass through the port after misleading an inspection officer about his immigration history);\n   <em>\n    Angeles-Mascote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454849\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/529/#p531\">\n    206 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant had not \"entered\" when he approached a port of entry at a United States airport, presented an alien registration card, and was subsequently arrested). Such applications of the official restraint doctrine to define \"entry\" in criminal cases do not affect the defendants' due process rights, nor do they make the issue of successful \"entry\" a \"pivotal factor in determining [their] status\"-the issues Congress was concerned with when amending the INA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 14.) Instead, they utilize the common-law definition of \"entry\" to determine what criminal immigration provisions an individual may have violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that the IIRIRA sought to remove the element of \"freedom from official restraint\" from the longstanding definition of \"entry\" under the INA, for the term \"entry\" still appears frequently in the INA even after the IIRIRA removed it from certain sections.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (13)(A) (the new definition of \"admission\" and \"admitted\" is: \"with respect to an alien, the lawful\n   <em>\n    entry\n   </em>\n   of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer\") (emphasis added);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201825\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1826. It appears that the IIRIRA aimed not to change the definition of \"entry\" itself, but to eliminate the need to establish \"entry\" at all in certain civil removability proceedings where such determinations had become problematic. The Court thus finds that, where \"entry\" remains a determinative element of an immigration statute, freedom from official restraint remains a required element of \"entry.\" Where this doctrine\n   has become problematic, however, is in the increasingly broad definition of what actually constitutes official restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

On its face, this explanation makes sense. Law enforcement personnel must constantly make nuanced determinations about when, where, and how to apprehend individuals suspected of violating the law. What the Sixth Circuit doesn't explain in this hypothetical is why, despite the wisdom of following an individual to obtain more information before apprehending him, that individual is suddenly no longer considered to have entered the United States simply because agents watched him do so. When police set up sting operations to catch car thieves, clandestinely surveilling the \"bait car\" throughout the operation, an individual who successfully steals the bait car is not somehow innocent of the crime simply because law enforcement watched the entire sequence of events unfold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Fifth Circuit, after appearing to endorse surveillance as constructive restraint in a criminal case that did not turn on the issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In upholding the conviction, the Tenth Circuit explained that the district court \"noted that a 'sheer lack of evidence [did] leave a reasonable doubt as to whether the group actually 'entered' the United States such that they were free from official restraint in the form of surveillance.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866024\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1222/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866024\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/687/1222/\">\n    at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the Tenth Circuit avoided the issue because it found that proving an alien had \"entered\" the United States was not a required element of the charged crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015497\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/709/1152/#p1165\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though the Tenth Circuit did not reject the doctrine entirely in\n   <em>\n    Franco-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds it likely that, given the Fifth Circuit's well-articulated concerns about the concept of surveillance as official restraint and the Ninth Circuit's unique position applying the doctrine in criminal cases, the Tenth Circuit will decline to adopt the concept of surveillance as constructive restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Government's final argument against adopting the doctrine-that it will lead to absurd results-is perhaps the most compelling. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 21.) The Court finds it unlikely that Border Patrol agents, having learned of the doctrine of constructive official restraint, would cease vigilantly patrolling the border simply to ensure that individuals crossing illegally could be charged with unlawful entry rather than attempted unlawful entry. However, adopting this doctrine would certainly provide agents a perverse incentive to conduct surveillance at points where the actual border itself is not visible, to allow aliens to spend more time in the United States before apprehending them, or even to be less than truthful about the extent of their surveillance efforts leading up to an apprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Prosecutors too could adapt to the doctrine by simply charging individuals who remain under surveillance while crossing the border with\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   unlawful entry-an offense under the same statutory provision that carries the same penalty as unlawful entry. However, it seems incongruous\n   at best to base a criminal charging decision on an in-depth analysis of the arresting agent's actions leading up to the apprehension, rather than the actions of the potential defendant. It would also undoubtedly mean, as the Government points out, that courts in the Tenth Circuit would suddenly, and in perpetuity, be faced with an influx of cases requiring them to determine which specific factual scenarios constitute constructive official restraint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This much is clear from the myriad Ninth Circuit decisions making hair splitting determinations about whether a unique set of facts constitutes official restraint through surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11407320\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/594/\">\n    309 F.3d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[a]lthough he lost sight of them for moments at a time, Agent Watkins observed the suspects continuously\" and thus the defendant was under official restraint),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Castro-Juarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=715%20F.%20App%27x%20636\">\n    715 F. App'x 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 637 (9th Cir. 2017) (\"[a]lthough he conceded that his memory of the event was vague,\" the agent who first spotted the defendant on a security camera surveilling the border was \" 'pretty certain' that the first time he saw\" the defendant he was already on the United States side of the border and was thus not under official restraint). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 44 at 22 (collecting cases illustrating the nuanced and voluminous body of case law that the Ninth Circuit has developed as result of adopting the doctrine of surveillance as official restraint-for example, a seismic sensor does not constitute official restraint while a night scope does, etc.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Proponents of the doctrine will argue that if an alien who is surveilled while crossing the border truly has the intent to unlawfully enter and evade law enforcement, she will be found guilty under \u00a7 1325 if properly charged with attempted entry and will then face the same consequences as if she had been convicted of entry. Only if an alien apprehended under official restraint could prove she did not commit the crime of\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   entry would she be acquitted. This is the crux of Defendant's argument on appeal: she did not actually enter the United States, so she should have had an opportunity to rebut the correct charge of attempted entry by proving that she had the specific intent to seek out law enforcement and ask for asylum, not the specific intent to unlawfully enter the United States and evade law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is certainly possible that, had the Government charged Defendant with attempt or had the Magistrate Judge entertained those arguments, she would still have been convicted of violating \u00a7 1325. Still, as Judge Bybee laments in his analysis of the state of affairs in the Ninth Circuit, \"this novel and unduly expansive definition of 'official restraint' makes no sense and creates a puzzling loophole in the law of attempted illegal [ ]entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Argueta-Rosales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253901\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1149/#p1158\">\n    819 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bybee, J., dissenting). Under this doctrine, \"an alien is not guilty of attempted illegal [ ]entry even if he crosses into the United States surreptitiously and outside a port of entry, so long as he tells border control that he came in hopes of remaining under restraint by any government official.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253901\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1149/#p1158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, as Agent De Anda stamped \"credible fear\" on Defendant's processing paperwork and acknowledged that she claimed fear of violence as her reason for leaving Guatemala, Defendant will have the opportunity to make her claim for asylum before an immigration judge in a completely separate legal proceeding from the one now before the Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 82-83.) Whether or not she crossed the border free from official restraint will not factor into any determination of what procedural and due process protections she is afforded during this\n   civil proceeding, nor will it affect the merits of her asylum claim. The only issue before the Court in this appeal is whether Defendant violated a\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   immigration law-improper entry without inspection in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -when, lacking valid authorization to enter or remain in the United States, she acted affirmatively and of her own free will to walk from Mexico around the \"end of the fence\" into the United States. Defendant's asylum claim is unrelated to the criminal charge here, and the Court declines to adopt a peculiar and logic-defying legal fiction that would blur the lines between criminal immigration charges and asylum claims. Indeed, at a time when asylum claims at ports of entry and across the border are on the rise, conflating the distinct civil and criminal immigration proceedings laid out in the INA will only further convolute an already overburdened and underfunded immigration system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The law is full of difficult and often imperfectly drawn lines, and there is no better example of this than the doctrine of official restraint. This doctrine carries a tortured history-having evolved haphazardly from use in civil immigration proceedings to deny aliens due process, to use in criminal immigration proceedings, and culminating in an absurdly broad definition of \"official restraint\" in some circuits that includes surveillance. The Ninth Circuit's application of the doctrine has led to a tortured result-case upon case requiring courts to determine just which types of sophisticated surveillance technology constitute official restraint. If Congress sees fit to clean up this issue by more fully and clearly amending the INA and the definition of \"entry\" in its various provisions, it can and will do so. But unless Congress prescribes otherwise, the Court will not extend this tortured result to the Tenth Circuit by adopting the position that continuous surveillance amounts to official government restraint negating \"entry\" in criminal immigration proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons described above, the Court finds that freedom from official restraint is a required element of \"entry\" in the immigration context, but that continuous surveillance by law enforcement does not qualify as \"official restraint\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
