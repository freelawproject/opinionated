Idaho residents Kasey Jorgensen and Michael Hill are employed by Union Pacific; each was injured during the course and scope of his employment while working outside the state of Idaho. Each sued Union Pacific in a separate action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , which provides remedies in the form of money damages for on-the-job injuries incurred by employees not covered by state workers' compensation\n   laws. Union Pacific moves to dismiss, claiming the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. Fed. Rule Civ. P. 12(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court consolidated the matters for the purpose of determining the virtually identical motions to dismiss, and finds the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record without the need for oral argument. Dist. Idaho Loc. Civ. R. 7.1(d). After carefully considering the parties' briefs and pertinent authorities, the Court issues the following decision denying both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Michael Hill\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Michael Hill is a resident and citizen of the state of Idaho, and he has been employed by Union Pacific in Twin Falls, Idaho, since 2001. On December 16, 2016, he was employed as a gang machinist. Although he resides in Twin Falls, Hill is required to travel outside the state of Idaho for work on behalf of Union Pacific. Hill receives his assignments from Union Pacific in Idaho, and his work is overseen in Idaho. Hill receives his paycheck from Union Pacific in the state of Idaho, and he receives work benefits from Union Pacific in the state of Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 16, 2016, Union Pacific assigned Hill work from Twin Falls, Idaho, and he reported to work in Kansas. Hill alleges he did not have the proper equipment to remove a wheel off an axle from a tie crane, and he was forced to use a sledge hammer instead. While swinging the sledge hammer, he injured his shoulder and bicep, and suffered injuries. Hill returned to Idaho and received the majority of his medical treatment for his injuries in the Twin Falls area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Kasey Jorgensen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jorgensen is a resident and citizen of the state of Idaho, and he has been employed by Union Pacific in Pocatello, Idaho, since 2011. Although he resides in Pocatello, Jorgensen is required to travel outside the state for work on behalf of Union Pacific. Like Hill, Jorgensen receives his assignments from Union Pacific in the state of Idaho, and his work is overseen in the state of Idaho. When he travels from Pocatello to the place he is assigned to work, Union Pacific reimburses him for his travel expenses. Jorgensen receives his paycheck from Union Pacific in the state of Idaho, and he receives work benefits from Union Pacific in the state of Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 7, 2017, Jorgensen was working for Union Pacific as a roadway machinist/heavy equipment mechanic. After receiving his work assignment in Pocatello, he reported to work in Wyoming. While troubleshooting a fuel truck together with the driver of the truck, Jorgensen checked under the hood. The truck driver slammed the hood down, hitting Jorgensen between the shoulder blades and causing physical injuries. Jorgensen received all of his medical treatment for his injuries in the Pocatello area after the accident when he returned to Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Union Pacific\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Union Pacific is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters and principal place of business located in Omaha, Nebraska, where it also operates a central operations center for train dispatching and network operations monitoring. Union Pacific operates in twenty-three states, with a total rail system of 32,122 miles. Of its 32,122 miles of rail trackage, 848 miles, or 2.64% of its total rail system, are located in Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Union Pacific employs 41,000 people. Of those employees, eight hundred employees, or 1.95% of the company's total workforce, are employed in the state of Idaho. Plaintiffs are two of these eight hundred employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although both Hill and Jorgensen testified in their affidavits that Union Pacific assigns work to them in Twin Falls and Pocatello, respectively, it is not clear whether Union Pacific maintains offices or specific work sites in the state of Idaho. Union Pacific is authorized by the Secretary of State to transact business in the state of Idaho, and it is currently registered to do so. Decl. of Gabiola Ex. A. (Dkt. 18-2.) Union Pacific maintains a registered agent for service of process in the state of Idaho as well. Decl. of Gabiola Ex. B.

In\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   , a North Dakota resident employed by the BNSF Railway Company as a conductor sued in a Montana state court for injuries he sustained while working for BNSF in Amarillo, Texas. BNSF is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Texas. The Supreme Court considered only whether Montana had general jurisdiction over BNSF, and held that it did not, because the plaintiff's claims were unrelated to any activity by the plaintiff or BNSF occurring in Montana.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604332\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1549/#p1553\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff resided in Kansas, and worked as a conductor employee for BNSF. The plaintiff was hired by BNSF in Kansas, assigned work in and from Kansas, and was required to report for work in Kansas. On June 10, 2013, he reported to work in Kansas. The following day, the plaintiff was working as a conductor in BNSF's Amarillo, Texas, yard, and suffered injuries upon being thrown from a gondola car to the ground. The plaintiff traveled back to Kansas and his work ended for the day in Kansas, several hours after he was injured in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Overfelt sued BNSF in the District of Kansas, alleging that his injuries arose out of his employment relationship with BNSF. The court held that it could exercise specific jurisdiction over BNSF, because BNSF had substantial connections with Kansas related to the plaintiff's cause of action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201045477\">\n    2016 WL 1045477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3. Specifically, the court found that BNSF created the contact with Kansas as it \"became an employer of an individual in the state of Kansas,\" and the plaintiff was trained, supervised, and assigned work in Kansas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201045477\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finding that the plaintiff's injuries arose \"out of his employment relationship with Defendant and the injuries he sustained during his employment with Defendant and while on the job,\" the court found that BNSF purposefully directed activities toward the state of Kansas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court found that minimum contacts existed to satisfy specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court did not address the reasonableness factor, as BNSF did not raise the\n   issue and therefore failed to meet its burden.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   persuasive. Here, much like\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   , Union Pacific employed Plaintiffs in Idaho, they reported for work in Idaho, they received their paychecks in Idaho, and Union Pacific employees directed their work activities in Idaho. Union Pacific employs approximately eight hundred employees in Idaho and has a registered agent for service of process in Idaho. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   , Union Pacific created the contact with Idaho as it became the employer of several hundred individuals, including Hill and Jorgensen, in the state of Idaho. By hiring Idaho residents, and receiving in return certain benefits, privileges, or protections from Idaho in connection with Plaintiffs' employment, the traditional \"quid pro quo justification for finding purposeful availment\" exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p800\">\n    374 F.3d at 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, \"but for\" the employment relationship with Union Pacific, Plaintiffs' injuries would not have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Union Pacific does not dispute the nature and extent of its contacts with both Hill and Jorgensen in connection with their employment in the state of Idaho. Unlike the facts in\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   , both Hill and Jorgensen allege injury related to Union Pacific's business activities in Idaho as their employer, despite the location of the accidents that resulted in physical injuries in each case. Plaintiffs point to more than their residency in Idaho to satisfy the requirements for specific jurisdiction-specifically, their respective employment relationships with Union Pacific formed in Idaho, their receipt of work assignments in Idaho, and their receipt of work-related compensation and benefits in Idaho. Here, the business Union Pacific does in Idaho is sufficient to subject Union Pacific to specific jurisdiction in Idaho, as the claims arise out of Plaintiffs' employment relationship (or contract as alleged by Plaintiffs) with Union Pacific in Idaho. Moreover, there would be no question the Court could exercise personal jurisdiction over Union Pacific had Plaintiffs been injured in Idaho while working for Union Pacific; that they were assigned work elsewhere is of no consequence under the facts here and as supported by the holding in\n   <em>\n    Overfelt.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Union Pacific argues the Court should not rely upon\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   , because the case was decided prior to\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   and therefore preempted. However, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   , because\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   decided the issue of specific jurisdiction, while\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   did not. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   specifically noted that, in certain cases where claims are brought related to the railroad's business in a particular state, such might be sufficient to subject the railroad to specific personal jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604332\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1549/#p1553\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The two holdings are consistent, as\n   <em>\n    Overfelt\n   </em>\n   found that BNSF's activities in Kansas, where it employed the plaintiff, were sufficient to subject the railroad to specific personal jurisdiction there, while the\n   <em>\n    Tyrrell\n   </em>\n   Court decided Montana could not exercise general jurisdiction over BNSF when neither the plaintiff nor the claim had any connection to Montana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, the Court has persuasive authority of its own in a similar case.

Idaho Mar. 9, 2010), the Court found the first two prongs of the specific jurisdiction test were satisfied when an out-of-state corporation hired an Idaho resident as its employee. In that case, the plaintiff met his burden of showing that the defendant's conduct satisfied both the purposeful availment and relatedness prongs, because the employer hired an Idaho resident; paid local union dues to the local union in Idaho; paid wages and taxes to Idaho; advertised its services to Idaho companies; and the plaintiff's cause of action arose out of the employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheets v.
