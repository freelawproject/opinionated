Both statutes prohibit \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   person\" - which includes attorneys - from intentionally using or disclosing \"the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication\" in violation of the statutes.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202511\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added); Va.

Because the statutes explicitly apply to \"any person,\" not just government officials, it clearly follows from\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   that non-government attorneys also cannot use improperly intercepted communications in court. In reaching its holding in\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit explicitly considered and rejected the argument that the impeachment exception required the court to recognize another exception that would have allowed the government attorneys to use the illegal recordings as evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643150\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/887/#p888\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643150\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/887/#p888\">\n    at 891-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   therefore suggests that the Fourth Circuit would not recognize a litigation privilege exception to the wiretapping statutes' prohibitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Recognizing a litigation privilege or immunity would also violate the clear purpose underlying the wiretapping statutes.

Plaintiff Sufficiently Pled that Defendant Lawyers Had Reason to Know the Information Was Obtained in Violation of the Wiretapping Statutes.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the alternative, Defendant Lawyers argue Plaintiff failed to state a claim that Defendant Lawyers violated the wiretapping statutes because Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Defendant Lawyers knew or had reason to know that the information they used in the divorce proceedings was obtained through an unauthorized wiretap. However, Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to show that Defendant Lawyers were at least on inquiry notice that the information their client shared was obtained through an unauthorized wiretap. Plaintiffs wife knew very specific details about Plaintiff's conversations with his romantic partner and attorney. Given the private nature of the conversations' content and the estrangement between Plaintiff and his wife, Defendant Lawyers should have at least suspected that none of the parties involved consented to their conversations being intercepted. Indeed, Defendant Lawyers were allegedly told their client was suspected of having electronically surveilled Plaintiff without his permission and asked in discovery responses to provide discovery related to that surveillance. Plaintiff has thus alleged sufficient facts supporting a plausible claim that Defendant Lawyers used the information disclosed \"knowing or having reason to know\" that the information had been obtained in violation of the wiretapping statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Defendant Lawyers ask the Court to strike the portions of the Amended Complaint alleging that the Defendant Lawyers violated the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct because any violation of such rules \"is irrelevant and immaterial in a civil claim.\" Dkt. 39 at 8. To the contrary. Defendant Lawyers' ethical\n   and professional obligations are relevant to whether Defendant Lawyers should have known that the information was obtained through an unauthorized wiretap. As a result, the Court will not strike the portions of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint referring to Defendant Lawyers' ethical and professional obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Wiretapping Claims Against Family Defendants.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Family Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts linking them to his wife's alleged recordings. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Derek Hampton had the tools and skill that would have allowed Plaintiff's wife and Family Defendants to intercept his communications. Am. Compl. \u00b6 20. Plaintiff then alleges that he has viewed emails in which the Family Defendants discussed the recorded conversations and circulated a journal, authored by Defendant Richards, in which the Family Defendants took turns transcribing the contents of Plaintiffs intercepted communications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 35-38. Plaintiff has thus alleged facts supporting a plausible claim that Family Defendants participated in illegally recording Plaintiff's conversations and disclosing the contents of those conversations to others. The fact that Plaintiff makes most of these allegations \"on information and belief\" does not provide a basis to dismiss the claims because the facts that would establish whether Family Defendants were involved in intercepting and disclosing Plaintiff's communications \"are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant[s]\" and there is \"factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v.

The Hamptons argue Plaintiff failed to allege any facts raising a reasonable inference that the Hamptons installed a keystroke logger on his computer or reviewed his financial or identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff has pled the elements of Counts III and IV \"on information and belief,\" but has also alleged facts and attached exhibits that provide factual support for his allegations.

As argued above, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that each of the Defendants were involved in the interception and/or use or disclosure of the contents of his private communications. He has also alleged facts that, if true, could lead a reasonable jury to determine that each Defendant knew or should have known that Plaintiff's communications were intercepted without his authorization in violation of the wiretapping statutes. It is common knowledge that an individual would suffer emotional distress by learning that his communications with his attorney and romantic partner were intercepted, shared, and used against him in his divorce.
