BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This litigation originated in the Eastern District of Missouri when NTD I, LLC (\"NTD\" and \"General Partner\"), North Tower Development, LLC, and Paul Weismann (\"Weismann\") (collectively \"Plaintiffs\" and \"Counterclaim Defendants\") filed a complaint on August 1, 2016, asserting various claims against Alliant Asset Management Company, LLC, Alliant Capital, Ltd., Alliant Credit Facility, Ltd., Alliant Credit Facility ALP, LLC, Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd., and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC (collectively \"Defendants\" and \"Counterclaim Plaintiffs\") related to a Limited Partnership Agreement (\"LPA\") between the parties. ECF 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2006, Water Tower Place Limited Partnership (the \"Partnership\") was formed, pursuant to an Amended and Restated LPA, for the general purpose of constructing, rehabilitating, and operating affordable housing apartment units to qualify for federal and state low-income housing tax credits. Water Tower Place is located in Saint Louis, Missouri, and is comprised of 178 residential housing units in 34 buildings. The project was financed by a 2006 issuance of Multifamily Housing Revenue Bonds that provide federal and state low-income housing tax credits. Water Tower Place must meet regulatory provisions\n   through 2020 to remain housing tax credit qualified. Housing tax credits are contingent on Water Tower Place maintaining occupant eligibility, and/or unit gross rent compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The claims asserted by Plaintiffs in their Complaint [1] are: Count I, for declaratory judgment reducing the Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd. and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC's (collectively \"Limited Partners\") interests to zero; Count II, for declaratory judgment excusing Weismann from surety obligations; Count III, for breach of contract to recover the Limited Partners' Capital Contributions; Count IV, excusing Weismann from surety obligations due to the Limited Partners' contract breach; Count V, for damages for the Limited Partners' breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; Count VI\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , for damages for Defendants' tortious interference with, and their inducement of a contract breach; Count VII, for equitable contribution and restitution to Weismann; and Count VIII\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit claiming first, Plaintiffs were the first to breach and therefore precluded from bringing two claims against Defendants, second, only one Plaintiff is a party to the LPA and therefore the rest do not have third-party rights to bring an action, third, Plaintiffs' declaratory relief and equitable claims as well as their tortious interference claims should be dismissed because a party cannot interfere with contracts to which it is not a party, fourth, a parent company cannot be held liable for interference with a subsidiary's contract, fifth, Plaintiffs' claims for monetary damages are precluded by the plain language of the contract, and finally, punitive damages are not allowed in a breach of contract case. ECF 17, 18. Additionally, Defendants argued Plaintiffs' jury demand is invalid because they waived their right to a jury trial in the LPA and Guaranty Agreement contracts. ECF 17, 18. After a hearing, the Court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to Count VII and Count VIII of Plaintiffs' Complaint and granted Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' demand for a jury trial. ECF 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 17, 2017, Defendants answered Plaintiffs' remaining counts and filed a Counterclaim against Plaintiffs NTD and Weismann alleging first, Counterclaim Defendants failed to meet Rental Achievement by December 1, 2008 and therefore Counterclaim Plaintiffs are entitled to declaratory relief, second, alleging a breach of contract and, third, seeking injunctive relief preventing any further withdrawals from the operating deficit reserve account without authorization from the Administrative Limited Partner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 41. Counterclaim Defendants NTD and Weismann answered Counterclaim Plaintiffs' counterclaim on April 4, 2017. ECF 45. On the same day, Counterclaim Plaintiffs moved to join WC Orange, LLC (\"WCO\") as a defendant to their Counterclaim seeking declaratory and injunctive relief related to an allegedly improper sale and purchase of the Partnership indebtedness. ECF 46. Counterclaim Defendants did not object to or oppose the joinder of WCO. ECF 49. Accordingly, the Court granted Counterclaim Plaintiffs' Motion for Joinder of WCO on April 25, 2017. ECF 50. Counterclaim Defendant WCO timely answered. ECF 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 27, 2017, Counterclaim Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Counterclaim\n   alleging four counts against Counterclaim Defendants including two additional claims for breach of contract, a claim alleging a breach of fiduciary duty, and injunctive relief against all three Counterclaim Defendants related to the purchase of certain indebtedness of the Partnership by WCO without the consent of the Administrative Limited Partner. ECF 72. Counterclaim Defendants timely answered on December 18, 2017. ECF 81, 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 22, 2017, Counterclaim Defendants moved for an order enforcing a settlement agreement with Counterclaim Plaintiffs alleging the existence of a valid, binding, and enforceable agreement to settle the action which Counterclaim Plaintiffs breached. ECF 83. Counterclaim Plaintiffs filed a Motion in Opposition alleging the agreement term sheet is not a binding settlement agreement because of the amount of undetermined terms absent in the term sheet, and stating the parties were still in negotiations in an attempt to settle the case. ECF 89. Counterclaim Defendants replied arguing, first, the term sheet unambiguously stated all of the enforceable terms, second, the performance of the agreement obligations were not subject to any conditions precedent, and third, the agreement was definite enough for specific performance. ECF 90. Following oral argument on January 30, 2018, the Court denied the Motion to Enforce the settlement. ECF 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Counterclaim Plaintiffs then sought leave to file a Third Amended Counterclaim; Counterclaim Defendants did not oppose, and leave was granted by the Court on May 7, 2018. ECF 98, 101-103. Counterclaim Plaintiffs' Third Amended Counterclaim alleged two additional counts from the Second Amended Counterclaim. ECF 104. Counterclaim Plaintiffs asserted the following counterclaims: first, declaratory relief against NTD and Weismann stating they failed to cause Rental Achievement as required under the Limited Partnership Agreement; second, breach of contract and injunctive relief against NTD and Weismann for withdrawing funds from the operating deficit reserve account and the replacement reserve account without the approval of the Administrative Limited Partner; third, breach of contract and injunctive relief against NTD, Weismann, and WCO resulting from the purchase of debts of the Partnership without the consent of the Administrative Limited Partner and WCO is related to the General Partner; fourth, breach of fiduciary duty and injunctive relief against NTD, Weismann, and WCO by allowing, participating in, and facilitating the purchase of the Partnership's debt by WCO; fifth, breach of contract and declaratory relief against NTD and Weismann for failure to repair material deficiencies and/or non-conformities in the physical property of Water Tower Place; and finally, breach of contract and specific performance against NTD and Weismann for failure to pay for any development deficits which are incurred by the partnership prior to rental achievement. ECF 104. Counterclaim Defendants timely answered on May 21, 2018. ECF 111, 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counterclaim Defendants then moved for partial summary judgment on Counts III and IV of the Third Amended Counterclaim on May 8, 2018, alleging the LPA did not prohibit WCO from acquiring the debt in the form of a bond and the Counterclaim Defendants did not owe or breach any fiduciary duty. ECF 105, 107. Counterclaim Plaintiffs filed a Motion in Opposition alleging Section 5.5(B) of the LPA precludes WCO from directly or indirectly purchasing debt without the consent of the Limited Partners, the General Partner indirectly acquired the mortgage note without the consent of the Limited Partners, and NTD I, LLC and Weismann owe the Limited Partners a fiduciary duty which\n   prevents this type of behavior. ECF 126. On June 29, 2018, the Court heard arguments on Counterclaim Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. ECF 144. On July 20, 2018, the Court granted summary judgment as to WCO and NTD as to Count III, and for WCO, NTD, and Weismann as to Count IV. ECF 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 22, 2018, Counterclaim Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against Counterclaim Defendants seeking a declaration Weismann and NTD breached fiduciary duties to the Limited Partners, requesting injunctive relief prohibiting WCO from exercising its mortgage rights against Water Tower Place, and imposing a constructive trust upon the mortgage interest. ECF 116, 117. Counterclaim Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition. ECF 123. On June 29, 2018, the Court heard arguments on Counterclaim Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 144. On July 20, 2018, the Court granted Counterclaim Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction stating the balance of factors weighed in favor of granting the preliminary injunction, and Counterclaim Plaintiffs had shown irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits. ECF 148. Additionally, the Court ordered Counterclaim Plaintiffs to post a bond in the amount of $ 100,000.00. ECF 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 10, 2018, Defendants filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment seeking an order, first, granting summary judgment against Plaintiffs as to Counts I-V and VII in Plaintiffs' Complaint, and second, granting partial summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs' allegations Rental Achievement and the Rental Achievement Test have been met. ECF 153. Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum in Opposition on August 31, 2018. ECF 162. On September 14, 2018, Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition. ECF 171. The Motion for Summary Judgment was heard by the Court on October 30, 2018. ECF 180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. UNCONTROVERTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The admissible evidence in the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, establishes the following relevant facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Partnership was formed in 2006 for the general purpose of constructing, renovating, rehabilitating, and operating affordable housing apartment units to qualify for federal and state low-income housing credits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 155, \u00b6 2. The Partnership financed the acquisition and rehabilitation of Water Tower Place by a 2006 issuance of tax-exempt Multifamily Housing Revenue Bonds identified in Schedule A of the LPA to create state and federal low-income tax credits. ECF No. 163, pg. 8 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 172, pg. 36 \u00b6 4. The Bond obligations constitute \"must-pay debt service.\" ECF No. 163, pg. 8 \u00b6 5; ECF No. 172, pg. 36 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Water Tower Place, LP (the \"LPA\") is a valid and binding contract. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 1. The LPA states the Limited Partners, Alliant Tax Credit Fund 36, Ltd., and Alliant Tax Credit 36, LLC, are obligated to make certain capital contributions upon a number of conditions being met, including Rental Achievement and the Rental Achievement Test. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In October 2013, the Partnership engaged Sherbert Associates, LLC to calculate the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (\"DSCR\") and the Occupancy of Water Tower Place. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 7. Sherbert Associates prepared an Independent Accountants' Report entitled Calculation of Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Occupancy Percentage October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the \"AUP\") showing its calculations. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 8. The AUP states the Occupancy for Water Tower Place was 92% for each of the three months in the AUP. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 12. The General Partner sent the AUP to the Limited Partners in early 2014. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 17. Plaintiffs rely upon the AUP in claiming Rental Achievement was met. ECF No. 155, \u00b6 29. The Limited Partners were not satisfied the AUP demonstrated Rental Achievement or the Rental Achievement Test had been met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 155, \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By January 15, 2014, the Limited Partners had in their possession the third-party property manager's monthly financial reports for Water Tower Place for each of October 2013, November 2013, and December 2013. ECF No. 163, pg. 8 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 172, pg. 37 \u00b6 6. In January 2016, the General Partner sent (via counsel) demand letters for the capital contributions associated with the attainment of the Rental Achievement Test and Rental Achievement, and notice of a subsequent closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 155, \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rental Achievement as defined by the LPA \"means the date that all of the following conditions have been fulfilled: (i) Conversion; (ii) all governmental approvals necessary for Occupancy of all units in the Apartment Complex have been obtained; and (iii) one hundred percent (100%) Occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units and ninety percent (90%) Occupancy of the Apartment Complex has occurred during each of three (3) consecutive months (but no earlier than the three (3) consecutive months immediately preceding Conversion), and which produces a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 for each of such three (3) consecutive months.\" ECF No. 155, \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Rental Achievement Test as defined by the LPA \"means the satisfaction of a level of Occupancy sustained for a period of three (3) consecutive months with actual rent levels and operating expenses which produce a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 with respect to all projected permanent financing for each of such three (3) consecutive months.\" ECF No. 155, \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the terms of Exhibit F to the LPA, all 178 units of the Water Tower Place apartment complex are \"Tax Credit Apartment Units.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 155, \u00b6 49. For the three months during which Plaintiffs claim Rental Achievement was met (October, November, and December 2013), only \"164 Water Tower Place apartment units were occupied, and 14 apartment units were vacant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 155, \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Weismann is party to a guaranty agreement (the \"Guaranty Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   No. 155, \u00b6 51. The Guaranty Agreement states Weismann is obligated to fund \"Development Deficits under Section 4.2\" of the LPA.

First, Defendants argue Rental Achievement has not been met. Second, they contend Weismann's guaranty obligations are still in place. Third, Defendants claim because Rental Achievement has not been met, Plaintiffs' claims of a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must be dismissed. Finally, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' claims are barred because Plaintiffs materially breached the contract prior to any alleged breaches by the Defendants.

App. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Court looks to the plain and ordinary meaning of the disputed term to determine whether an ambiguity exists. Article I of the LPA is titled \"DEFINED TERMS\" and outlines definitions for well over a hundred capitalized terms including Rental Achievement, Occupancy, and Tax Credit Apartment Units. The LPA specifies that when the terms listed in Article I are capitalized anywhere in the LPA, those terms shall have the meaning specified and detailed in Article I. The terms Rental Achievement, Occupancy, and Tax Credit Apartment Units are capitalized and defined terms in Article I and also appear throughout the LPA clauses in dispute. The Court will use capitalized terms according to their specified meaning in Article I according to the instructions in the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The parties ultimately dispute whether Rental Achievement, a defined term in Article I, has been met. If Rental Achievement has been met, a series of requirements are triggered in the LPA which shift certain financial obligations from Plaintiffs to Defendants. Since Rental Achievement is a defined and capitalized term in Article I, there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the requirements or definition of Rental Achievement in the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rental Achievement is defined in Article I of the LPA as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Rental Achievement\"\n   </strong>\n   means the date that all of the following conditions have been fulfilled: (i) Conversion; (ii) all governmental approvals necessary for Occupancy of all units in the Apartment Complex have been obtained; and (iii) one hundred percent (100%) Occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units and ninety percent (90%) Occupancy of the Apartment Complex has occurred during each of three (3) consecutive months (but no earlier than the three (3) consecutive months immediately preceding Conversion), and which produces a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 for each of such three (3) consecutive months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 155, Ex. A, pg. 21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to the definition in Article I of the LPA, there are three factors which must be met before Water Tower Place has satisfied Rental Achievement. The only factor in dispute in the instant motion is factor (iii) which requires two conditions to be satisfied. First, Water Tower Place must have \"one hundred percent (100%) Occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units and ninety percent (90%) Occupancy of the Apartment Complex has occurred during each of three (3) consecutive months (but no earlier than the three (3) consecutive months immediately preceding Conversion)\" and second, \"which produces a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 for each of such three (3) consecutive months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There is no genuine issue of material fact as to the definition of Rental Achievement given its plain meaning in the LPA. However, the parties dispute the meaning of the term \"one hundred percent \"Occupancy\" ' as used in part (iii) of the definition. To determine the meaning of \"Occupancy\" the Court looks to the definition outlined in Article I of the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Article I of the LPA defines \"Occupancy\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Occupancy\"\n   </strong>\n   means lawful occupancy of apartment units in the Apartment Complex under leases (i) having a term of not less than six months, (ii) under which full rental payments have commenced at rental rates which are (in the case of the Tax Credit Apartment Units) consistent with the definition of \"rent restricted unit\" under Section 42(g)(2) of the Code, or at such lower rental rates as may be prescribed under any applicable restrictions contained in the Project Documents, but in no event at rates which are less than ninety percent (90%) of the maximum rents which can be charged to tenants of rent restricted units under Section 42(g)(2) (unless any Project Document prescribes a lower rent, in which case at rates which are less than ninety percent (90%) of such lower rents), (iii) to tenants actually occupying the apartment unit other than on a transient basis and who (in the case of the Tax Credit Apartment Units) meet the income requirements of Section 42(g) of the Code and the Project Documents, and (iv) on such other terms as are commercially reasonable and customary under residential apartment leasing practices observed in the area in which the Apartment Complex is located. An apartment unit shall not be considered \"Occupied\" unless and until each of the foregoing criteria has been complied with. ECF 155, Ex. A, pg. 17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to meet the definition of Occupancy as outlined in Article I of the LPA, the apartment units in Water Tower place must: (i) have a lease of not less than six months; (ii) full rental payments have commenced at rates which are consistent with the requirements of \"rent restricted units;\" (iii) to tenants who are not transient and who meet the income requirements; and (iv) under other commercially reasonable terms and leasing practices observed in the area. These benchmarks are clearly and specifically defined in the LPA. The capitalized term Tax Credit Apartment Units also appears in the definition of Occupancy, therefore the Court looks at Article I of the LPA to determine its plain meaning and definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In Article I of the LPA, \"Tax Credit Apartment Units\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Tax Credit Apartment Units\"\n   </strong>\n   means all of the apartment units in the Apartment Complex which are to be occupied by tenants in a manner which will qualify such units for Housing Tax Credits and which will permit the Partnership to claim an \"applicable fraction\", pursuant to Section 42(c)(1)(B) of the Code with respect to the Housing Tax Credits, of at least 100%. ECF 155, Ex. A, pg. 22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is undisputed all 178 apartment units at Water Tower Place are qualified as Tax Credit Apartment Units. There are zero units in Water Tower Place which fall into a different category of unit including market rate units or leased commercial space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the term requiring \"one hundred percent (100%) Occupancy of the Tax Credit Apartment Units\" located in the definition of Rental Achievement is ambiguous and therefore the Court should look to extrinsic evidence, namely an affidavit from Paul Corrigan\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   , to inform the\n   intent of the parties by outlining Mr. Corrigan's experiences with the custom and practice of the industry. With the use of this extrinsic evidence, Plaintiffs contend during in the three months during which NTD and Weismann claim Rental Achievement was met, they achieved one hundred percent Occupancy because, based on industry custom and usage, the Occupancy requirement in the definition of Rental Achievement refers only to satisfying the requirement of qualifying the Tax Credit Apartment Units by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Upon a plain reading of the LPA, including Article I, it is clear the term \"Occupancy\" as used in the definition of Rental Achievement refers to \"Occupancy,\" the defined and capitalized term outlined in Article I. The term \"Occupancy\" is not reasonably susceptible of more than one construction because of the capitalization of the word within the definition. It is clear that the contract intended for the capitalized Occupancy to mean the defined word present in Article I, not a broader definition found in a dictionary or based on custom and practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Upon a plain reading of the LPA, Rental Achievement requires one hundred percent of\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   Tax Credit Apartment Units to be occupied according to the defined term \"Occupancy\" as detailed in the LPA. It is unambiguous that the term \"Tax Credit Apartment Units\" was intended to mean the definition outlined in Article I. The Article I definition in the LPA specifies that Tax Credit Apartment Units are units which are eligible to receive the Housing Tax Credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs attempt to create an ambiguity in the reading of the definition of Rental Achievement by using the same affidavit from Mr. Corrigan to assert that the real meaning of Occupancy is rooted in the notion that because Defendants accepted tax returns and K1s, claiming their tax credits, they have, in essence, admitted that one hundred percent of the Tax Credit Apartment Units have been Occupied. The Court disagrees. For the same reasons above, the contract definitions speak for themselves and the Court cannot consider extrinsic evidence to make the terms Occupancy and Tax Credit Apartment Units suddenly ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    ATC Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7095468,7095485\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/389/732/\">\n    389 S.W.3d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An ambiguity must come from within the four corners of the contract; extrinsic evidence cannot be used to create an ambiguity.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In this instance, Plaintiffs introduction of extrinsic evidence cannot be used to create an ambiguity in the word Occupancy or in Tax Credit Apartment Units. Occupancy is not a disputed term and clearly expresses the requirements for Rental Achievement. Tax Credit Apartment Units are clearly a type of unit which qualifies for the Housing Tax Credit and their certification\n   does not suddenly excuse the Occupancy requirement when it comes to attaining Rental Achievement. Accordingly, \"[w]here the language of a contract is free from ambiguity, its construction is for the court, as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Brittany Sobery Family Ltd.

Since the definitions have been determined, the Court now looks to the definitions to determine whether Plaintiffs have successfully reached Rental Achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   There is no genuine issue of material fact as to all 178 units at Water Tower Place being qualified as Tax Credit Apartment Units. Additionally, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to how many of those 178 units were Occupied by tenants of some kind from October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs state \"during each of October 2013, November 2013, and December 2013, 164 Water Tower Place apartment units were Occupied, and 14 units were vacant. The Accountants then divided the number of Occupied apartment units in October 2013, November 2013, and December 2013 by the total number of apartment units to arrive at a 92% Occupancy percentage for each of those three successive months.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 104. During the three months Plaintiffs contend they met Rental Achievement, only 92% of the apartment units were Occupied. Plaintiffs' 92% Occupancy rate as stated in their Compliant and in the AUP report completed by the accountants at the behest of Plaintiffs, states unequivocally Plaintiffs had not attained Rental Achievement because they could not have had \"one hundred percent Occupancy,\" a requirement to attain Rental Achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court finds the requirements of Rental Achievement as well as the definitions of Occupancy and Tax Credit Apartment units are clear from the plain meaning of the LPA and it will not consider extrinsic evidence to create an ambiguity where none exists. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Court grants summary judgment as to the issue of whether Rental Achievement had been met and determines Plaintiffs have not met Rental Achievement using the documentation from October to December 2013 because they did not have one hundred percent Occupancy as required in the LPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    b. Improper Calculation of Rental Achievement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue summary judgment is proper because Plaintiffs improperly calculated the Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the months of October through December 2013 by including the increases in the balance of an escrow or reserve account as Expenditures and not Cash Receipts, and therefore Plaintiffs did not attain Rental Achievement for those three months. Plaintiffs counter, arguing various terms in the LPA, including Cash Flow, Cash Receipts, Expenditures, and Debt Service Coverage Ratio, which are needed to meet the requirements of Rental Achievement, are ambiguous and a trial is needed for the Court to determine the parties' intent, custom\n   and practice, and understandings and actions as to the requirements of calculating the Debt Service Coverage Ratio in the LPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As detailed above, Rental Achievement requires the satisfaction of three requirements, with the third requirement consisting of two parts. The third requirement to attain Rental Achievement includes having one hundred percent Occupancy and a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 for three consecutive months. The Court will grant summary judgment as to the issue of Plaintiffs satisfaction of the requirements of Rental Achievement, therefore, the Court does not need to address any potential ambiguities in the Debt to Service Coverage Ratio as Rental Achievement has not been met by Plaintiffs and summary judgment on the failure of Plaintiffs to obtain Rental Achievement will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    c. Waiver of Rental Achievement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs argue in their Memorandum in Opposition the Defendants waived Rental Achievement and therefore summary judgment is not proper on the issue of whether the milestone of Rental Achievement has occurred. Defendants counter, arguing there is not even a scintilla of evidence showing the requirement to meet Rental Achievement was waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Waiver is \"the intentional relinquishment of a known right.\"\n   <em>\n    Shahan v.

Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' own admissions state they did nothing to enforce the Rental Achievement date against Plaintiffs and therefore they waived the Rental Achievement requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On the contrary, Defendants argue they requested additional information from Plaintiffs numerous times from 2014 to 2016 to determine whether Rental Achievement had been met. Defendants assert nothing in the timeline of requests for additional information demonstrates an intentional waiver of the requirement for meeting Rental Achievement. Defendants also contend any argument by Plaintiffs pertaining to Rental Achievement listed as a benchmark in the Verizon quarterly report is unfounded because the benchmark was not a deadline, but rather an estimated date based on the General Partner's information regarding when the Partnership might meet Rental Achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There are genuine issues of material fact related to the circumstances and events which Plaintiffs contend shows Defendants waived the requirement of Rental Achievement.

Weismann's Guaranty Obligations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In their Motion, Defendants argue summary judgment should be granted in their favor on Counts II, IV, and VII because Weismann has an obligation to continue to fund Development Deficits, including Operating Deficits, irrespective of an alleged cap of $ 500,000 because the cap only exists as to funds expended following Rental Achievement. Plaintiffs contend Weismann's obligation to fund Operating Deficits does not exceed $ 500,000, and an ambiguity exists between the Guaranty Agreement and the LPA which would determine the amount of Development Deficits Weismann is obligated to fund under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Weismann is a signatory to the July 1, 2006 Guaranty Agreement. The Guaranty Agreement states, in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (A) the payment and performance by the General Partners of each and every one of the following obligations under the following provisions of the Partnership Agreement:...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (v)\n   <em>\n    the obligation to fund up to $ 500,000 of Operating Deficits under Section 4.3\n   </em>\n   and the obligation to cause the Operating Deficit Reserve Account and the Replacement Reserve Account to be funded pursuant to Sections 4.4 and 4.5, respectively;... ECF 165 at Exhibit P (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Section 4.3 of the LPA, which is referred to in the Guaranty Agreement, exists in Article 4 of the LPA under the subheading \"CONSTRUCTION OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX; DEVELOPMENT DEFICITS; OPERATING DEFICITS; RESERVES.\" ECF 155 at 39. Section 4.3 is titled \"\n   <em>\n    Operating Deficits\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" outlines the obligations of the General Partners with respect to lending the Partnership any Operating Loans to fund Operating Deficits during the Operating Deficit Guaranty Period. Operating Deficit Guaranty Period is a defined term in Article I of the LPA and is defined as \"the period described in the Schedule\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   during which the General Partners are obligated to fund Operating Deficits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 155 at 17.

Plaintiffs contend Weismann's obligation was discharged because the Guaranty Agreement, which is one of General Partner LPA obligations and not indebtedness,\n   only requires the payment of $ 500,000.

The Guaranty Agreement, entered into by Plaintiffs, states the General Partners and not the Alliant entities as Investor Limited Partners have \"the obligation to fund up to $ 500,000 of Operating Deficits under Section 4.3 and the obligation to cause the Operating Deficit Reserve Account and the Replacement Reserve Account to be funded pursuant to Sections 4.4 and 4.5, respectively.\" ECF 165 at Exhibit P. Article I of the LPA defines Guaranty Agreement as \"the Guaranty Agreement of even date with this Agreement pursuant to which the Guarantors have\n   <em>\n    guaranteed for the benefit\n   </em>\n   of the Investor Limited Partner the performance of certain specified obligations of the General Partners hereunder.\" ECF 155 at 14 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It is undisputed neither the LPA nor the Guaranty Agreement place any obligation on any Alliant entity to co-fund Operating Deficits. The definition of Guaranty Agreement in the LPA, as well as the Guaranty Agreement itself, clearly detail the obligations Plaintiffs have with respect to the Investor Limited Partner, Alliant, LLC, and do not detail co-obligations they share with regards to funding certain obligations of the General Partners. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the Court finds there is no dispute of material fact pertaining to any Alliant entity as a co-obligor to Weismann's financial obligations under the LPA and Guaranty Agreement. Equitable contribution is a right to recover against a party who shares liability. In the present case, there are no facts which indicate Defendants' share liability with Plaintiffs as to any financial contributions, and therefore Plaintiffs are not entitled to recovery under the doctrine of equitable contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, summary judgment is granted for Defendants as to any equitable contribution claim based on any Alliant entity being a co-obligor to Weismann's financial obligations under the LPA and Guaranty Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Plaintiffs counter, arguing there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants sought additional information as a follow up to the initial AUP report claiming Rental Achievement as a pretext to avoid payment. Plaintiffs also argue genuine issues of fact exist as to whether Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unjustifiable failing to refusing to utilize information in their possession to make a fair and good faith assessment of the AUP report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Missouri law implies a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in performance and enforcement in every contract.\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The facts surrounding the actions of both parties as it relates to the AUP report are still in dispute. Plaintiffs set forth disputed facts alleging Defendants were being opportunistic and exploiting the situation to improve their gains, and Defendants set forth disputed facts alleging Plaintiffs failed to provide the necessary information to verify Rental Achievement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It is clear to the Court, irrespective of the granting of summary judgment on the non-attainment of Rental Achievement, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are numerous material facts in dispute which could show Defendants evaded the spirit of the transaction, and therefore denied Plaintiffs the expected benefit of their contract, namely, capital contributions.
