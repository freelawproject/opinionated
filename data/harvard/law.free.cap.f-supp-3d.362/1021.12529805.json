The Court held a hearing on December 21, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, wherein Plaintiff World Fuel Services, Inc. -- a non-Indian party -- asserts claims against Defendant Nambe Pueblo Development Corporation (\"Nambe Corp.\"), an Indian party; (ii) whether the Court should consider the Motion as a\n   rule 12(b)(1) or a rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure motion and, based on the appropriate rule, whether the Court may consider an affidavit and other documents affixed to the Motion; (iii) whether Nambe Corp. and Nambe Pueblo are entitled to, or have waived, Tribal sovereign immunity; and (iv) whether World Fuel, who entered a Motor Fuel Supply Agreement (dated May 17, 2017), filed September 11, 2018 (Doc. 9-1)(\"Agreement\"), with an Indian party, Nambe Corp., regarding fuel sales on Nambe Pueblo lands, must exhaust Tribal remedies before seeking relief in federal district court on its demand for arbitration of a dispute arising from the Agreement, when its claim arises under the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 16 (\"FAA\"), but there is no intra-Tribal dispute and there is no attempt to circumvent a pending parallel proceeding in Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court. The Court concludes that: (i) the Court has subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity; (ii) the Court considers the Motion under rule 12(b)(6) and, accordingly, does not rely on the documents affixed to the Motion, but does consider the documents attached to and referenced by the Complaint; (iii) both Nambe Corp. and Nambe Pueblo are entitled to Tribal sovereign immunity and Nambe Corp., but not Nambe Pueblo, waived Tribal sovereign immunity for the purposes of arbitration; and (iv) World Fuel must exhaust Tribal remedies before seeking relief in federal district court on its demand for arbitration, although there is no intra-Tribal dispute and there is no attempt to circumvent a pending parallel proceeding in Tribal Court, because no exceptions to the Tribal exhaustion doctrine's application apply and the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court has colorable jurisdiction over the case. Accordingly, the Court stays the case pending World Fuel's exhaustion of Tribal Court remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court draws its facts from World Fuel's Petition to Compel Arbitration Pursuant to Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act, filed August 31, 2018 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\").

World Fuel begins by asserting that, in enacting the FAA, Congress sought to \"control the procedures employed by a federal court, and thus ensure that petitions to compel arbitration would be expeditious summary proceedings.\" Response\n   at 1. World Fuel argues that, by insisting on Tribal exhaustion, Nambe Corp., contrary to Congress' intent in enacting the FAA, \"seeks to drag out the litigation regarding the preliminary question of whether to enforce the parties' arbitration agreement in at least two tiers of Tribal Courts before World Fuel may seek enforcement in this Court.\" Response at 1-2. World Fuel contends that Congress has empowered only federal courts to hear petitions under the FAA's \u00a7 4, and that the 2017 contract's arbitration clause contemplates resolving disputes in a non-Tribal forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2.

First, World Fuel argues that two threshold issues bar the Court from considering the exhaustion argument: (i) arbitrators, not a court, should determine whether World Fuel has satisfied conditions precedent to arbitration, including Tribal exhaustion, and whether the parties' agreement is valid; and (ii) the Motion \"improperly relies on matters extrinsic to World Fuel's petition and allegations contrary to World Fuel's factual allegations.\" Response at 2. World Fuel asserts that, even if the Court reaches the merits of Nambe Corp.'s Tribal exhaustion argument, it must deny the Motion, because: (i) \"especially\" where a petition's filing is not \"an attempt to circumvent the tribal entity's invocation of a parallel proceeding in Tribal Court and the underlying controversy is not an intra-tribal dispute,\" the Tribal exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable to petitions to compel arbitration under the FAA's \u00a7 4; (ii) the parties' arbitration clause waives any otherwise applicable Tribal exhaustion rule; and (iii) there is no pending proceeding in the Nambe Tribal Courts, rendering the Tribal exhaustion doctrine inapplicable. Response at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   World Fuel describes the arbitration clause, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If any dispute arises between the parties over or in accordance with this Agreement and the parties, after good faith efforts, are unable to resolve the dispute between themselves, either party may serve notice in writing to the other of such dispute and demand that it be resolved through binding arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Response at 2 (quoting Agreement \u00b6 18(a), at 7). World Fuel states that the arbitration clause \"provides that the arbitration panel 'shall convene as soon as practicable' and that the panel 'shall hear and decide the dispute within sixty (60) days of the notice to arbitrate' \" \"based on the laws of the State of New Mexico.\" Response at 3-4 (quoting Agreement \u00b6 18(a), at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   World Fuel contends that the arbitration provision expressly waives Nambe Corp.'s immunity from suit \"for the limited and sole purposes of compelling arbitration or enforcing any binding arbitration decision ...\n   <em>\n    by any court\n   </em>\n   having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter and for purposes of any such arbitration provisions.\" Response at 3 (emphasis in Response)(quoting Agreement \u00b6 18(b), at 7). World Fuel also notes that the Federal Charter contains a \"sue and be sued\" clause, stating that Nambe Corp. \"is expressly authorized and empowered ... [t]o sue and be sued in its Corporate name in courts of competent jurisdiction within the United States.\" Response at 4 (quoting Federal Charter \u00a7 3.01(b), at 2). World Fuel contends that the Federal Charter\n   waives Nambe Corp.'s immunity \"independently of the contractual waiver of sovereign immunity in the Agreement.\" Response at 4 n.1 (\"The narrower waiver in the Agreement does not negate the general waiver of immunity in the sue and be sued clause of Nambe's corporate charter -- each waiver operates independently.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   World Fuel asserts that it provided Nambe Corp. formal notice of the dispute regarding unpaid taxes that Nambe Corp. owes to World Fuel, after Nambe Corp. refused to pay an invoice for amounts owed and demanded arbitration pursuant to the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. World Fuel asserts that Nambe Corp. \"has not selected a second arbitrator within ten days of its receipt of the notice as required by the Agreement, and has refused to proceed to arbitration.\" Response at 4-5. World Fuel avers that, on August 31, 2018, it \"filed a petition in this Court to compel arbitration pursuant to Section 4 of the FAA.\" Response at 5. World Fuel contends that, according to Nambe Corp.,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   before World Fuel may avail itself of the summary procedures afforded under Section 4 of the FAA, which apply only to federal courts, it must bring its FAA claim in the Nambe Tribal Courts and engage in the exact type of protracted litigation about venue that the FAA was enacted to curb.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Response at 5. World Fuel argues that arbitrators, and not a court, must decide the exhaustion argument, because it is a procedural question regarding grievance procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. World Fuel asserts that arbitrators, and not a court, must determine the Agreement's validity, because the Supreme Court has held that, \"unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the contract's validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.\" Response at 5-6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.

Response at 7. World Fuel argues, accordingly, that \"[a]ny counterfactual arguments that NPDC seeks to present,\" including regarding the Agreement's validity and the Tribal exhaustion requirement, \"must be made at trial, not on a motion to dismiss[,]\" because the FAA requires that where factual issues exist, courts shall proceed summarily to trial.

Nambe Corp. averred that, in other Courts of Appeals, the party required to exhaust Tribal remedies files another action, if they want to return to federal court and challenge the Tribal Court's jurisdiction after exhausting Tribal Court remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 3:24-4:2 (Rogers). The Court replied that other Courts of Appeals are also more liberal than the Tenth Circuit \"about dismissing cases in which there is a motion to arbitrate as well.\" Tr. at 4:3-6 (Court).

Nambe Corp. asserts that there is a colorable basis for Tribal jurisdiction, first, because the case's impact is \"potentially adverse to the resources of the tribe,\" given that Nambe Pueblo wholly owns Nambe\n   Corp., so if World Fuel prevails on their payment dispute, Nambe Pueblo's financial resources will be impacted and, second, because the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court may exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from consensual relationships on Nambe Pueblo's land.

Nambe Corp. argued that whether Board approval was required or what the effect of a lack of Board approval is \"needs to go to the Tribal Court.\" Tr. at 6:6-8 (Roger). Nambe Corp. submitted that Tribal Court jurisdiction clearly exists under federal law, because World Fuel will be the plaintiff in any Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court suit to compel arbitration, and, when a non-Indian plaintiff sues a Tribal entity in Tribal Court,\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Nambe Corp. argues that the FAA's \u00a7 4 says a party seeking to compel arbitration may file that petition in federal court, but that state and Tribal Courts also hear FAA cases, and that, unlike the PAA, the FAA confers on the court no independent basis for federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:1-11 (Rogers).

World Fuel argued that, because there are factual issues here -- including where the cause of action accrued -- there should be an Answer, but the Court asked whether, if the bar is as low as identifying a colorable claim for jurisdiction, the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Courts should take the first look.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:16-27:1 (Zaron, Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   World Fuel alleged that, on page 12, the Federal Charter states that the president signs and approves of all contracts and instruments on behalf of Nambe Corp., except for those expressly delegated to the chief executive officer after the Board's authorization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:14-22 (Zaron).

World Fuel argued that there is no dispute as to the contract's validity and \"that's really the basis for which [Nambe Corp. is] seeking exhaustion....\" Tr. at 28:23-25 (Zaron).

World Fuel argued that, while state courts consider FAA \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 arbitration claims, exclusively federal courts consider \u00a7 4 claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30-20-22 (Zaron).

World Fuel argued that, although they could seek to compel arbitration\n   under a different FAA section, World Fuel brought their petition pursuant to \u00a7 4\"which does have special provisions providing for the application of the Federal Rules of Civil [Procedure] and certain limitations on notice....\" Tr. at 32:1-6 (Zaron).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   World Fuel next argued that, if the Court dismisses this case, World Fuel would be the plaintiff in the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court and would have to file a motion to dismiss World Fuel's own Complaint, because \"we think that there is no colorable basis for jurisdiction under this section of the FAA in Tribal Court....\" Tr. at 33:7-16 (Zaron). World Fuel argued that, in the administrative context, Supreme Court caselaw suggests that arbitration's goals trump the practice of administrative remedy exhaustion, despite the states' strong interest in protecting regulations and ordinances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 34:24-35:10 (Zaron). World Fuel argued that, in\n   <em>\n    El Paso\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court determined that the PAA's speed and efficiency goals were more important than Tribal exhaustion, and that the FAA has \"similar language in terms of the need for speed and efficiency....\" Tr. at 35:14-36:8 (Zaron).

In\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

World Fuel contended that the Court needs \"to determine whether or not there has been a waiver of Tribal exhaustion.\" Tr. at 38:18-20 (Zaron).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   World Fuel argued that, where there is a factual dispute, \"the proper mechanism is to go to trial on the factual issues in a summary fashion.\" Tr. at 39:14-16 (Zaron).

World Fuel argued that, because a \u00a7 4 arbitration claim may not be filed in Tribal Court, there can be no parallel proceeding, and that the appropriate course of action \"would be to deny the motion to dismiss and require the Nambe corporation to file an answer, and then proceed to a summary trial of the issue....\" Tr. at 42:12-42:22 (Zaron).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Regarding the R.

Nambe Corp. argued that, disregarding the portions of the R.

Nambe Corp. contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Comanche Indian Tribe of Okla. v. 49 L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , the Tribe did not argue for exhaustion, because no Comanche Tribal Court existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:5-8 (Rogers). Nambe Corp. argues that, although World Fuel, if it files in Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court, will not bring its action under the FAA's \u00a7 4, the exhaustion doctrine requires only that the Tribal Court resolve the parties' dispute and the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Court may resolve the dispute without invoking \u00a7 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:22-46:5 (Rogers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court stated that it would not rule definitively at the hearing, but that the Court's impression \"is this is a very strong exhaustion requirement....\" Tr. at 54:15-55:1 (Court).

Justice Brennan explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   In many cases, no doubt, a \u00a7 3 stay is quite adequate to protect the right to arbitration.

It leaves the recalcitrant party free to sit and do nothing -- neither to litigate nor to arbitrate. If the state court stayed litigation pending arbitration but declined to compel the Hospital to arbitrate, Mercury would have no sure way to proceed with its claims except to return to federal court to obtain a \u00a7 4 order -- a pointless and wasteful burden on the supposedly summary and speedy procedures prescribed by the Arbitration Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188858\" index=\"676\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/1/\">\n    460 U.S. at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188858\" index=\"677\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/1/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Judge Maloney found, however, that the remaining factors favored abstention. Specifically, the first lawsuit had been pending for over three and one-half years, while the federal suit was in its initial pleading stage.

The Court takes judicial notice of the fact an apparently arbitrable dispute has involved three Texas trial courts, one California trial court, one Texas appeals court, one California appeals court, and one federal district court, all without final resolution of the dispute between the parties.

Nambe Corp. averred at the hearing that its Motion falls somewhere between a rule 12(b)(1) and a rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:10-13 (Rogers);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:15-18 (Rogers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The Court concludes that rule 12(b)(6) provides the appropriate standard regarding which documents a Court may review in ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust Tribal remedies, because Tribal exhaustion is non-waivable,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, in this\n   case, the facts necessary to make the determination whether Tribal exhaustion applies appear on the face of the Complaint.

The Agreement, incorporated through the Complaint, states that Nambe Pueblo authorizes Nambe Corp. \"to use and occupy certain tribal lands ... at a facility known as the Nambe Falls Travel Center.\" Agreement at \u00b6 A. From the Agreement's face, it appears that the dispute, arising from Nambe Corp.'s alleged failure to pay excise taxes as the Agreement requires, centers on activity occurring on Nambe Pueblo lands, at the Nambe Travel Center. These facts establish that the Nambe Pueblo Tribal Courts have a colorable claim of jurisdiction, as discussed in Section IV of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. Using the 12(b)(6) standard, the Court does not consider the R.

If the Court adheres too rigidly to Tenth Circuit caselaw, ignoring changes undergone by a state's law in the ensuing years, then parties litigating state-law claims will be subject to a different body of substantive law, depending on whether they litigate in state court or federal court. This result frustrates the purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , which held that federal courts must apply state court interpretations of state law, rather than their own, in part so that parties achieve a consistent result regardless of the forum. This consideration pulls the Court toward according Tenth Circuit precedent less weight and according state court decisions issued in the ensuing years more weight. On the other hand, when the state law is unclear, it is desirable for there to at least be uniformity among federal judges as to its proper interpretation. Otherwise, different federal judges within the same circuit -- or even the same district, as district courts' decisions are not binding, even upon themselves -- would be free to adopt differing interpretations of a state's law. This consideration pulls the Court towards a stronger respect for vertical stare decisis, because a Tenth Circuit decision on point -- regardless whether it accurately reflects state law --at least provides consistency at the federal level, so long federal district judges are required to follow it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-319\">\n    The Court must decide how to weigh Tenth Circuit caselaw against more-recent state court decisions, choosing a point on the spectrum between the two extremes: rigidly adhering to Tenth Circuit precedent unless there is intervening caselaw directly on point from the state's highest court, on one end; and independently interpreting the state law, regarding the Tenth Circuit precedent as no more than persuasive authority, on the other. In striking this balance, the Court notes that it is generally more concerned about systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and the state courts than it is about inconsistency among federal judges. Judges, even those within a jurisdiction with ostensibly identical governing law, sometimes interpret and apply the law differently from one another; this inconsistency is part and parcel of a common-law judicial system. More importantly, litigants seeking to use forum selection to gain a substantive legal advantage cannot easily manipulate such inconsistency: cases are assigned randomly to district judges in this and many federal districts; and, regardless, litigants cannot know for certain how a given judge will interpret the state law, even if they could determine the identity of the judge pre-filing or pre-removal. All litigants know in advance is that whomever federal district judge they are assigned will look to the entirety of the state's common law in making his or her determination -- the same as a state judge would. Systemic inconsistency between the federal courts and state courts, on the other hand, not only threatens the principles of federalism, but litigants may more easily manipulate the inconsistency. When the Tenth Circuit issues an opinion interpreting state law, and the state courts subsequently shift away from that interpretation, litigants -- if the district courts strictly adhere to the Tenth Circuit opinion -- have a definite substantive advantage in choosing the federal forum over the state forum, or vice versa.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    The Court further notes that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to be responsive to changes in state law. Tenth Circuit decisions interpreting a particular state's law on a specific issue are further apart in time than the collective district courts' are. More importantly, the Tenth Circuit does not typically address such issues with the frequency that the state's courts themselves do. As such, Tenth Circuit precedent can lag behind developments in state law -- developments that the district courts may be nimble enough to perceive and adopt. Additionally, much of the benefit of having a consistent Tenth Circuit-wide interpretation of a particular state's law is wasted. Other than Oklahoma, every state encompassed by the Tenth Circuit contains only one federal judicial district, and there is relatively little need for federal judges in Wyoming and Kansas to have a uniform body of New Mexico law to which to look. Last, the Court notes, respectfully, that district courts may be in a better position than the Tenth Circuit to develop expertise on the state law of the state in which they sit. Every federal judicial district in the nation, except the District of Wyoming, covers at most one state. It is perhaps a more workable design for each district court to keep track of legal developments in the state law of its own state(s) than it is for the Tenth Circuit to monitor separate legal developments in eight states.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    Having outlined the relevant considerations, the Court thinks the proper stance on vertical stare decisis in the context of federal court interpretations of state law is as follows: the Tenth Circuit's cases are binding as to their precise holding -- what the state law was on the day the opinion was published -- but lack the positive precedential force that its cases interpreting a federal statute or the federal Constitution possess. A district court considering a state law issue after the publication of a Tenth Circuit opinion on point may not come to a contrary conclusion based\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    on state court cases that were available to the Tenth Circuit and that the Tenth Circuit considered, but it may come to such a conclusion based on intervening state court cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    When interpreting state law, the Tenth Circuit does not and cannot issue a case holding that\n    <em>\n     x\n    </em>\n    is the law in New Mexico; it holds that the\n    <em>\n     proper interpretation\n    </em>\n    of New Mexico law, at the time the opinion is released, is\n    <em>\n     x.\n    </em>\n    Its holdings are descriptive, not prescriptive -- interpretive, not normative. Because federal judicial opinions lack independent substantive force on state law issues, but possess such force regarding federal law issues, the Court thinks the following is not an unfair summary of the judicial interpretive process: (i) when interpreting federal law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that both reflects and influences the body of law; that holding subsequently becomes a part of the body of law; but (ii) when interpreting state law, the federal appellate courts consider the existing body of law, and then issue a holding that only reflects the body of law; that holding does not subsequently become a part of the body of law. The federal district courts are bound to conclude that the Tenth Circuit's reflection of the then-existing body of law was accurate. The question is whether they should build a doctrine atop the case and use the existence of the Tenth Circuit's case to avoid any responsibility to independently consider the whole body of state law that exists when the time comes that diversity litigants raise the issue in their courtrooms. Giving such effect to the Tenth Circuit's interpretations of state law is at tension with\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , giving independent substantive effect to federal judicial decisions --\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , applying federal law -- in a case brought in diversity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    The purpose of\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    is well-known and simple, and the Court should not complicate it beyond recognition: it is that the same substantive law governs litigants' cases regardless whether they are brought in a federal or state forum. For simplicity's sake, most courts have settled on the formulation that \"the federal court must attempt to predict how the states' highest court would rule if confronted with the issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore's Federal Practice\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 124.22[3] (citing\n    <em>\n     Comm'r v.

This formulation may not be the most precise one if the goal is to ensure identical outcomes in state and federal court -- the Honorable Milton I. Shadur, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, looks to state procedural rules to determine in which state appellate circuit the suit would have been filed were it not in federal court, and then applies the state law as that circuit court interprets it,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abbott Labs. v.

This formulation, built out of ease-of-use, does not relieve courts of their Supreme Court-mandated obligation to consider state appellate and trial court decisions. To the contrary, even non-judicial writings by influential authors, statements by state supreme court justices, the closeness of the vote on a prior case addressing the issue, and personnel changes on the court -- considerations that would never inform a federal court's analysis of federal law -- may validly come into play. The question is whether the district courts must abdicate, across-the-board, the \"would decide\" aspect of the\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    analysis to their parent appellate courts when the Court of Appeals has declared an interpretation of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    doctrine results in federal cases that interpret state law withering with time. While cases interpreting federal law become more powerful over time -- forming the groundwork for doctrines, growing upward from one application (Congress may create a national bank) to many (Congress may set quotas on wheat-growing for personal consumption), expanding outward from the general (states must grant criminal jury trials) to the specific (the jury need not be twelve people, nor must it be unanimous) -- federal cases interpreting state law often become stale. New state court cases -- even when not directly rebuking the federal court's statement of law -- alter the common-law legal landscape with their dicta, their insinuations, and their tone. The Supreme Court, which picks its cases sparingly and for maximum effect, almost never grants certiorari to resolve issues of state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    The Court's views on\n    <em>\n     Erie\n    </em>\n    , of course, mean little if the Tenth Circuit does not agree.

The Tribe created SMC to enhance employment opportunities on the reservation. As the Ninth Circuit recognized, economic independence is the foundation of a tribe's self-determination. If contracting parties cannot trust the validity of choice of law and venue provisions, SMC may well find itself unable to compete and the Tribe's efforts to improve the reservation's economy may come to naught.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-351\">\n    <em>\n     Altheimer &amp; Gray v.

The tribal exhaustion doctrine functions like a state abstention doctrine because it stays the federal court's jurisdiction until after the tribal court has heard and decided the merits of the case. Abstention doctrines are judicially created rules that limit the ability of federal courts to decide issues before them even though the jurisdictional and justiciability requirements have been met.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Chemerinsky at 735.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-358\">\n    Carlson at 576 n.44.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-359\">\n    Paragraph A states in full:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-360\">\n    Customer [Nambe Corp.] is authorized by the Pueblo of Nambe to use and occupy certain tribal lands situated on the Highway U.S. 84/285 frontage road on which Customer currently markets on in the future intends to market gasoline, diesel fuel and related fuels as well as alternative fuels at a facility known as the Nambe Falls Travel Center.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-361\">\n    Agreement \u00b6 A, at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-362\">\n    The Court has reservations about the Tribal exhaustion doctrine and thinks the Supreme Court should reconsider it. It should be emphasized that it is a judge-made doctrine and not something the political branch -- Congress -- has enacted. Yet it judicially creates exceptions from congressional statutes. First, it is an exception to the general jurisdictional statutes related to diversity and federal question jurisdiction. If Congress wanted to create an exception, it certainly knows how. Second, it starts creating exceptions from important, long-standing statutes. Here, the judicially created exception undermines Congress' decision to allow parties to enforce arbitration agreements in federal court. Congress was so concerned about the hostility of state courts to arbitration agreements that it vested concurrent jurisdiction in federal courts to protect freedom of contract and the important federal interest in regulating interstate commerce. The Tribal exhaustion doctrine seems to make up a doctrine that the Supreme Court thinks is more right than the statute as Congress wrote it and overrides Congress' decision that federal courts should be able to enforce arbitration agreements. When Congress takes the time to create a federal statute giving the federal courts jurisdiction over an issue, the federal courts should be hesitant to decline the work the people want them to do. Fourth, if the Supreme Court is going to play legislature, and exercise legal powers, it should at least do the job well. There is no empirical evidence that taking away congressionally-granted federal court powers helps strengthen Tribal court systems. It does not appear that the FAA has hurt the wonderful system of state courts the nation enjoys, and the Supreme Court knows it could not create an exception for state courts that would not gut the FAA and probably many other federal statutes. Fifth, the fourth reason above shows how paternalistic and insulting the Tribal exhaustion doctrine is. A sovereign nation should take pride in its own court system. It should want the very best for its own sake and for its people's sake. It should not depend upon another sovereign throwing them a few cases or bones. Sixth, the Supreme Court should take a hard look at Tribal courts and see whether they are better in 2019 than they were in 1959, when they needed the Tribal exhaustion doctrine. If they are better, then maybe the nation no longer needs the Tribal exhaustion doctrine. If they are not better after sixty years, it may be time to get rid of the ineffective doctrine. American law should not be just aspirational, American laws should be effective. Seventh, if the law really is that Tribal exhaustion doctrine cannot be waived, it is hard to see how that helps the Tribes. If the prior criticism, that the doctrine is paternalistic, is not convincing enough alone, when applied to the entire Tribe, the doctrine is paternalistic and insulting. It would appear that the Tribe -- not the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. -- is in the best position to decide whether a Tribe should be able to waive Tribal exhaustion as a bargaining chip in an effort to get a non-Indian to come on the reservation to stimulate its economy or the Supreme Court's desire to grow the Tribal courts is more important or is most in the Tribe's interests. For the foregoing reasons, if the Court were writing on a clean slate, the Court would not recognize the Tribal exhaustion doctrine and would deny the Motion. The Court is not, however, writing on a clean slate, and the Court has worked faithfully to apply the applicable Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit law as correctly as possible.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
