(Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6 1.) On June 14, 2017, Defendants Yvette Hoyer and Shauna M. Paul, by counsel, filed an answer to the complaint in which they substantially denied Plaintiff's allegations, asserted numerous affirmative defenses, and advanced one counterclaim. (Answer, Dkt. 31.) Plaintiff now seeks an order: (1) granting summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) ; (2) striking the answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaim interposed by Defendants; and (3) such other and further relief this Court deems proper. (Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 59, at 1-2.) Defendants, for their part, submitted a cross-motion requesting that the Court grant summary judgment in their favor and dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (Defs.' Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. 57, at 1.) The Court concludes that Plaintiff has met its burden of proof and that Defendants have failed to advance evidence to rebut the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case established by Plaintiff. For the reasons explained below, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment is denied, Plaintiff's motion to strike Defendants' answer and affirmative defenses is denied as moot, and Defendants' counterclaim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiff-a single-member limited liability company organized under Florida law-has one member, an individual domiciled in Florida. (Pl. 56.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 61, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) On June 15, 2005, Defendant Hoyer executed to First Franklin, A Division of National City Bank of Indiana (\"First Franklin\") a mortgage that encumbers the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 3.) Defendant Hoyer executed a note to First Franklin on that same day. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 4.) The mortgage and note were eventually assigned to Plaintiff. (Compl. Ex. D at 6; Affidavit of Jared Dotoli (\"Dotoli Aff.\"), Dkt. 64, \u00b6 5.) On March 30, 2016, a \"Default Notice\" was sent to Defendant Hoyer, explaining that she was in default, that she had thirty days after receipt of the notice to dispute the validity of the debt, and that a payment\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was due within ninety days from the date on which the letter was sent, after which the loan would be accelerated should Defendant Hoyer fail to pay. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 5.) Additionally, Plaintiff's mortgage servicer sent Defendant Hoyer a \"Pre-Foreclosure Notice\" stating that, as of March 30, 2016, Defendant Hoyer was in default and the default could be cured by making a specified payment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which\n   would be due within ninety days. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 6.) Defendant Hoyer failed to make any payment by the deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Defendants submitted an answer in which they substantially denied Plaintiff's allegations (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1-44), asserted numerous affirmative defenses (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-96), and advanced one counterclaim (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-100). The parties entered the discovery process (Dkt. 29). On October 17, 2017, Plaintiff moved for entry of an order appointing a receiver to take control of the Property (Dkt. 39), which was granted (Dkt. 71). The parties filed competing motions for summary judgment.

Although the parties do not appear to question the existence of such an obligation ( (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 3); (Defs.' 56.1, Dkt. 56-9, \u00b6 3) ), Defendants \"dispute that Plaintiff was the owner and holder of the note and mortgage when the complaint was filed on the grounds that the cited material either does not support Plaintiff's claim or is inadmissible\" (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 9). But Plaintiff submitted to the Court, as Exhibit D affixed to its complaint, a document titled \"Corporate Assignment of Mortgage\" that plainly verifies that Plaintiff was assigned the mortgage on the Property on December 30, 2015. (Compl. Ex. D. at 6.) Because Defendants adduce no basis for questioning the veracity of this document or the other applicable evidence presented by Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Note Possession (\"Note Aff.\"), Dkt. 60-5, \u00b6\u00b6 7-11), the Court concludes that Plaintiff was, in fact, the owner and holder of the note and mortgage when the complaint was filed in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v.

In evaluating whether this element has been satisfied, \"[n]o general allegations of default will be assumed to be true; rather, [t]here must be some proof in the form of an affidavit of a person with knowledge, or a complaint verified by a person with knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Fortress Credit Corp. v.

In this case, Plaintiff submitted an affidavit from Jared Dotoli, Plaintiff's single member, that references the allegation in the complaint that \"Defendant Hoyer failed to meet the regular monthly payment that became due on September 1, 2008 and has failed to cure said default as of the date hereof\" and states that Mr. Dotoli \"know[s] this information to be true of [his] own knowledge.\" (Dotoli Aff. \u00b6 44 (referencing (Compl. \u00b6 32) ).) Additionally, Plaintiff submitted an affidavit from Stephanie Childress, Asset Manager at Plaintiff's mortgage servicer, who confirmed that both the \"Default Notice\" and \"Pre-Foreclosure Notice\"-documents that demonstrate that default occurred-were prepared in the ordinary course of business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Stephanie\n   Childress (\"Childress Aff\"), Dkt. 66, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Defendants deny that this default occurred (Answer \u00b6 32), they have not produced any evidence confirming that Defendant Hoyer in fact made the required payment that was due on September 1, 2008 or any of the required payments that followed, or that she was not required to make such payments. The Court therefore rules that Plaintiff has proven that Defendant Hoyer defaulted on the mortgage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gustavia Home, LLC v.

Plaintiff's mortgage servicer mailed Defendant Hoyer two notices informing her of the default: (1) a \"Default Notice\" mailed on March 30, 2016 (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 5), and (2) a \"Pre-Foreclosure Notice\" also mailed on March 30, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). Although Defendants dispute that these notices were sent (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6), they fail to adduce any basis for questioning the veracity of the documents submitted by Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl.

Specifically, Defendants point to the inconsistency discussed earlier in footnotes 4 and 5 of this Memorandum &amp; Order-namely, that on March 30, 2016, Plaintiff sent Defendant Hoyer two separate notices that articulated different payment amounts required to cure the default.
