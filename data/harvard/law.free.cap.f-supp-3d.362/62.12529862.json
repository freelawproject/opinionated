The Court held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   From the exhibits submitted with the [recusal] motion and arguments made therein, this Judge's handling of this case does not trigger the application of 28 U.S.C. 455(a).

Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 ordered Gonz\u00e1lez \"to adduce additional facts, if any ... to avoid summary judgment for the United States pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.\" (Docket No. 841.) Before the deadline for Gonz\u00e1lez to do so, Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 assigned this action to the undersigned judge.

Gonz\u00e1lez appealed this decision. (Docket No. 855.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 21, 2009, Gonz\u00e1lez filed an informative motion. (Docket No. 858.) In his motion, Gonz\u00e1lez alleged that Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 \"became aware that he had a conflict of interest and recused himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. Gonz\u00e1lez attributed the purported conflict of interest to \"some sort of animosity\" arising from the motion to recuse Judge P\u00e9rez-Gim\u00e9nez.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. The purported conflict of interest, Gonz\u00e1lez argued, required Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 to \"[follow] the District Court's electronic case assignment system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. Gonz\u00e1lez averred that Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 \"handpicked Judge Besosa\" in contravention of \"the statutory command that the disqualified judge be removed from all participation in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7 (citing 32 Am.

The Court denied Gonz\u00e1lez's motion to reduce his sentence. (Docket No. 889.)

Defense attorneys Jay Moskoitz and Graham Castillo represented Gonz\u00e1lez before and during his trial. (Docket Nos. 271 and 272.) Defense attorney Rafael Castro-Lang also appeared on behalf on Gonz\u00e1lez.

The record does not reflect that Ms. Brill represented Gonz\u00e1lez at any stage of this proceeding.
