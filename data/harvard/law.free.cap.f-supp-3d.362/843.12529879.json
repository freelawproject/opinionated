(collectively \"Defendants\"), seeking injunctive relief for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\")\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, as codified at California Civil Code \u00a7\u00a7 51 - 53. He claims he was denied access to Enchanted Florist (\"the Store\"), a shop located at 1079 Emerald Bay Road in Lake Tahoe, California, that is owned by Defendants. Presently before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (ECF 19-1). As set forth below, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a quadriplegic who cannot walk and has significant dexterity impairments. He uses a wheelchair for mobility and has a specially equipped van.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff avers that he visited the Store on four different occasions between September and November of 2015 and encountered barriers to access. More specifically, Plaintiff claims that Defendants have allowed the paint identifying the handicap parking space to fade. Plaintiff also claims that the wheelchair access ramp attached to the store building is out of compliance with the ADA's maximum slope of 8.3 percent. According to Plaintiff, these defects have deterred him from patronizing Defendants' store. As a result, Plaintiff initiated this action alleging violations of state and federal law. Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claims on two grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, Defendants contend that because the handicap parking space has been repainted and they have entered into an agreement with a contractor to repaint the spot every year, Plaintiff's claim regarding the parking space is moot. Decl. of Jeri Oishi, ECF 19-2 \u00b6 4. Second, Defendants point out that the South Lake Tahoe Building Division (\"the Division\"), an enforcing agency, determined that rebuilding the ramp to fully comply with the ADA would be a hardship because it would require extending the ramp into the drive aisle of the parking lot, impeding vehicle access into the lot. Decl. of Kristin Blocher, ECF 19-3 at 4. Additionally, the Division determined that because the ramp exceeded the maximum slope limit under the ADA by only three-fourths of a percent, it provided an \"equivalent means of\n   access\" and was therefore exempt from ADA compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants argue that given the Division's finding, the Plaintiff's claim as to the access ramp is moot as well. Defendants thus ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiff's ADA claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state law claims. Plaintiff responds by arguing that Defendants' remedial measures do not sufficiently demonstrate that the violation will not recur and that the Division is not qualified to determine exemptions under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and are presumptively without jurisdiction over civil actions.\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v.

In\n   <em>\n    Houston v. 7-Eleven, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-60004,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20351970\">\n    2014 WL 351970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. Jan. 31, 2014), the court held that given that defendant spent a considerable amount of money to renovate their store parking lot to comply with ADA requirements, combined with the defendant's \"adequate policies and practices in place to ensure\" compliance, it was not reasonable to expect the violations to recur.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Similarly, Defendants here have a policy in place-an annual agreement with a contractor to repaint the parking lot-to properly maintain ADA compliance. ECF 19-2, \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Given Defendant's history of complying with ADA requirements and the considerable sums of money spent on bringing the parking lot into compliance, the Court has no reason to believe the handicap parking space will not remain in compliance. Accordingly, the Court is convinced that the violations could not reasonably be expected to recur. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim pertaining to the parking space is moot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Access Ramp\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue that although the access ramp leading to the Store exceeds the ADA's maximum slope of 8.3 percent, the access ramp is \"no longer a legally recognized barrier to Plaintiff's access to the Store.\" ECF No. 19-1 at 4. The Division found that reconstructing the ramp to comply with ADA standards would be a hardship because it would require the ramp to extend into the parking lot drive aisle, impeding vehicles from traveling in and out of the parking lot. ECF No. 19-3. Additionally, the Division concluded that the current ramp provides for equivalent means of access as it only exceeds the maximum slope by three-fourths a percent for 14 feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, Defendants take the position that because the access ramp is technically no longer noncompliant, Plaintiff's claim pertaining to the ramp is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's only argument in response is that the Division does not have the authority to relieve defendants of the requirements of federal law. ECF No. 21 at 15. The Court rejects Plaintiff's argument, because the engineer who surveyed the Store on behalf of the Division is a Certified Access Specialist with specialized knowledge of accessibility standards whose job is to make such determinations. ECF 19-3 at 4. Given the Division's determination that the access ramp provides an equivalent means of access, the Court finds that the ramp is no longer in violation of the ADA. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim as to the access ramp is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons just stated, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 7) is GRANTED. Inasmuch as the Court does not believe that the shortcomings of Plaintiff's Complaint can be rectified through amendment, no leave to file an amended pleading will be permitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, because the Court has dismissed Plaintiff's ADA claims as moot, the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state law claims. Since the case has now been concluded in its entirety, the Clerk of Court is directed to close the file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Having determined that oral argument would not be of material assistance, Defendants' Motion was submitted on the briefs in accordance with E.D. Local Rule 230(g).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are taken, at times verbatim, from Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. ECF 18.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In his response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff also argues that Defendants have not demonstrated that the newly painted parking space complies with the ADA's required dimensions. ECF No. 21 at 6-7. Because Plaintiff limited his complaints to the lack of clearly painted lines, the Court will not consider this argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Oliver\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825614\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/654/903/#p905\">\n     654 F.3d at 908-09\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Where the claim is one of discrimination under the ADA due to the presence of architectural barriers at a place of public accommodation, we have held that the relevant 'grounds' are the allegedly non-compliant architectural features at the facility.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    While leave to amend is normally freely given, where, as here, any such amendment would constitute an exercise in futility, leave need not be provided.\n    <em>\n     Ascon Props., Inc. v.
