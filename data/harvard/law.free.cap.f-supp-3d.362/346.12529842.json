At that hearing, the court inquired as to whether Plaintiff, Roxanne Adams, Administrator of the Estate of Jamycheal M. Mitchell, would be entitled to a fee for her role in this case. Following the hearing, Plaintiff filed a Brief Concerning the Administrator's Right to Compensation (\"Brief Concerning Compensation\"). ECF No. 284. The court has reviewed the matter and is of the opinion that the Virginia Code excludes the distribution of a fee from the wrongful-death settlement proceeds to the administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Virginia Code \u00a7 8.01-54(C) specifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The amount recovered in [a wrongful-death] action\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be paid to the personal representative who\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   first pay the costs and reasonable attorney's fees and then distribute the amount specifically allocated to the payment of hospital, medical, and funeral expenses. The remainder of the amount recovered\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   thereafter be distributed ... to the beneficiaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The expression of specific distributions provided by the Virginia Code implies the exclusion of other distributions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Woodley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643810\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/560/\">\n    290 Va. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12643810\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/777/560/\">\n    777 S.E.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (citing\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.
