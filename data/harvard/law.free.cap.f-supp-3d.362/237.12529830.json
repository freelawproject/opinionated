The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the Amended Complaint is almost 200 paragraphs long, only three paragraphs (one page) include a description of Plaintiffs or the harms they have suffered. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.) Plaintiff Clean Air Council \"is a member-supported environmental organization\" based in Philadelphia \"dedicated to protecting and defending everyone's right to breath clean air\" by creating \"sustainability and public health initiatives, using public education, community action, government oversight, and enforcement of environmental laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff S.B. is a seven-year-old Philadelphian who \"suffers from severe seasonal allergies\" that are \"directly impacted by the climate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) His allergies \"have been exacerbated and will continue to worsen as climate change becomes more severe.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"For example, S.B. needed to be hospitalized during Hurricane Irene in 2011....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) S.B. \"loves to play sports,\" and fears that \"increasing temperatures and extreme weather events\" will make it difficult for him to engage in outdoor activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff B.B., an eleven-year-old Chester Country resident, is \"passionate about protecting the environment, and experiences anxiety\" about climate change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.) He \"regularly takes notice of news events\" concerning climate change. B.B. \"experienced the frightening impact of Super Storm Sandy [in 2012] and Hurricane Irene [in 2011].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) B.B. suffers from asthma, which he believes \"is exacerbated by climate change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Challenged Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Approximately half the Amended Complaint is a recitation of domestic and international treaty provisions, studies, declarations, and administrative actions effected over the last fifty years addressing air\n   pollution and climate change. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-138.) As alleged, \"[c]limate change 'refers to changes in the totality of attributes that define climate.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) Because of \"climate change\" (or \"global warming\"), \"the United States has experienced a steady increase in extreme weather events that have destroyed American homes and businesses, displaced millions of United States citizens, and caused the tragic loss of lives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.) Measured by increasing average air temperatures, climate change is caused by rising carbon emissions and the burning of coal, oil, and natural gases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27-28, 43, 46-47.) As alleged, climate change causes \"more frequent, extreme, and costly weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes,\" impairing human health and disproportionately affecting children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 59, 61, 62, 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The United States Government purportedly has known for some fifty years that climate change \"presents a clear and present danger to the health and welfare of its citizens and an immediate threat to the planet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-85;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-102.) Defendants have nonetheless acted with \"reckless and deliberate indifference\" to the danger of climate change by \"roll[ing] back regulations and practices previously directed at addressing and minimizing the United States['] contribution to climate change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge: (1) the President's March 16, 2017 \"Budget Blueprint,\" proposing reduced funding for numerous agencies, including the EPA; (2) the President's March 28, 2017 Executive Order, directing agencies to review current environmental legislation; (3) Administrator Scott Pruitt's replacement of those on the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors with individuals purportedly tied to regulated industries; and (4) various EPA, DOE, and DOI decisions to halt the work of climate change advisory boards, to alter climate change terminology on public websites, to reduce staffing at agencies with operations touching on the environment, to hire researchers with industry ties, and to leave various science-related positions unfilled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 142-43, 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   These actions, which Plaintiffs call \"the Rollbacks,\" have increased the Nation's contribution to climate change and \"endanger[ed] the lives and welfare of United States citizens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) Climate analysts estimate that the Rollbacks \"will result in a 3.4% rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166.) This, in turn, will \"exacerbate[ ] the consequences of a known danger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 170.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As alleged, Defendants have violated: (1) Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment due process rights; (2) Plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights; and (3) Defendants' duty as sovereign trustees to hold the nation's resources in public trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 172-97.) Plaintiffs ask me to declare unconstitutional any of Defendants' future actions that could aggravate climate change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants argue that I should dismiss the Amended Complaint: (1) for Plaintiffs' lack of standing; (2) for failure to state a claim; and (3) as barred by the Administrative Procedure Act. (Mot. Dismiss, Doc. No. 18; Suppl. Mot. Dismiss, Doc. No. 31.) I will dismiss on the first two alternative grounds. I will not address the third.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Moreover, even as alleged, many of Defendants' challenged actions could have nothing to do with Plaintiffs' injuries because the actions\n   did not increase the level of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Plaintiffs attack numerous personnel and budgetary decisions, including: (1) the President's proposed Federal agency budget cuts; (2) the DOI suspending \"the work of hundreds of advisory boards\"; (3) the EPA deleting its climate science website; (4) DOE eliminating the words \"clean energy\" from its website; (5) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dissolving its climate science advisory committee; (6) the EPA ending its Climate Leadership Program; (7) the EPA reducing its staff; (8) the EPA changing its rules regarding which scientists may serve on the Science Advisory Board; (9) replacing EPA scientists with different advisors; (10) the failure of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to hire a director; and (11) National Park Service advisory board members resigning because their advice was ignored.

Presumably, I must predict the actions the Department of State would have taken under Secretary Tillerson that it will not now take under Secretary Pompeo and how Plaintiff's injuries are traceable to that difference.

Plaintiffs simply ignore that Defendant agencies and officers\n   <em>\n    do not produce\n   </em>\n   greenhouse gases, but act to regulate those third parties that do: innumerable businesses and private industries. The materials on which Plaintiffs rely make this clear. For instance, Plaintiffs allege that \"the combined effects of the Rollbacks will result in a 3.4% rise in greenhouse gas emissions.\" (Am.

Yet, their source document for this allegation states that \"[t]he Trump Administration's climate policies,\n   <em>\n    if fully implemented and not compensated by other actors\n   </em>\n   , are projected to flatten US emissions instead of them continuing on a downward trend.\" Niklas Hohne et al.,\n   <em>\n    Action by China and India slows emissions growth, President Trump's policies likely to cause US emissions to flatten\n   </em>\n   , (May 15, 2017) http://climateactiontracker.org/assets/publications/briefing_papers/CAT2017-0515Briefing_IndiaChina-USA.pdf (emphasis added).
