The facts as described below are not in dispute, except to the extent indicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    1. Labor and Delivery Care\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 2014, Ms. Hartmann learned she was pregnant with I.M. by a positive home pregnancy test. The pregnancy was later confirmed by a physician at MCHC. Ms. Hartmann received prenatal care at MCHC with Dr. Singaravelu, Dr. Blair, and Nurse Rubino. She chose MCHC for her prenatal care as this was the closest facility that Medicaid approved. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 175.) Ms. Hartmann was 24 years old at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the end of February 2015, Ms. Hartmann presented to Bon Secours Hospital for a routine sonogram. Ms. Hartmann testified that Nurse Rubino told her the baby was large and Dr. Blair would have to schedule an induction at ORMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176.) At that time, Ms. Hartmann was told to go home and wait for a call for the induction date. Her birthing plan was to deliver at ORMC, with the assigned physician employed at MCHC on the day of her delivery. Ms. Hartmann knew that MCHC patients delivered at ORMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ms. Hartmann's estimated due date was March 1, 2015. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 7.) On March 5, 2015, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Ms. Hartmann's water broke while she was in her home. Her contractions were about five minutes apart. She immediately called ORMC to inform them of her expected arrival. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177.) She called her mother, who drove her to ORMC. They arrived at ORMC around 12:00 a.m. on March 6, 2015. They waited in the Emergency Room for approximately fifteen minutes before being taken upstairs to a room in Labor and Delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A nurse was present in the room when Ms. Hartmann arrived and took her vital signs. Ms. Hartmann testified that during the time period from 12:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., a nurse placed an intravenous line (\"IV\") in her arm, connected her to a fetal heart monitor, and did not palpate her stomach or physically touch her for an examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178.) A female physician came to her room for the first time around 2:00 a.m. and did a vaginal examination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Hartmann was 2.3 cm dilated and was told she would receive Pitocin if the labor was not progressing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The examination took approximately five minutes and a vaginal delivery was still anticipated as there were no complications and Ms. Hartmann had had a prior vaginal delivery with her son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Between 2:00 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., Ms. Hartmann periodically walked around and rested in bed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) Around 6:30 a.m., Ms. Hartmann asked for an epidural as her contractions were worsening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When she received the epidural, the baby's heart rate decreased. Ms. Hartmann was given oxygen and positioned onto her left side. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The fetal heart rate returned to normal after ten minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An injection of Pitocin was ordered by Dr. Jouve and administered approximately thirty minutes after the epidural to augment labor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nurse Bast was the labor and delivery nurse assigned to Ms. Hartmann's delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 309.) Nurse Bast was as employee of ORMC. (Decl. of Jayne L. Brayer, Esq. (\"Brayer Decl.\") Ex. I., at 9-10 (Nurse Bast's Deposition Transcript (\"Bast Dep.\") (Dkt. No. 120) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Labor and Delivery Admission History and Physical Note at 2:32 a.m. reflects that Ms. Hartmann was having contractions every five minutes and her cervix was 2cm dilated, 60% effaced, and the fetus was at -3 station. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 8.) The plan was for expectant management, labs, an epidural when needed, with a vaginal delivery expected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. DiCostanzo is an obstetrician-gynecologist (\"OBGYN\"). (Brayer Decl. Ex. H., at 11-12 (Dr. DiCostanzo's Deposition Transcripts (\"DiCostanzo Dep.\") ).) In March 2015 she was employed by MCHC and had privileges at ORMC. (DiCostanzo Dep. 15.) Dr. DiCostanzo testified that there was always an OBGYN from MCHC on call for ORMC, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22), and that whenever an MCHC patient was at ORMC, someone from ORMC would contact MCHC staff to let them know, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Dr. DiCostanzo worked a shift at ORMC from 8:00 a.m. on March 6, 2015, to 8:00 a.m. on March 7, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) A site manager at MCHC set Dr. DiCostanzo's schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) When Dr. DiCostanzo managed labor and deliveries at ORMC, she managed those cases with hospital staff and nurses from ORMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Dr. DiCostanzo testified that she first examined Ms. Hartmann at 9:26 a.m. on March 6, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181.) When Dr. DiCostanzo examined her, there was a gush of meconium\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stained fluid and, with that gush, Dr. DiCostanzo felt the cord come down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-84.) After Dr. DiCostanzo\n   diagnosed the cord prolapse, Nurse Bast summoned help by yelling \"cord prolapse\" so that about twelve people rushed into the room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185-86.) They called all the relevant departments to prepare for a stat caesarian section (\"c-section\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 186-87.) Nurse Bast turned off the Pitocin, increased fluids, repositioned Ms. Hartmann and gave her oxygen. (Aff. of Christopher Rogers, Esq. (\"Rogers's Aff.\") Ex. D, at 17 (Dkt. No. 111-12) (ORMC records pertaining to Ms. Hartmann (\"Hartmann ORMC Rec.\") ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. DiCostanzo kept her hand in Ms. Hartmann's vagina and uterus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185.) The cord was still pulsating. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. DiCostanzo lifted the cord above the baby's head and, since Ms. Hartmann was eight centimeters dilated, had her push twice to attempt a vaginal delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs correctly point out that the ORMC record pertaining to Ms. Hartmann includes a note that Dr. DiCostanzo first examined Ms. Hartmann at 9:24 a.m. and called for the stat c-section at 9:26 a.m., not that she first examined her at 9:26 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 180 (citing Hartmann ORMC Rec. 18).) Ms. Hartmann testified that Dr. DiCostanzo examined her for about five minutes before she felt the cord prolapse and before ordering the emergency c-section. (Rogers's Aff. Ex. F, at 123 (Ms. Hartmann's Deposition Transcript (\"Hartmann Dep.\") ).).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Hartmann was taken to the operating room (\"OR\") at 9:38 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 13.) She was in the OR by 9:41 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The skin incision for the c-section procedure commenced at 9:52 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff I.M. was delivered at 9:54 a.m., weighing 9 pounds 7 ounces. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Her gestational age was 40 weeks and five days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Kothari is an anesthesiologist. On March 6, 2015, he was an employee of NAPA and provided anesthesiologic services at ORMC. (Brayer Decl. Ex. L, at 10-12, 15 (Dr. Kothari's Deposition Transcript (\"Kothari Dep.\") ).) There are usually multiple anesthesiologists from NAPA on the premises at ORMC. (Kothari Dep. 18.) Dr. Kothari testified that once Ms. Hartmann was brought to the OR, there was a \"struggle\" to transfer her to the OR table because her bed and the OR table were not aligned, and the bed needed to be moved closer to an outlet because there was no extension cord in the room at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. DiCostanzo testified that from the time she diagnosed the cord prolapse to the time they left for the operating room, it was difficult to trace the baby's heart rate. She recalls that at one point the fetal heart rate increased above 80 beats per minute-there was a 10 second segment at 9:37 a.m. that registered at 180 beats per minute and Dr. DiCostanzo could not rule out that it was an artifact. (DiCostanzo Dep. 210-12.) Nurse Bast testified that from 9:25 a.m. onward, it was unknown if the fetal heart rate was bradycardic\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or if the baby was suffering from hypoxia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 302.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nurse Bast testified that the last time she worked on a cord prolapse case, the baby was delivered in 16 minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 311.) Nurse Bast testified that it was her understanding that with a cord prolapse, the baby should be delivered in less than 30 minutes, \"decision to incision,\" because there is decreased oxygenation to the fetus and the goal is to prevent hypoxemia and acidosis to the baby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 310.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    2. Initial Neonatal Care\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nurse Hines is a nurse practitioner. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 66.) She has a doctorate degree in Neonatology, a Certificate as a Neonatal Nurse Practitioner and Master's Degree in Nursing and Health Care Administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (\"NRP\") is an educational program in neonatal resuscitation run by the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Heart Association and is delineated in the Neonatal Resuscitation Textbook. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) NRP provides guidelines and protocols for neonatal resuscitation when there is perinatal distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.) Nurse Hines is a NRP instructor and provider. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nurse Hines testified that when she covered shifts at ORMC \"an attending neonatologist [was] assigned as [her] backup, as a collaborating physician,\" (Rogers's Aff. Ex. G, at 10 (Nurse Hines's Deposition Transcript (\"Hines Dep.\") ), and that this person supervised her and worked with her to make decisions about the neonates together, (Hines Dep. 12) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nurse Hines testified she arrived in the operating room about five minutes before Ms. Hartmann was wheeled in for her emergency c-section. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) Nurse Hines testified that she confirmed that the operating room equipment was ready for resuscitation. This included ensuring that the radiant warmer was turned on, that the oxygen was turned on, that suction was available, that the meconium aspirator was attached to the endotracheal tube and assembled correctly, and that the pulse oximeter was available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After I.M. was delivered at 9:54 a.m., she was brought to the radiant warmer. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 19.) Nurse Hines testified that she received the baby within 10 seconds of life after the umbilical cord was clamped and cut. (Hines Dep. 87.) The infant was pale, flaccid, unresponsive, and not breathing when she was given to Nurse Hines. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 21.) Nurse Hines testified she immediately intubated the baby within 20 seconds of life using a meconium aspirator with a 4.0 endotracheal tube. (Hines Dep. 87, 89.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Within the first minute of life, the infant's heart rate was less than 50-60 beats per minute. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 26.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   A scant\n   amount of meconium was suctioned, and the vocal cords were visualized with no meconium seen below the vocal cords. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 24.) Nurse Hines then proceeded to dry and stimulate the baby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Chest compressions were started and continued until the infant was re-intubated with a 3.5 endotracheal tube. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Nurse Hines observed the baby gasp two to three times at approximately two minutes of life. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 28 (citing Hines Dep. 96; ORMC Rec. 9).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bilateral breath sounds were heard, and the end tidal carbon dioxide detector posted positive results. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 29 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 9).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chest compressions were stopped after 90 seconds as the heart rate was rechecked and found to be in the 140s. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 30 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 9).) Ventilation through the endotracheal tube continued and the baby's color improved with increasing heart rate and perfusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 9).) Apgar scores\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   were 1 at 1 minute (1 for heart rate less than 100 beats per minute); 3 at 5 minutes (2 for heart and 1 for color); 6 at 7 minutes (2 for heart rate, 1 for respiration, 1 for tone, and 2 for color); and 8 at 10 minutes (2 for heart rate, 2 for respiration, 2 for color, 1 for tone, and 1 for reflex). (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 32.) The pH values of the blood specimens taken from the infant's umbilical cord were 7.087 from the umbilical cord artery and 7.239 from the umbilical cord vein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    3. Care Provided in the NICU\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I.M. was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (\"NICU\") for management at 10:15 a.m. or 10:16 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 34.) I.M. was transferred to the NICU with 100% FiO2\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   via endotracheal tube and Neo-T resuscitator with pressures of\n   20/5 and she showed good chest expansion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) The baby's first vital signs were recorded by the nurses in the NICU at 10:16 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Her blood pressure was 98/44 mmHg, her heart rate was 163 beats per minute, her temperature was 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and her blood oxygen saturation was 100%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) A specimen of venous blood was collected at 10:15 a.m. from the infant's right arm for blood gas analysis and the results were available at 10:22 a.m. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 38 (citing Hines Dep. 122; I.M. ORMC Rec. 33-34).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The results from this analysis revealed a pH of 6.951, pCo2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) of 60.7, p02 (partial pressure of oxygen) of 88.8, and a base excess of -19.9. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Portable chest and abdominal x-rays were ordered by Nurse Hines at 10:22 a.m. and were performed between 10:30 a.m. and 10:39 a.m. The results were available at 11:19 a.m. and showed that the tip of the endotracheal tube was at the level of the clavicles. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 40 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 61).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A 10:50 a.m. note filed by Nurse Adrienne Quinn (\"Nurse Quinn\") at 11:16 a.m. reflects the baby had intermittent twitching in her lower extremities. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 41 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 13; Hines Dep. 135).) The note reads in relevant part, \"infant noted to open eyes but tone remains low &amp; appears to have intermittent twitching in lower extremities.\" (ORMC Rec. 13.) Nurse Hines testified about the note, \"Adrienne's note is at 10:50 a.m., but it wasn't filed until 11:16, so I can't tell from this exactly when that occurred.\" (Hines Dep. 135.) Plaintiffs point out that Nurse Hines also testified that the twitching probably occurred before 10:50 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 41 (citing Hines Dep. 133-34).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Nurse Hines testified that she does not know when Dr. Senguttuvan was first called. (Hines Dep. 86.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurse Hines did not call Dr. Senguttuvan about the infant. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 82.) Dr. Senguttuvan was not at the hospital when Nurse Hines was called to the operating room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) Nurse Hines does not know when Dr. Senguttuvan arrived at the NICU. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan is a neonatologist. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 85.) On March 6, 2015, Dr. Senguttuvan was the backup physician at ORMC assigned to Nurse Hines. (Senguttuvan's 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25 (citing Rogers's Aff. Ex. K, at 29 (Dr. Senguttuvan's Deposition Transcript \"Senguttuvan Dep.\") ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr.\n   Senguttuvan is Board Certified in Pediatrics and Neonatology. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 86.) In March 2015, Dr. Senguttuvan was an on-call neonatologist at ORMC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Dr. Senguttuvan testified that no neonatologist was present at ORMC on the morning of March 6, 2015 until she arrived. (Senguttuvan Dep. 38.) Dr. Senguttuvan further testified that Nurse Hines was the only neonatology nurse practitioner on the premises at ORMC the morning of I.M.'s delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) When a neonatologist is called in, one of her responsibilities is to assess the condition of the newborn, to identify any problems and to determine the cause of the problems. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 268.) When Dr. Senguttuvan arrived, she had authority to instruct Nurse Hines to do certain things as medically necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 269.) The nurse practitioners could look to Dr. Senguttuvan for guidance and instruction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 270.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Whenever a baby was transferred from ORMC to a tertiary care center, a backup physician would be called in to assist with the transfer process. (Senguttuvan's 56.1 \u00b6 32 (citing Senguttuvan Dep. 36-37).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that her role with the NICU team was to arrange for I.M.'s transfer to Westchester Medical Center (\"WMC\") for cooling. (Senguttuvan Dep. 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Before Dr. Senguttuvan started working as an on-call neonatologist at ORMC, she had to provide documentation to and complete an interview with ORMC. (Senguttuvan Dep. 21-22.) Dr. Senguttuvan was given an orientation at ORMC in July 2011 when she started working there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) At ORMC, Dr. Senguttuvan wore a security badge with her name and picture that said \"Orange Regional Medical Center\" on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the morning of March 6, 2015, Nurse Quinn called Dr. Senguttuvan and said that Nurse Hines had an intubated baby and needed Dr. Senguttuvan to come to the hospital. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 91-93.) Dr. Senguttuvan testified that she does not recall when exactly she received this call. (Senguttuvan Dep. 32-33.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Senguttuvan did not receive any additional information between the telephone call and her arrival at ORMC. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 95.) I.M.'s treatment at ORMC had already begun before Dr. Senguttuvan arrived, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88), and indeed, I.M. was already in the NICU when Dr. Senguttuvan arrived, (Senguttuvan Dep. 115). Dr. Senguttuvan was not\n   present at ORMC during I.M.'s resuscitation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When Dr. Senguttuvan arrived at ORMC, she started to help with the process of transferring I.M. to WMC and completing the electronic process of orders. (Senguttuvan Dep. 52.) Dr. Senguttuvan's first entries into I.M.'s ORMC chart were timed at 10:49 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 102.) Dr. Senguttuvan's first note in the ORMC chart was timed at 10:50 a.m. and stated, \"Called for backup. Cord prolapse, 6.9 PH likely HIE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) Dr. Senguttuvan testified that she arrived at ORMC sometime before 10:49 a.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 276.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that she evaluated I.M.'s condition, including her hemodynamic stability and pH level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 271.) She prepared progress notes because she provided medical care and treatment to the patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 272.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    a. Sodium Bicarbonate and Phenobarbital Orders\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At what time and by whom the sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital were ordered and administered to I.M. is disputed. Nurse Hines and Dr. Senguttuvan were responsible for when the sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital were given. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 221.) Nurse Hines, Dr. Senguttuvan, and the ORMC nurses were responsible for monitoring seizure activity in the baby, and for the placement of the endotracheal tube. (Hines Dep. 141-42.) Nurse Hines testified that she and Dr. Senguttuvan were also responsible for monitoring the ventilator settings, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 140), and for the timely ordering of the phenobarbital, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 248).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that she placed medication orders for I.M. to complete processes that had already been started. (Senguttuvan Dep. 52.) In particular, Dr. Senguttuvan placed orders into ORMC's computer to complete the \"medication override\" of events that had already happened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) A medication can be \"overrided\" and given before the physical act of placing an electronic order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) Cabinet overrides allow the nurses to retrieve medication from the cabinet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107.) After medication is retrieved by a nurse via a cabinet override, a regular order is entered to complete the electronic record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that I.M.'s records include a cabinet override for sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital, that this cabinet override occurred before she arrived at ORMC, and that her order for sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital for I.M. served only to \"complete electronic records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Two unsuccessful attempts were made to place a peripheral intravenous (\"PIV\") line by the nursing staff sometime before 10:50 a.m. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 42.) In her 56.1 statement, Nurse Hines states that \"Dr. Senguttuvan ordered a sodium bicarbonate injection at 10:53 a.m. and it was administered at 11:04 a.m. after a normal saline bolus via UVC line [umbilical vessel catheter line].\" (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 44 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 9, 13, 46).) Nurse Hines testified that Dr. Senguttuvan ordered the sodium bicarbonate at 10:53 a.m. because Nurse Hines was establishing the vascular access on the baby. (Hines Dep. 126.) Nurse Hines also testified that she was not\n   sure when exactly the UVC line was first placed, but that the sodium bicarbonate was first given about 20 minutes after the UVC line was placed. She knew this because a saline bolus had to be administered via a UVC line before sodium bicarbonate could be administered, and a saline bolus takes about 20 minutes to administer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127-28.) I.M.'s chart includes a note that the UVC line was placed at 11:04 a.m., (I.M. ORMC Rec. 13), but Nurse Hines testified that the time of the note is not necessarily reflective of when the actual line was placed. (Hines Dep. 128.) Nurse Hines also testified that Phenobarbital was first administered at 11:58 a.m. (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 47 (citing I.M. ORMC Rec. 12); Hines Dep. 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan's testimony that sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital were administered before she arrived, and that she only entered a cabinet override, conflicts with Nurse Hines's testimony that the sodium bicarbonate injection was administered at 11:04 a.m., and that the phenobarbital was first given at 11:58 a.m., both after Dr. Senguttuvan arrived. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 44, 109.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs incorrectly state that both Nurse Hines and Dr. Senguttuvan testified that \"the standard of care was to administer sodium bicarbonate to treat acidosis.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 54.) In the portion of Nurse Hines's transcript Plaintiffs cite to, she did not testify that the \"standard of care\" is to administer sodium bicarbonate immediately-she testified that administering sodium bicarbonate is\n   <em>\n    one of the ways\n   </em>\n   acidosis may be treated, and emphasized that it is only appropriate once \"you've obtained a blood gas [measure] that clinically indicates that bicarbonate ... should be used.\" (Hines Dep. 38.) Dr. Senguttuvan also testified that administering sodium bicarbonate is \"\n   <em>\n    one of the modalities\n   </em>\n   \" of treating acidosis, and that if it is determined that a patient is acidotic, sodium bicarbonate should be administered immediately-she did not testify that administering sodium bicarbonate was the \"standard of care.\" (Senguttuvan Dep. 97 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that \"[d]ue to the failure to timely give sodium bicarbonate, the venous pH of 6.951 was worse than the cord pH taken at the time of birth of 7.239,\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 224 (citing Hines Dep. 125) ), but the portion of Nurse Hines's deposition transcript they cite to does not support their proposition. Nurse Hines testified that the pH change was caused by \"acidosis from lactic acid that collects in the body\" and that the cause of the lactic acidosis was that the baby was \"depressed at birth.\" (Hines Dep. 125.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan and Nurse Hines both testified that they are aware of the NRP guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senguttuvan Dep. 89, 92; Hines Dep. 17-19, 29, 90.) The sixth edition of the Neonatal Resuscitation Textbook was in effect on March 6, 2015, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 53), and reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The use of sodium bicarbonate during neonatal resuscitation is controversial. Its use may be helpful to correct metabolic acidosis that results from buildup of lactic acid that may occur while the baby has hypoxemia and poor cardiac output ... sodium bicarbonate can be harmful, particularly if given too early in a resuscitation. Use of sodium bicarbonate may increase the serum pH but can worsen intracellular acidosis. You must be certain the ventilation of the lungs is adequate before administering sodium bicarbonate. When sodium bicarbonate mixes with acid, CO2 is formed. The lungs must be adequately ventilated to remove the CO2. If you decide to give sodium bicarbonate, remember that it is very hypertonic and irritating to blood vessels, and, therefore, must be given into a large vein, from which there is good blood return.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (Hines's 56.1 \u00b6 54.) As noted in this quote, Defendants argue that Sodium bicarbonate can be dangerous and its use during neonatal resuscitation is controversial. (Senguttuvan's 56.1 \u00b6 81-82.) Indeed, Defendants argue that infusions of sodium bicarbonate are associated with increased mortality rates and increased intracranial hemorrhage in infants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Regarding phenobarbital, Nurse Hines testified that if she were to observe seizures in a neonate, the standard of care would require her to order phenobarbital, but that she would not order phenobarbital prophylactically in the event that a baby was born depressed but had not yet had seizures because that was a decision the tertiary care center would make under its \"cool-cap protocol.\" (Hines Dep. 44-45.) Nurse Hines also testified that twitching in a baby's lower extremities is \"possibly seizure activity,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 134), but also noted that \"[i]nfants can present [seizures] in a wide variety of ways that are typical to a newborn as opposed to an adult.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that abdominal movement and posturing can indicate that a baby is having a seizure. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 236.) Dr. Senguttuvan further testified that when seizures are diagnosed, the standard of care requires administration of phenobarbital to prevent excitation of the neuronal cells that can hurt cell inflammation in the brain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 237 (citing Senguttuvan Dep. 101).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   She further testified that it is not an accepted standard of care to give phenobarbital before the occurrence of seizures. (Senguttuvan Dep. 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    b. Additional Testing and Adjustment of the Endotracheal Tube\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan placed an order for an arterial blood gas specimen to be taken via arterial puncture. It was collected at 11:55 a.m. and results were available at 11:57 a.m. The results showed a pH of 7.545, a pC02 of 22.9, a p02 of 291.5, and a base excess of -1.2. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A repeat portable chest x-ray was ordered by Nurse Hines at 11:44 a.m. It was performed between 11:50 a.m. and 12:06 p.m., and the results were available 12:21 p.m. The x-ray revealed that the endotracheal tube had moved, and the tip was now further advanced in the carina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NICU was aware of this and the tube was readjusted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) When an endotracheal tube is placed, the tip should be just above the carina, and it should not be above the clavicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 249-51.) Nurse Hines testified that the \"optimal positioning\" for the endotracheal tube\"is between the clavicle and the carina,\" (Hines Dep. 143), and that if the endotracheal tube was seen to be at the level of the clavicles, it would be adjusted immediately, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 144.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Senguttuvan testified that the whole NICU team, of which she was a part, was responsible for monitoring the vent settings and making sure they were appropriate, and for monitoring the endotracheal tube and making sure it is properly placed. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 259-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nurse Hines testified that the second x-ray showed that the endotracheal tube was low in position and that there was \"atelectasis on the right upper lobe.\" (Hines Dep. 153-54.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Atelectasis of the lungs may indicate that a portion of the lungs may not be expanded, or it could indicate an aspiration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) Nurse Hines testified that there was no way to tell what the cause of the atelectasis was, but she noted that I.M. had respiratory distress because she was depressed at birth,\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that it was possible that the placement of the endotracheal tube caused the atelectasis.

Dr. Danoff stated that he is board certified in pediatrics and has practiced pediatrics and neonatal medicine for over 50 years. Dr. Danoff stated that he is licensed to practice medicine in New York and Connecticut. He received a bio-chemistry degree from Harvard College and a medical degree from New York University. (Decl. of Jordan K. Merson, Esq. (\"Merson Decl.\") Ex. 14, at 2, 5 (Dr. Danoff's Affidavit and Expert Report (\"Danoff Expert Rep.\") (Dkt.

During that time he was an attending neonatologist at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital's NICU. (Danoff Expert Rep. 5.) Dr. Danoff stated that he is an instructor in neonatal resuscitation, a program developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Anesthesiology and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Dr. Danoff also stated that he was hired as a consultant to the department of health of the State of Connecticut in 2010.

(Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 63.) Dr. Danoff was never board certified in neonatal-perinatal medicine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Dr. Danoff keeps current only by making rounds at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and also by talking to students, fellows, residents and other neonatologists. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-29.) He has testified once as an expert witness in the last 5 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Dr. Danoff has not authored any publications in the fields of pediatrics or neonatology since 1995, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 127), nor has he authored any publication regarding neonatal care in the face of an umbilical cord prolapse, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126). Dr. Danoff had never before heard or read that it is dangerous to give a neonate sodium bicarbonate without first administering saline because of the deleterious effects that it has on the infant's brain and heart and that it can cause cerebral hemorrhage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Danoff is unfamiliar with research which formed the basis for a 10-year old article titled \"Sodium bicarbonate, basically useless therapy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Doctor Danoff reviewed the ORMC medical records pertaining to Ms. Hartmann and to I.M., Plaintiffs' medical records from WMC, Good Shephard Rehabilitation Hospital (GSRH), MCHC, Luger Scranton Rehabilitation Center, Ms. Hartmann's interrogatory responses and deposition transcript, the deposition transcripts of Nurse Hines, Dr. Senguttuvan, and the expert reports of Dr. Hamar and Dr. Steele. (Danoff Expert Rep. 2.) However, Dr. Danoff did not review I.M.'s x-ray films. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 169.) The opinions in his expert report are based on his \"training, experience, and education,\" and his review of these materials. (Danoff Expert Rep. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dr. Danoff concluded that the main deviations from the standard of care were the untimely administration of sodium bicarbonate in the face of severe acidosis, untimely administration of phenobarbital for convulsions, and improper administration of ventilatory care. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 136.) First, Dr. Danoff opined that I.M.'s low cord pH and that she was floppy and bradycardic and cyanotic at birth, indicated that she had severe acidosis and that sodium bicarbonate would be needed to treat her. (Dr. Danoff Ex. Rep. 7.) He opined that \"it was incumbent upon the neonatal staff to immediately and without delay suction the meconium from the trachea and provide adequate ventilation and respiratory and vascular support to maintain proper oxygenation and cardiovascular circulation\" and to immediately administer sodium bicarbonate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Danoff points out that I.M. was born at 9:54 a.m., the sodium bicarbonate was not ordered until an hour later at 10:53 a.m., and not administered until 11:04 a.m. He opined that such a delay was a deviation from the standard of care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Second, Dr. Danoff opined that the endotracheal tube was not properly placed as evidenced by the x-ray which revealed it was too high in the trachea and that this caused I.M. to experience further hypoxia. He pointed to I.M.'s lower pH an hour after intubation as evidence that she was not properly intubated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Third, Dr. Danoff opined that the twitching I.M. exhibited at 10:50 a.m. was seizure activity and that phenobarbital should have been administered immediately. Instead, phenobarbital was not given until 11:58 a.m., an hour after the twitching began. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Dr. Danoff concludes that these deviations were the direct cause of persistent acidosis and significant hypoxic brain damage, and HIE resulting in permanent and irreversible neurological abnormalities. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 190.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Dr. Danoff also opined that I.M. was \"dead\" at the moment of birth, (Danoff Dep. 76, 84, 122), and that there was no doubt that I.M. suffered irreversible brain damage before she was delivered, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 161-62). Dr. Danoff had no criticism of the size of the endotracheal tube used, stating that a 3.5 endotracheal tube is adequate, and a 4.0 endotracheal tube is \"great.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 170-72.) Based on the Apgar score readings in I.M.'s chart, Dr. Danoff testified that \"I don't think the baby breathed for the first, I mean really breathed, for seven minutes.\" (Danoff Dep. 167-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    b. Dr. Hamar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs also served an expert report from Benjamin Hamar, M.D. (\"Dr. Hamar\"). (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 188, 280-85.) Dr. Hamar is a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist. He currently practices at Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center (\"BIDMC\"), where he is the Director for the Center for Maternal-Fetal Health, Beverly Hospital, and Mount Auburn Hospital, and is an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School. (Brayer Decl. Ex. N., at 2-3 (\"Hamar Expert Rep.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In his report, Dr. Hamar opined that Ms. Hartmann's cord prolapse was negligently managed by her providers. Dr. Hamar opined that Dr. DiCostanzo deviated\n   from the standard of care by removing her hand from Ms. Hartmann's vagina too early so that she was no longer elevating the baby's head, and that this led the cord to drop below the baby's head, further depriving her of oxygen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Specifically, Dr. Hamar also opined that having Ms. Hartmann push before she was fully dilated was dangerous and a \"clear violation in the standard of care and led to delays in the delivery with resulting worsening of the hypoxia and acidosis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Dr. Hartman also opined that Ms. Hartmann's providers failed to properly monitor the fetus, for example by not checking her heart rate, from the time that the prolapse was identified to the time of delivery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Dr. Hamar also opined that Ms. Hartmann's providers failed to timely deliver the infant. He stated that a cord prolapse is a true obstetric emergency and the infant must be delivered as fast as possible. Although he acknowledged the recommendation by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (\"ACOG\") that the decision to incision time should be 30 minutes or less for emergency cesarean deliveries, he opined that ACOG has backed away from the \"30-minute rule\" in its more recent publications. Dr. Hamar opined that in this case involving a cord prolapse, the decision to incision time should have been less than 10 minutes. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 189.) Dr. Hamar points out that it took fourteen minutes from diagnosis to get Ms. Hartmann to the operating room, and another ten minutes for anesthesia to be administered. (Hamar Expert Rep. 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Dr. Hamar also describes I.M.'s subsequent medical history in his report. He states that the diagnoses in the WMC chart included perinatal depression and the pediatric endocrinology consult note documents \"birth asphyxia [secondary] to prolapse cord.\" (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 334 (citing Hamar Expert Rep. 9).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   He states that further testing on March 9 and 12, 2015 confirmed continued seizure activity and I.M. was subsequently admitted to GSRH\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   from August 10, 2015 to October 29, 2015 with the diagnoses of non-traumatic brain injury, global developmental delays, and spasticity. The stated reason for admissions was that I.M. was born \"via STAT C-section for a prolapsed cord resulting in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and required head cooling.\" Dr. Hamar states that I.M. has subsequently been diagnosed with global developmental delays, cerebral palsy, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, and dysphagia and continues to have a gastronomy tube. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 335-38 (citing Hamar Expert Rep. 9).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    B.

(Hines Mem. 10.) Nurse Hines cites the opinion of her own expert, Warren Rosenfeld, M.D. (\"Dr. Rosenfeld\"), that if sodium bicarbonate had been given in the delivery room to I.M., it would have presented a breach of the standard of care because NRP states that sodium bicarbonate should not be used early in a resuscitation (Hines Mem. 11 (citing Rogers's Aff. Ex. M, at 5 (\"Rosenfeld Expert Rep.\") ).) Nurse Hines also cites Dr. Senguttuvan's expert, Dr. Steele, (Hines Mem. 12 (citing Steele Expert Rep. 7-8) ), and ORMC and Nurse Bast's expert, Ivan Hand, M.D. (\"Dr. Hand\") (Hines Mem. 13 (citing Rogers's Aff. Ex. O, at 4 (\"Hand Expert Rep.\") ) ), both of whom opined that sodium bicarbonate could only be administered after proper ventilation was achieved and that sodium bicarbonate was timely administered to I.M. Nurse Hines's argument misses the point-the fact that Defendants' experts disagree with Dr. Danoff's conclusions does not render his testimony unreliable. A reasonable jury could credit Dr. Danoff's opinion that sodium bicarbonate should have been administered, if not immediately, then certain before an hour since delivery went by. It is not for the Court at this stage to decide which version of events and which explanation of I.M.'s injuries is more plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bale v.

(Hines Mem. 13.) She cites Defendants' experts' opinions and an academic paper to argue that Dr. Danoff's opinion about the meaning of the baby's pH levels shows that he does not understand what cord gas findings represent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Nurse Hines argues that Dr. Danoff improperly compared the cord gas pH reading of 7.087 with the baby's pH of 6.95 at 21 minutes of life. She argues that the cord gas reading represented the baby's condition prior to the prolapse and is therefore an inaccurate point of comparison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Here too, a reasonable jury could instead credit the academic articles Plaintiffs cite in their Memorandum and the portions of expert testimony Plaintiffs rely on to support their interpretation of what a baby's cord gas numbers and pH levels mean. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. 8-11.) Nurse Hines further argues that Dr. Danoff did not explain his methodology for arriving at his opinions, but rather \"merely states that one set of figures which, on their face, appear to be a worse result, are indeed a worse result.\" (Hines Mem. 16.) This mischaracterizes Dr. Danoff's explanation-he argued that the causal chain was that the endotracheal tube was improperly placed, that this led to improper ventilation, which led to further hypoxia, worsening of the metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis, and that the lower pH is one piece of evidence supporting his theory. (Danoff Expert Rep. 9-10.) In his deposition he explained\n   that a decrease in the pH was related to an increase in the severity of acidosis. (Danoff Dep. 82-83.) That Defendants disagree with Dr. Danoff about the utility and reliability of the cord gas reading does not render his testimony unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Nurse Hines makes similarly unavailing arguments about Dr. Danoff's testimony regarding I.M.'s twitching and whether phenobarbital should have been administered sooner. She cites Defendants' experts' opinions concluding that the twitching was not necessarily indicative of seizure activity. (Hines Mem. 16-17.) This only further points out that there is a factual dispute as to whether and when I.M. was experiencing seizures and when phenobarbital should have been administered. Nurse Hines also argues that Dr. Danoff jumped to the conclusion that I.M. was experiencing seizures without explaining his method for reaching that conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Dr. Danoff, however, did in fact explain that he concluded the baby's early twitching was seizure activity because of her condition at birth and because of the various other symptoms she was exhibiting, and he pointed out that the baby was eventually diagnosed with and treated for seizures. (Danoff Expert Rep. 9-10.) Dr. Danoff conceded that there are many reasons babies twitch, but concluded, \"[t]his baby was seizing. The baby was acidotic. The baby was hypoxic at or before birth.... I am not talking about some hypothetical baby who twitched.\" (Danoff Dep. 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Court concludes that there is enough in the record to reject the claim that Dr. Danoff's testimony is unreliable. He explained what he believes Defendants' deviations from the standard of care were, what evidence he reviewed, how he arrived at his opinions, and his statements are not clearly contradicted by the record.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523805\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/294/83/#p96\">\n    294 F.Supp.3d at 93-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding expert testimony was not reliable where expert failed to explain connection between medical condition decedent was allegedly suffering from and the care provided by the defendants, proposed expert based opinion on statements that were contracted by the record, and failed to explain how he arrived at his opinions);\n   <em>\n    Vale,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205773729\">\n    2015 WL 5773729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding expert testimony was not reliable because doctor provided no foundational basis for his opinion, no explanation for how defendants was negligent except for one isolated unsupported statement, and his conclusions were \"merely speculative\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Because the Court concludes that Dr. Danoff is qualified to testify and does not find his testimony unreliable, neonatal Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs cannot prevail on their medical malpractice claim because they do not have a qualified expert, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    iii.

Nurse Hines testified that she and Dr. Senguttuvan were responsible for the timing of when sodium bicarbonate and phenobarbital were given. (Hines Dep. 141-42). Dr. Senguttuvan's argument that she arrived over an hour after the endotracheal tube was first placed, (Senguttuvan Mem. 9), is also unavailing because Dr. Senguttuvan testified that the whole NICU team, of which she was a part, was responsible for monitoring the vent settings and the endotracheal tube, (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 259-60).

The Court is not aware of a case in the Second Circuit\n   holding that a doctor in a specialty cannot testify as an expert about nursing in that same specialty, and Nurse Bast and ORMC do not cite to such a case. Both Dr. Hamar and Dr. Danoff have knowledge of the standards applicable to cord prolapse treatment by doctors and nurses in labor and delivery and neonatal resuscitation respectively, given their experience in managing these situations.

(Pls.' Mem. 30.) ORMC counters that Ms. Hartmann did not come to ORMC for emergency treatment, but rather that she came at the instruction of her obstetrician at MCHC. (ORMC and Bast Mem. 9-10; ORMC and Bast Reply 10.) Indeed, Ms. Hartmann's birthing plan was to deliver at ORMC, with the assigned physician employed at MCHC on the day of her delivery. She knew that MCHC patients delivered at ORMC. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6 176.) However, she also entered the hospital through the emergency department, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177), and eventually underwent an emergency c-section and received other emergency treatment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180). She interacted with Dr. DiCostanzo, Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, and Dr. Kothari under emergency circumstances and none of them was her OBGYN. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 175-76, 180.) All the alleged deviations from the standard of care occurred during the administration of emergency treatment. Ms. Hartmann arguably did not have any particular doctor in mind when she sought life-saving treatment and expected that a hospital that held itself out as providing emergency services would do so in accordance with the standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orgovan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553951\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/7/770/\">\n    776 N.Y.S.2d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an exception to the general rule applies when \"a patient comes to an emergency room seeking treatment from the hospital and not from a particular physician of the patient's choosing\");\n   <em>\n    Mduba,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20N.Y.S.2d%20527\">\n    384 N.Y.S.2d at 529-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). A reasonable jury could find that although Ms. Hartmann had planned to deliver at ORMC, she received emergency treatment from Defendants on the night in question. ORMC has not submitted any evidence to show Ms. Hartmann did not believe she was receiving emergency treatment after her cord prolapse was diagnosed. It is not for the Court to decide whether Ms. Hartmann was, at the time\n   she was receiving the allegedly negligent treatment, expecting emergency treatment from the hospital or treatment from a doctor of her choosing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vital v.

The Court concludes that there is a factual dispute as to whether the emergency exception applies. If a jury were to find that this exception applies, ORMC would be vicariously liable for the alleged malpractice of Dr. DiCostanzo, Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, or Dr. Kothari or NAPA. Because there is a question of fact as to whether ORMC is vicariously liable for Dr. DiCostanzo, Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, or Dr. Kothari or NAPA's alleged malpractice, the Court denies ORMC and Nurse Bast's Motions for Summary Judgment with respect to vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Court could deny summary judgment on the grounds of the emergency exception alone, but will also briefly address whether the apparent agency exception applies. ORMC argues that Ms. Hartmann knew Dr. DiCostanzo was not an agent of ORMC and that she was instead affiliated with MCHC. (ORMC and Bast Mem. 8-9.) Ms. Hartmann indeed testified that she knew who Dr. DiCostanzo was as she had seen her walking around at MCHC even though she never had her as her doctor. (Hartmann Dep. 123.) However, ORMC failed to establish that there was no issue of fact as to whether Ms. Hartmann expected treatment from the hospital or from Dr. DiCostanzo. Ms. Hartmann had expected to have an MCHC doctor help her with a natural vaginal delivery. (Pls.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 175-76, 178.) Once the treatment turned into an emergency c-section, it is not at all clear that Ms. Hartmann still expected MCHC and Dr. DiCostanzo, rather than ORMC, to provide care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halkias,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"118234\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/282/650/\">\n    282 A.D.2d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"118234\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/282/650/\">\n    724 N.Y.S.2d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying summary judgment where hospital failed to establish absence of issues of fact as to \"whether the plaintiff sought medical care from [the hospital] rather than from a particular physician\"). \"Assessments of ... choices between conflicting versions of the events are matters for the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Vital,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11640470\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/615/#p622\">\n    168 F.3d at 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable jury could conclude that because the emergency treatment Ms. Hartmann ended up receiving was different from what she had expected from an MCHC doctor, Ms. Hartmann was seeking medical care from ORMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   As for Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, and Dr. Kothari or NAPA's affiliation with ORMC, ORMC argues that it made no representations about their relationship to the hospital, and that there is no testimony from Ms. Hartmann that she relied on representations by ORMC. (ORMC and Bast Mem. 12.) Plaintiffs counter that ORMC held itself out as controlling Dr. Senguttuvan and Nurse Hines because they both provided treatment to I.M. only because of their relationship with ORMC-Ms. Hartmann did not choose them as the emergency neonatal service provider. (Pls.' Mem. 30-32.) Dr. Senguttuvan was the only neonatologist attending at ORMC when she arrived, (Senguttuvan Dep. 38), and Nurse Hines was the only neonatology nurse practitioner on the premises at ORMC that morning, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42). Dr. Senguttuvan even testified that she wore a security badge that had \"Orange Regional Medical Center\" on it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.) ORMC had the burden of submitting evidence to show that there is no material issue of fact concerning apparent agency,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contreras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701142\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/102/720/\">\n    958 N.Y.S.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying summary judgment where hospital failed to submit evidence that the offsite radiologist was not under its control and not its agent in providing care to the patient), and the Court finds that it failed\n   to do so. A reasonable jury could conclude Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, and Dr. Kothari or NAPA were held out as agents of ORMC. Indeed, after the cord prolapse was called, about twelve medical professionals rushed into Ms. Hartmann's room and she was wheeled away to receive anesthesia and surgery at ORMC. (DiCostanzo Dep. 185-86.) A reasonable jury could conclude that Ms. Hartmann understood that all the staff to be involve in her emergency care were provided by ORMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   If a jury were to find that the apparent agent exception applies, ORMC would be vicariously liable for their alleged malpractice. Because there is a question of fact as to whether ORMC is vicariously liable for Dr. DiCostanzo, Dr. Senguttuvan, Nurse Hines, or Dr. Kothari or NAPA's alleged malpractice, the Court denies ORMC and Nurse Bast's Motions for Summary Judgment with respect to ORMC's vicarious liability for its non-employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

(ORMC and Bast Mem. 14-16.) Plaintiffs counter that hospitals and their employees may be concurrently liable with private attending physicians, and that Nurse Bast committed independent acts of negligence. (Pls.'

Compressions approx 90 seconds.\" (I.M. ORMC Rec. 9.) Nurse Hines's notes do not expressly state that I.M.'s heart rate was 50-60\n    <em>\n     in the first minute\n    </em>\n    of life, but she testified that she intubated the baby \"before one minute of life.\" (Hines Dep. 92.)

This statement, however, misquotes and misrepresents Nurse Hines's testimony. Nurse Hines testified that she intubated the baby at 20 seconds of life, not that the baby was resuscitated at 20 seconds of life. (Hines Dep. 89.)

(Hines Reply 3; Senguttuvan Reply 6-7.) Dr. Senguttuvan goes as far as accusing Dr. Danoff of fabricating and manufacturing his credentials. The Court only briefly addresses these allegations. Upon review of the evidence submitted by Dr. Senguttuvan, most of which is likely not admissible or dispositive in any event, the Court finds that the neonatal Defendants have failed to prove Dr. Danoff fabricated his credentials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    Nurse Hines and Dr. Senguttuvan challenge Dr. Danoff's assertion that he is an instructor in neonatal resuscitation. (Hines Reply 3; Senguttuvan Reply 7.) Andrew M. Steele, M.D. (\"Dr. Steele\"), an expert for Dr. Senguttuvan, stated in his expert letter that \"there is no such program developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Anesthesiology and Obstetrics and Gynecology.\" (Rogers's Aff. Ex. N., at 4 (\"Steele Expert Rep.\").) Dr. Senguttuvan submitted an email from an official at the American Academy of Pediatrics stating that the official was unable to locate a record for Dr. Danoff within the \"current NRP Learning Management System.\" (Leifert Reply Decl. Ex. E (\"DePauw Email\").) Admissibility concerns aside, this email does not prove that Dr. Danoff was never an instructor with the organization, nor that he was not an instructor with some other organization and made an honest mistake in describing his credentials. \"Constru[ing] the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\"\n    <em>\n     Brod\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822628\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/653/156/#p164\">\n     653 F.3d at 164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , the Court will consider Dr. Danoff's sworn biographical statement that he was or is an instructor of neonatal resuscitation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Dr. Senguttuvan also challenges Dr. Danoff's claim that he was a consultant for the State of Connecticut. She submitted an email exchange with an official from the Connecticut Department of Health, in which the official explains that the department \"maintain[s] a list of interested consultants for various professions and specialties\" and spells out the criteria a consultant must meet. The official confirmed that Dr. Danoff reviewed one case for the state in 2014. (Leifert Reply Decl. Ex. A (\"Montauti Email\").) Once more, setting aside admissibility concerns, this email does not prove that Dr. Danoff was never a consultant for the State of Connecticut-quite the opposite. Aside from the discrepancy in Dr. Danoff stating that he was a consultant in 2010, and the official stating he was a consultant in 2014, which could be explained by an honest mistake on Dr. Danoff's part, the Court does not see the inaccuracy in Dr. Danoff's assertion, and certainly does not see it as a fabrication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Dr. Senguttuvan next attacks Dr. Danoff's claim that he is registered to practice medicine in the State of New York. Dr. Senguttuvan submitted a screenshot of a web search of the New York State Education Department's (\"NYSED\") Office of the Profession website showing that Dr. Danoff is not currently registered to practice medicine in the State of New York. (Leifert Reply Decl. Ex. B (\"NYSED Search\").) Dr. Senguttuvan offers no explanation as to why the Court should consider this web search as proof of Dr. Danoff's registration status-she does not explain what the searched database is, she does not explain whether the NYSED is the body that keeps medical licensing records, she does not explain whether there are any other organizations that maintain medical licensing records, and she provides no information about how this web search was conducted, or whether the official who responded has the authority to make the representations made. Moreover, Plaintiffs submitted, albeit in a surreply that they did not seek the Court's permission to file, Dr. Danoff's registration certificate to practice medicine in the State of New York which was valid through March 31, 2018. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    September 18, 2018 Letter from Jordan Merson, Esq., to Court (Dkt. No. 153).) Dr. Danoff's expert report is dated January 22, 2018, meaning he was licensed to practice medicine in New York on the date he submitted his expert report.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    The Court agrees that it does not help Dr. Danoff's credibility that his affidavit is dated August 20, 2018, and that in that affidavit he states he\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    licensed to practice medicine in New York, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Danoff Expert Rep. 2), when the New York registration certificate he submitted was only valid through March 31, 2018.

The Court will not address these documents at length other than to say that, like the submissions discussed above, they are likely not admissible, do not prove Dr. Danoff manufactured his credentials, and are not dispositive because the Court need not rely on the portions of Dr. Danoff's resume that Dr. Senguttuvan is contesting to decide whether he is qualified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"38\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Plaintiffs admit this statement but add additional biographical information about Dr. Danoff that they do not support with any admissible evidence.

ORMC and Nurse Bast do not object to some of Plaintiffs' other citations to Dr. Hamar's expert report because those portions cite to admissible evidence, such as portions of the transcript. The disputed portions of the report do not cite to evidence that has been submitted to this Court as part of the briefing on the present Motions. Dr. Hamar cites to I.M.'s GSRH medical chart, and I.M.'s subsequent diagnoses and medical records-none of which Plaintiffs have submitted to the Court.

For example, Dr. Senguttuvan argues that Dr. Danoff \"criticized [her] for not being present in the delivery room at a certain time, then admitted that he had no idea when she was called,\" (Senguttuvan Mem. 5), when in fact Dr. Danoff testified that she was called when the entire neonatal team was called because according to her own testimony she was the head of the neonatal team, and in his opinion it took her too long to get to the baby, (Danoff Dep. 45-46).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"44\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Dr. Senguttuvan argues that the existence of the physician-patient relationship is a question of law for the Court to decide.
