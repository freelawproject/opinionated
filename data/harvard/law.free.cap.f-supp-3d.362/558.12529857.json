(\"Authenticom\") filed this lawsuit on May 1, 2017, in the Western District of Wisconsin. At that time, Authenticom filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction that sought to enjoin allegedly anticompetitive practices by Defendants CDK Global, LLC (\"CDK\") and Reynolds and Reynolds Co. (\"Reynolds\") that Authenticom contends improperly prevented it from accessing Defendants' respective dealer management systems (\"DMS\"). [\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK Global, LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-cv-868 (N.D. Ill.), Dkt. 5.] After extensive briefing and a two-and-a-half-day hearing, the district court granted Authenticom's motion for a preliminary injunction and entered a preliminary injunction against each Defendant mandating that Defendants permit Authenticom to access their respective DMSs.

The Seventh Circuit reasoned that \"[t]he proper remedy for a section 1 violation based on an agreement to restrain trade is to set the offending agreement aside,\" not to impose a duty to deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1026.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Seventh Circuit issued its opinion, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") granted Defendants' motion for transfer and consolidation of this case and a number of other potential tag-along lawsuits filed against Defendants. [See 1.] The JPML chose the Northern District of Illinois as the transferee court and assigned the litigation to Judge St Eve. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] While the case was before Judge St. Eve, she issued a thorough opinion granting in part and denying in part Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss in this case. [See\n   <em>\n    In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525541\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/931/\">\n    313 F.Supp.3d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 2018).] The case was reassigned to this Court on May 23, 2018. [181.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both CDK and Reynolds subsequently answered the complaint and filed numerous counterclaims against Authenticom. [225 (Reynolds); 229 (CDK).] Specifically, CDK and Reynolds brings counterclaims against Authenticom for damages, declaratory, injunctive, and other relief pursuant to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Copyright Act, the Defend Trade Secrets Act, the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, the Wisconsin Uniform Trade Secrets Act, and state common law, consumer protection, and related laws. Pending before the Court are Authenticom's Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss [272; 277] certain of those counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Given that this case already has been extensively litigated before multiple courts, the Court assumes some familiarity with the facts of this case. The Counterclaims brought by CDK and Reynolds focus on Authenticom's purported unauthorized access to their enterprise software and computing platforms for automotive dealerships and dealership groups known as Dealer Management Systems or, more commonly, DMSs. Both CDK and Reynolds allege that they have devoted substantial resources to developing, securing, and maintaining their respective DMSs. According to CDK and Reynolds, Authenticom's business model revolves around improperly gaining free access to their respective DMSs, extracting and exporting the data from those DMSs, often copying the data onto its own system, and then selling the data to third-parties (principally vendors that provide software applications to support the dealers operations). Authenticom is able to do this by using login credentials (allegedly through unsecured means) acquired from dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Authenticom does not appear to dispute that Reynolds sufficiently has alleged that Authenticom lacked authorization to access its DMS. However, a central dispute raised in Authenticom's motion to dismiss the counterclaims of CDK is whether CDK sufficiently has alleged that Authenticom lacked authorization to access its DMS. CDK alleges that Authenticom \"does not have CDK's permission or its authorization to access or use CDK's DMS, including on behalf of or for the purported benefit of\n   dealers or vendors.\" [229, at \u00b6 35.] CDK contends that its contracts with dealers and third parties make clear that its DMS has remained the sole and exclusive property of CDK. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.] Section 6(D) of CDK's standard DMS contract with dealers-known as the \"Master Service Agreement\" or \"MSA\"-states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Client [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the dealer] shall treat as confidential and will not disclose or otherwise make available any of the CDK Products (including, without limitation, screen displays or user documentation) or any trade secrets, processes, proprietary data, information or documentation related thereto (collectively the \"Confidential Information\"), in any form, to any person\n   <em>\n    other than employees\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and agents\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    of Client\n   </em>\n   with a need-to-know.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [276, Ex. D (emphasis added).] The MSA also prohibits \"ANY THIRD PARTY [sic] SOFTWARE TO ACCESS THE CDK DEALER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY [THE] AGREEMENT.\" [229, at \u00b6 71.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CDK further alleges that \"Authenticom became aware that CDK objected to its unauthorized access to the CDK DMS no later than June 2015, and in all likelihood, much earlier.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.] Supporting that assertion, CDK alleges that Authenticom has taken steps to circumvent CDK's security measures. [See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.] For example, Authenticom representatives certified that they were \"an authorized dealer employee\" in order to access CDK's DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84-86.] Authenticom also implemented a software tool that automatically renewed user IDs that CDK had disabled. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.] Furthermore, Authenticom was able to modify its automated scripts to bypass a CAPTCHA (\"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\") control designed by CDK to stop Authenticom's automated access to its DMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 90-93.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CDK also alleges that a CDK employee informed Authenticom's CEO Steve Cottrell \"(a) that CDK's contracts with dealers prohibited them from providing DMS login credentials to third parties (including Authenticom) and (b) that CDK intended to prevent non-authorized access to its DMS, including Authenticom's unlawful user ID and password access.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87.] \"Mr. Cottrell responded to the effect that Authenticom refused to cease its unauthorized access or otherwise change its business practices.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both CDK and Reynolds claim that Authenticom's purported unauthorized access to their respective DMSs has caused them harm. CDK alleges that Authenticom misappropriated protected \"CDK-created forms, accounting rules, tax tables, and proprietary tools and data compilations.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115.] The \"trade secrets stored on the CDK DMS derive independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, such as other DMS providers, application providers, or third-party data extractors like Authenticom.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128.] CDK \"makes efforts to maintain the secrecy of these trade secrets\" and outlines such efforts in its counter-complaint. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 129.] Authenticom's unauthorized access adds \"to the cost of computing services that CDK must provide\" to each dealer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.] Authenticom's data extraction methods burden \"CDK's systems with poorly constructed, inefficient and repetitive queries that extract too much data, too frequently, and during peak dealer business hours.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.] \"At times, for at least some dealers, Authenticom's constant querying can tie up more than 50% of the DMS's entire computing capacity.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Likewise, Reynolds alleges that \"the automated scripts that Authenticom uses 'ping' [its] DMS with computing requests at a rate of hundreds or thousands of times per day\" and are dangerous to the DMS. [226, at \u00b6 99.] \"That speed and volume taxes the computational and network resources of the Reynolds DMS, resulting in degradation of service for dealers and increased operational costs to Reynolds.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Reynolds further alleges that \"[i]t has been expensive and burdensome * * * to respond to Authenticom's continuing technological gamesmanship and 'Whack-A-Mole' tactics. Reynolds has had to invest significant resources in investigating and resolving hostile integration problems caused by Authenticom-a cost that Reynolds alone has had to bear, rather than dealers, third parties, or Authenticom itself. And whenever Authenticom or another hostile integrator succeeds in circumventing all of the dedicated safeguards and resources that Reynolds has built into its system, Reynolds must devote even more resources to counteracting these breaches and attempting to prevent recurrences.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Authorization to Access DMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Authenticom argues that CDK's counterclaims should be dismissed because CDK fails plausibly to allege that Authenticom lacked authorization to access CDK's DMS, which Authenticom contends is a necessary factual predicate for all of CDK's counterclaims against Authenticom. Specifically, Authenticom argues that it had authorization to access to CDK's DMS by way of Section 6(D) of CDK's standard DMS contract-known as the \"Master Service Agreement\" or \"MSA\"-which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Client shall treat as confidential and will not disclose or otherwise make available any of the CDK Products (including, without limitation, screen displays or user documentation) or any trade secrets, processes, proprietary data, information or documentation related thereto (collectively the \"Confidential Information\"),\n   in any form, to any person\n   <em>\n    other than employees\n    <strong>\n     and agents\n    </strong>\n    of Client\n   </em>\n   with a need-to-know.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [276, Ex. D (emphasis added).] Because Authenticom contends it acts as an agent of CDK's DMS clients (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , dealers), Authenticom contends that this contractual language establishes that it actually had authorization to access CDK's DMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   However, CDK alleges that Authenticom \"does not have CDK's permission or its authorization to access or use CDK's DMS, including on behalf of or for the purported benefit of dealers or vendors.\" [229, at \u00b6 35.] CDK further alleges that \"Authenticom became aware that CDK objected to its unauthorized access to the CDK DMS no later than June 2015, and in all likelihood, much earlier.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.] Supporting that assertion, CDK also alleges that Authenticom has taken steps to circumvent CDK's security measures. [See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.] For example, Authenticom representatives certified that they were \"an authorized dealer employee\" in order to access CDK's DMS.

In fact, the facts alleged suggest that the contrary is true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To begin, Authenticom's contract with dealers makes clear that it is not an agent of the dealers. [229, at \u00b6 75.] Specifically, the contract between Authenticom and the dealers, which is governed by Wisconsin law, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Parties expressly agree that they are independent contractors and do not intend for these Terms and Conditions to be interpreted as an employment agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v.

In support of that argument, Authenticom cites to a Seventh Circuit case that held that \"[r]egardless of how the two parties chose to define their relationship for remuneration, tax, employment law, or tort liability purposes,\" the court independently should analyze their relationship on a motion for summary judgment on a claim under the Copyright Act.\n   <em>\n    Automation By Design, Inc. v.

In other words, the Seventh Circuit held that two parties' characterization of their agency status is not dispositive of whether there exists an agency relationship as the term is used under the Copyright Act. However, the language in\n   <em>\n    Automation\n   </em>\n   indicating that the parties may choose to define their relationship for \"remuneration, tax, employment law, or tort liability purposes,\" indicates that the parties' characterization of their relationship may have some relevance in other contexts.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court therefore has recognized that the distinction between an employee or agent on one hand and an\n   independent contractor on the other hand \"is the degree of retention by the employer or principal of the right to control the manner in which the details of the work are to be performed.\"\n   <em>\n    Jahns v.

Although an independent contractor may be considered an agent for certain purposes under certain circumstances, there is no indication that those circumstances exist here. Specifically, where the independent contractor does not owe the principal a fiduciary duty and the principal does not reserve any right to control the details of its work, the independent contractor is not an agent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20N.W.2d%20674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because there is no indication that Authenticom owed the dealers a fiduciary duty or that the dealers reserved the right to control the details of its work in the relevant contract, the parties' representation that they are independent contractors is a strong indication that they intended to disclaim an agency relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Authenticom also argues that its disavowal of an \"employment agency\" relationship does not apply here because that disclaimer means only that \"Authenticom is not the dealers' employee.\" [276, at 15.] But if the parties had intended to accomplish only that result, they would have said simply \"employment,\" not \"employment agency.\" Although it is not clear to the Court what is meant by the term \"employment agency,\" it seems very unlikely that it simply means \"employment.\" \"[C]ontract language should be construed to give meaning to every word.\"\n   <em>\n    Md.

CDK hypothesizes that a comma mistakenly was omitted from the agreement and that the parties intended to disavow any employment, agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship. While that conclusion is possible, it is by no means inevitable and thus the Court takes no position on it at this time. That issue can be fleshed out through discovery. Still, as discussed above, the parties' agreement expressly states that they are independent contractors and there is no indication that Authenticom owed the dealers a fiduciary duty or that the dealers reserved any right to control the details of the independent contractor's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Furthermore, Authenticom's own complaint alleges that CDK's contractual terms with dealers \"prohibit dealers from granting access to their data to anyone else, including data integrators such as Authenticom.\" [\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v. CDK Global, LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:18-cv-00868 (N.D. Ill.), Dkt. 1, at \u00b6 150.] Authenticom argues that its allegation that CDK engaged in exclusive dealing by requiring dealers that use the CDK DMS exclusively for data integration services is legal argument and not a proper factual pleading. [276, at 14.] However, CDK is not citing to Authenticom's characterization of CDK's actions as exclusive dealing. Rather, CDK is citing to the fact that Authenticom alleges that CDK's contracts prohibit dealers from granting Authenticom access to their data, which is a factual allegation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Authenticom also argues that \"[t]he fact that CDK invoked its MSA when it forced its dealers to deal exclusively with CDK for integration services does not change the unambiguous contract language.\" [276, at 14.] But the unambiguous contract language merely provides that the dealers cannot disclose or otherwise make available any of the CDK Products or proprietary\n   information to any person other than employees and agents. It does not establish as a matter of law or fact that Authenticom falls within the scope of the term \"employees and agents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, whether Authenticom was the dealers' agent is an issue of fact not properly resolved on Authenticom's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Restoration Specialists, LLC v.

But the provision allowing dealers to disclose or otherwise make available CDK's products does not specifically address third party software. It therefore is not unambiguously clear that MSA authorizes Authenticom to access CDK's DMS with its software. In connection with CDK's other allegations-such as CDK's allegations regarding Authenticom's efforts to find ways of circumventing security measures CDK took to prevent Authenticom's automated access to the CDK DMS-CDK's allegations are sufficient to establish that Authenticom accessed CDK's DMS without authorization at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Authenticom argues that CDK's unjust enrichment claim fails because CDK cannot establish unjust enrichment for a purported benefit that was contractually authorized. Specifically, Authenticom argues that dealers engaged Authenticom as their agent pursuant to the express terms of their MSAs. As already discussed, however, CDK sufficiently has alleged a lack of authorization. Authenticom also argues that CDK fails to allege that it actually conferred a benefit on Authenticom, as required to state a claim for unjust enrichment under Wisconsin law.\n   <em>\n    Puttkammer v.

Authenticom argues that the benefits CDK alleges Authenticom received (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , access to CDK's DMS and payment by vendors) were conferred by dealers and vendors and not CDK. Given that Authenticom appears to be admitting that access to CDK's DMS is a benefit-albeit one that Authenticom contends was conferred by dealers-it is not clear based on CDK's allegations that such a benefit was the dealers' benefit to give. Authenticom does not explain how-under Wisconsin law-it was the dealers that actually conferred access to CDK's DMS, especially given that CDK plausibly has alleged a lack of authorization. Although Authenticom ultimately may be able to make such a showing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   it has not done so at this stage. Accordingly, the Court denies Authenticom's motion to dismiss CDK's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Fraud (Counterclaim XII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Authenticom argues that CDK's fraud claim fails because (1) CDK fails to allege a material misstatement of fact, and (2) CDK cannot plausibly allege damages from justifiable reliance. CDK's fraud claim is based on the allegation that \"Authenticom has frequently and repeatedly represented to CDK that it is a human employee of a CDK dealer customer who is authorized to access the DMS.\" [229, at \u00b6 174.] Authenticom argues that because there is no material difference between an \"employee\" of the dealers and an \"agent\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   of the dealers-which Authenticom contends would be authorized to access CDK's DMS-CDK has not sufficiently alleged a material misrepresentation. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Court is unable to determine at the motion to dismiss stage whether Authenticom actually was an agent of CDK's dealer clients. Accordingly, the Court denies Authenticom's motion to dismiss CDK's fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    J. California's Unfair Competition Law (Counterclaim VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Authenticom argues that CDK's counter-claim under California's Unfair Competition Law (\"CUCL\") fails because CDK fails to allege that Authenticom engaged in unfair or unlawful conduct. \"Each prong of the UCL is a separate and distinct theory of liability\" and must be analyzed separately.\n   <em>\n    Kearns v.

With respect to the CUCL's \"unfair\" practices prong, CDK identifies two allegedly unfair practices: (1) Authenticom's \"unauthorized use of DMS login credentials,\" and (2) its \"inducement of CDK's dealer customers to breach their contracts with CDK.\" [229, at \u00b6 146.] Authenticom argues that neither theory is plausible because Authenticom's access to the DMS was authorized under the plain terms of CDK's contract with dealers. Again, as discussed above, CDK sufficiently has alleged that Authenticom's access of CDK's DMS was not authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With respect to the CUCL's \"unlawful\" conduct prong, Authenticom argues that CDK's CUCL claim fails because CDK has not alleged any unlawful conduct on the part of Authenticom. \"The unlawful category of the UCL 'borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Haynish v.

[363, at 15.] Thus, to the extent that a measure is designed to control access and does so effectively, intent may be relevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Authenticom also argues in a footnote that CDK cannot maintain its DMCA claim based on the alleged circumvention of a CAPTCHA because \"nothing in its MSA * * * would restrict a dealer's ability either to employ automated access methods itself or to authorize agents to do so on its behalf.\" [276, at 12 n.7.] However, nothing in the MSA specifically allows dealers to use the kind of automated access challenged by CDK and there is no indication that any dealer itself has used such automated access. Regardless, this argument only is relevant if Authenticom had authorization to act on behalf of the dealers. As discussed above, however, CDK sufficiently has alleged a lack of authorization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The only other case cited by Authenticom in which the court granted a motion to dismiss based on insufficient allegations of a legally cognizable trade secret is\n    <em>\n     Cohabaco Cigar Co. v.

Reynolds argues that the Court should consider these factors when determining whether Authenticom sufficiently alleged its conversion claim against Reynolds under Wisconsin law. Although Wisconsin courts have adopted and applied some of the standards set forth in the Restatement for conversion claims brought under Wisconsin law (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the requirement that the interference be so serious as to justify payment of the full value of the chattel), Reynolds has not cited one case applying the factors identified in Section 222A to conversion claims brought under Wisconsin law. Regardless, \"[n]o one factor is always predominant in determining the seriousness of the interference, or the justice of requiring the forced purchase at full value. * * * In each case the question to be asked is whether the actor has exercised such dominion and control over the chattel, and has so seriously interfered with the other's right to control it, that in justice he should be required to buy the chattel.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 222A, comment d (1965). As discussed above, even considering the factors identified in the restatement, neither CDK nor Reynolds has made such allegations here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Indeed, if it turns out to be the case that Authenticom was acting as the dealers' agent and that dealers were the parties that conferred the agency status necessary for Authenticom to access CDK's DMS, it may be that it was the dealers that conferred the benefit of accessing CDK's DMS on Authenticom.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
