All of them are Delaware companies, with eight having their principal place of business in New York, three in California, and one in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant is a Russian national living and working in the Russian Federation. Defendant owns and operates two websites, www.FLVTO.biz (FLVTO) and www.2conv.com (2conv) (collectively the \"Websites\"). The Websites are devoted to \"stream ripping\" which is a process by which users may \"rip\" a file from a streaming platform and convert it to a downloadable file format, such as an mp3.

A large portion of the files ripped using the Websites come from YouTube videos and are frequently music videos, however, the Websites are able to stream rip from a wide variety of sources. Neither Plaintiffs nor YouTube authorize or condone the ripping of files from YouTube videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Websites are visited very frequently by users around the world. The Websites are available in twenty-three different languages and are most used in Brazil, Italy, and Mexico. FLVTO received over 263 million visits between October 2017 and September\n   2018 making it the 322nd most visited website in the world. 2conv also receives millions of visits each month. A significant portion of this traffic comes from the United States and Virginia more specifically. Approximately 26.3 million of FLVTO's visitors last year, or 9.92%, come from the United States. Nearly 500,000 of FLVTO's visitors came from Virginia. 2conv had similar percentages of its users from the United States and Virginia respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Websites are free to users and users do not have to register to use the Websites' capabilities. Users do have to agree to certain terms of use, but Defendant does not track or maintain a relationship with individual users beyond this agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant earns revenue from the Websites only through advertisements posted on them. Some of the advertisements placed on the Websites have geo-targeting capabilities, which means that the advertisements can be targeted to users based on their location. A similar function is available for interest-based targeting of advertisements on the Websites. Defendant sells the advertising placements to an advertising broker who then resells them to actual advertisers. Defendant deals directly with a broker in the Ukraine and does not deal with anyone in the United States or Virginia with regard to the sale or placement of advertisements. Defendant does not advertise the Websites in any way in the United States or elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant has the Websites' domain names registered with GoDaddy.com, a United States based domain-name registrar. Defendant also has top-level domains for the Websites administered by VeriSign, Inc. (2conv) and Neustar, Inc. (FLVTO) both of which are headquartered in Northern Virginia. As of July 2018, the Websites were, and have since been, hosted by Hetzner Online Gmbh, a German based organization without servers in the United States. For nearly three years prior to July 2018, the Websites were hosted by Amazon Web Services which has servers physically located in Ashburn, Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant operates the Websites entirely from Russia. Defendant has not directly done business in the United States or Virginia, nor does he have an agent in either forum. Defendant has no bank account in the United States, nor has he paid taxes here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Websites are a vehicle for music piracy and copyright infringement.

An evaluation of the contacts in this case points to the absence of personal jurisdiction due to a lack of purposeful targeting of either Virginia or the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To begin, the Websites are semi-interactive. They allow users to share information with the host and for files to be downloaded, but there is not a significant or prolonged engagement between the user and the Websites.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alitalia-Linee Aeree Italiane S.p.A. v. Casinoalitalia.Com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139041\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/128/340/\">\n    128 F.Supp.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2001) (finding an online gambling site on which users could play online games for significant periods of time to be highly interactive). Also, there is no evidence that users exchanged multiple files with the Websites.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bright Imperial Ltd. v. RT MediaSolutions, S.R.O.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-cv-935,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201831536\">\n    2012 WL 1831536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. May 18, 2012) (finding a site to be highly interactive when it contracted with individuals to make and send multiple videos for posting on the site). Plaintiffs attempt to describe the Websites as highly interactive due to the million of users. This is incorrect because the number of users cannot make a website highly interactive, there must instead be numerous transactions between the site and a user evidencing an ongoing relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Here, there is no ongoing relationship as the Terms of Use state that the files transmitted between the Websites and users are only stored until the user has downloaded them.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bright Imperial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201831536\">\n    2012 WL 1831536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1-2 (highly interactive site stored video files for future viewing by other users). Further, users do not need to create an account, sign in, or register in order to use the Websites. This want of an ongoing, developed relationship between users and the Websites leads to a finding that the Websites are semi-interactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, the relationship between the Websites and the users is not based on a commercial contract. While users of the Websites must agree to the Terms of Use, the Websites are free to use. Defendant does earn money from the sale of advertising space on the Websites, but all of this money comes from third party advertisers who Defendant does not deal with directly. The revenue from the advertisements cannot be the basis for finding a commercial relationship with the users because they are separate interactions and the due process analysis must only look at the acts from which the cause of action arises, here, the alleged aid in music piracy.\n   <em>\n    Carefirst of Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530070\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/390/#p397\">\n    334 F.3d at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, Defendant took no action through the Websites that would demonstrate purposeful targeting of Virginia or the United States. Defendant does not advertise the Websites in either forum, nor does Defendant provide specific instructions or advice to users in either forum.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GMAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9367776\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/241/589/#p594\">\n    241 F.Supp.2d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding Rule 4 (k) (2) jurisdiction when website had specific ordering instructions for U.S. customers). The contact that users have with the Websites is unilateral in nature and as such cannot be the basis for jurisdiction without more.\n   <em>\n    Kulko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p93\">\n    436 U.S. at 93-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p93\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Users may access the Websites from anywhere on the globe and they select their location when they use the Websites. Plaintiffs make the contention that Defendant's tracking of where the users are located and use of geo-targeted advertisements\n   demonstrates that he was targeting Virginians and Americans. This is an attenuated argument as tracking the location of a user does not show targeting of the user or their location; instead it is merely a recording of where the user's unilateral act took place.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Intercarrier Communications LLC v. WhatsApp Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3:12-cv-776,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205230631\">\n    2013 WL 5230631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Sept. 13, 2013 E.D. Va.) (finding no personal jurisdiction based on unilateral acts of users even where the defendant could users' track locations). Even if the Websites' servers knew exactly where the users were located, any interaction would still be in the unilateral control of the users as they initiate the contacts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zaletel v. Prisma Labs, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269922\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/226/599/#p610\">\n    226 F.Supp.3d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610 (E.D. Va. 2016) (finding user-initiated contact to be fortuitous and not arising out of defendant created contacts with the forum). It is clear that Defendant did not take any actions which purposefully targeted Virginia or the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As the Websites are semi-interactive, the interactions with the users are non-commercial, and there were no other acts by the Defendant that would demonstrate purposeful targeting, the Court finds that Defendant did not purposefully avail himself of the benefits and protections of either Virginia or the United States. Due to this finding, the Court does not need to engage in a reasonability analysis. The Court finds that exercise of personal jurisdiction over Defendant would be unconstitutional as a violation of due process under either Rule 4(k)(1) or 4(k) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Due to the Court's finding that personal jurisdiction is absent under either section of Rule 4 (k), the Court need not address whether transfer to the Central District of California would be appropriate as that venue would also be without jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the reasons mentioned, the Court concludes that it is without personal jurisdiction over Defendant. Dismissal is granted to Defendant on all counts. An appropriate order shall issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
