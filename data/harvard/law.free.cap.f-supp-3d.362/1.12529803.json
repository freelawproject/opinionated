Plaintiffs Perry Spiller and James McCray are suing the District and two officers of the Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") for various constitutional and common law torts stemming from an encounter in which the officers allegedly used excessive force. Spiller and McCray allege that they were unlawfully arrested, injured, and detained, and that Spiller was maliciously prosecuted.

Previously, the Court held that Plaintiffs' original complaint failed to state a claim for negligent supervision because their \"bare allegations\" did not support a reasonable inference that the \"District or MPD officials were on constructive notice of dangerous or incompetent behavior by the officers in question\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to when Spiller and McCray were arrested.\"\n   <em>\n    Spiller I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524483\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/240/\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In an effort to cure this defect, Plaintiffs added the following allegations to the amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Before this incident, the District of Columbia knew or should have known, apparent from the opening of [an] internal investigation of these Defendant Officers, that Defendant [Officers] engaged in a dangerous and incompetent manner of arresting and charging individuals without probable cause and assaulting arrestees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The District of Columbia[,] armed with this actual or constructive knowledge failed to supervise Defendant Officers[,] failed to reverse their decisions, and failed to condemn the officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dkt. 29 at 12 (Amd.

In\n   <em>\n    Spicer\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that an inmate's negligent supervision claim \"barely\" survived a motion to dismiss based on his allegation that the supervising corrections officer \"was negligent in failing to adequately supervise the [corrections officers]\" who attacked him and that, \"due to the lack of adequate supervision,\" the corrections officers \"broke his foot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4302164\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4302164\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/916/1/\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those allegations, however, do not relate to the District's supervision of the officers' conduct in the performance of their duties; rather, they relate to actions that the District might have taken after the officers engaged in the conduct at issue.

As\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   makes clear, a desire to cover up an officer's use of excessive force is not enough-nor, more generally, is a bad purpose sufficient to state a claim for abuse of process. Rather, the plaintiff must also allege that the judicial process was used \"to accomplish some end which is without the regular purview of the process\" or to \"compel[ ] the party against whom it is used to do some collateral thing which he could not legally and regularly be required to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697749,7638262\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/748/\">\n    101 F.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11945293\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/601/1074/#p1080\">\n    601 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1079 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In their complaint, Plaintiffs allege only that the officers had \"the ulterior motive of covering up their assault.\" Dkt 29 at 13 (Amd.
