Downer, </em>wife of <em>Robert G. Downer, </em>who was the daughter of her nephew, and had been brought up and educated by her, she had determined to make some provision for her and her children; and had sent for her friend <em>Jacob Graves, </em>and had requested him to prepare for her an instrument which should convey to <em>Mrs. Downer)' </em>and her children certain slaves, reserving to the plaintiff the use of them during her life; and securing them from the control of <em>Mr. Downer, </em>her niece\u2019s husband ; who she alleged was intemperate and extravagant. That <em>Mr. Graves </em>came to her house, and in the presence of <em>Mr. Downer </em>handed her a writing which she understood from him would give effect to her wishes. That relying on this information, and supposing the deed to have been prepared according to her in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>structions, she executed it, and it was recorded. That some time after, she learned that the deed did not secure the property to <em>Mrs. Downer </em>and her children, but wouj(j g\u00bfve \u00a1t on the plaintiff\u2019s death to <em>Robert G. p)owner </em>contrary to her intention. And that she had recently learned that when <em>Graves </em>came to her house, <em>R. G. Downer </em>presented to him the deed which she executed, as one which he had prepared with the plaintiff\u2019s consent ,\u2022 and that <em>Graves </em>had presented it to her for execution, believing <em>Downer\u2019s </em>story to be true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-8\">The bill alleged further, that <em>Albert G. Shepherd </em>had sold to <em>Downer </em>a tract of land, and to secure the payment of the purchase money, had taken from <em>Downer </em>a deed of trust upon all or a part of the slaves conveyed by her as aforesaid, although, not long after the execution of her deed, <em>Shepherd </em>had made enquiry of her concerning <em>Doioner\u2019s </em>means, and had been informed by her that <em>Downer </em>had no property; and that she had given some slaves to <em>Mrs. Downer, </em>but had secured them from her husband\u2019s control.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-9\">The plaintiff made Shepherd, <em>Downer </em>and wife and the trustees parties defendants, and prayed that her deed might be set aside as fraudulently obtained; and that such other conveyance might be directed as would carry into effect the plaintiff\u2019s intention in favour of <em>Mrs. Downer </em>and her children; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-10\"><em>Shepherd </em>answered the bill, disclaiming knowledge of the circumstances under which the deed in question was made ; admitting that <em>Downer </em>was indebted to him for land sold to him, and necessaries furnished his family; and that the payment of the debt was secured by the land itself and <em>Downer\u2019s </em>interest in the slaves given him by <em>Mrs. Henderson; </em>but denying that he had made the enquiry or received the information as charged in the bill; The bill was taken for confessed as to the other parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The deed referred to is dated the 22d of April 1835, and conveys certain slaves therein mentioned, and their increase, \u201c to <em>Frances A. Downer </em>and her heirs forever, free from the claim or claims of all and every person or persons whatsoeverbut subject to the life estate <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">The testimony filed in the cause satisfied both the Court below and this Court that the deed was fraudulently obtained from <em>Mrs. </em>Henderson; and was executed by her under the persuasion that she was executing a very different deed. Therefore when the cause came on to be heard, the Court made a decree setting aside the deed, and with the assent of the plaintiff, directed that she should convey the slaves embraced in said deed and their increase, to trustees specified in the decree, to be held for the exclusive and separate use and benefit of <em>Mrs. Downer </em>and her children during her life, free from all claim, interest or control of her husband or his creditors, or others claiming under him, and on the death of <em>Mrs. Downer </em>to be equally divided among her children then living: subject to the life estate of the plaintiff. And the defendants <em>Downer, Shepherd </em>and the trustees in the deed for his benefit, were directed to release to the trustees appointed by the decree, all the right, title, and claim, they had in said slaves. From this decree, <em>Shepherd </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-9\">G. <em>N. Johnson, </em>for the appellant, went into an examination of the evidence, and insisted :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-10\">1st. That there was no fraud in the procurement of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-11\">2d. That <em>Shepherd </em>was a purchaser without notice of the fraud, if there was fraud; and as such would be protected in equity. And he referred to <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>12 Pick. R. 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>3d. That <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>could not maintain this suit. She says she intended to convey the slaves from herself, reserving a life estate. This deed reserves all g^g jnten(je(j t0 reserve. She therefore is not injured, anq she cannot complain of an injury inflicted on <em>Mrs. Downer.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-9\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlH6\">insisted, that beyond all controversy <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>intended to secure the property to <em>Mrs. Downer, </em>free from the control of her husband; and that the deed was fraudulently prepared by <em>Downer. </em>But whether the deed was prepared by the mistake of <em>Graves, </em>or fraud of <em>Downer, </em>he insisted it was competent for the Court to correct that mistake against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. The case of <em>Alexander &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>2 Gratt. 266, in its principles governs this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-10\">2. <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>may come into equity to complain that she has been fraudulently made to execute a deed to a person to whom she never intended to execute it. Or she may be considered as the next friend of <em>Mrs. Downer, </em>who is a party to the suit; and in whose favour the decree has been made. The Court will not, therefore, reverse this decree, which is right on the merits ; and that too when all the parties are before the Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b390-11\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ai19\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The Court, approving the principles of the said decree, and being of opinion that there is no error therein; it is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that the same be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
