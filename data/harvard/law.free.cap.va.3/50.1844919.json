Court to dismiss the suit, although it appears that the defendant is a'resident of another county in the State.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\"><em>Ashby </em>brought trespass against <em>Kiger </em>in the Circuit Court of <em>Hampshire: </em>and affidavit being duly made by <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>agent, that the writ was sued out to recover mesne profits of land lying in <em>Hampshire, </em>belonging to <em>Ashby, </em>which <em>Kiger </em>had held for many years; that those profits amounted to $1000; and that there was good cause to believe, that <em>Kiger </em>would move out of the Commonwealth before the determination of the suit; thereupon, a justice of the pe\u00e1ce of <em>Hampshire </em>endorsed on the capias, an order directing the sheriff to take appearance bail in the sum of $1000. The writ was directed to the sheriff of <em>Hampshire, </em>and returned <em>executed </em>by him, and a bail bond taken according to the precept. <em>Ashby </em>filed his declaration at August rules, 1818; on which a conditional judgment was entered against <em>Kiger </em>and his bail. At September rules, both parties appeared in <em>the </em>office, and the case was continued till the next rules. But, at October term, on <em>Kiger\u2019s </em>motion, and <em>because if appeared that he resided in \u2018Harrison county, </em>the Aourt, holding that the order for bail was improper, ordered <em>the suit to be dismissed. Ashby </em>applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the plaintiff in error, made three points *.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">1. That the affidavit was a good foundation for the order requiring bail, and the defendant\u2019s residence in another county no objection to it. <em>2. </em>That the justice of the peace was competent to make the order.' See acts of 1808, c. <em>6, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a7 2. 2 <em>Old Rev. Code, Supp. </em>12. 1809, c. 17, \u00a7 6. <em>Ibid. </em>54. Also, 1 <em>Old Rev. Code, </em>ch. 66, \u00a7 25, 78. And 3. That, supposing the order requiring bail improper, yet being the order of a competent judicial officer, not the plaintiff\u2019s own act, the true course would have been, to discharge the bail, not to dismiss the suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\">No Counsel for appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b63-6\"><em>November </em>12.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AuR\">The President,</author>\n<p id=\"AfP\">delivered the judgment of the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The affidavit being full and a proper affidavit, and the cause of action being emphatically within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, the Court is of opinion, that that Court erred in dismissing the suit. The judgment is therefore reversed, and the causo remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\"> Judges Cabell and Cabe, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
