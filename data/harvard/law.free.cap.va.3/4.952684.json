Emmons, </em>and the said <em>Daniel, </em>to <em>Burrage, </em>for 500 dollars of this money; which bond was held by <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>as agent of <em>Burrage.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-14\">In the spring, or early part of the summer of the year 1836, <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>administrator filed a bill in the nature of a foreign attachment, in the Superior Court of <em>Stafford </em>county, against <em>Thomas Burrage </em>and <em>Stephen Hempstead, </em>as absent debtors, and <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>as a home defendant, in which he charged, that <em>Burrage </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and <em>Hempstead </em>were indebted to <em>Slaughter, </em>in his lifetime, on three bonds, which he exhibited, and that <em>Daniel Emmons </em>held property or effects of <em>Burrage, </em>in his hands, which he asked to be subjected to the satisfaction of his claims. Process was served on <em>Emmons ; </em>and at the November term of the Court the bill was regularly taken for confessed as to all the defendants, and a decree was made against <em>Burrage </em>and <em>Hempstead </em>for the sum of 754 dollars 18 cents, with interest thereon from the 6th of March <em>1835; </em>and the defendant <em>Emmons </em>was directed to render before one of the commissioners of the Court, an account of the effects of <em>Bur-rage </em>and <em>Hempstead, </em>or either of them, which were then, or had been in his hands since the institution of that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">The commissioner subsequently reported that the defendant <em>Emmons </em>had appeared before him and admitted that he had sold a slave of <em>Burr age\u2019s </em>for 700 dollars; that of this, he had lent 500 dollars to <em>Enoch Jameson, </em>and had possession of <em>Jameson\u2019s </em>bond at the time the suit was instituted, but had since then delivered it to an agent of <em>Burrage; </em>and that after the allowance of certain credits which he claimed against <em>Burrage, </em>there was in his hands when the suit was instituted of <em>Bur-rage\u2019s </em>effects 525 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">In June 1837, the case of <em>Slaughter\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Bur-rage Sf als., </em>came on finally to be heard, when the Court decreed that the defendant <em>Emmons </em>should pay to the plaintiff, in part satisfaction of his decree against <em>Bur-rage </em>and <em>Hempstead, </em>so much of the sum of 525 dollars, with interest from the 17th December 1835 till paid, as should remain after deducting his costs expended in defending that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">In the mean time, in the year 1836, the bond executed by <em>Jameson, </em>and <em>Daniel </em>and <em>James S. Emmons </em>to <em>Burrage, </em>came into the possession of <em>Henry Coolce; </em>and there was an endorsement on it, dated the 10th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>August 1836, purporting to be an assignment thereof by <em>Thomas Burrage </em>to <em>Cooke. </em>This endorsement was clearly proved to be a forgery, and to have been put upon the bond some time after it purports to have been made. In November 1836, Cooke, who was in fact acting for <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>assigned the bond to <em>James Deshields </em>for value: and <em>Deshields </em>brought a suit thereon in the Superior Court of <em>Culpeper </em>county, in the name of Burrage, but endorsed for his benefit, against Jameson, and obtained a judgment at the June term 1837: a few days after the decree against <em>Daniel Emmons </em>in the case depending in <em>Stafford.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">Soon after the judgment was obtained by <em>Deshields, Jameson </em>obtained <em>an </em>injunction thereto. In his bill, he stated the foregoing facts; and he further insisted, that if <em>Daniel Emmons </em>had paid the amount decreed against him in favour of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, he was entitled to the bond executed to <em>Burrage: </em>and <em>Deshields </em>could only claim as assignee from him; and the plaintiff was therefore entitled to any setoffs against said bond in the hands of <em>Deshields, </em>which ho might have set up against <em>Daniel Emmons ; </em>and he then exhibited claims against <em>Emmons </em>to more than the amount of the bond. <em>Deshields </em>and <em>Daniel Emmons </em>were the only parties defendants to this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\"><em>Deshields </em>answered, denying all- knowledge of the facts stated in the hill; insisting that he had purchased the bond for value from <em>Cooke, </em>and had never heard and did not then believe, that the assignment of <em>Burrage </em>was a forgery; and he insisted, that in any aspect of the case, <em>Jameson </em>owed the money, and it was not for him to say that it was due to some one else. He objected further that <em>Burrage, James S. Emmons, </em>the other obligor in the bond, and <em>Cooke </em>the assignor, were not made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-8\">On the coming in of <em>Deshields\u2019s </em>answer, the plaintiff amended his bill, and made <em>Burrage </em>and <em>Cooke </em>parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to the suit. <em>Burrage </em>died soon after, and the suit was revived against <em>William </em>Major, the sheriff of <em>Culpeper, </em>to whom his estate was committed; and the bill was taken for confessed as to him. <em>Cooke </em>answered, denying ^1&lt;3 allegation as to the forged assignment from <em>Burrage </em>to himj or that he acted as <em>the </em>agent of <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>in the sale of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\">At the November term of the Court in 1838, the Court dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the bill; and from this decree, the plaintiff applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">After the cause came into this Court, the appellaut died, and it was revived in the name of his administratrix.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-6\"><em>William Green </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMoz\">insisted :</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\">1st. If the right to the money secured by the bond to <em>Burrage </em>was in him, then a payment by <em>Jameson </em>of the amount of the judgment, to <em>Deshields, </em>or to the attorney on the record, who was the attorney of <em>Deshields, </em>or to the sheriff, or into the Court in which the judgment was rendered, though under the order of the Court itself to do so, would not exonerate him from the claim of <em>Bun-age\u2019s </em>administrator. <em>Robson v.

If the right <em>to </em>the money secured by the bond was not in <em>Burrage, </em>it was only divested by the decree in the attachment case in <em>Stafford; </em>and then, it was either in <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, or in <em>Daniel Emmons. </em>If in <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, <em>Deshields </em>can have no right to it. And if <em>Daniel Emmons </em>has paid off the decree against him, in that case, so as to be entitled to the proceeds of the bond, he could not sue upon it at law, in his own name, because he was a joint obligor. <em>Moffatt </em>v. <em>Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Mullingen, </em>18 Eng.

That the appellant might have relieved himself from all responsibility, by paying the money into Court, or to the attorney who prosecuted the cause in the Common Law Court. That though the case of <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Eaton </em>seems to be opposed to this, that case was reviewed in <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>6 John. R. 296, where the doctrine was fully discussed, and the authority of <em>Robson v. Eaton </em>was denied. But if there was any doubt about this, yet the appellant having come into equity, and made <em>Barrage\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r a party, who does not controvert the right of <em>Deshields </em>to the money, <em>Jameson, </em>surely, cannot object <em>Barrage\u2019s </em>rights against <em>Deshields, </em>when <em>Burrage\u2019s </em>representative is present in Court, and acquiesces in the decree in favour of <em>Deshields.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">2. The decree in the attachment suit cannot affect the rights of these parties. That decree was against <em>Barrage </em>and <em>Hempstead, </em>as well as against <em>Emmons. Non constat, </em>that <em>Barrage </em>has not paid the debt to <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r himself. He was as much hound by the decree to pay the debt as <em>Daniel Emmons. </em>There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>is nothing to shew that <em>Emmons </em>paid it. <em>Burrage </em>does not admit it; nor does <em>Emmons </em>claim it. The right of the appellant to set off his equities against <em>Emmons, </em>therefore, cannot arise.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b30-11\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AO\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">The Court is of opinion, that the decree of the Circuit Court of <em>Stafford, </em>in the proceedings mentioned, having directed the money of <em>Burrage </em>in the hands of <em>Daniel Emmons </em>to be paid by the latter to <em>Slaughters </em>adm\u2019r, towards the discharge of the debt by a previous decree in the same suit recovered against <em>Burrage </em>and <em>Hempstead, </em>the said <em>Slaughters </em>adm\u2019r thereby acquired an equitable right to the bond executed, as collateral security, to said <em>Burrage </em>by said <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>together with <em>James S. Emmons </em>and the appellant\u2019s intestate, for the money in the hands of said <em>Daniel Emmons </em>as aforesaid; which equitable right must prevail against the claim of the appellee <em>Deshields </em>under the forged assignment of said bond purporting to have been made by said <em>Burrage </em>to <em>Cooke: </em>and that the appellant\u2019s intestate was properly in a Court of Equity, for the purpose of restraining the said <em>Deshields </em>from enforcing payment to himself of the judgment at law recovered by him for his own benefit, in the name of said <em>Burrage, </em>against the appellant\u2019s intestate and the other obligors in said bond; if the said decree in favour of <em>Slaughters </em>adm\u2019r\u25a0 still remains unsatisfied; or, if the same has been paid by the said <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>to have the equities amongst the parties, in the last mentioned aspect, adjudicated. The Court is therefore of opinion that the said Circuit Court of <em>Culpeper </em>erred in dissolving the appellant\u2019s injunction and dismissing his bill, instead of directing said <em>Slaughters </em>adm\u2019r to be made a party defendant, in order to a hearing and decision of the case according to the rights of the several parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Decree reversed and canso remanded to be farther pro-needed in according to the principles of the foregoing opinion and decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">After the opinion of the Court in this case had been delivered, the appellee by his counsel moved for a rehearing of the cause.</p>\n<author id=\"b31-9\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2\">It is unquestioned and unquestionable that, by force of the decree of the Circuit Court of <em>Stafford, Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r acquired an equitable right to the bond executed by <em>Jameson, Daniel Emmons </em>and <em>James S. Emmons </em>to <em>Burrage. </em>Upon the proofs in the cause, the claim to the bond set up by <em>Deskields </em>as assignee of <em>Cooke, </em>the pretended assignee of <em>Burrage, </em>is utterly without foundation; it appearing that the assignment purporting to have been made by <em>Burrage </em>was without his authority, knowledge or consent, and a mere forgery perpetrated by <em>Daniel Emmons </em>for his own benefit. It follows that <em>Deshields </em>had no right to prosecute the action at law upon the bond: and, if he had brought it in his own name, might have been defeated, by putting him upon the proof of the alleged assignment from <em>Burrage. </em>Of this lawful and just defence, <em>Jameson </em>was deprived by the mode of prosecuting the action, which was brought in the name of <em>Burrage </em>for the benefit of <em>Deshields; </em>and this kept out of view and precluded all enquiry into the genuineness of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Under these circumstances, <em>Jameson </em>had a clear right to be relieved in a Court of Equity, against the effort of <em>Deshields </em>to coerce payment to himself by process of execution. The latter as assignee of <em>Burrage </em>had no just demand against him; and the payment of the money to <em>Deshields </em>would have been no protection to <em>Jameson, </em>against the right of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, or any person claiming under him. I need not enquire whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Iher if the judgment had been apparently for <em>Burrage\u2019s </em>own benefit, and Jameson, without notice of the forgery, and of the right of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, had paid the execution to the sheriff or to the attorney on the record, he would have been protected by such payment. Here it appeared from the record that the action, though prosecuted in the name of <em>Burrage, </em>was for the benefit of <em>Deshields, </em>and that he claimed under the assignment of <em>Burrage ; </em>and <em>Jameson </em>had actual notice of the forgery, and of the right of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r. Under these circumstances, if he had paid, instead of resisting the payment of the execution, there is no principle or authority, that I am apprised of, which would have protected him against the assertion of the right of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, or of any one claiming under him, by assignment or substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">There is no proof, or even suggestion, in the record, that the decree of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, and consequently his equitable right to the bond in question, has ever been discharged. Nor if discharged, would that circumstance destroy <em>Jameson\u2019s </em>title to relief in a Court of Equity. If the decree has been paid, it must have been by the absent debtors <em>Burrage </em>and <em>Hempstead, </em>or one of them, against whom the foreign attachment of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r was <em>prosecuted; </em>or by <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>the home defendant in that case, in whose hands the money for which the bond in question was executed, was attached. If paid 'by <em>Burrage, </em>the obligee in the bond, his right to it, and to the judgment recovered thereupon, would have been completely restored, and <em>Jameson </em>could not have resisted a demand on his part for payment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Thus, whether the equitable right of <em>Slaughter's </em>adm\u2019r to the bond in question is still subsisting, or has been extinguished, the title of <em>Jameson </em>to relief against the judgment recovered by <em>Deshields </em>for his own benefit, in the name of <em>Burrage, </em>is to my mind perfectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>clear. In the <em>former </em>case, the relief ought to be for the . 1 . . whole amount of the judgment; m the latter case, it ought to be for the whole amount, if the decree has been . . discharged by Burrage, or if by <em>Darnel </em>Bmmons, then for so much as, upon an adjustment of the equities amongst the obligors themselves, shall be found to exceed the sum properly chargeable to <em>Jameson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">But upon the hearing of the cause in the Circuit Court, there was a serious obstacle in the way of the proper relief to <em>Jameson. </em>He had failed to make <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r a defendant to his bill. And the Chancellor, instead of removing this obstacle, by directing <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r to be made a party, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s <em>bill; </em>thus denying him all relief, and giving full efficacy to <em>Deshields\u2019s </em>demand under the forged assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The reasoning and authorities of the appellee\u2019s counsel are quite satisfactory to establish, that where a plaintiff in equity has shewn no right to relief, an appellate Court will not reverse a decree dismissing his bill, to enable him to introduce new parties, and thereby make a new case upon the merits. But it would be difficult to produce any reason or authority for the proposition, (which indeed the learned counsel has not ventured to assume,) that where the plaintiff has shewn a right to . relief against the defendants before the Court, his bill ought to be dismissed, because the proper relief cannot bo extended to him, in consequence of his omission to make other necessary parties. The directly opposite rule is well settled. The effect of an objection successfully taken for want of parties is not that the bill is dismissed, but that it stands over with leave to amend by adding the necessary parties: and if a defect of parties is apparent upon the record, the Court will take the objection, though the defendant do not; and the Court of appeal, if there he a defect of parties, will send the case back to the Court below. Calvert on Parties 116; 17 L. Lib.; 2 Rob. Pract. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>If the appellee\u2019s counsel had succeeded in demonstrating that <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r is not a necessary party, it would avail him nothing, without going further, and shewing that the appellant is entitled to no relief upon the meritsfor if entitled to relief he ought to have it, whether <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r be a necessary party or not. It is an entire misapprehension of the decree of this Court (now sought to be reheard) to suppose that it reverses the decree of the Circuit Court, on the ground that <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r ought to have been a party. The ground of reversal is that the Chancellor erroneously dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill, instead of giving him relief upon the merits, for which purpose it was proper that <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r should be brought before the Court, as was therefore directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">But I cannot doubt that <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r is a necessary party within the terms, as well as the true spirit and meaning, of the rule of 'equity on that subject'. The general rule was correctly stated by the appellee\u2019s counsel from Story\u2019s Eq. Plead. \u00a7 72, thus: All persons materially interested in the subject matter of a suit, either legally or beneficially, are to be made parties to it, either as plaintiffs or defendants, however numerous they may be, so that there may be a complete decree which shall bind them all:\u201d and from Calvert on Parties, p. 11, as that writer proposes to restrict it, thus: \u201c All persons having an interest in the object of the suit ought to be made parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">Now, can it be doubted, upon the case presented by this record, that <em>Slaughtei'\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r appears to have an interest both in the subject and the object of the suit ? The subject of the suit is the debt secured by the bond and judgment in question: the object of it to prevent the appellee from coercing payment of it to himself from the appellant. As the equitable owner of the debt, <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r is interested in the subject: as the person entitled to receive payment of it, he is interested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>object of preventing it from being paid over to another. It is in vaiu to urge, that if he is not made a party, the decree of the Circuit Court (dissolving the injunction, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, and thereby enabling <em>Deshields </em>to obtain the money) will not affect him, inasmuch as he may still have his remedy against <em>Jame-son, </em>and compel him to pay it over again. If this be considered a sufficient reason against the application of the rule, then it is obvious that the rule itself is for the most part nugatory, inasmuch as few decrees are binding upon those who are not parties to the suit, or can have the effect of preventing them from prosecuting any remedy, or making any defence, which they had before.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">That the spirit and policy of the rule are applicable to a case like this, is a proposition, it seems to me, free from all difficulty. The reasons for the rule are thus stated by Judge <em>Story </em>as deduced from the authorities: \u201c It is the constant aim of Courts of Equity to do complete justice, by deciding upon and settling the rights of all persons interested in the subject matter of the suit, so that the performance of the decree of the Court may be perfectly safe to those who are compelled to obey it, and also that future litigation may bo <em>prevented.\u201d\u2014\u201c </em>By this means the Court is enabled to make a complete decree between the parties, to prevent future litigation by taking away the necessity of a multiplicity of suits, and to make it perfectly certain that no injustice is done, either to the parlies before it, or to others who are interested in the subject matter by a decree, which might otherwise bo grounded upon a partial view only of the real merits. When all the parties are before the Court, the whole case may be seen: but it may not, where all the conflicting interests are not. brought out upon the pleadings by the original parties.\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. PI. \u00a7 <em>72.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Now, the decree of the Chancellor in this case dissolving the plaintiff\u2019s injunction and dismissing his bill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>is virtually a decree that he shall pay the money to <em>Deshields, </em>who claims under the forged assignment. <em>Jameson </em>is thus, if the decree is to stand, exposed to necessity of paying the money again; thus making it certain that injustice is done to him: and the person <em>' 1 </em>justly entitled is subjected to the necessity and hazard of future litigation. That the decree is founded upon a partial view only of the real merits is evident from the fact, that there is not a particle of proof, or even allegation, in the record, that <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r has obtained satisfaction: and we have had an elaborate discussion upon the effect of the decree against <em>Daniel Emmons </em>on the rights of the present parties, without an intimation that he has ever paid the money, though without such payment neither he, nor those claiming under him, can have acquired a scintilla of title to the subject matter in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">On the other hand, if the Chancellor, instead of dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill, had directed <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r to be brought before the Court, the way to a complete and final adjustment of all conflicting interests would have been made perfectly plain and easy. Upon the coming in of his answer, it would have appeared whether he had been paid or not. If not, then there would have been nothing to do but to decree payment to him by <em>Jameson, </em>and a perpetuation of the injunction against <em>Deshields. </em>Or, if it appeared that the decree had been satisfied by <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>then <em>Deshields </em>might have been treated as his assignee, and as such entitled to satisfaction of the debt from the coobligors, subject to their equities against <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>arising out of his liability to them for contribution, or for any other matters of equitable discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">It is in vain that the appellee\u2019s counsel urges a presumption of satisfaction to <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r. If an actual payment to him, as I have shewn, would not repel the appellant\u2019s right to relief, much less would the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>mere presumption. But what room is there for such presumption ? It is in no wise suggested in the appellee\u2019s answer, and the supposed acquiescence of <em>&gt;'Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r indicates nothing to the purpose. The mere absence of activity on the part of an apparent owner of the subject is not a surrender of his title, and if it requires explanation, he ought to have an opportunity of giving it. The circumstance that <em>Mr. Green, </em>the adm\u2019r of <em>Slaughter, </em>has argued the cause in this Court as counsel for the appellant, is at best but a shadow. He has treated the case professionally as he found it, with his accustomed zeal and ability, but he has not yet been heard as a party. When he comes to speak as <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, he will doubtless do so decisively; but how can any thing be inferred from his silence before he has had an opportunity of being heard ?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In truth, the wisdom of the rule requiring all persons interested in the subject and object of the suit to be made parties cannot be better illustrated than by this very case. The counsel concerned for the present parties, skilful and learned as they are, have not been enabled to reach the full merits of the <em>case; </em>and their discussions have been for the most part merely formal and technical. They have lost sight of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r, though it is only by substitution to him that either of their clients can have acquired any title to the subject matter in controversy. It is only as the assignee of <em>Daniel Emmons </em>that <em>Deshields </em>can gain any foothold in the cause, and yet in his answer he has roundly denied all right on the part of his real, though not formal, assignor. <em>Jameson, </em>too, has failed to shew any title to the subject, though the facts of the case establish his right to protection. Ho has asserted in his bill the erroneous proposition, that by the decree of <em>Slaughter\u2019s </em>adm\u2019r against <em>Daniel Emmons, </em>the latter has acquired a right to the debt in <em>question; </em>and upon this, and the relation which he bears to him as co-obligor, he builds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>an equitable claim of his own. It is a false foundation, unless <em>Daniel Emmons </em>has actually paid.the money, which no one has yet pretended; but still <em>Jameson </em>has ample ground to stand upon, in the simple fact that it wou^ gross injustice to compel him to pay the money twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">It is only by reasoning in a circle that <em>Deshields </em>can give any plausibility to his defence\u2014first by contending it was <em>Jameson's </em>fault that <em>Slaughter's </em>adm\u2019r was not made a party\u2014that consequently his case ought to be treated without any regard to the apparent right of <em>Slaughter's </em>adm\u2019r\u2014and so, in that view, that there is no propriety in requiring the latter to be made a defendant, in order that he may receive satisfaction, and <em>Jame-son </em>protection. This brings us back to the question, whether, admitting the fault to have been in <em>Jameson </em>at first, he ought to be punished by a double exaction of the same debt, and the other parties in interest vexed by a renewed litigation ; especially as he may have been surprised at the hearing, there having been no objection previously to the omission of <em>Slaughter's </em>adm\u2019r as a party, though the want of other specified parties was deliberately objected by <em>Deshields </em>in his answer, and the defect accordingly supplied by an amended bill.</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">It is true, in the language of the authority quoted by the appellee\u2019s counsel, the exceptions to the general rule as to parties, \u201c will be found to be governed by the same principle, which is that, as the object of the general rule is to accomplish the purposes of justice between all the parties in interest, and it is a rule founded, in some sort, upon public convenience and policy, rather than upon positive principles of municipal or general jurisprudence ; courts of equity will not suffer it to be so applied as to defeat the very purposes of justice, if they can dispose of the merits of the case before them, without prejudice to the rights or interests of other persons who are not parties, or if the circumstances of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>render the application of the rule wholly impracticable.\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. PI. &gt;\u00a7&gt; 77. But I am utterly at a loss to perceive within what exception to the general rule this can be brought; or how the purposes of justice can be sub-served, or the merits of the cause disposed of, or the rights and interests of third persons left unprejudiced, by dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill; or that there is the slightest difficulty in the application of the rule to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">After a careful rc-examination of the case, I am perfectly well satisfied with the decree of this Court already rendered, and think the motion for a rehearing ought to be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Cabell, <em>P. </em>and Brooke and Allen. <em>J. </em>concurred in <em>Baldwin\u2019s </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Stanard, <em>J. </em>concurred in the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
