D. 1816, between <em>T. Newell </em>and <em>T.

But the court,\u2014being of opinion, that the variance was not such as should prevent the paper from being given in evidence to support this declaration, that if <em>Newell </em>had intended to take advantage of the variance, he ought to have done so by way of plea, to which <em>Mayberry </em>might have had an opportunity to reply, and that <em>Newell </em>could not take advantage of the variance by way of objection to the evidence,\u2014 overruled the objection, and permitted the paper to be read in evidence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The <em>fourth </em>bill of exceptions, after setting out the written agreement again <em>in hcec verba, </em>stated, that <em>Newell\u2019s </em>counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that, as it appeared by that instrument, that the agreement was to be in force only until the 12th July 1816, if they should find that <em>Newell </em>did not get possession of the slave till after that day, they ought to find a verdict for him, in this <em>action; because, </em>in such case, <em>Mayberry </em>would have been no wise bound to permit <em>Newell </em>to retain the slave as his own property, and <em>Mayberry </em>would have had an action to recover the slave himself or his value, but could not maintain an action on this agreement. But the court refused to give the instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">The <em>sixth </em>bill of instructions, repeating the agreement <em>in hcec verba, </em>stated, that <em>Newell\u2019s </em>counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that if it should find from the evidence, that the agreement had been altered, after it was executed, by <em>Mayberry </em>himself, without <em>Newell\u2019s </em>consent, whether in a material or immaterial part,\u2014or that it had been altered by a stranger, without <em>Newell\u2019s </em>consent, in a material park-in either case, the jury ought to find for <em>Newell. </em>And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>thereupon the court instructed the jury, that if it should find 1 from the whole evidence, that the agreement had been a Itered, since the execution of it, in any material part, without <em>Newell\u2019s </em>knowledge and consent, either by <em>Mayberry </em>or any other by his procurement, then the agreement ought to be wholly disregarded by the jury, and it ought to find for <em>Newell, </em>unless the contract should be substantially proved by other evidence; but, if the jury should find, that the agreement had in fact been altered, whether in a material or immaterial part, but had not been so altered by <em>Mayberry </em>himself, or with his consent, or by his procurement, in such case the jury ought to disregard the altered parts only, and find accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-17\">To these opinions <em>Newell\u2019s </em>counsel exGepted, and appealed from the judgement to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-18\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant: <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-19\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">I am of opinion, that the words, <em>this agreement to be in force until the 12th July, </em>if underwritten at the time of the contract, or afterwards and before that date by the mutual consent of the parties, did constitute a part of the contract between them, and a most material part of it, since it limited (as I conceive) the right of purchase on the part of <em>Newell, </em>to the 12th July. Until that date he had a right to keep the slave, if he chose to do so, under the contract, and pay <em>Shepherd </em>for him. But after that date, he had no such right. If he detained him, he did not detain him under the contract, but of his own wrong, for which he was responsible in another form of action, but not in this. The declaration, therefore, having set out the contract as indefinite, and the contract being in fact limited, the variance was fatal, in this action, upon the trial of the general issue. If, indeed, <em>Mayberry </em>had offered proof, that these words were not subjoined by the parties as part of the contract, and that they were neither added by himself nor by any other at his instance or with his connivance, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>paper should have gone to the jury, with an instruction, that if it believed such evidence it should disregard those words; in which case, the agreement would have corresponded with the declaration. I am, therefore, of opinion that the circuit court erred in the points stated in both the <em>second </em>and <em>fourth </em>exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"AX-\">The court also erred in the opinion set forth in the <em>sixth </em>exception. The materiality of an alteration is, I take it, matter for the decision of the court; and, moreover, if it had appeared, that the alteration was made by <em>Mayberry, </em>or any other by his procurement, then he could never recover upon this contract, nor could he be permitted to establish it by any other evidence, or even to avail himself of the contract according to its original and true character. For the principle long since established as to bonds, <em>Pigot\u2019s case, </em>11 Co. 27. is extended, by recent decisions, to other instruments,^upon the principle, that no man shall be permitted to take the chance of gain, by the commission of a fraud, without running the risk of loss in case of detection. <em>Master </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>4 T. R. 320. 1 Anst. 226. 2 H. Black. 141. S. C. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Divett, </em>15 East, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The other judges concurring, judgment reversed, verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
