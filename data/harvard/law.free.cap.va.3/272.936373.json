For, 1st, the appellants having stated their case fully in their bill, made the absent defendant <em>Holloway </em>a party, and prayed general relief, ought, upon this bill, to be considered as attaching creditors : they were the creditors, indeed, who first sued out a foreign attachment, for the <em>subpoena </em>they sued out of the court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>had the effect of an attachment, though no bill was filed upon it: and considering both the appellants and appellees as attaching creditors, all the creditors are equally entitled to the benefit of the diligence of each, and the court in such cases, ought to let in all creditors, who come in while the fund is within the power of the court, to a fair participation in it. <em>Lashley v. Hogg, </em>11 Ves. 602. <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Haddon, </em>1 Madd. C. R. 529. and lord <em>Redesdale\u2019s </em>opinion in <em>Latouche </em>v. <em>Ld. Dunsany, </em>1 Sch. &amp;; Lef. 156. 2ndly, at any rate, the appellants were entitled to have the surplus of the proceeds of the subject, if any there should be, after satisfying the debt due to <em>Kinney, </em>applied to the satisfaction of their claims; yet the chancellor had not thought it proper to make any provision to give them even that. Srdly, <em>Kinney </em>could not attach <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>property for the instalments of the debt claimed by him, that had not yet fallen due; at least, he was not entitled to a decree for money not due. A foreign attachment and a decree upon it against an absent defendant, were given in place of an action and judgement at law against a resident defendant; but no judgement could be given at law, no action would lie for a debt not due. And, certainly, the court ought not to have decreed a sale to satisfy the instalments yet to come due : the most it could have done, was to decree a sale of so much as would raise enough to pay what was already due. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>M\u2019Comb, </em>4 Johns.

Rep. <em>534. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>4thly, and chiefly, the judgement which <em>Warwick </em>had obtained against <em>Holloway </em>and his sureties, in April 1823, to the amount of 5000 dollars, being prior in date to <em>Kinney\u2019s </em>decree, and even to his attachment, constituted a lien on <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>land, prior and preferable to the lien which <em>Kinney </em>acquired by his attachment and decree against <em>Holloway. </em>He said, the appellants had paid off and discharged this judgement; but it was immaterial whether they had or not. If the judgements were still unsatisfied, they gave <em>Warwick </em>a lien on <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>lands, which his sureties had a right to have enforced for their indemnity. If the sureties had satisfied the judgement, they had a right to be substituted to the benefit of <em>Warwick\u2019s </em>judgement against their principal, and to have his lands extended upon it. <em>Eppes v. Randolph, </em>2 Call, 125. 188. <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>3 Call, 285-9. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>11 Ves. 22. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>4 Johns. Ch.

He contended, that the appellants had a right to have <em>the whole debt </em>due to them from <em>Holloway, </em>charged upon his moiety of the land; as well that part of it, which arose out of the judgement against both <em>Holloway </em>and themselves, as that part which arose out of the judgement against themselves alone, and whatever they should any wise be held to pay as his sureties. He admitted, that <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>mortgage of the 11th December 1823, was not duly recorded, because it was not acknowledged before <em>justices of the peace </em>in <em>JYew Orleans, </em>but before the district court, which was not regular according to the present statute of conveyances, as was decided in <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Carlisle, </em>2 Leigh, 186. But, whether recorded or no, it was good as between the parties; good as against every body but purchasers without notice and creditors. <em>Kinney claimed </em>as creditor. But he was not a creditor of <em>Holloway: </em>he had no right to demand specific execution of the alleged agreement between him and <em>Holloway </em>for the sale of his wife\u2019s moiety of the land to <em>Holloway. </em>The agreement was ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>knowledgedly, in the beginning, a parol agreement; and the . _ 77 . <em>r </em>possession of <em>Holloway </em>was not such a part performance as to take the case out of the statute of frauds; for, in order to constitute possession taken, or acts done, by a vendee of ]ancj jjy paroi agreement, such part performance as will take the agreement out of the statute, the possession, or acts done, must have plain and certain reference to the agreement. Sugd. Law Vend. 83. Here, <em>Holloway </em>had the possession before the agreement, as tenant in common, and might well have continued to hold possession in the same right. Certainly, his possession was not, necessarily, a possession under the agreement. The agreement never was reduced to writing and signed by <em>Holloivay. Kinney </em>prepared a draft of it: <em>Holloway </em>excepted to its terms in two particulars: his letter stated his exceptions : the terms were never definitively agreed, much less reduced to writing. But, if this objection be ill founded, <em>Kinney </em>could not enforce a specific execution of <em>Holloway's </em>agreement to purchase his wife\u2019s land of him, because there was no reciprocity in such an agreement; the remedy was not mutual, since <em>Holloway </em>could not have compelled <em>Mrs. Kinney </em>to convey her right. <em>Id. </em>158. At all events, the court could not decree specific execution, before <em>Mrs. Kinney </em>had actually joined in a conveyance binding on her, and irrevocable. If she refused to join in a conveyance ; if she died the day after the decree for specific execution, of December 1823, and her rights descended to her infant children j <em>Holloway </em>would not have got the land, and yet the decree gave <em>Kinney </em>a judgement against him for the purchase money. The decree of December 1823, placed <em>Holloway's </em>debt to Kinney, not on any thing that had been done, but on acts to be done in future, which might never be done. <em>Holloway, </em>then, owed no debt to Kinney; and the decree that adjudged the debt to him, ought to be put wholly out of the way of the appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">I. <em>Johnson, </em>in his answer to the first set of objections to the decree of December 1823, said, 1st, That as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>subpxna </em>sued out of the court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>' <em>J o o\u2019 </em>by the appellants, in June 1822, no notice of that proceeding was brought home to <em>Kinney, </em>before he had obtained his decree against Holloway; and if he was apprised of it, it was not easy to see how process in another suit, and that a suit never proceeded in, and in fact abandoned, could be connected with this suit, to any purpose whatever. The court could only look to the appellants\u2019 bill in this case; and that was not framed as a foreign attachment: the appellants did not seek to attach <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>property; they claimed a lien on it, and a right to satisfaction out of it, in preference to <em>Kinney. </em>But, he said, in the proceeding by way of foreign attachment under the statute of <em>Virginia, </em>the attaching creditor was entitled to the whole benefit of bis own diligence; for he could only obtain a decree, upon condition of giving bond with surety to abide any future decree of the court, in case the proceedings should be opened at the instance of the absent debtor; and, surely, he could not be held to undertake that burden for any person\u2019s benefit but his own. 2ndly, He had no objection to the appellants\u2019 claim to the surplus of the fund, after the debt due to <em>Kinney </em>should be satisfied. The decree might be so corrected as to retain the appellants\u2019 bill for this purpose. Srdly, He insisted, that a foreign attachment would lie for a debt payable in future; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Bowie, </em>6 Munf. 176. Whether the whole subject attached ought to be so sold as not only to pay the instalments due, but to meet the deferred instalments when they should fall due, was always a question for the discretion of the court. And it were strange if it should be otherwise, seeing that the same statute, which gave the foreign attachment in chancery against <em>absent </em>debtors, gave also a common attachment against <em>absconding </em>debtors, for debts to fall due at a future time, and provided for a sale of the subject, exactly in the manner in which the chancellor directed the sale here. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123. &lt;\u00a7 14. p. 478, 9. 4thly, He strenuously contended, that the appellants could claim no benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>whatever, as against <em>Kinney, </em>from the judgement which <em>Warwick </em>recovered against <em>Holloway </em>and them, as there was no proof that the appellants had discharged that judgement, it must be taken that they had not; and as <em>Warwick </em>had never elected to have execution of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>lands, and as it was quite certain he never would elect to resort to that for satisfaction, the judgement in his hands was not a subsisting lien on the lands. But, if the appellants had discharged the judgement, how was it possible, that this <em>satisfied </em>judgement could be a lien on <em>Holloioay\u2019s </em>land, when no <em>elegit </em>could ever possibly be sued out upon it? The lien of a judgement on the debtor\u2019s lands was only a consequence of the capacity of the creditor to sue out an <em>elegit. </em>If the lien was extinguished in <em>Warwick\u2019s </em>hands, it could not be revived for the benefit of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>sureties: they could not be substituted in <em>Warwick\u2019s </em>place, for the benefit of a remedy which he himself no longer had. He went into minute examination of the cases, in which a surety paying a debt, has been substituted to the benefit of the remedies which the creditor had against the principal debtor; and he argued, that this doctrine of subrogation was the creature of equity, and that no such subrogation was ever allowed in equity, where the legal remedy of the creditor was extinct at law, <em>and </em>where, if revived in equity, it would overreach or affect the legal rights <em>of </em>third persons having equal equity. But, he said, the conclusive answer to this claim of the appellants, was, that they were creditors who had obtained a mortgage of the subject for the debt due them; and they could not now claim as <em>creditors </em>in any way, or in the double character of creditors and purchasers, but as <em>purchasers </em>only. <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Liggat, </em>2 Leigh, 84. 104. 5thly, Accordingly, they did claim as purchasers under their mortgage-; but the mortgage not being duly recorded was unavailing as against creditors. The deed was executed at <em>New Orleans </em>the 11th December 1823, while <em>Kinney </em>was pursuing his remedy by foreign attachment; and his lien was consummated by the decree of the 20th December 1823, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>before he could possibly have notice of the deed. The ap<em>1, </em>pellants had no just ground to complain, that he did not make them parties to his suit against <em>Holloway.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">II. With regard to the other objections, which, if just, shewed that <em>Holloway </em>owed <em>Kinney </em>no debt, and so razed <em>Kinney\u2019s </em>claim from the foundation, the first of them rested on the statute of frauds. The contract for the sale and purchase of <em>Mrs. Kinney\u2019s </em>moiety of the land, was, at first, a mere parol agreement. If the subsequent transactions with respect to it, did not shew that this agreement was reduced to writing, they shewed, at least, that <em>Holloway </em>claimed under the sale, and that the possession he afterwards held of the land, in intirety, was referrible to the agreement, and not to his tenancy in common. But this was an agreement in writing within the statute : <em>Kinney </em>reduced the agreement to writing, and signed it; <em>Holloway </em>then wrote him a letter, saying that <em>the draft corresponded with his idea of the contract, except in two particulars, which he specified; </em>and <em>Kinney </em>claimed according to the terms of the contract written by bim as modified by <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>letter. Taking the contract as written by <em>Kinney, </em>and <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>letter, together, there was a written agreement, within the words and spirit of the statute. The other objection was, in effect, that a husband cannot make an executory contract for the sale of his wife\u2019s land that will be binding on the purchaser, because the wife is not bound to convey in pursuance of her husband\u2019s agreement, and so the remedy is not mutual; a principle of very extensive consequence. It had, indeed, been doubted, whether it was right to decree specific execution of a contract of sale by a husband of his wife\u2019s land, at the suit of the purchaser against the husband j but it never was questioned, that, where husband and wife unite in a bill demanding a specific execution of a purchaser\u2019s contract with the husband, for the purchase of the wife\u2019s land, it was right to decree specific execution against the purchaser. To exempt <em>him </em>from the duty of specific performance, in such a case, were to exempt him from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>obligation contracted by him, with his eyes open to the situation of his vendor, with full knowledge of the necessity of the wife\u2019s concurrence, and in the expectation of her concurrence, in the execution of the contract; when the wife is willing to unite with her husband in the execution of it; when the purchaser is exactly in the situation in which he voluntarily placed himself; and when he has no delay, inconvenience or mischief to complain of. It was said, that, at all events, the husband and wife coming to demand specific execution of a contract, should have the wife\u2019s conveyance in court, duly executed so as to be irrevocably binding on her, before the court should hold the purchaser to specific execution. But there could be no substantial difference between an interlocutory decree for specific execution against the purchaser, founded on an actual exhibition of such a conveyance, and an interlocutory decree, like the present, suspended in its effect, until the conveyance should be duly executed, and filed in court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b310-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">If the appellants\u2019 case is to be sustained in this court, I am inclined to think it cannot be on the ground of their having presented themselves as attaching creditors in this suit, or as seeking to become parties to the attachment of Kinney, or as entitled to avail themselves of the naked <em>subpoena </em>which <em>they </em>sued out of the court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg. </em>Their bill assumes not at all the shape of an attachment; nor do they ask to participate in the benefits of <em>Kinney's, </em>upon the usual terms of the court; so that we may throw out of the case the various questions which have been suggested upon these views of the subject. And as to the <em>Lynchburg </em>attachment, whether the original indorsement bn the <em>subpoena </em>was or was not imperfect or inefficient; whether the lien has been preserved by keeping the cause on the docket, or lost for want of prosecution ; certain it is, I think, that we cannot (if I may so speak) splice that case to this, for the purpose of preserving the supposed preference, which the creditors may have obtained, by that process, over <em>Kinney and wife.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>But though upon these grounds the creditors have little . . . . . pretensions to success in this case, yet there are others that present much stronger claims to our attention. I shall consider these in succession.</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">The first of them which I shall notice, refers itself not so much to the merits of the respective pretensions of the parties, as to a question not vital to their interests. Admitting the superiority of the claim of the appellees, it is yet contended, that as they, after all, had only a right to have that claim satisfied, the bill of the creditors should not have been dismissed, until it bad been ascertained by a sale, that there would be no surplus, out of which they could have received payment. Whatever were the comparative merits of the claims of the appellants on the one hand, and of <em>Kinney and wife </em>on the other, the claims of the former against <em>Holloway, </em>have not been seriously contested. If, therefore, the proceeds of sale shall suffice to discharge the demand, or that portion of the demand, of <em>Kinney and wife, </em>which they may have a right to charge upon the land, and a surplus shall remain, there seems no assignable reason, why payment out of such surplus should be refused to the appellants, who stand, as sureties, in the shoes of a creditor whom they have satisfied, and moreover hold the deed of <em>Holloway </em>for the security of their demand : for, whether as representing <em>Warwick, </em>they could overreach <em>Kinney and wife, </em>or whether <em>Kinney and wife </em>were or were not bound by the unrecorded deed of <em>Holloway, he </em>at least was bound and chargeable to the appellants, on either of those grounds. Nor was it an apology for the dismission of the bill, that relief was hopeless, as no surplus was to be expected. Hopeless as it might have been, the result should have been awaited. And, indeed, it ought not to have been considered as hopeless. The decree was for the <em>sale </em>of the <em>whole </em>tract, for the <em>satisfaction </em>of the price of but <em>half </em>of it: and, though no calculation, in judicial proceedings, should have been made on the probability, that the ties of kindred would restrain <em>Kinney </em>from buying in his brother-in-law\u2019s estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>at an immense and ruinous sacrifice; yet there was a reasonable ground of hope, that long credits, and a judicious sub-division of the subject, might effect that which the more amiable feelings of our nature might have been appealed to jn vajn t0 bring about. Moreover, if it should appear, that the vendor, <em>Kinney, </em>had a right to a decree only for the amount actually due when his decree was rendered, and not for the deferred instalments, then there was every reason for presuming, that that half of the land which was sold by him, would be more than sufficient for that purpose, and would leave the proper land of <em>Holloway </em>for the indemnity of the appellants. I am of opinion, therefore, that in this regard, the decree of dismission is very clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">It is essential, however, that the court in reversing the decree, should pronounce upon certain other principles in the case, involving the merits of the controversy, in order to its ultimate adjustment. This leads me to consider, and to compare the pretensions of the parties, at least in some important particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u2022 The superiority of the claim of the appellants may be considered, either as arising out of the deed from <em>Holloway </em>to <em>Watts </em>and <em>Kinney, </em>for the benefit of his creditors, or as sustained by the supposed right to stand in the shoes of <em>Warwick, </em>and to charge the lands of their debtor, by virtue of the lien of the judgement which they have paid off and discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">First, let us consider their claim under the deed to <em>Watts </em>and <em>Kinney. </em>This deed, though not duly recorded, and therefore not valid as to the creditors of <em>Holloway, </em>is nevertheless binding between the parties themselves. It constitutes a lien, of which, as against <em>Holloway, </em>the appellants had a right to avail themselves. And it is not only valid against him, but it is also valid against all persons, except purchasers without notice or creditors of <em>Holloway. </em>It can only he assailed, then, in this case, upon the ground, that <em>Kinney and wife </em>are either purchasers without notice, or creditors. The former is not pretended. The <em>latter must </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>be examined ; and it brings us to one of the most litigated . . , points in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">I will remark, at once, that I do not conceive <em>Kinney </em>or <em>Kinney and wife </em>to be <em>creditors </em>of Holloway, in this regard. A verbal contract having been entered into between <em>Kinney </em>and Holloway, for the sale of the lands of <em>Mrs. Kinney, </em>the parties separated without having reduced the terms of the contract to writing; but with an understanding (to place the facts in the strongest points of view for the vendors) that <em>Holloway, </em>who was already in possession as jointenant should continue to hold the whole tract, one half in his own right as devisee of his uncle, and the other half as purchaser from <em>Kinney </em>and his sister. Waiving the question, whether this continuance of possession constituted part execution, and waiving also the objection arising out of the difference between the parties as to the terms of the parol contract, it is material to remark, that the written contract never was signed by <em>Holloway, </em>the party to be charged with it. <em>Kinney, </em>therefore, never has had any right of action at <em>law </em>against <em>Holloway. </em>If, indeed, the contract had been signed, and the covenants could have been regarded as independent covenants, <em>Kinney </em>might have then maintained an action for the money, notwithstanding a deed had not yet been made and tendered by himself and wife. But, as the contract was not executed, he had no demand whatever <em>at law </em>against <em>Holloway. </em>His demand was only in equity, where the payment of the purchase money never could be enforced until the title was made. Until this was done, he was no creditor in equity: and to this day it has not been done: to this day, for aught wo know, the title is in his wife, or, if she is dead, in her heirs; and if she refuses to make a title, or should die without the due execution of one, the contract is annihilated, both at law and in equity; all pretence of specific performance is extinguished; and the parties are thrown back upon those original rights, which they possessed anteriour to their treaty. How, then, can that be said to be a debt, which is a debt to-day, and to-morrow is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>none'? which is a debt, in case a wife shall, voluntarily and without the threats of her husband, convey away her own inheritance, and enable him to pocket the money, and no debt if she should decline to do so? How can <em>he </em>be said to be a creditor, whose demand depends upon a contingency which is beyond human ken, since that contingency, in its turn, depends upon the will, not to say the caprice, of a <em>feme covert </em>? Nay, how can <em>he </em>be said to be a creditor, or his adversary a debtor, when the whim, or caprice, or self interest, of that creditor himself, may make, or may avoid, the contract? Can there be a debt without a contract? Can there be a contract without mutual obligation ? Can there be an agreement between two parties, which binds one of them absolutely, and the other only at his pleasure ? Yet, here the contract between these parties would be binding on one, and not upon the other, if <em>Holloway </em>is to be considered as bound. If from an increased value in the land, or from any other cause, it should be the desire of <em>Kinney </em>to recede, what could .restrain him ? At <em>law, </em>he was not bound, nor is he yet bound for any thing. In <em>equity, </em>he cannot be decreed to pay <em>Holloway </em>damages for the loss of a good bargain, for this is a jurisdiction it does not exercise (Gwil<em>lim </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>14 Ves. 128. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>17 Ves. 277.) unless, indeed, in very special circumstances; and as to compelling the husband to procure a conveyance, the doctrine, never well received, has never been acted upon with us, and seems recently to have been discountenanced in <em>England. Emery </em>v. <em>Wase, </em>8 Ves. 505. 1 New Rep. 267. It is true, that in a recent case it has been said, that if the wife assents the husband will not be permitted to recede. <em>Howell </em>v. <em>George, </em>1 Madd. Ch. Rep. 1-7. But so easy is it where family convenience and profit concur, for the influence of the husband to withhold the assent of the wife, that, practically, the doctrine can never be of use. Be this as it may, the wife in this case is the essential contracting party, if indeed <em>she </em>is to be called ,a contracting party, who is bound or not bound, at her absolute will and <em>pleasure. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Being only thus far bound, the other party cannot have been <em>\u00b0 J \u2019 , </em>,, bound, and cannot thereiore have been a debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Upon this ground also it is probable, that no specific performance could properly have been decreed, since the want of mutuality in the contract, is generally a valid objection to the exercise of that jurisdiction. 1 Madd. Ch. Prac. ,423, 4. Certain it is, I think, that no decree should have been rendered against the vendee until the vendor had procured and offered in court a deed executed with all proper solemnities to pass the title of the wife; since, otherwise, this solecism is presented, that the decree between the parties is binding or not binding, at the will and pleasure of one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">It would be unprofitable to pursue, through all its consequences, this anomalous state of contract. Difficulties and absurdities fasten upon it, whithersoever we turn. Thus, this very decree of dismission, may have been free from error when it was rendered, upon the supposition that <em>Holloway </em>was a debtor of <em>Kinney, </em>for, in that case, the deed of trust was void as to him; yet, if <em>Mrs. Kinney </em>is since dead, or should now refuse to execute the contract, he is no debtor, and the decree is erroneous; for, in that event, he would certainly not be the debtor of <em>Kinney, </em>and therefore the deed of trust would be good against him. A bill for specific performance will lie for <em>Kinney and wife, </em>if they choose to abide by the contract; but <em>Holloway </em>cannot maintain such a bill. If he becomes a suitor for the benefit of it, he cannot <em>compel, </em>he can do no more than <em>solicit. </em>And his shortest course, instead of being suitor to the court, would be to become a suppliant to the lady.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">With these views, I have no doubt, that <em>Kinney </em>was no creditor of <em>Holloway, </em>and that the deed of <em>Holloway, </em>though not recorded, was good against him. This view of the subject renders it unnecessary to consider, whether as an attaching creditor, <em>Kinney </em>comes in by act of law, so far as <em>to be </em>within the principle, that he, who takes by act of law, steps only into the shoes of his debtor; and \u201ctakes his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rights precisely in the same plight and condition, as <em>he </em>possessed them.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>In such cases even though a complete legal title vests in the party, and there is no notice of any equity.affecting it, he takes subject to all the equity to which his debtor was liable.\u201d This is the doctrine as to assignees of bankrupts, and is broadly stated by sir <em>W. Grant </em>in <em>Mitford </em>v. <em>Mitford, </em>9 Ves. 100. in reference to all persons coming in by act of law. Whether attachment creditors are so to be considered, and whether the lien of an unrecorded deed would bind the estate in the hands of such persons, are questions not now necessary to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">If the superiority of the rights of the appellants, should not seem clear as arising out of the lien created by the deed of trust, let us next consider it in another light, in which it was presented in the argument at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">It is contended for the appellants, that having as the sureties of <em>Holloway, </em>paid off the judgements obtained by <em>Warwick, </em>they have a right, upon the principles of substitution, to the lien of the judgements upon the land, which has been subsequently attached at the suit of the appellees. The payment indeed was denied in the argument, though not absolutely denied in the answer. I shall take it as a fact in the cause, because alleged by the appellants themselves\u00bb whose case would perhaps present itself yet more strongly, if we suppose the judgements not to have been paid. In that view they would be relieved from the force of the argument, that equity will not revive a <em>satisfied </em>judgement, to the prejudice of an incumbrancer having the <em>legal title; </em>and of the other argument, that the taking the deed of trust changed their character of <em>creditors </em>into the less advantageous character of <em>purchasers; </em>an argument, which rests upon a supposed decision of this court in <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Liggat. </em>Moreover, their bill would then be considered, in the light of \u00e1n application to have the benefit of the judgements assigned them ; or as seeking to have the property sold to pay off the judgements, for which they are responsible; a right which is conceded to a surety, wherever the debt is due and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>payable for which he is bound, in the cases of <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>M'Comb, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 538. <em>Ranelaugh </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>1 Vern. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Taking the sureties, then, to have paid the debt, and to seek by substitution to have the benefit of the creditor\u2019s lien, there can be nothing more clear, than their right to this, as a general principle. It imports us only to examine the objections made to its application in the present case. These objections have been presented with great force and ability, by the counsel for the appellees. It is contended, that the lien of the judgement has been lost by lapse of time, no <em>elegit </em>or indeed other execution having ever issued; that the lien has been destroyed by the discharge of the judgement by the sureties; and that it has also been destroyed by the execution of the deed of trust, which has changed the character of the sureties from creditors into purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">I do not understand the counsel for the appellees as contending, that the two first of these objections could prove a barrier to the right of the sureties to proceed against the <em>debtor himself. </em>However long the judgement may have been out of date, there is no doubt, that, if susceptible of being revived at all, the lien upon the land yet in the hands of the debtor, would be revived <em>eodem flatu; </em>and there can be as little doubt, that if the principal debtor were to interpose the objection that the surety had discharged the debt, a court of equity would frown upon such a defence in its own <em>forum, </em>and would inhibit it in any other. 2 Call, 136, 7. But it is alleged, that the subsequent creditor has equal equity; and that by the payment or other discharge of the judgement, the legal lien which it gave is extinguished ; and it is contended, that that lien should not be revived at the instance of a surety against the\u2019second incumbrancer, who has by the fact of the discharge of the first judgement, acquired the better title at law. And the principle is relied on, that where equity is equal the law will prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The principle is unquestionable, but its application may be doubted. It is not true, that the equities of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>in the case supposed, are equal; and if that of the sureties . . , be supenour, it must prevail, although their adversary may have the law in his favour. The whole train of authorities on this subject, is founded upon the principle of the superiour equity of the sureties, to be paid out of that fund to which their cr\u00e9ditor might have resorted, for their relief. The surety in a bond, for the payment of which the principal has bound particular property, has a preference over all other persons, to have the debt charged upon that fund. If the principal dies, and after his death the surety pays off the bond, he has a right to demand the payment of the bond, out of the assets, before the simple contract creditors, and thus to be placed in the shoes of the obligee; because, at the instant of the principal\u2019s death, the obligee had a right to demand payment out of the assets, in preference to any simple contract creditor : in good faith, he should have demanded such payment, instead of putting the burden on the innocent surety: in good faith, the executor should have so applied the assets. An adequate portion should have been set apart and appropriated for that debt. No simple contract creditor had, or could have by law, any claim thereto. If the executor were sued by simple contract creditors, he might plead the outstanding bond in bar of the demand. He might fence around an adequate portion of assets against all their assaults. Nor is the state of things changed by payment being forced from the-surety, or being voluntarily made by him. If forced from him, a court of equity-will give him redress: it will consider him as standing in the shoes of the creditor, who ought to have looked to the estate of the principal, instead of drawing money from the pocket of the surety: it will consider the executor as holding a certain portion of the assets, as trustee for the payment of this very debt, and hold him to the discharge of the trust in its spirit, when it can no longer be performed to the letter: and it will deny to the simple contract creditor, who had no right to these funds, the application of then! to the payment of his debt. And why ? If the surety discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the bond, or a judgement and execution upon it, is he not a simple contract creditor only? and has not any other simple contract creditor a legal right to resort to this fund, as there is now no longer any bond or judgement to be charged upon it ? and has he not equal equity ? The answer is, no : he not only has not equal equity, but he has no equity whatever to charge a fund which, in equity and justice, belongs to another. He has no equity to demand, that money, which by law ought to have been applied to pay my debt, shall be applied to pay his. The ease is the same, if the payment is made voluntarily by the surety. In making that payment, he is governed by the law of this court. Even on entering into his engagement as surety, he looks to its well established principles. He knows, if he pays the debt to the obligee, he will stand in the obligee\u2019s shoes. He knows he will be subrogated to all the rights of the obligee, as they subsist at the time he makes his payment. lie knows that a court of equity looks not to form but to substance; that it looks to the <em>debt </em>which is to be paid, not to the <em>hand </em>which may happen to hold it; that the fund charged with its payment, shall be so applied, whosoever may be the person entitled; and that it considers a debt as never discharged, until it is discharged by payment to the proper person, and by the proper person. He knows, that that court, which permits no act of a trustee to prejudice the <em>cestui que trust, </em>will not permit one who stands in the relation of the creditor or obligee to the surety, to bar him of those rights which the principles of equity have secured to him. He is conscious, that his rights do not depend upon the caprice of the creditor, or the whim of an executor, or the sense of right of other creditors, but rest upon the immutable principles of justice and equity; and, in making his payment, he does it in the confidence, that he will be entitled to be indemnified to the full amount, to which his creditor could have charged the assets of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">The foregoing case, which I have put as an illustration, will sufficiently disclose my idea of the principles of equity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>in relation to this doctrine of substitution; and all the cases, <em>i </em>believe, will sustain the opinion, that the surety\u2019s right of subrogation, can never be resisted by any other creditor, on the ground that he has the law in his favour and equal equity. F\u00b0r\u2019 \u2019n trut^\u2019 kas n0 at a\u00fc as against the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">It would be unprofitable to go into a minute examination of the various cases which have been decided upon this subject, in some of which it is clearly seen, that the supposed legal advantage of a party will not protect him from the operation of this subrogation of the surety to the remedies of the creditor. It may, however, not be amiss to refer to two of the cases, with a view to make this matter more clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In the case of <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Randolph, Wayles\u2019s </em>executors paid off a bond in which their testator was surety for <em>Randolph </em>to <em>Bevins. </em>Chancellor <em>Wythe </em>declared, that they would have a right to stand in his shoes as against the heir, who had been forever discharged at law by the payment of the bond; and that if they had taken an assignment of the bond, and the heir had pleaded payment by the surety, he would have injoined him from making that defence. And the court of appeals further declared, that in the administration of the assets of the estate, which were inadequate to the discharge of all the debts, the executors of <em>Wayles, </em>who at law would only have been simple contract creditors, should be considered as bond creditors. The effect of this arrangement was to give them a <em>preference </em>over simple contract creditors, who <em>at law </em>had a right to an <em>equality, </em>and thus to deprive the latter of the <em>legal </em>right to participate in the fund, which they would have enjoyed but for the interference of equity. So in <em>Tinsley </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>it was declared, that, in the distribution of the funds, the sureties should be placed in the shoes of the creditors they had paid; the effect of which arrangement was to exclude from their legal equality, simple contract creditors, who, but for the interference of equity, would have enjoyed a full share of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Now, in these cases, it is clear, the legal right of the simple contract creditors was invaded. For, if the fund was only sufficient to pay off the bond, <em>they </em>would get nothing; and if it was even more than adequate to pay off the bond, but not enough to pay off the simple contract creditors also, the bond would be discharged in the first place, and they would only get the <em>residuum </em>among them. A more marked disregard of the <em>legal </em>privileges of parties, cannot well be conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">As to the position, that by taking the deed of trust, the sureties put off their character of <em>creditors </em>and assumed that of <em>purchasers, </em>1 cannot understand that the opinion in <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Liggat, </em>referred to, designed to go so far as to say, that a creditor <em>by </em>judgement, who takes a mere collateral security for the payment of his debt, thereby loses intirely the benefit of his judgement lien; and unless the principle be extended thus far, it can have no influence upon this case. Be this as it may, 1 understand that the principle is not considered as settled by that case. I am of opinion, therefore, that there is no validity in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In the views I have taken of the sureties\u2019 right of subrogation here, I have treated the claim of <em>Kinney, </em>as if it were a real and subsisting debt. But if we regard it otherwise ; if, as I have shewn, <em>Holloway </em>was no debtor of <em>Kinney ; </em>then the question of subrogation is one between the sureties and their debtor alone, and not between the sureties and another creditor of that debtor. In this point of view, the case is divested of every difficulty. The existence of a debt from <em>Holloway </em>to <em>Kinney </em>is, indeed, the essential ingredient in every part of this transaction. Without it, the deed of trust to the sureties is unquestionable; without it, their right to subrogation cannot be contested; without it, there is no barrier to an <em>elegit </em>on <em>Warwick's </em>judgement, though it may have run out of date; without it, the attachment of <em>Kinney </em>was illegal; without it, the decree in that case, was irregular; and without it, <em>no </em>decree could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>been properly entered against <em>Holloway </em>in the state of the <em>. </em>, . cause appearing to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AW1\">I have not deemed it material, or proper, to examine all the objections to <em>Kinney\u2019s </em>decree against <em>Holloway, </em>as there is no appeal from that decree. There is one, however, which ought not to be passed in silence, lest this court should seem to have disregarded it. I mean the decree for the sale of the land, not for payment only of the sum due, but for the deferred instalments also. The parties not having contracted for a mortgage, a mortgage could not have been decreed to be executed by <em>Holloway. </em>Yet this decree is, <em>uno flatu, </em>both mortgage and foreclosure. The utmost that should have been decreed, was, that <em>Holloway </em>should execute his bonds for the instalments, and that the vendor\u2019s lien should be retained for the security of them until payment.</p>\n<p id=\"ALn\">The decree entered by the court, declared, that in the original cause of <em>Kinney and wife </em>against <em>Holloway, </em>no sufficient ground appeared, upon which <em>Kinney and wife </em>could proceed by foreign attachment against the absent defendant, Holloway; no debt appearing to be due by <em>Holloway </em>to <em>Kinney, </em>but his demand depending upon the contingency of the execution of a deed by his wife for her land sold by her husband, which contingency might never happen, and did not appear to have as yet occurred: that, such being the case, whatever decree might have been rendered as between <em>Kinney </em>and <em>Holloway </em>(a matter of which this court had not cognizance, since no appeal from the decree in that cause, was before it), the appellants had a right to arrest .the execution of the decree actually pronounced, at least so far as it respected the sale of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>proper moiety of the tract of 916 acres of land, devised by his uncle to him and his sister; and they had moreover a right to a decree for the sale of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>moiety (either under <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>mortgage thereof for their indemnity, or as standing in the place of <em>Warwick, </em>so far as they had paid off and discharged his judgements, or as entitled to <em>compel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>payment thereof out of <em>Holloway\u2019s </em>property thereby bound to satisfy them) for any sums which they might have paid, or be liable to pay, for Holloway; of which an account ought to be taken : and that, therefore, the injunction to the execution of <em>Kinney\u2019s </em>decree against <em>Holloway, </em>of Decernher 1823, ought to be reinstated and perpetuated, so far as respected the moiety of the tract of 916 acres which belonged to <em>Holloway </em>as devisee of his uncle. Therefore, the chancellor\u2019s decree was reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, to be further proceeded in, according to the principles here declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
