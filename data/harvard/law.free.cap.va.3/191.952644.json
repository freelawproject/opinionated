To this opinion of the Court the defendant excepted; and a verdict and judgment thereon being given for the plaintiff, the defendant applied to this Court for a supersedeas, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-4\"><em>Stuart, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AdUg\"><em>Fultz, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\"> 1Vie <em>ad says: </em>That in all actions which may hereafter be brought upon any promissory note, bill of exchange, draft or other writing, or on any endorsement, assignment or acceptance thereof, and in which the declaration shall allege or charge that the defendant or any\u2019 other person made, assigned, endorsed or accepted the same, and subscribed his or her name thereto, every such note, bill, draft, assignment, endorsement, acceptance or other writing, with the name or signature thereto subscribed, upon being offered in evidence, shall be deemed and taken to be genuine, and the name or signature, to have been subscribed or made by the person charged therewith, without any proof of the handwriting; unless the defendant or some other person shall make affidavit, to be filed with the plea, that the said note, bill, endorsement, assignment, acceptance or other writing, was not made by the person charged therewith, or in case it be the name or signature of any person other than the affiant, then that he hath good cause to believe, and does believe, that the same was not so made or signed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b212-6\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A1c\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The Court is of opinion, that the Circuit Court erred in permitting the order or draft, purporting to have been drawn by the plaintiff in error, to go in evidence to the jury, as stated in the second bill of exceptions, without evidence of the genuineness of the signature thereto; inasmuch as the declaration only alleges that the plaintiff in error made said order or draft, without also alleging that he subscribed his name thereto, which the statute of the 5th of February 1828, dispensing with the proof of handwriting in certain cases, Sup. Rev. Code, p. 265, requires. It is therefore considered by the Court, that the said judgment is erroneous, and that the same be reversed and annulled, and the verdict of the jurors set aside ; and that the plaintiff in error recover against the defendant in error his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his writ of error aforesaid here. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit Court for a new trial to be had of the issue between the parties, prior to which, the said Circuit Court is to give the defendant in error leave to amend his declaration, and the plaintiff in error leave to file such affidavit as the statute authorizes, if by them respectively applied for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
