Baldwin, </em>was one. The real estate consisted of two tracts, one containing about three hundred acres of land well improved, and upon which there was a valuable tavern house, the other tract contained about 80 acres of wood land of little value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\"><em>Paxton </em>in his.lifetime, had leased the farm and tavern to <em>Samuel Darst, </em>for a term of five years ending on the first of March 1841: and before that time he died. In November 1840, <em>C. C. Baldioin </em>and <em>Margaret </em>his wife filed their bill in the Superior Court of <em>Rockbridge, </em>against the other children and devisees of <em>Hugh Paxton, </em>for a partition of the land. This was resisted by the other cotenants, on the ground that the tract of land was not susceptible of division without greatly impairing the value of the respective interests therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-12\">At the termination of the lease to <em>Darst, Baldwin </em>wished to take possession of a portion of the joint estate, and to cultivate it himself; but the other cotenants i-ented the whole of the farm, for another, term of a year, to <em>Darst, </em>who took the lease with a full knowledge that <em>Baldwin </em>refused to join in it; and of his intention to cultivate a part of the farm himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-13\">On the 2d of March 1841, <em>Darsfs </em>new term commenced ; and on the same day, <em>Baldwin </em>entered upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>and took possession of about thirty acres of the land; declaring his intention to cultivate it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYq\">In April, <em>Darst </em>obtained from the J udge of the Circuit Superior Court of Rockbridge, an injunction to restrain <em>Baldwin </em>from disturbing him in the possession of the laud; and at the next term of the Court <em>Baldwin </em>having answered moved for a dissolution of the injunction, but the motion was overruled. At the September term of the Court, the cause was finally heard, when the Court premising that the purpose of the injunction would cease to exist after the expiration of the plaintiff\u2019s lease on the 1st of the next March, and as its dissolution after that time, would be necessary to give full and complete effect to the decree for partition entered during the then present term, in a suit for the purpose, between the defendant and his codevisees, made a decree, that the injunction be dissolved from and after the first day of the next March; that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed, and that the defendant pay him his costs. From this decree <em>Baldwin </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-7\"><em>J. B. Baldwin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">The injunction was improvidently awarded in this case, and should have been dissolved with costs. 1. One joint tenant has no right to the exclusive possession of the joint estate against his cotenant; and therefore, cannot confer any such right upon another by lease or otherwise. <em>Tuttle </em>v. Eskridge, 2 Munf. 330; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>4 Rand. 477; 13 Viner\u2019s Abr. 381, pl. 14. The lease to <em>Darst </em>was therefore void as to <em>Baldwin; </em>and he might enter upon the joint property, and take its profits. 2. But if the appellant had no right to enter upon the land a Court of Equity had no jurisdiction to grant the tenant relief. There was a plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>4 Rand. 477.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-9\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-14\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A45\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AW-s\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">The Court is of opinion that the Court below erred in not dissolving the injunction, at the first hearing of motion made for that purpose, and also in continu\u00a1ng the injunction till the termination of the lease, and then dissolving it at the costs of the appellant; this Court being clearly of opinion that the injunction ought never to have been granted. The decree is therefore reversed with costs; and this Court proceeding to pronounce such decree as the Court below ought to have pronounced, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the injunction be dissolved, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
