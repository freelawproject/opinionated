The provision of the act, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123, <em>\u00a7 </em>4, p. 476, directing the decree against an absent debtor to stand absolutely confirmed against the absent debtor who shall not within seven years appear and petition to have the cause reheard, only applies to so much of such decree as operated upon the estate or effects of such absent debtor, subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">3. A decree <em>in personam </em>against an absent debtor, is entitled to all the respect to which any other decree is entitled, in all collateral controversies. So that if property is sold under an execution issued thereon, the title to said property cannot be impeached by objections to the form or merits of the decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">3. A decree against an absent debtor merges the original cause of action, so far as to enable the plaintiff to rely thereon, in any subsequent proceeding to enforce it, as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the demand it establishes; and to repel the statute of limitations, except so far as the statute may apply to judgments or decrees.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b118-12\">4. Such a decree, so far as it reaches beyond the cause or thing subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, and purports to operate <em>in personam </em>merely, so as to create a personal charge alone, is not of such binding and conclusive character as to preclude all enquiry into the merits thereof; notwithstanding more than se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>von years have elapsed since it was pronounced. But it may be shewn to he erroneous, either upon its face, or by evidence <em>aliunde.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AjS\">5. Decrees against absent defendants have the same effect as decrees against absent debtors. And so far as the decree operates upon a subject within the jurisdiction of the Court, the interests of such absent defendant therein, are conclusively bound by the decree, unless he shall appear and petition for a rehearing within seven years. But the limitation of seven years has no application to so much of the decree as acts <em>in personam, </em>and establishes a personal demand.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">Prior to the year 1801, <em>James Dunlop, David Buchanan </em>and <em>Robert Pollock </em>were merchants and partners, doing business in the towns of <em>Petersburg </em>and <em>Manchester, </em>and in the City of <em>Richmond: </em>in <em>Manchester, </em>under the name of <em>Robert Pollock Sy Co. </em>In that year they dissolved their partnership: and a new firm was formed by <em>David Buchanan </em>and <em>Robert Sy Allan Pollock, </em>under the name of <em>Robert Sy Allan Pollock Sy Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">At the time of the dissolution of the first partnership, <em>John Sy Cornelius Pate Sy Co. </em>of <em>Bedford </em>county, were their debtors. After the formation of the new partnership, the <em>Pates </em>became the debtors of that house ; and in 1804, transferred to <em>Robert Sy Allan Pollock Sy Co. </em>debts amounting to near \u00a31000, which, when collected, were to be applied to the satisfaction <em>pro tanto </em>of the debts due the old and new firms. These debts were, by consent of the parties, placed in the hands of <em>Col. William Hancock, </em>for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-7\">Soon after this transfer by the <em>Pates, James Dunlop </em>purchased the interest of his former partners in the debts then due the old concern ; and in 1807, he filed a bill in the Chancery Court at <em>Richmond, </em>against <em>Robert Sy Allan Pollock Sf' Co. </em>and others, seeking, among other things, to have his due proportion of the claims transferred by the <em>Pates </em>applied to the payment of the debt due the first partnership. In the progress of this cause, a compromise was made between <em>Dunlop </em>and <em>Robert Sy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Allan. Pollock Sp Co. </em>by which it was agreed that this last firm should be allowed out of the claims transferred by the <em>Pates, </em>the amount of their debt; and the remainder of the fund should be transferred to <em>James Dunlop. </em>In pursuance of this agreement, <em>Allan Pollock </em>wrote to <em>Col. Hancock, </em>requesting him to make a statement of the amount which his firm had <em>received; </em>and if it did not amount to as much as their debt, to retain enough to discharge <em>it; </em>and pay over the balance of the fund to <em>Dunlop.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-10\"><em>. </em>In 1817, <em>Tompkins Sp Murray, </em>claiming to be the assignees of <em>James Dunlop, </em>filed their bill in the Chancery Court of <em>Lynchburg, </em>against <em>Col. Hancock, David Buchanan </em>as the surviving partner of <em>Robert Pollock Sp Co. </em>and <em>Edmund W. Rootes </em>as the executor of <em>Allan Pollock, </em>who was the executor of <em>Robert Pollock, </em>seeking to recover from <em>Hancock </em>the amount of moneys in his hands belonging to <em>James </em>Dunlop, and from <em>Buchanan </em>as the surviving partner of <em>Robert Pollock Sp Co. </em>and <em>Rootes </em>as the executor of <em>Allan Pollock, </em>who was the executor of <em>Robert Pollock, </em>the amount then in their hands, to which, as the assignees of <em>Dunlop, Tompkins Sp Murray </em>were entitled. In this case, <em>Buchanan </em>being a citizen and subject of <em>Great Britain, </em>and not residing in the State of <em>Virginia, </em>was proceeded against as an absent defendant, under the Act of Assembly. The accounts were referred to a commissioner, who made a report to which both parties filed exceptions; and the cause coming on to be finally heard, the Court made a decree against <em>Hancock\u2019s </em>representative in favour of the plaintiffs for 6404 dollars 52 cents ; and also made a personal decree against the absent defendant <em>David Buchanan, </em>as the surviving partner of <em>Robert Sp Allan Pollock Sp Co. </em>in favour of <em>Hancock\u2019s </em>representative, for 3950 dollars 41 cents. After this decree, a compromise was made by the plaintiffs and <em>Hancock\u2019s </em>representative, by which he assigned to <em>the </em>plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>tiffs, without recourse to him, his decree against <em>Buchanan ; </em>and the decree entered in the cause was modified ; and the plaintiffs took a decree against <em>Hancocks </em>representative for 1109 dollars 84 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\"><em>David Buchanan </em>died subsequent to the final decree in the cause in the <em>Lynchburg </em>Chancery Court. In his lifetime, <em>Rootes </em>had acted as his agent in <em>Virginia; </em>and had collected considerable sums of money, and transmitted them to him in <em>Great Britain. </em>And after the death of <em>Da,vid Buchanan, Rootes </em>acted as the agent of <em>Robert Garrick Buchanan, </em>who was the donee or legatee of <em>David, </em>and transmitted moneys to him; and at the time of the decree appealed from in this case, Rootes\u2019 executrix had in her hands the sum of 438 dollars, which he had collected for <em>Robert Garrick Buchanan. </em>The moneys so collected and transmitted were moneys of the firm of <em>Robert Sp Allan Pollock Sp Co.; </em>to which <em>Buchanan </em>was entitled as surviving partner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">After the decree in the <em>Lynchburg </em>Chancery Court, <em>Tompkins $p Murray </em>failed in business, and conveyed their effects in trust for their creditors ; and in 1835, the surviving trustees <em>Philip Norborne Nicholas </em>and <em>Richard Anderson, </em>filed their bill in the Superior Court of Law and Chancery for the county of <em>Amherst, </em>against <em>Edmund Winston, </em>sheriff of that county, to whom the estate of <em>David Buchanan </em>had been committed, <em>Edmund W. </em>.Rootes, in his own rigid, and as executor of <em>Allan Pollock, </em>who was executor of <em>Robert Pollock, </em>and <em>GMswcll Dabney, </em>who as attorney for <em>Rootes, </em>the agent of <em>Buchanan, </em>had collected and then held a small sum of money in his hands. The object <em>of </em>this suit was to recover the amount of the decree rendered against <em>David Buchanan </em>in the <em>Lynchburg </em>Chancery Court, which remained unsatisfied, from <em>Rootes, </em>as the representative <em>of the Pollocks.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\"><em>Rootes </em>died soon after the institution of the suit: and it was revived against <em>Mrs. Rootes </em>as his executrix and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sole devisee. <em>Mrs. Rootes </em>answered the bill, admitting: 0 that she had in her hands the sum of 438 dollars, collected by her testator for <em>Robert Garrick </em>Buchanan, but insisted that the decree against <em>Buchanan, </em>as the survhdng partner of <em>Robert Allan Pollock Co., </em>was <em>coram non judice, </em>and null and <em>void; </em>because it was a personal decree against an absent <em>defendant; </em>and he was not a party to the suit as the surviving partner of <em>Robert Sf Allan Pollock Co., </em>but of the former firm of <em>Robert Pollock Sf Co.; </em>and that no claim against him as a member of the firm of <em>Robert Sf Allan Pollock &amp;f Co. </em>was set up in the bill; in which indeed they were not <em>named; </em>and there was no prayer for relief against him as a member of that <em>firm; but the </em>prayer for relief was specific against <em>Hancock </em>and the <em>Pates.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">She insisted further, that if the decree was obligatory upon <em>Buchanan, </em>it was in no wise binding upon the representatives of the deceased <em>partners; </em>and was not evidence against them of the existence of a debt from the firm of <em>Robert Sf Allan Pollock Sf Co. </em>And she insisted that <em>Rootes </em>was not a party as executor of <em>Allan Pollock; </em>but simply as the representative of <em>Robert Pollock, </em>a member of the old firm of <em>Robert Pollock Co.; </em>and that he had fully administered the estates of <em>Robert </em>and <em>Allan Pollock </em>before the institution of this suit. And further, that the report of the commissioner, and the vouchers filed in the cause in the <em>Lynchburg </em>Court, shewed that the decree was erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-7\"><em>Dabney </em>answered, admitting that there was in his hands the sum of 28 dollars 38 cents, collected for <em>Robert Garrick Buchanan.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-8\">The cause came on to be heard in 1837, when the Court made a decree, directing <em>Dabney </em>to pay to <em>Edmund Winston, </em>as the administrator of <em>David Buchanan, </em>the sum of 28 dollars 38 cents, with interest; and directing Rootes\u2019 executrix, out of the estate of her testator in her hands, to pay to <em>Winston </em>the sum of 438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>dollars, with interest from the time the same was received : and also directing <em>Winston </em>to render an account of his administration before a commissioner of the Court; and that Rootes\u2019 executrix should render before the same commissioner an account of all sums of money, debts, or other estate, either real or personal, which remained in at the time or came to his hands after the death of <em>Buchanan.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\">The decree then declared, that if upon the coming in of the report, there should not be sufficient assets found in the hands of the defendant <em>Winston, </em>of the assets of <em>David Buchanan, </em>to satisfy the balance of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, satisfaction thereof would be decreed out of the estate of <em>Robert Sf Allan Pollock, </em>if the plaintiffs would make their representatives parties defendants; and if that fund was inadequate, satisfaction would be decreed out of the estate of <em>Rootes </em>in the hands of his executrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">Prom this decree Rootes\u2019 executrix applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-15\"><em>G. N. </em>Johnson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKG\">The question involved in this cause is, whether a personal decree against a party proceeded against as an absent defendant, is conclusive against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-16\">It has been a vexed question, whether a decree or judgment against a person upon whom process was served, and who appeared in the cause, is <em>prima facie </em>or conclusive against him in another country: but the weight of authority is against the conclusiveness of the judgment. <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>9 Mass. R. 462: <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>Doug. It. 1; <em>Arnott </em>v. <em>Redfern, </em>13 Eng. C. L. R. 1. But a judgment against a person not a resident in the country where the judgment was rendered, upon whom no process was served, will <em>not </em>raise an <em>asswmpsit; </em>though the judgment was rendered upon a proceeding prescribed by the law of the place where it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>was rendered. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Rticlcer, </em>9 East\u2019s R. 192. And the <em>American </em>cases are unanimous, that where process has not been served on a defendant, and he has not appeared in the cause, a Court cannot render a judgment w^ch will bind him. <em>Borden </em>v. Fitch, 15 John. R. 121; <em>Mills v. </em>Duryee, 7 Cranch\u2019s R. 181; <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>M'Connell, </em>3 Wheat. R. 234; <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>4 Conn. R. 380; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Pick. R. 232 ; <em>Shumway </em>v. <em>Stillman, </em>6 Wend. R. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-4\">The only difference in the effect of the judgment in the State where it is rendered, and in another State, is, that it may operate <em>in rem </em>when the property is there; and possibly, under our statute, a decree after seven years might prevent the setting aside what had been done under it. The cases of <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>and <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>shew that the proceeding is as <em>in rem. </em>And so is <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Holker, </em>1 Dall. R. 261.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-5\">If the suit upon the decree is brought in the State in which it was rendered, on principle, the force and validity of the decree must be the same. The decree is not obligatory abroad because the party was not before the Court either by service of process or appearance; and this is equally the case where the suit is brought in the State in which the first decree was rendered. If, therefore, for the reason assigned, the decree is null in the first case; for the same reason it must be null in the second.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">The act 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66, 46, p. 205, and the act, ch. 123, \u00a7 5, p. 476, authorizes an absent person to be made a party, when he is a necessary party to a controversy depending in the Courts of this State. But it was not intended to make all absent debtors parties to suits instituted here. The object was to remove an obstacle to the administration of justice between parties here. Sometimes an absent person is a necessary party to enable the Court to decide upon the rights of parties who are present. But where there is but one person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>against whom a right or a claim is to be enforced, and he is absent, a suit cannot be sustained against him. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>3 Rand. 41: <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Bridges, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 413 ; 1 Rob. Pr. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-4\">The jurisdiction taken against absent defendants, being only <em>ex necessitate rei, </em>to administer the rights of others, it can neVer be necessary to make a personal decree against such absent defendant; and unless the Court shall be of opinion that the act intended to give to our Courts authority to administer justice over all persons, wherever living, and whatever their rights, station, or condition, a mere personal decree in such case must be void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-14\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE_\">The question submitted to the Court by the counsel for the appellant is, whether the decree rendered against <em>Buchanan, </em>an absent defendant, is void. It was said by the Yice Chancellor in the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Nicolls, </em>5 Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 198, that a foreign judgment was not examinable in <em>Westminster Hall. </em>And so says <em>Story </em>in his Conflict of Laws, ch. 15, \u00a7 606, p. 506.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-15\">The case of <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Rucker, </em>9 East\u2019s R. 192, relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel, was a simple suit against one person having no property within the jurisdiction of the Court. But the Courts both of <em>England </em>and <em>Scotland </em>recognize the validity of a judgment against a person who has an interest in the country which may be affected by it: and that not only to the extent of the property,, but also as a personal judgment. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>15 Eng. C. L. R. 113; <em>Becquet </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>22 Id. 20; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>39 Id. 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-16\">In this country, it has been held that a judgment in one State is not binding in another, where the defendant has not been served with process. And the same rule has been applied to judgments and decrees in attachment cases. The Courts of this country have given less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>effect to such judgments than was given in <em>England </em>in ibe case of <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Forrest. </em>But these Courts have not anticipated from their decisions the conclusion which bas been deduced from them by the counsel for the appedant; but have expressly disavowed it. <em>Kilburn v. Woodworth, </em>5 John. R. 37; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>8 Id. 67; <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>15 Id. 121; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>19 Id. 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-4\">There is certainly great difficulty in reconciling the decisions relied on by the appellant\u2019s counsel, with the Constitution of the <em>United States: </em>but whatever may be thought about their soundness, it does not follow that because such a judgment will be treated as null in another State, it will be so considered in our own. Here the Court must give it effect according to the laws of <em>Virginia, </em>whatever may be done <em>elsewhere; </em>and the whole question is, what is the intent and meaning of the <em>Virginia </em>statute ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">The preamble to the statute speaks of persons; and the statute gives jurisdiction against all nonresident persons. In <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Bowe, </em>6 Munf. 176, the absent defendant was an inhabitant of <em>Maryland. </em>In <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>1 Leigh 285, the absent defendant resided in the District of <em>Columbia. </em>In the <em>Merchants Bank </em>v. <em>The Bank of the U. S., </em>1 Rob. R. 573, the case was put upon the ground that the corporation was a foreign corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-6\">The act 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123, \u00a7. 2, p. 475, says : \u201c If such absent defendant shall not appear and give security, within the time limited, or such further time as the Court may allow for good cause shewn, the Court may proceed to take such proof as the complainant shall offer ; and if they shall thereupon, be satisfied of the justice of the demand, they may order the bill to be taken for confessed, and make such order and decree therein, as may appear just, and may enforce due performance and execution thereof by such ways and means as have hereto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>fore been used for enforcing other decrees.\u201d Thus it is apparent that there can be no decree against a home defendant in favour of the plaintiff unless there is proof of the debt against the absent defendant: and in fact the case must be settled precisely as if the plaintiff and the absent defendant were the only parties in the cause. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>White, </em>3 Munf. 94; <em>Glassell </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>3 Leigh 113. Suppose that the absent defendant after-wards comes into the State, and an action is brought against him upon the decree, would not this be as good ground of action as that on which the cases of <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>and <em>Becquet </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>were founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-4\">The acts 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66, \u00a7 46, p. 205, and ch. 123, \u00a7 5, p. 476, are the statutes under which the proceedings in this case were had. By these statutes the Court is authorized to proceed to a hearing and decree against absent defendants, as in cases of absent debtors. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Donaghe\u2019s ex'or, </em>1 Rand. 300; <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Keith, 1 </em>Leigh 430. In the present case the Court exercised jurisdiction over <em>Buchanan </em>on matters in which he was jointly interested with others. And in a case in which the Court properly had jurisdiction, <em>Tompkins if Murray </em>came into Court to have an account of what had been received by <em>Robert if Allan Pollock if Co. </em>of which firm <em>Buchanan </em>was the surviving partner; and the decree was such as if he had been here, he would have been amenable to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-13\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbF\">Upon the statute no Court has authority to make a decree against an absent defendant, unless he has effects here, or his rights are so mixed up with those of a home defendant that a decree against this last will be a decree against him. The preamble of the statute states the mischief and the remedy ; the difficulty of recovering debts from persons residing out of the State who have effects here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The first section of the statute relates to what' is called a foreign attachment; and proceeds <em>in rem </em>and <em>in personam. </em>The second requires security to be given by the absent debtor on his appearance-; or if he does not appear, and a decree is rendered against the home defendant, requires the plaintiff to give security for abiding such future order as may be made for restoring the estate or effects to the absent defendant, upon his appearance and answering the bill. The third section relates to the proceeding to subject the land of the absent debtor. The fourth section authorizes the absent defendant to come in and set aside the decree. The fifth section authorizes the same proceedings against other absent defendants as is authorized in the case of absent debtors.- The statute obviously refers to persons who once resided here; and who have .effects in the Commonwealth. The plaintiff must give bond to restore the effects. If there are no effects here, how is such bond to be given ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-12\">The act 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 46, has reference to the same subject; though the language is broader. But the whole effect of the statute is to change the English practice, so that whenever the interest of the absent defendant and that of the home defendant is so connected that the one cannot be decreed against without decreeing against the other, the Court may proceed in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-13\">The act <em>5 </em>Hen. St. 320, is the first statute found on the subject. This statute only refers to persons residing in some other part of the King\u2019s dominions, or who had resided here and left effects here. The next act is found in 9 Hen. St. 396. This statute has no preamble. The Court is authorized to proceed against absent defendants having effects here. The act makes the same provision as to other absent defendants ; but keeps up the idea that his interests are so interwoven with the interests of the home defendant that a decree against the one must affect the rights of the other. The Legislature which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>passed the present law, struck out that part of the act relating to persons residing in some other parts of his majesty\u2019s dominions, and confined it to absent defendants having effects here ; or whose interests are identified with that of home defendants. All the cases of foreign attachment referred to by the counsel for the appellee, will be found to be embraced in one or other of the provisions stated, and to come precisely within it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-4\">Assuming that it has been proved that the Court had no jurisdiction to pronounce the decree against <em>Buch</em>anan,| what is its effect in <em>Virginia </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-5\">The Constitution of the <em>United States </em>declares, that the acts and records of one State shall have the same effect in other States. The effect of this provision is, that a <em>Virginia </em>judgment is valid to the same extent in <em>Maryland </em>or <em>New York </em>as it is in <em>Virginia. </em>If invalid in <em>Neto York, </em>it must be because it is invalid here. <em>Story's </em>Conilict <em>of </em>Laws, ch. 15, p. 508-9. In support of this doctrine, <em>Story </em>refers to many cases, and among others to <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>4 Conn. R. 380, in which the subject is most fully considered; and it is held that a party not served with process is not concluded by the judgment. The counsel for the appellee has referred to <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Nicolls, 5 </em>Cond. Eng. Ch. R. 198, for authority to shew that a foreign judgment is not examinable. <em>Story </em>examines this question in the work before referred to, p. 602, 608, and says, the general doctrine in this country is, that a foreign judgment is examinable. The question is not, whether an action may be maintained upon a foreign judgment, but whether it is examinable. An examination of the cases referred to by the counsel for the appellee, will shew that none of them establish the conclusiveness of the foreign judgment; but in most of them, evidence to support or contest it, was admitted. And the conclusion to which Judge <em>Story </em>comes, after a careful consideration of the subject, is, that <em>foreign </em>judgments are <em>not </em>conclusive: and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>cases of judgments where the process has not been served upon the defendant, the effect of such proceeding is purely local; and in other countries would be void. <em>Story\u2019s </em>Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 546, 549, citing <em>Cavan </em>v. Stewart, <em>2 </em>Eng. C. L. R. 496.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b118-13\"><em> Note by the reporter. </em>This is the last case reported in which Judge <em>Stanard </em>sat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\"> The fourth section of the act, after providing that any absent defendant may come in within seven years after the decree pronounced, and obtain a rehearing, then provides that if such defendant \u201c shall not within seven years from the time of the decree pronounced, appear and petition to have the cause reheard as aforesaid, and pay, or secure to be paid, such costs as the Court shall think reasonable, all and every decree, to be made in pursuance of this act against any defendant or defendants so failing, shall stand absolutely confirmed against him, her or them; and at the end of such term, the Court may make such further order for quieting the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such suits, in then- possession or title in the estate or effects so sequestered or made liable, as to them shall seem reasonable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-11\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_0\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">The Court is of opinion, that according to the true construction of the act reducing into one, the several acts, directing the method of proceeding in Courts of Equity against absent debtors and other absent defendants, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123, &gt;\u00a7&gt; 4, p. 475; the provision of the 4th section, directing the decree to stand absolutely confirmed against the absent debtor, who shall not within seven years appear and petition to have the cause reheard, applies to and should be restricted to so much of said decree as operated upon the estate or effects of such absent debtor, subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of this Commonwealth: the interest of the creditors and the public requiring, that so far as the decree operated upon a cause or matter subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, rights thereto acquired under the proceedings had, should be quieted within a reasonable time. And in this, but little hazard was encountered of doing injustice to the absent debtor, as it was but a fair presumption, that if he owned estate or effects of value, he would have notice of the proceeding within the time limited. This construction is sustained by the last clause of the said 4th section, which authorizes the Court, at the end of such term, to make such further order for quieting the plaintiff or plaintiffs in any such suits, in their possession and title to the estate or effects so sequestered or made liable, as may seem reasonable. Thus referring the limitation of seven years to the possession and title to the estate or effects sequestered ; and making the decree absolute to the extent requisite to quiet the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>The Court is further of opinion, that such decree, so far as it extends beyond the cause or thing subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of this Commonwealth, and operates as a decree <em>in personam </em>merely, is entitled to all the respect to which any other decree is entitled in all collateral controversies; so that, if property should be sold under an execution issued thereon, the title could not be impeached by objections to the form or merits of the decree. The Court is further of opinion, that as the statute authorizes the proceeding, the decree when rendered, merges the original cause of action, so far as to enable the plaintiff to rely thereon in any subsequent proceeding to enforce it, as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the demand it establishes; and to repel the defence of the statute of limitations; except so far as said statute may apply to judgments or decrees. But the Court is further of opinion, that such decree so far as it reaches beyond the cause or thing subject to the jurisdiction of the Court, and purports to operate <em>in personam </em>merely, so as to create a personal charge alone, is not of such binding and conclusive character as to preclude all enquiry into the merits thereof, notwithstanding more than seven years have elapsed since it was pronounced. A construction which would lead to a different result would violate the principles of natural justice, which forbid that any man should be condemned unheard ; and would impute to the Legislature the intention of giving to the Courts of this Commonwealth jurisdiction over persons throughout the earth. The Court is therefore of opinion, it is competent for the defendant, where it is attempted to enforce such decree against him as a personal demand, to shew in his defence, that the said decree was erroneous or unjust upon the face of the proceedings; or to prove by evidence <em>aliunde, </em>that it was against equity and good conscience : and that it would be equally competent for him to impeach the same, for similar causes, in a proper proceeding to be instituted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"AxG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The Court is further of opinion, that by the 5th section of the said act, decrees against absent defendants should receive the same effect as decrees against absent debtors are entitled to. So far as the decree operates IlPon a subject within the jurisdiction of the State, the interests of such absentee therein are conclusively bound by the decree, unless he shall appear and petition for a rehearing within the seven years. This is made manifest by the concluding clause of the 5th section, which directs that the proceedings in relation to such absent defendants, shall in all respects be the same, both before and after the decree, as are prescribed in relation to absent debtors, so far as such proceedings against absent debtors shall be applicable to other absent defendants. The proceedings after decree, in the case of absent debtors, are the proceedings for quieting the title or possession to the estate or effects sequestered. The proceedings analogous thereto, in the case of other absent defendants, after decree, would be to quiet the possession or title to the interest of the absent defendant to any matter within the jurisdiction of the Court involved in the suit and passed upon by the decree. But the limitation of seven years has no application to the decree, or so much thereof as acts <em>in personam, </em>and establishes a personal demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The Court is further of opinion, that as this was a bill filed to enforce a decree rendered against <em>David Buchanan, </em>proceeded against, not as an absent debtor having effects within the Commonwealth, but as an absent defendant merely, the merits of the whole decree are open for investigation ; and that it is competent for his representative, and the representatives of the deceased partners, and the representative of <em>Rootes, </em>to shew from the face of the proceedings, or from any other evidence to be adduced, that said decree was erroneous or illegal, or against equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">The Court is further of opinion, that as by the opinion and decree of the Court below the said decree against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the said <em>David Buchanan </em>was treated as conclusively establishing the demand against him, as surviving partner, and against the estates of the deceased partners, and as in this respect said opinion and decree are erroneous, it would be improper in this stage of the cause to pronounce any opinion upon any other question involved in the case, before the representatives of <em>Allan </em>and <em>Robert Pollock </em>have been brought before the Court, and an opportunity afforded them and the representative of said <em>David Buchanan, </em>and the representative of said <em>Rootes </em>of controverting said decree upon the matters appearing on the face thereof, or any other matter to be adduced by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The decree reversed; and the cause remanded to make the representatives of <em>Robert </em>and <em>Allan Pollock, </em>parties; and for farther proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
