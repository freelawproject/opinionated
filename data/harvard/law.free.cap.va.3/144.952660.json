A conditional agreement by the holder to give time to the principal obligor, will not bind the holder, unless the condition is strictly complied with; and therefore, though such agreement was without the consent of the surety, yet if the condition has not been complied with, the surety is not released.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-18\">In January 1848, <em>George Geiger </em>filed his bill in the Superior Court for <em>Augusta </em>county, against <em>John Churchman </em>as the executor of <em>Walter II. Tapp, </em>for the purpose of having a settlement of <em>Churchmans </em>ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>counts as executor, and obtaining satisfaction of two judgments which he had recovered against him, as the executor of <em>Tapp. </em>In the progress of the cause the accounts were referred to a commissioner, who was directed to call in the creditors of <em>Tapp, </em>and state an account of their debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-4\">Among the debts reported by the commissioner was one due to the executor of <em>Robert Harnsberger ; </em>and it being ascertained that the estate of <em>Tapp </em>was not sufficient to pay all the debts, <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>administrator, by leave of the Court, filed an amended bill in which he charged that <em>Harnsberger\u2019s </em>debt was founded on a usurious consideration; and that <em>'Tapp, </em>who was only a surety in that debt, had been released from his liability therefor by <em>Harnsberger\u2019s </em>having given time to the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">This Court was of opinion that the charge of usury was not sustained by the proofs. On the other question the facts were, that <em>Henry Imboden </em>desiring to borrow money, procured <em>Tapp </em>to become his security, and they executed to <em>George W. Peck, </em>a bond dated the 3d of May 1836, and payable twelve months thereafter, with interest from the date, for one thousand dollars. <em>Peck </em>gave no consideration for the bond, but was merely the agent of <em>Imboden </em>to borrow the money. As such agent he applied to <em>Harnsberger </em>for a loan on the bond, who at first refused. After this refusal, <em>Peck </em>and <em>Imboden, </em>in the absence, and without the knowledge of <em>Tapp, </em>made the following endorsement at the foot of the bond. \u2018\u2022'N. B. The above note is not to be pushed on for three years, by the interest being punctually paid at the expiration of each year. Given under my hand this 3d of May 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">(Signed,) <em>G. W. Peck.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\">The endorsement having been made, <em>Peck </em>again took the bond to <em>Harnsberger, </em>who then gave him 900 dollars for it, which he paid over to <em>Imboden.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The interest on the bond was not paid punctually at the end of the first year; though on the 28th of August 1837, <em>Imboden </em>made a payment upon it of 170 dollars. He afterwards became a bankrupt, and received his certificate of discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-14\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court below, declining to decide whether the consideration of the bond was usurious, held that <em>Harnsberger </em>had given time upon it to <em>Imboden </em>without the knowledge of <em>Tapp, </em>and that <em>Tapp </em>was thereby discharged. And it was therefore decreed that <em>Harnsberger's </em>ex\u2019or should not participate in the assets of <em>Tapp's </em>estate by virtue of said debt. From this decree, <em>Harnsberger's </em>ex\u2019or obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-15\"><em>Stuart, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ACI\"><em>Fultz, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b164-19\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b166-16\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AXY\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">The bond in this case was executed by <em>Tapp </em>as surety for <em>Imboden, </em>and at the time of its execution, it was payable twelve months after date. No valuable consideration passed from <em>Peck, </em>the obligee. On the contrary, it was executed solely for the accommodation of <em>Imboden, </em>the principal, and to enable him to raise money for his own benefit, by transferring it to <em>Harnsberger. </em>Accordingly, <em>Imboden </em>employed <em>Peck, </em>the obligee, to make the arrangement with <em>Harnsberger. </em>The evidence in the cause does not shew whether <em>Harnsberger </em>was informed or knew that the bond had been given without value, and for the accommodation of the principal obligor. But whether he knew it or not, that was certainly the fact; and therefore, according to well established principles, the instrument had no obligatory force, on any body, until it passed into the hands of <em>Harnsberger, </em>for value. But before the bond was thus passed to him, a memorandum had been made thereon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>and signed by <em>Peck, </em>the obligee, to the effect that payment should not be enforced for three years, provided the interest should be punctually paid at the expiration of each year. This memorandum, although signed by <em>Peck </em>only, was in fact the act of <em>Imboden; </em>for he himself wrote it, and <em>Peck </em>was nothing more than his agent in the transaction. It was also known to <em>Harnsberger </em>before he traded for the bond. Before he gave value for it, the bond, as before observed, had no obligatory force. It took effect as a bond from that time only ; and as the memorandum for extending the time of payment, was then upon the instrument, and signed by the obligee, and known to <em>Harnsberger, </em>that memorandum was part and parcel of the bond as taken by <em>Harnsberger, </em>and is supported by the same valuable consideration on which every other part of the bond rests. It was therefore obligatory upon <em>Harnsberger, </em>to the extent to which it purported to bind him. And if the agreement for the extension of the time of payment had been absolute and unconditional, it would, according to numerous decisions of this Court, have absolved the surety who had not assented to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">But the agreement was not absolute; there was a condition attached to it, namely, the punctual payment of the interest at the expiration of each year. This condition was not performed; for no interest was paid until many months after the expiration of the first year. That the nonperformance of a condition, on the performance of which, the agreement to extend the time of payment depends, destroys the obligatory force of the agreement, and leaves the parties in the same situation, and with the same rights and obligations, as if the agreement had never been made, was decided in the case of <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crummy, </em>2 Rand. 323. The hands of <em>Harnsberger, </em>therefore, were never tied up, so as to prevent his suing the principal, as soon as he could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sued him, if the agreement had never been made. The remedies of the surety were never impaired, and of course his obligation to pay the bond, remained in full . 101\u2019Ce.</p>\n<p id=\"AEM\">The Qourt jg farther of opinion, that the evidence is not sufficient to shew that the said bond was given for . ... a usurious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The decree is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded, to be farther proceeded in, according to the principles now declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
