Plea, <em>non assumpsit. </em>At the trial, the plaintiff demurred to the defendant\u2019s evidence as being insufficient to support the negative of the issue : <em>that the defendant had not assumed.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-12\">The demurrer to evidence set forth, 1st, The evidence on the part of the plaintiff, which consisted of the note described in the declaration, made by <em>Hansbrough </em>to <em>Carr, </em>whereon were endorsed two credits for moneys paid by <em>Carr, </em>182 dollars on the 24th March 1828, and 90 dollars 20 cents on the 3d June <em>1828; </em>of the assignment and guarantee of the note by <em>Carr </em>to <em>Gray, </em>by instrument under seal, bearing even date with the note, in these words: \u201c For value received I assign the within note to <em>J.

And here the plaintiff rested his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\">The demurrer then set forth, 2dly, the evidence adduced for the defendant, consisting of the depositions and testimony of several witnesses, whereby the following facts were proved: That the note was made by <em>Hansbrough </em>to <em>Carr, </em>for the accommodation of <em>Carr, </em>and in order that <em>Carr </em>might get it discounted at the bank for his accommodation, so that <em>Carr, </em>as between <em>Hansbrough </em>and him, was the person who was to see to the payment of the contents at the maturity of the note: that the character and purpose of the note was known to <em>Gray, </em>when he took the transfer and guarantee thereof, in the manner above mentioned, from <em>Carr: </em>that <em>Gray </em>accordingly looked to <em>Carr </em>for payment, and had it in his power, for above a year, during which <em>Carr </em>continued solvent, to enforce the payment from <em>Carr, </em>but out of indulgence to <em>Carr, </em>wilfully forbore to do so : that it was at <em>Carr's </em>instance, and on his promise to pay the contents of the note, that <em>Gray </em>for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>bore to have it protested for nonpayment: that no notice of the note still remaining unpaid was ever given to <em>Hansbrough, </em>till after <em>Carr </em>had become insolvent: that there was a positive understanding between <em>Gray </em>and <em>Carr, </em>when <em>Gray </em>received the note from him, that <em>Gray, </em>should look to <em>Carr </em>for payment, not to <em>Hansbrough, </em>and <em>Gray </em>himself thought that, under the circumstances, <em>Hansbrough </em>was not bound to pay the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-11\">And this being all the evidence, the jury having found a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the demurrer to evidence, the Court gave judgment on the demurrer for the plaintiff.
