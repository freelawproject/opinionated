Williams, </em>in which they charged that in 1838, they sold to <em>Maxon </em>a tract of one hundred acres of land, at the price of 300 dollars, of which 175 dollars was paid, and <em>Maxon </em>executed his bond for the balance, 125 dollars, to the complainant <em>John, </em>payable on the 1st of October 1839. That <em>Maxon </em>professed to buy this land for the purpose of satisfying a claim which <em>Hannah Williams </em>had against him; and that he bought it for her. That at the time the bond was executed, the complainants executed to <em>Hannah Williams, </em>and delivered to <em>Maxon, </em>a title bond, in the penalty of 750 dollars, binding themselves to convey the land to the said <em>Hannah, </em>when the residue of the purchase money was paid. That <em>Maxon </em>having taken possession of the land sold it in May 1839, to <em>William G. Williams, </em>who holds both it and the title bond; and is still debtor for the greater part of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">They farther state, that on the 21st of November 1840, the complainant <em>John Knisely </em>and <em>Maxon </em>ascertained that there was then due from <em>Maxon, </em>on account of the purchase money of the land, and interest, 138 dollars 12\u00bf cents; and <em>Maxon </em>stating that he had not the money, but that one <em>Nathan West </em>would owe him, proposed to give to <em>John Knisely </em>an order on <em>West, </em>for the payment of the debt in September 1842. That <em>Knisely </em>agreed, if <em>West </em>would accept the order payable in September 1842, he would wait until that time. That the order was drawn by <em>Maxon </em>and given to <em>John Knisely, </em>who then handed to <em>Maxon </em>his bond for 125 dollars. That <em>West </em>refused to accept the order; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and that <em>Maxon </em>refused to take back the order and return the bond, or pay the money. That complainants are willing to convey the land upon receiving the balance of the purchase money, but that <em>Maxon </em>insists that the acceptance of the order on <em>West, </em>and delivery of the bond, was a discharge of the vendor\u2019s lien, and forbids <em>Williams </em>paying the amount due complainants. They therefore pray that the land may be sold to satisfy the unpaid purchase money, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Maxon </em>filed his answer, in which he admitted the purchase, the execution of his bond, and its return to him, and the giving the order on <em>West, </em>as stated in the bill. But he does not admit that <em>West </em>refused to accept the order; but says he is informed by <em>West </em>he is willing to accept it. Ho admits <em>Knisely </em>informed him <em>West </em>would not accept the order, and requested him to return his bond; but that <em>Knisely </em>knew that the bond could not be returned, as it was destroyed in his presence at the time the order was given. That he had agreed that if <em>West </em>had refused to accept the order, that he would give <em>Knisely </em>his note, payable at the time the order was to be paid, which <em>Knisely </em>agreed to, but that no materials for writing being at hand, it was agreed it should be done at another time; and that he has always been ready to give the note. He insists that complainants have no right to payment of the amount of the order until the time it was made payable, if it was protested; and that therefore complainants have no right to come into Court before that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">After September 18-12, the complainants filed a supplemental bill, making <em>West </em>a party, in which they charge that the debt duo from <em>West </em>to <em>Maxon, </em>is for the purchase money of land, which is still held and owned by <em>West, </em>and is bound for the purchase money. That the order given by <em>Maxon </em>to <em>John Knisely </em>on <em>West, </em>is in equity a transfer of so much of the unpaid purchase money due from <em>West </em>to <em>Maxon. </em>That <em>West </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>refuses to accept or protest the said order, nor will he pay the same ; alleging at some times, that he does not owe Maxon, at others, that he apprehends a deficiency e'tj-ier t{le title or quantity of the land purchased by hjm from <em>Maxon: </em>and that <em>Maxon </em>will take no steps to ascertain what is really due to him from <em>West. </em>They therefore pray that the accounts between <em>West </em>and <em>Maxon </em>may be settled; and that <em>West </em>may be compelled to pay the amount of the order, or so much as he may owe <em>Maxon; </em>and that the land sold by <em>Maxon to West </em>may be subjected to satisfy the amount of said order, or so much thereof as <em>West </em>may owe <em>Maxon.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\"><em>West </em>demurred to this bill: and the cause coming on to be heard in May 1848, the Court was of opinion that the plaintiffs having retained the legal title to the land sold by them to <em>Maxon, </em>that they had a lien upon the land in the possession of <em>Williams, </em>for the purchase <em>money; </em>and that the taking the order on <em>West </em>for the balance of the purchase money, and delivery up of the bond to <em>Maxon, </em>was not an extinguishment of their lien, if the order was not paid. The Court was further of opinion, that the order drawn by <em>Maxon </em>on <em>West, </em>being for purchase of land sold by <em>Maxon </em>to <em>West, </em>for which <em>Maxon </em>had a vendor\u2019s lien on the land so sold, that the plaintiffs might at their election, consider themselves as transferees of <em>Maxon, </em>and entitled to all his rights, and might assert his vendor\u2019s lien. But the Court was farther of opinion, that until the time arrived at which the order drawn by <em>Maxon </em>on <em>West </em>came to maturity, the plaintiffs had no right of action against either <em>Maxon </em>or <em>West, </em>and having commenced their suit when they had no right to demand the amount of the order, they could not by engrafting their supplemental bill on their original bill cure the defect, although at the time of filing the supplemental bill, the order had arrived at maturity. The Court therefore dismissed both the original and supplemental bills, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>costs, but without prejudice. From this decree, the plaintiffs applied, to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-4\"><em>William A. Harrison, </em>and <em>Lee, </em>for the appellants, submitted the case. There was no counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AdYn\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Court is of opinion, that as it appears the appellant <em>John </em>took the order in the proceedings mentioned, in consideration of the bond for the purchase money then due, the taking of such order did not extinguish the right to hold the land subject to the payment of the purchase money, if the order was not accepted; and that, upon the failure of <em>West </em>to accept the order, the appellants had an immediate right to proceed against said <em>Maxon </em>for the amount due. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said Circuit Court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the supplemental bill, and in dismissing the said supplemental and original bills with costs. Therefore it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the said decree of the Circuit Court bo reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellants, their costs by them expended about the prosecution of their appeal here. And this Court proceeding to render such decree as the said Circuit Court ought to have rendered, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the demurrer of said <em>West </em>to the supplemental bill be overruled, and that said <em>West </em>answer over. And it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the said <em>T. Maxon </em>pay to the appellants the sum of 125 dollars, with interest from 1st October 1839 till paid; and their costs in said Circuit Court expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">And it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the appellants do make and execute a deed conveying the land in the title bond mentioned to- the appellee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Hannah </em>Williams, with covenants of warranty according to the provisions of said title bond, and acknowledge the same iu order to be recorded, and upon filing gQ executed and acknowledged, amongst the PaPers the cause, unless said <em>Timothy Maxon, </em>or some person for him, shall pay said debt,- interest and costs herein decreed against him, within 30 days after such deed shall have been so filed, that then the sheriff of <em>Harrison </em>county, who is hereby appointed a commissioner for that purpose, after advertising the time and place of sale for four weeks successively, &amp;c. proceed to sell said land at six and twelve months, takiug bonds with security, and retaining a lien for the payment of the purchase money, and report, &amp;c. And leave is reserved to the appellants to proceed against said <em>West </em>in the event of this decree proving unavailing in whole or in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
