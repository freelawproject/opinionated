That, consequently, upon the death of <em>Mrs. Henderson, </em>the whole remainder of the whole estate vested in her son <em>Thomas, </em>one moiety immediately in possession, the other in expectancy after his aunt <em>Mrs. Andrews's </em>death. And that, as there were no children afterwards born to <em>Mrs. Andrews, </em>to participate with him in the estate; and as he derived his whole interest by purchase under the will of his grand father, not by descent from his mother as to any part; therefore, upon his death, though he died in infancy, the whole estate, real and personal, descended and devolved to his father <em>James Henderson, </em>his sole heir at law and distributee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-5\">He said, there was no other construction, which would at once ensure the whole remainder of the estate expectant on the life estates of the testator\u2019s daughters, to his grand children by both daughters, and give to all and each of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>equal shares <em>per capita ; </em>which was the manifest purpose of the will. There was only <em>one </em>limitation over as to <em>the whole remainder, </em>and that limitation was to take effect upon the happening of <em>one </em>event. The event upon which the estate was limited over, was \u201c the death of either\u201d <em>daughter; </em>a phrase of well understood and definite signification, meaning the death of <em>the one or the other: </em>therefore, the <em>death of the one first dying, </em>was the event on which the remainder was to take effect. And the remainder was limited to \u201c their children\u201d (that is, the children of both) \u201c who should be living at the death of either\u201d (including all the children of <em>both, </em>who should be living at the death of the one <em>and </em>at the death of the other) \u201c so that, upon the death of either\u201d (upon the death of one or upon the death of the other) \u201c her moiety should go in remainder, not to her children, but to them and the children of the surviving daughter meaning clearly, the children which both should have at the death of the one first dying, and those which the survivor should have at her death. That the testator intended exact equality among all his grand children by both daughters, whenever born, and apprehended they might be numerous, was plainly indicated, by the direction that they should take <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes, </em>and by the authority given to sell the land, and divide the money, in case it should come to be divided into many small shares.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-4\">He insisted, that the construction he proposed would effect the intent, and the whole intent, of the testator: and that any other construction would disappoint <em>it; so far, </em>certainly, as to defeat the purpose of exact equality among all the grand children by both daughters, which the testator so plainly wished and so carefully provided for. The testator could not possibly have intended, that the remainder should take effect as to the several moieties, at several times and upon several events, and devolve to different sets of grand children ; that the remainder of the moiety given to <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>for life, should take effect at her death, and vest</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>in the children of both daughters then living, and that the remainder of the moiety given to <em>Mrs. Andrews, </em>for life, should take effect at her death, and vest in the children of both then living. He said, the consequences of such a construction, were enough to condemn it: for, suppose <em>Mrs. Henderson to have </em>died first, leaving one child, and after her death <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>to have had many children, and then died; <em>Mrs. Henderson\u2019s </em>child would have taken his mother\u2019s moiety, and then participated equally with the children left by <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>in her moiety, while these could claim no participation with him in his mother\u2019s moiety\u2014 or, suppose <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>to have died childless, <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>surviving her and having one child living at the time of her death $ and then suppose <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>to have had many children born after her sister\u2019s death, and then died; the child born before that event, would have taken <em>Mrs. Henderson\u2019s </em>intire moiety absolutely, and then come in for an equal share of his mother\u2019s moiety with his brothers born after that event, while these would be excluded from participation with him in their aunt\u2019s moiety. Consequences like these would be utterly irreconcileable with the obvious intent and the whole scheme of the will 5 and the construction that would lead to them, could not be adopted, without supposing that the testator studiously selected the most ambiguous words to express his meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">And as the construction he contended for, upon which the intire remainder of the whole estate vested, upon the death of <em>Mrs. Henderson, </em>in the only grand child of the testator then living, subject to open to let in any grand child that might be afterwards born of <em>Mrs. Andrews, </em>would best effectuate the intent of the testator, so it was perfectly conformable with the rules of law, that the estate so vesting in one, should devest as to the proportions of others afterwards becoming capable. He referred to Butler\u2019s Fearne, 312-315. and the cases there cited, <em>Matthews v. Temple, </em>Comb. 467. 1 Ld. Ray. 311. <em>Oates v. Jackson, </em>2 Stra. 1172. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Perryn, </em>3 T.

In this case, there was no possible construction, upon which the testator\u2019s intent, as expounded by the appellants\u2019 counsel, might not have been eventually disappointed. If, as he contended, the death of the daughter first dying, was the event upon which the in-tire remainder of the whole estate was limited over, then, in case <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>had died childless, her surviving sister being at the time also childless, the intire remainder of the whole estate would have been defeated and gone.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-4\">They first took up the question as to the <em>real </em>estate; as to which, the first proposition they advanced was, that upon the \u25a0death of the testator, the two daughters took, by the will, each, a several life estate in a moiety, and <em>by descent in parcenary, </em>the fee simple of the whole, but a base fee, subject to contingent remainders limited to their children.' They said, there was no doubt, that the will devised a moiety of the land to each of the daughters, for her life, in such manner as that the life estate of each in her moiety, was, in a legal view, several and distinct from that of the other. The testator apparently looked to an actual division between them; and, certainly, either might at any time have demanded and obtained one; but an actual division of the subject, was by no means necessary to sever their titles; for, by force of the will alone, so far as concerns the points in question, each took. a several vested estate for life in a moiety. The remainder in fee expectant on these several life estates, being devised to the children of both daughters who should be living at the death of either, was a <em>contin-&gt; gent </em>not a vested remainder; a remainder limited to persons not ascertained by the limitation itself, nor ascertainable till the happening of a future event or events, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>there might or might not be persons in being answering the description of the remaindermen, so that it was uncertain whether the remainder would ever vest at all, or if it should vest, in whom. This limitation too (though the distinction, in this case, might be unimportant) was a contingent remainder, not an executory devise; for it was an inflexible rule that such a limitation should never take effect as an executory devise, if it might possibly take effect as a contingent remainder; as this certainly might; the remainder being limited on particular freehold estates capable of supporting such a remainder, and limited on such a contingency that it must vest, if at all, instantly on the termination of the particular estates. Then, the limitation of the remainder in fee expectant on the preceding life estates, being a contingent remainder, not certain as to the persons in whom it should vest, nor certain to vest at all; and the fee simple and inheritance not being disposed of by the will, in the mean time; the fee descended to the testator\u2019s heirs at law, his two daughters, and remained in them, awaiting the appointed contingency that should devest it in favour of the remaindermen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\">In this state the title remained till <em>Mrs. Henderson\u2019s </em>death. Her surviving sister had no child; and she left but one. What did he then take, by force of the testator\u2019s will? A vested estate in possession in his mother\u2019s moiety, and a vested remainder in his aunt\u2019s moiety expectant on her life estate ? or, a vested estate in his mother\u2019s moiety, with a mere possibility of ultimately getting the whole of his aunt\u2019s moiety, depending on the contingency of his surviving her, and being the only grand child of the testator that should survive her? They contended, that as the will devised several life estates in several moieties to each daughter, so it devised the remainder of each moiety, severally and respectively, to their children; that the remainder, as well as the paf ticular estate, passed in several moieties. The testator\u2019s language (after the devise of the life estates, in moieties expressly, to his two daughters) was, \u201c remainder to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>children who should be living <em>at the decease of </em>either\u201d of the daughters. These words might, perhaps, in a strict sense, import alternative contingencies. But the word either, as here used, meant <em>each, </em>which indeed was one of ^ senses of it, in very common use; and the word <em>remainder </em>was explained by the context to mean the <em>several remainders of the respective moieties. </em>For, they said, the word <em>remainder </em>was a word of relation: its antecedent here, was a several life estate, in each moiety, previously given to each daughter: the remainder was to take effect after each life estate, as it should be determined by the death of each daughter; and, as the life estates on which the remainder depended were several, so was the remainder expectant upon each of those life estates, a several remainder. And that this was the just, construction, seemed plain from the subsequent words, professedly explanatory, whereby it was provided, that upon the death of' either of the daughters, <em>her </em>moiety (only) should go in remainder, not to her children, but to them and the children of the surviving daughter. The death of either daughter was the event upon which <em>her </em>moiety was to go over in remainder, and the event by which the remaindermen to take that moiety, were to be ascertained; and the death of the other daughter, was the event, by which <em>her </em>moiety was to go over in remainder, and the remaindermen as to it were to be ascertained. And whatever might be the consequences of such a construction, they contended it was the just construction and true effect of the will, that the remainder was to take effect as to the several moieties respectively, at several times and upon several events, and devolve, perchance, to several sets of remaindermen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-4\">It was argued by the appellants\u2019 counsel, that the consequences of this construction sufficed to condemn it: but the consequences of his construction would be equally, if not more, abhorrent from any intention that could possibly be attributed to the testator. If the death of the daughter first dying, was the event upon which it was intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the contingent character of the <em>intire </em>remainder of the <em>whole </em>estate should cease, and by which the remaindermen should be ascertained, who should take the fee simple in possession of <em>the moiety </em>of the daughter first dying, and a vested remaiuder in fee in the other moiety expectant on the life estate of the survivor; then the grand children in being at the death of the daughter first dying, would take absolutely. Their estate so vested, would not open to let in any after born children of the surviving daughter, for an equal share of the subject. The after born children could never claim an estate limited in remainder upon a particular estate which determined, and upon a contingency which happened, before they were in being and capable to take; as to them, the contingent remainder would be gone, for the plain reason, that they were incapable to take, both when the estate determined, and when the event happened, on which the remainder depended, and was to take effect. The passage cited from <em>Fearne, </em>concerning shifting uses, and the cases there referred to, only shewed, that \u201cwhere a contingent remainder is limited to the use of several, who do not all become capable at the same time ; notwithstanding it vests in the person first becoming capable, yet it shall devest as to the proportions of the persons afterwards becoming capable <em>before the determination of the preceding </em>estate.\u201d Now, upon the hypothesis of the appellants\u2019 counsel, the preceding estate before the determination of which <em>Mrs. Andrews\u2019s </em>children must have become capable to take, in order to be entitled to come in, was the life estate of <em>Mrs. Henderson, </em>since it was her life estate upon the determination of which the contingent remainder was to vest. Thus, his own argument and authority concluded directly against the opening of the estate once completely vested, upon the death of the daughter first dying, in the grand children then living, to let in the children of the surviving daughter that might be after-wards born. And then, the consequence of the construction proposed for the appellants, would be, that all grand children of the testator, who should be born after the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of whichever of his daughters should first die, were wholly unprovided for. And again, if one of the daughters had died leaving a child, the other having none at the time, and that child had died before the surviving daughter, and then s^e died ^eav*ng many children born after the death of her sister; in such case, the remainder of the whole estate having vested in the child of the daughter first dying in absolute fee, the estate would, on the death of that child, pass to his heirs (his father, or half brothers and sisters on the part of the father, if any, since he would have derived the estate, not by descent from his mother but by purchase under the will of his grand father) and the children of the daughter last dying, the sole remaining objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, would be excluded <em>from </em>any share of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9X\">They understood the will then, as a devise <em>of the </em>plantation &amp;.c. to the two daughters, <em>in several moieties, </em>for life; remainder, <em>as to each moiety respectively, expectant on each life estate, </em>to the children of <em>both </em>daughters who should be living <em>at the death of each of </em>them; so that upon the death of <em>each, </em>her moiety was to go in remainder, not to her children only, but to them and the children of the <em>other </em>(meaning still such as should be living <em>at the death of each, </em>respectively) in fee simple, per <em>capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes. </em>And so understanding it, the effect of the limitation was, that on the death of <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>leaving one child, her sister surviving and being childless at the time, <em>Mrs. Henderson\u2019s </em>child, <em>Thomas, </em>took a vested estate in possession of that moiety whereof his mother had the life estate. The remainder of the- other moiety, expectant on <em>Mrs. Andrews\u2019s </em>life estate therein, still continued a contingent remainder, that might or might not take effect: if she had died childless, and her nephew <em>Thomas </em>had survived her, he would have taken this moiety also: if she had had children born after the death of her sister, and then died leaving both her own children and her nephew <em>Thomas </em>surviving her, her children and her nephew would have taken this moiety in equal shares, <em>per capita: </em>if she had had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>children born after her sister\u2019s death, and her nephew <em>Thomas </em>had died before her, and her own children had survived, they would have taken this moiety : and, in the case <em>\u2019 J ' . . </em>which actually happened, of <em>.Mrs. Andrews </em>surviving her nephew <em>Thomas, </em>and then dying childless, the contingent remainder in this moiety was disappointed by the event, and gone. The reversion in fee of this moiety, as well as of the other\u2014the base fee subject to the contingent remainder\u2014not having been disposed of by the testator\u2019s will, had passed by descent from him to his two daughters, in equal moieties $ and upon the death of <em>Mrs. Henderson </em>her share of this base fee of <em>Mrs. Andrews's </em>moiety, descended directly from <em>her </em>to her son <em>Thomas. </em>This base fee eventually became pure and absolute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-9\">During the lives of <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>and <em>Thomas Henderson, </em>after his mother\u2019s death, the state of the title stood thus : <em>Thomas </em>had a vested fee simple in possession in his mother\u2019s moiety, which he derived <em>by purchase under his grand father's will. Mrs. Andrews </em>held the life estate in the other moiety ; of which the fee simple, that is, the base fee subject to the contingent remainder limited by the testator\u2019s will, was vested in her and her nephew <em>Thomas, </em>he claiming <em>this interest </em>by <em>descent from his mother.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b99-10\">Upon the death of <em>Thomas Henderson, </em>that moiety which had vested in him in fee upon the determination of his mother\u2019s life estate therein, by force of the limitation in his grand father\u2019s will, and so was derived <em>by purchase directly from his grand father, </em>descended to his own father, who was his heir at law as to it, and passed by his will to the appellants, his devisees. But that portion of the fee simple of the moiety wherein <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>still held the life estate, which had vested in <em>Thomas Henderson </em>at his mother\u2019s death, having been derived <em>by descent from his mother, </em>and he dying an infant, and leaving a maternal aunt surviving him, descended to that aunt, <em>Mrs. Andrews, </em>to the exclusion of his father, according to the exception in the statute of descents, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 96. \u00a7 12. p. 356. So that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Mrs. Andrews </em>now held not only her life estate in this moiety, but the fee simple also; subject still to the contingent remainder limited by her father\u2019s will, which might possibly still take effect in favour of any children she might have and leave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-4\">When <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>died, there was no child living of either daughter of the testator; there was no person in being answering the description contained in his limitation of the contingent remainder expectant on her life estate in her moiety ; no person capable to take this remainder. As to this moiety, the contingent remainder failed, because the contingency did not happen. Her fee in this moiety, therefore, which before her death 'was a base conditional fee, became upon her death, <em>eo instante, </em>a pure and-absolute fee; which, consequently, passed by her will to her devisee thereof, the appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-5\">Then, as to the <em>personal </em>subject, they said, the intention of the testator was, doubtless, to make the same disposition of the personal as. of the real estate; but, in the events that had occurred; the law made a different disposition of the personal from that which it made of the real. The construction and effect of the <em>will </em>was the same as to both subjects, with this difference, that the executory limitation was a contingent remainder as to the real, but as to the personal, an executory devise or bequest; 'a difference, in many cases, by no means verbal, but immaterial here. The course and manner in which the title of the personal estate passed from the testator to his two daughters, followed exactly the real. Upon the death of <em>the </em>testator, <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>and <em>Mrs. Henderson, </em>took, each respectively, a several life estate in a several moiety of the'personal subject ; remainder, as to <em>each </em>moiety respectively, to the children of <em>both, </em>who should be living at the death of each; and they also took, as co-distributees of their father (and beneficiary owners of the interest, though it vested in his personal representatives), that possible residuary interest undisposed of by his will, which might eventually result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>from the failure of the executory bequest to take effect, as to both or either of the moieties. Upon the death of <em>Mrs. </em>Henderson, her son <em>Thomas </em>took, by virtue of the executory bequest in the will, <em>an absolute vested estate in her moiety </em>(which, upon his death, devolved, by the statute of distributions, to his father <em>James </em>Henderson) and a possibility, under the executory bequest of the other moiety, of taking that also at <em>Mrs. Andrews\u2019s </em>death, depending on the contingency of his surviving her, and being the only grand child of the testator who should survive her. <em>Mrs. Andrews </em>still holding her life estate in this remaining moiety, she and <em>James Henderson </em>(representing his deceased wife, being her sole distributee, and entitled to administration of her estate) became now tenants in common, each entitled to one half of the undisposed of possible interest in her moiety, which should result from the failure of the executory limitation to take effect as to <em>it. </em>In the event, the executory limitation did fail as to this moiety, by the death of <em>Mrs. Andrews, </em>without leaving any child of herself or her sister surviving her, to take under the limitation. And then <em>James Henderson\u2019s </em>right to one half of this moiety, which before her death was a mere possibility, became absolute in <em>his </em>representatives, and her right to the other half of it, became likewise absolute in her representatives. Thus it was, that <em>Henderson\u2019s </em>representatives, claiming by distribution from his son, one moiety of the personal estate in question, and by distribution from his wife, one moiety of the other moiety, became entitled to three fourths of the personal subject in question; and <em>Mrs. Andrews\u2019s </em>legatee, the appellee, had the right to the remaining fourth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\">They concluded, that the decree of the court of chancery was perfectly correct, in respect both to the real and personal subject.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"> The testator was an eminent lawyer and judge. At the first organization of the high court of chancery of <em>Virginia, </em>that court consisted of three judges: <em>Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, </em>and this gentleman, <em>Mr. Blair, </em>were the three chancellors. After the adoption of the present constitution of the <em>U. States, Mr. Blair </em>was appointed by president <em>Washington, </em>an associate justice of the supreme court of the <em>U. States; </em>which office he resigned a few years before bis death. He was a man of learning, and most exemplary virtue. He died at a very advanced age. His will was written by himself the year before his death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AUn\">The decree is approved, and affirmed in <em>omnibus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
