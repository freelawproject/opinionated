Barnett </em>and <em>George Eggleston </em>and <em>Eliza </em>his wife filed their bill in the Superior Court of <em>Albemarle </em>county, against the executors of <em>John Harris </em>deceased, in which they charged: That in 1811 <em>Abraham Martin </em>sued out an execution against <em>Nathan </em>Barnett, the father of the plaintiffs <em>Nathan </em>and <em>Eliza, </em>\u25a0which was levied on his property. That he gave a forthcoming bond; and to indemnify his sureties iu that bond, he executed a deed of trust on a tract of land on which he lived, and some personal property. That it became necessary to sell the land and some of the personal property, in order to secure the sureties; and that <em>Murphy, Brown if Co. </em>became the purchasers of the land at the price of 1200 dollars, and also of two negroes, who were advanced in years, at 200 dollars. That <em>John Harris, </em>a very wealthy and childless uncle of the plaintiffs <em>Nathan </em>and <em>Eliza, </em>applied to <em>Robert Rives, </em>one of the firm of <em>Murphy, Brown Sf Co., </em>to purchase the land for the benefit of the plaintiffs, who were then of very tender years; and that <em>Rives </em>for his firm, consented that <em>Harris </em>might take the land, upon condition that he would pay to <em>Murphy, Broivn Sf Co. </em>1000 dollars <em>; </em>and after he should be reimbursed that sum from the rents of the land or otherwise, that he should then give the same to the plaintiffs. That another condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>of this agreement was, that <em>Nathan Barnett </em>the father, was to pay to <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>200 dollars; and that <em>Elizabeth </em>Harris, the grandmother of the plaintiffs, was to take the two old negroes purchased by them off their hands, at the price they had given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">The bill then charges that <em>John Harris </em>agreed to these terms, and the land was conveyed to him; and that <em>Elizabeth Harris </em>took the two negroes, and paid the two hundred dollars to <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>That <em>Harris </em>took possession of the land in 1811, and rented it. out until 1821, when he sold it to <em>Lee W. Harris : </em>and that the rents he received amounted to considerably more than the interest on 1000 dollars; so as not to leave much of that sum unpaid at the time of the sale. The plaintiffs then pray for an account of rents and profits of the land whilst in the possession of <em>John Harris, </em>and of the amount received by him for the land; and also of what is due them after satisfying to the said <em>John Harris </em>the sum of 1000 dollars paid by him to <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>for the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-11\">The executor of <em>John Harris </em>answered the bill, disclaiming all knowledge of the facts in relation to the purchase of the land, and calling for proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">From the evidence, it appears that <em>Barnett\u2019s </em>property was sold and purchased by <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co., </em>as stated in the bill. <em>Mr. Robert Rives, </em>who was a member of the firm of <em>Murphy, Broion Sp Co., </em>was examined as a witness. He says: The land bought by <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>was worth double the sum it was bought at-; and they were offered consid\u00e9rably more than they gave. But at the earnest request of <em>Nathan Barnett, </em>who had made arrangements with <em>Mr. Harris </em>to pay <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>1000 dollars on the land being conveyed to him, <em>Murphy, Brown Sp Co. </em>consented that it should be done on his paying them the 1000 dollars ; which, with other arrangements then entered into with <em>Nathan Barnett, </em>were satisfactory to <em>Murphy, Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Co. </em>That he never would have consented to relinquish to <em>Mr. Harris </em>the purchase, for one thousand dollars, which had cost 1200 dollars, and which could readily have been sold for the double of that sum, but for the perfect conviction it was intended by him for the benefit of his niece, the wife of <em>Nathan Barnett. </em>But the witness had no communication whatever with <em>Harris on this subject: every thing in </em>relation to this transaction was through <em>Barnett. </em>In conformity to the arrangement with <em>Barnett, </em>the land was conveyed to <em>Mr. Harris, </em>and he paid the 1000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\">It also appeared that <em>Mrs. Elizabeth Harris </em>was induced to take the two old negroes who had been purchased by <em>Murphy, Broten Sy Co., </em>for the purpose of effecting the transfer of the purchase of the land from them to <em>John Harris </em>for the benefit of the plaintiffs. But this was done at the suggestion of <em>Barnett.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">After the land was conveyed to <em>John Harris </em>he rented it to <em>Barnett, </em>and stated to the person who acted as his agent in renting the land, that it would be best to make <em>Barnett </em>pay as high rent as possible, as it would be for the benefit of the children ; as all he wanted was to get back his 1000 dollars with its accruing interest. He also enquired of another person whether the land would do to divide, so as to make two settlements for the children of <em>Nathan Barnett, </em>and being told it would not, he replied he would sell the land and give them the money, with which they might do better. In 1821, <em>John Harris </em>sold the land to <em>Lee W. Harris. </em>Pending the negotiation, he observed that if he intended to give the land to the heirs of <em>Polly Barnett, </em>(the wife of <em>Nathan Barnett,) </em>it would be best for their interest that it should be sold, as the money would be much more easily divided, and would suit the children better. And another witness states, that after the sale of the land, <em>Mr. Rives, </em>having enquired of him whether <em>Harris </em>intended the land for <em>Barnett\u2019s </em>children, and having observed that had not the understanding been so he would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>taken any thing like the price he had taken, the witness mentioned this conversation of <em>Mr. Rives' to John Har~ ris, </em>and he replied, the money would do <em>Barnett's </em>children more good he thought than the land; and asked the witness if he did not think so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afi\">During the minority of the plaintiff <em>Nathan Barnett, John Harris </em>advanced him the sum of <em>850 </em>dollars; and by his will he gave to the said <em>Nathan </em>and the plaintiff <em>Eliza </em>2000 dollars to be divided between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">' The Court having directed an account to be taken of the amount due from <em>John Harris </em>for the land, charging him with the rents whilst he held it, and the price at which it was sold, with interest thereon, and crediting him with 1000 dollars, with its interest, and the amount advanced to the plaintiff <em>Nathan, </em>and the taxes on the land; and the commissioner having returned a report, the cause came on to be finally heard in May 1839, when the Court decreed in favour of the plaintiffs for 6435 dollars 12 cents, the amount reported due by one of the commissioner\u2019s statements, with interest on 4178 dollars 65 cents from the date of the decree till paid. Prom this decree the executor of <em>John Harris </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-7\"><em>Garland </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b362-9\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqRS\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The Court is of opinion, that the evidence in the cause is insufficient to establish that the purchase by <em>John Harris </em>of the tract of land in the proceedings mentioned, was coupled with any trust for the benefit of the complainants <em>Nathan J. Barnett </em>and <em>Eliza Eggleston. </em>The Court, therefore, without considering what would have been the effect of the parol undertaking and agreement of the said <em>John Harris, </em>alleged in the bill of the complainants, if the same had been proved, is of opinion that so much of the said decree of the said Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>as gives relief to the complainants in relation to the rents of said land, and the proceeds of the sale thereof by the said <em>Harris, </em>and so much thereof as gives costs to the complainants is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Decree reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
