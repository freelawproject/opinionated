And <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>covenanted to give <em>Jackson </em>full and complete possession on the 25th December 1822, and meantime to allow him the privilege of preparing or using the land for crops, so that he should not interfere with <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>crop of tobacco then in the tobacco houses, or with any other property of <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>then on the land. And <em>Lig\u00f3n bound himself to make Jackson a good and lawful right to the land, on or before the 1st January </em>1823, <em>at which time the first payment was to be made.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\">In the interval between the date of the articles and the 25th December following, <em>Jackson </em>sowed a crop of wheat on the land, and full possession was given him on the 25th December 1822, according to the covenant. The parties met on the 1st January 1823, for the purpose of executing the articles; when <em>Jackson </em>requested that the business should be postponed for a few days, alleging (according to the account given by one witness) as his only reason for the request, that, as he had not been apprised of the exact quantity of the land, he was not then prepared with his bonds with surety for the deferred payments, but (according to two other witnesses) he suggested also, the same doubt about the title, which he afterwards specially objected, and which he then said it was necessary to examine; and, as those doubts arose out of the provisions of <em>Owen Haskins's </em>will, under which part of the land was claimed, he required <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>to produce the will. <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>assented to the postponement; and the parties agreed to meet again on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the Saturday following. They both attended at the day and place appointed; <em>Jackson </em>prepared to make the first payment, and to give his bonds with surety for the deferred payments, and tendering them, if <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>should make him a good and clear title; and <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>prepared with a deed <em>duly </em>executed by him, conveying the land to <em>Jackson </em>in fee, with general warranty. <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>tendered this deed to <em>Jackson, </em>and he shewed him the will of <em>Owen Haskins </em>under whose executor ho claimed a large portion of the land, but <em>Jackson </em>refused to accept <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>deed, alleging specific objections to <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title to that portion of the land claimed under <em>Haskins\u2019s </em>executor, requiring that the title should be cleared of those objections, and declaring that unless the defects or doubts of the title were removed, he would not proceed with the purchase. <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>denied that there was any defect in the title, and insisted, that his deed with warranty was a full and just execution of the articles on his part, and that nothing more could be required of him. Upon this, the parties separated, without executing the contract. And, a few weeks afterwards, <em>Jackson </em>abandoned the land, and the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">In January 1824, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>exhibited his bill in the county court in chancery, wherein, after setting forth the articles of agreement, and <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>refusal to proceed with the purchase, he proceeded to state his title to the land : that the whole tract was found, by survey, to contain 698 acres; 489 acres of which, he held under a conveyance from his father, and as to that the title was indisputable; and as to the residue of the tract, 209 acres, he claimed <em>two thirds </em>thereof under a sale and conveyance with general warranty, made to him by <em>Thomas Haskins, </em>executor of <em>Owen Has-kins, </em>in virtue of a power to sell vested in him by his testator\u2019s will; and the other third thereof he claimed under a contract made between him and <em>Albert Haskins, </em>one of the devisees of the testator <em>Owen Haskins, </em>who was entitled to this third; to which contract, he said, <em>Thomas Haskins, </em>the executor, had given his assent, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Lig\u00f3n </em>had completely executed on his part, but <em>Albert, </em>though of full age, had died without making him a conveyanee. He exhibited <em>Owen Haskins\u2019s </em>will, and the conveyanee made to him by <em>Thomas Haskins </em>the executor, but he did not exhibit the contract between him and <em>Albert Haskins. </em>He then alleged, that, at the time of the contract between him and <em>Jackson, Jackson </em>was exactly informed of the state of the title; that the title was, in fact, such a good and lawful title, that <em>Jackson </em>could never be disturbed in the enjoyment of the subject; that his conveyance with general warranty, tendered to <em>Jackson </em>in January 1823 (which he also exhibited) was such a good and lawful right to the land, as he was bound to make, and <em>Jackson </em>bound to accept, by the articles of the 12th November 1822, and that he was not bound to do any thing more on his part, to entitle himself to demand performance of the contract on <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>part.. And he prayed a decree for specific execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A--\"><em>Jackson, </em>in his answer, admitted that <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title to the 489 acres, which he claimed under the conveyance from his father, was perfect: but as to the 209 acres, whereof <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>claimed two thirds under the sale and conveyance of the executor of <em>Owen Haskins, </em>and the other third under the contract between him and <em>Albert Haskins, he objected, </em>that the executor had no authority under his testator\u2019s will, to make such sale and conveyance, so that <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>had no title whatever to the two thirds he claimed under him; and that, as to the other third thereof, which he claimed under <em>Albert, </em>he had, by his own shewing, only an equitable title. He acknowledged, that he was present at the sale made by the executor, which was a public one, and was apprised that the executor professed to make the sale in execution of a power vested in him by his testator\u2019s will; and his confidence in the executor\u2019s judgement was such that he did not doubt he had the power; but he never was informed of the actual provisions of the will, until after his contract with <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>was made. He said, that he expressly stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>lated that <em>Lisbon </em>should make him a good and lawful right on the day appointed; and relying on that covenant, he took possession of the land, as stated in the bill, and prepared himself to execute the contract on his part, in good faith ; but, finding that <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>had no good title to so large a portion of the land, and yet refused to take any steps to perfect the title, insisted that his title was already perfect, and that his own conveyance with warranty, was a full compliance with his covenant to make a good and lawful right to the land, and declared he would do nothing more, he, therefore, immediately declined to complete the purchase and abandoned the contract, and as promptly as he could abandoned also the possession of the land. He referred to the terms of the covenant, whereby <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>bound himself to make him a good and lawful right to the land on or before 1st January 1823, when the first payment was to be made by him ; and insisted, that <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>was absolutely bound to perfect the title in himself, and to convey a clear title to him, <em>at or before the lime appointed, </em>and that his failure to do so absolved him, the purchaser, from all obligation to complete the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">The controversy, then, turned upon the state of the title of the 209 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\">This was parcel of a tract of 438 acres, whereof <em>Owen Haskins </em>died seized in fee in January 1808, having by his last will and testament devised and bequeathed as follows: \u201c It is my will and desire, that all my just debts shall be paid by my executor; and that the following slaves (naming three men) shall be sold on twelve months credit, and the money arising from the sale thereof shall be laid out in young female slaves, for the benefit of my wife and children.

To this bill, the widow and executor filed their answers, and an answer was put in for the infant defendants <em>by a next </em>friend; no <em>guardian ad litem </em>was assigned them. The court made an interlocutory decree, appointing commissioners to assign the widow her dower, and to make partition among the four brothers. At this stage of that proceeding, <em>Albert, </em>the plaintiff therein, died without issue and intestate. And then <em>Lig\u00f3n (Jackson\u2019s </em>vendor) exhibited his bill, in the <em>same </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>court, against the same parties defendants, referring to <em>Al- </em>. . . r . . <em>bert Haskins\u2019s </em>bill, and the proceedings thereupon ; stating <em>Albert\u2019s </em>death; alleging that <em>Albert, </em>before his death, had transferred his whole interest in his father\u2019s land to him, as well what he derived from his father, as what he derived from his two deceased sisters, <em>Mary </em>and <em>Catharine; </em>that these having derived their shares of the land from their father, and died in infancy, their shares descended to their four brothers, to the exclusion of their mother; that, therefore, <em>Albert, </em>and <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>claiming under him, was entitled to one fourth of the land, subject to the widow\u2019s dower; praying, that he might be substituted in <em>Albert\u2019s </em>place, and that the widow\u2019s dower might be assigned her, and partition made between him and the three infant brothers of <em>Albert. </em>To this bill also the widow and executor of the testator <em>Owen Haskins, </em>and the three infant defendants, <em>Edward, Henry </em>and <em>Francis Haskins, </em>not <em>by guardian, </em>but <em>by next friend, </em>put in an answer, admitting the allegations of the bill, and assenting to the decree therein prayed for. Upon the strength of this admission in the answer, without any proof whatever of the alleged transfer by <em>Albert </em>of his share to <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>the county court at July term 1822, made an interlocutory decree, appointing commissioners to assign the widow her dower, and to make partition among the other parties according to the prayer of the bill. In October 1822, the commissioners, in pursuance of this decree, assigned 146 acres of the testator <em>Owen Haskins\u2019s </em>land to the widow for* her dower, and allotted 86 acres to <em>Edward Haskins </em>in severalty, and the residue, 209 acres, to <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Francis Haskins, </em>and <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>claiming <em>Albert\u2019s </em>share, jointly. The commissioners having made a report of this, division of the land, the court, at July term 1823, made a final decree, confirming the report and establishing the division, and directing the same commissioners to convey <em>Albert\u2019s </em>one undivided third of the 209 acres to <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>without giving the infant parties any day, after their attainment to full age, to shew cause against the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>And this was the precise state of <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title to <em>Albert Haskins\u2019s </em>third of this parcel of 209 acres of land, at the time this suit of <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>against <em>Jackson </em>was heard in the county court, and of the decree of that court in the same. The commissioners appointed to convey it to <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>had made no such conveyance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\">As to the other undivided two thirds of the 209 acres, which belonged to <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Francis Haskins, </em>which <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>claimed under the sale and conveyance of <em>Owen Haskins\u2019s </em>executor, it appeared, that the executor made the sale and conveyance thereof to <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>in October 1822, while <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Henry Haskins </em>were still infants, in virtue of the provision contained in his testator\u2019s will, which directed that, \u201c <em>after his wife\u2019s death or marriage, </em>his land should be sold, and the money arising from the <em>sale be </em>equally divided among all his children,\u201d notwithstanding the testator\u2019s widow <em>was still living, and still remained unmarried. </em>And she was still living, in widowhood, at the time of the hearing of <em>Lig\u00f3n\u2019s </em>suit against <em>Jackson, </em>and of the decree of the county court therein. So that the sufficiency of <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title to these two thirds of the 209 acres, depended on the question, whether the testator <em>Owen Has-kins\u2019s </em>will gave his executor power to sell his lands, after his widow had renounced the provision made for her by the will, but before her death or marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">The evidence as to the precise time when <em>Jackson </em>abandoned the possession of the land, was vague. A witness examined for <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>deposed, that <em>Jackson, </em>after sowing a crop of wheat, received full possession on the 24th December 1822, and that he abandoned the possession <em>within a few weeks afterwards.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">It was doubtful also, upon the proofs in the cause, whether or no <em>Jackson </em>was apprised of or suspected the defects in the title, at the time of his contract with <em>Lig\u00f3n. </em>It was proved, that the sale by the executor of <em>Haskins, </em>was made at public auction, in October <em>1822; </em>that the executor stated publicly, that he was selling as executor under his testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>will, for <em>the beaef\u00edt of his two </em>infant children <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Francis, </em>and that he would give a deed with a special warranty, and his own bond <em>with surety, </em>that the title should be made good, when the infants attained to full age, and that <em>Jackson </em>was present, and the witnesses supposed must have heard this; he was a bidder at the sale. On the other hand, it was proved, that, at the time of the treaty and contract between <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Lig\u00f3n, Jackson </em>told <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>he knew nothing about the title, and told the person who wrote the articles, to write such a contract as would bind <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>to convey him a good title, and bind him to pay the purchase money. The deed of <em>Haskins's </em>executor to <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>contained a covenant of <em>general </em>warranty; but no bond <em>with surety, </em>that the title should be made good when the infant owners attained to full age, was given by or demanded of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">The cause was pending in the county court, from January 1823 till July term 1826, when it was brought on for hearing by <em>consent of the parties, </em>upon the-state of the case as above detailed, <em>neither party asking or proposing a reference of the title. </em>The county court decreed a specific execution of the articles; that <em>Jackson </em>should accept <em>Ligones </em>deed with general warranty for the whole tract of 698 <em>acres, </em>which had been tendered to him in January 1823, and pay the purchase money according to the articles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">From this decree <em>Jackson </em>appealed to the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond. </em>And before the cause was heard in that court, viz. in November 1827, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>filed the following deeds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">1.

And he reported, that the parcel of 209 acres, was separated by a public road from the 489 acres, and all the buildings on the whole tract were upon the latter parcel: that, upon the question whether the former was essential to the beneficial enjoyment of the latter part, the <em>affidavits </em>of many persons had been laid before him (which he returned with the report) and these were very variant and conflicting: that his own opinion was, that, though the parcel of 209 acres was a convenient appendage to, it was not essential to the beneficial enjoyment of, the 489 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">The chancellor, upon the final hearing, in April 1830, was of opinion, that at the time of the decree of the county court, <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title was defective, and that court erred in decreeing specific execution without having first referred the title to a commissioner, to be examined and stated ; and, therefore, he reversed that decree with costs. But he was also of opinion, that <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>title was now perfect, and that if the county court had perceived the defect of the title when the cause was heard there, and had proceeded regularly, and made a reference of the title, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>could have perfected the title there, as he had done here; and, therefore, proceeding to make such decree as the county court ought to have pronounced, if it had proceeded regularly, and the same results that now appeared had appeared there, he decreed a specific execution; adjudging that <em>Jackson </em>should pay the whole purchase money with interest; and, in case of his failure to pay it within four months, ordering a sale of the land to be made by the marshal, and the proceeds to be brought into court to be applied by future order to the satisfaction of the debt.

For if it was, and if the vendor had not <em>then </em>a clear and perfect title, no matter whether or at what time he <em>after-wards </em>got the title in, he was not entitled to specific execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">The appellant\u2019s counsel thought, that, in the case of a purchase of land in this country for <em>cultivation, </em>where the purchaser covenants to pay the purchase money in several and distant instalments, and stipulates that a good title shall be assured to him at an early day before he shall part with any of the purchase money, the time, in general, was highly material, and ought to be regarded as of the essence of the contract: that, in such a case, while the credit enhanced the price of the subject, the purchaser always reckoned on the profits,- to be derived from his own labour and capital applied to the cultivation of the land, as a fund to aid hjm in making the deferred payments; but, unless he should be assured of the title at the time stipulated, he could neither safely make any improvements, nor certainly know whether the profits would be his own to dispose of; for if evicted, he would have to account to the true owner for the profits, while the owner would not be bound to make him any compensation for his improvements, nor would he be entitled to recover, on the usual covenants for assurance of title, the value of the improvements from the vendor: that, thus, the failure of the vendor to make a perfect title at the time stipulated, disappointed the purchaser, in very material respects, of the benefit of his purchase: therefore, that the case of such a purchase here, was different from the common case of purchase of lands in England\u2014lands already improved to the utmost and yielding a certain rent; it was, in principle like the case of a purchase of a house for a residence, and other cases where the contract is made with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>specific view, in which the time appointed for the convey-<em>Cl \u25a0 1 \u25a0 11 Cl c </em>i anee ot a clear title is regarded as ol the essence ot the contract, on the ground that the failure of the vendor to perfect the title, defeats the purpose of the purchase. But, however this might be in the general case, they said the circumstances of this particular case, and the conduct of the parties, made the time appointed for the performance of the vendor\u2019s covenant to convey, unquestionably material. The vendee expressly stipulated, that the vendor should make him a good and lawful right on the 1st January 1823, when the first payment was to be made; the time was extended to the Saturday following, by mutual consent; the vendor then tendered his own deed with warranty, and upon the vendee making specific objections to the title, he insisted that the title was good, and neither offered to take measures to perfect it, nor in fact took any: he left the vendee no alternative but to take a title, doubtful at least if not plainly defective, or to decline to proceed with the purchase. The vendee did immediately decline to proceed, and shortly after abandoned the possession; yet the vendor acquiesced for a year without insisting on the contract; for his suit was not brought till January 1824. They cited the opinion of <em>C. J. Marshall </em>in <em>Garnett </em>v. <em>Macon,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>p. 15. 53, 4. <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 469. 4 Ves. 689, <em>in notis. Harrington </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>4 Ves. 686. <em>Guest </em>v. <em>Homfray, </em>5 Ves. 818.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">The appellee\u2019s counsel said the case of <em>Garnett </em>v. <em>Macon </em>alone sufficed to refute the suggestion, that there was a peculiarity, in respect of the question whether time was of the essence of the contract, in a sale of lands in this country for <em>cultivation; </em>that case was like this, and though it was held that a change of circumstances rendered the time material, yet time was not held to be of the essence of the contract. Time may indeed, be made essential, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>by plain agreement to that effect; Sugd. Law Vend. ch. 8. ^ <em>2. </em>p. 284-292. Append. No. VI. p. 6.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But, so far from there being any thing of that kind in this contract, the provision, that partial possession should be immediately permitted to the vendee, and full possession given to him, before the time appointed for the conveyance of the title, shewed, conclusively, that time was neither of the essence of the contract, nor originally deemed by the parties at all material. And the vendee held the possession till after the time for the conveyance of the title had passed by; and that was a waiver of all objections founded on the failure of the vendor to make a good title at the precise time appointed. Therefore, they said, this case was to be added to the numerous cases, in which a vendor has been held entitled to specific execution, if he can make the title at the time of the decree. They cited Sugd. ch. 8. \u00a7 2. p. 282, 3. where the cases are collected; and they referred, particularly, to <em>Langford </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>2 P. Wms. 630. <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>7 Ves. 202. <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>14 Ves. 205. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Lindo, </em>3 Meriv. 80. <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 419. <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Auld, </em>5 <em>Cranch, </em>262. 275. <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Dunlop, </em>1 Wheat. 179. <em>Brazier </em>v. <em>Gratz, </em>6 Wheat. 528. 533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">\u2022 II. Whether, in fact, <em>Jackson </em>had knowledge of the alleged defects of the title, at the time the contract was made ? and supposing he had, what influence that circumstance would have on the construction of the contract? and how far such notice, coupled with the fact of possession taken by him, would bind him to proceed with the purchase, notwithstanding the defects of the title ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">As to the point of fact, both parties appealed to the evidence. Supposing <em>Jackson </em>had full knowledge of the defects of the title, the appellant\u2019s counsel said, it could not bind him to take a bad or doubtful title; and it rather served to account for and explain the stipulation he insisted upon, that a good and lawful right should be made to him at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>precise day when he was to make the first payment. The <em>appellee's </em>counsel said, it was apparent, that if <em>Jackson </em>was apprised of the defects of the title, he must have known that they could not be removed at so early a day; and they cited Sugd. ch. 8. \u00a7 2. p.286,7. <em>Pincke v. Curteis, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 329. <em>Seton </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>7 Ves. 265. <em>Syme v. Johnston, </em>3 Call, 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-4\">III. The appellant\u2019s counsel insisted, that it was quite clear, that, at the date of the articles, at the date appointed for the conveyance of the title, and at the date of the decree of the county court, <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>the vendor, had no title to 209 acres of land. As to the third of that parcel, he claimed only an <em>equitable </em>title, and that upon the strength of a decree palpably erroneous, and subject to be set aside by the infant parties whenever they attained to full age. And as to the other two thirds, claimed under the executor of <em>Owen Haskins, </em>they said, the will of that testator gave the executor a mere naked power to sell, after the death or <em>marriage </em>of the wife, and gave <em>all </em>the children an interest in the profits till one of those events should happen, and gave them unequal interests. The wife\u2019s renunciation of the provisions made for her by the will, entitled her to dower, but only disturbed the testator\u2019s disposition of his property <em>pro tanto. </em>The power to sell could never arise so <em>long </em>as the wife was living and remaining in widowhood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">The counsel for the appellee said, that, when the wife renounced the provision made for her by the will, the reason that induced the testator to postpone the sale till her death or marriage, ceased; but the purpose for which he authorized the sale remained, and that purpose required the sale to he presently made. This was not a naked power, but a power coupled with an interest, or (which is the same thing) with a trust. <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 20. 21. 14 Johns. Rep. 553,4 S. C.

And then, the question was\u2014supposing this a case, in which the vendor was entitled to specific execution, if he could make a good title at the time of the decree, and supposing the decree of the county court erroneous, because he was <em>then </em>unable to convey such a title\u2014what ought the court of chancery to have done, on the first hearing of the cause there, upon the appeal from-the decree of the county court ? Ought it to have reversed that decree, merely because the county court had not referred the title to a commissioner, and then to have retained the cause, referred the title, and made its final decree upon the commissioner\u2019s report shewing the title perfected since the decree of the county court ? or, to have reversed that decree <em>in omnibus, </em>and dismissed the bill?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab5\">The counsel for the appellant maintained, that the latter was the only decree, that could properly be made. They said, the doctrine that a vendor is entitled to specific execution, if he enable himself to convey a perfect title at the time of the decree, must have relation to the time of the decree of the court to which he resorts for relief, not to the time of a final decree in an appellate court, to which the cause may eventually be carried, by appeal from a decree which he himself has asked and obtained. The error of the county court consisted simply in decreeing specific execution when the plaintiff was no wise entitled to it, and when the defendant was entitled to a dismission of the bill. There was no error, not the least irregularity, in the omission to refer the title to a commissioner: 1. because the cause was brought to hearing by consent, and neither party asked a reference of the title. 2. Because the plaintiff, without having taken, without offering to take, any steps to perfect the title, or pretending that he could or would make a better title, relied upon the title he already had as a good one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>such as the defendant was bound to take; which the defendant denied; and both parties joined in submitting the dry question to the court, as to the sufficiency of the title in the then actual state of it. <em>Rose v. Calland, </em>5 Ves. 186. <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman, Id. </em>722. 3. Because there was no certainty, that the title could be perfected in any reasonable time : that depended on the infant owners living to attain to full age, and then confirming the title, or, if they should die in infancy, leaving no infant heirs entitled to share the inheritance (a very uncommon case under our system of descents) but only heirs of full age, competent and willing to confirm the title. Nothing could exceed the hardship of keeping the purchaser in such suspense. In this respect, the case was like <em>MackretKs </em>part of <em>the </em>case <em>of Whittaker v. Whittaker, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-5\">The appellee\u2019s counsel contended, that wherever a case is made by the pleadings-, in which a vendor will be entitled to specific execution of the contract of sale, if he shall be able to make the title at the time of the decree, it is the duty of the court to refer the title to a commissioner, in order to ascertain whether the vendor can make a good title, or has the means of compelling others to do it, and to give him the opportunity to perfect the title, unless such reference be waived, unequivocally and without fraud or surprise; <em>Jenkins v. Hites, </em>6 Ves. 646. And this, though the questions upon the title, are mere questions of law; <em>Marlow v. Smith, </em>2 P. Wms. 198. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Denne, </em>1 Ves. Jr. 565. <em>Abel </em>v. <em>Heathcote, </em>2 Ves. Jr. 98. 4 Bro. C. C. 278. <em>Roake v. Kidd, </em>5 Ves. 647. As to the question, whether an appellate court may direct a reference of the title, when the inferiour court has improperly neglected to do so, they said the case of <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman, </em>cited for the appellant for another purpose, was decisive on this point; for there, though it was not thought proper to refer the title, yet the question as to the reference was entertained in an appellate court. And this court upon an appeal from a decree of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>court of chancery, has directed a reference of the title; <em>Beverley </em>v. Lawson, 3 Munf. 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJc\">V. The last point was, whether admitting that the plaintiff was not entitled to specific execution of the contract as to the 209 acres, he was entitled to specific execution as to the other parcel of 489, as to which it was agreed on all hands he had, from the beginning, an undoubted title ? The authorities cited upon this point were, Sugd. Law Vend. ch. 6. p. 209-214. and the cases there cited, particularly <em>Poole </em>v. <em>Shergold,2 </em>Bro. C. C. 118. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Rand. 508.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\"> This was a case decided in the circuit court of the <em>U. States </em>for the district of <em>Virginia. </em>It was reported and published in a pamphlet form by <em>Collins Co. </em>Richmond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-8\"><em>Ingraham\u2019s </em>edi.

The county court decreed a performance : On appeal to the superiour court, the chancellor, without acting upon the decree, referred the title to a commissioner; upon whose report and other evidence taken in that court, the chancellor on a final hearing reversed the decree, as having been entered prematurely, and then decreed a specific execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Was the decree of the county court right? It is a principle laid down in many cases in equity, that an unwilling purchaser shall not be compelled to take a title with a cloud upon it; and that principle is assuredly strengthened here, where the party has contracted for <em>a good and lawful right. </em>What was the state of the title at the time of sale ? The tract consisted of 698 <em>acres; </em>to 489 acres of which, the vendor had an unquestioned title. To the residue, 209 acres, his title was of a different character: he held two thirds of it, by a deed from the executor of <em>Owen Haskins, </em>who had sold it under the will of his testator; and the other third, by a, purchase from <em>Albert Haskins, </em>a son of the testator, of his undivided third part, but for this part he had no conveyance. The validity of his title to the part purchased from the executor, depended on the question, whether the executor had power under the will to sell when he did ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The words of the will are\u2014\u201c It is my will and desire, that \u2022 11,11, <em>after my wijes death or marriage, </em>my land shall be sold, and the money arising from the sale be equally divided among all my children.\u201d The testator had in a former part of the will, directed that his estate should be kept together for the support of his wife and children. The wife renounced the will, but was neither dead, nor married ; and the children whose shares of the 209 acres the executor sold, were infants. It seems to me too clear for discussion, that the sale of the executor, under these circumstances, was not authorized by the will. Call it a naked power, or a power blended with a trust; construe it strictly or liberally; still you cannot make it a power to sell the land, while the wife was living and unmarried. The title, then, to these two thirds was clearly defective. The title to <em>Albert's </em>part was equally so : it was at best, nothing but an equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">But it was insisted, that the vendee, at the time of his purchase, was well acquainted with the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s title, and therefore is bound to take such as he can make. I do not consider the fact of his knowledge sufficiently established: he denies it in his answer; and we hear him calling for a sight of the will, when the deed was tendered to him. However, suppose him to have had this knowledge, I do not think it would oblige him to take a defective title, <em>even on a sale at auction; </em>it might induce the court to give the vendor time to perfect the title; but, surely, the court would not oblige him to take a defective title, in the teeth of his covenant, by which he stipulated to get, and the vendor bound himself to give, a good and sufficient right, at a short day.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">It was contended, that admitting the title to the 209 acres, to be defective, there are still 489 acres, about the title of which there is no dispute, and that the court ought to have executed the contract thus far : and much evidence, <em>pro </em>and <em>con, </em>was taken, as to the importance of these 209 acres to the enjoyment of the tract of land purchased. There are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>many cases that say, a trifling deficiency of a few acres in a tract of land, possessing no peculiar value in relation to the general tract, will not prevent the specific execution of a contract, as such deficiency lies in compensation (10 Ves. 306. 14 Ves. 413.) and this is interfering sufficiently with men\u2019s contracts. I have never seen, and I hope never shall see, a case going so far as is asked here. A man buys a farm of a certain size for cultivation; you deprive him of nearly a third, and insist that he shall take the residue, as a substantial compliance with the contract. This would be truly to <em>make </em>contracts, and not to execute those already made.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">At the time, then, of the hearing before the county court, I am clearly of opinion, that the plaintiff had not made out such a case as authorized a decree for specific execution. Ought that court to have dismissed his bill, or to have referred the title to a commissioner, and given further time for perfecting the title ? As to further time, no such thing was asked or thought of; no imperfection in his title was admitted by the plaintiff; on the contrary, he insisted by his bill, that \u25a0 his title was perfect, and that the deed which he had tendered, and which he exhibited with his bill and made part of it, was a full compliance with his contract. This was the issue made up by the parties, and submitted to the court; and to try this, they went to hearing by consent. Further time then for improving the title, was wholly out of the question. Ought the court to have sent the case to a commissioner for his report upon the title, <em>before </em>it proceeded to decide upon it? I think clearly not. The whole depended upon a dry point of law, which the court had as directly before it upon the pleadings and the evidence, as it ever could have it. ' To have sent the case then to a commissioner would have been to incur a vain and useless expense and delay; and that, when neither party wished it, but both were anxious for an immediate decision of the case in its actual posture. Even in <em>England, </em>where their commissioners are men of learning and professional skill, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>reference would not have been ordered in such a case. This is clear from the cases cited at the bar, of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Calland </em>and <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman, </em>where a reference was pressed and refused by the chancellor,\u2014in the first case, saying, \u201c he should create a needless expense by it\u201d\u2014and by <em>Chambre </em>justice, and baron <em>Graham, </em>in the last case, (sitting in the duchy court of Lancaster,) upon the same ground. I conclude, then, that the county court, on the hearing, ought neither to have given further time, nor to have referred the title; but finding it essentially and materially defective, should have dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It is equally clear to me, that on the appeal, the chancellor ought to have tried the case upon the record, as it stood before the court below, and to have reversed the decree and dismissed the bill; which having failed to do, I think we should now reverse his decree and dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b205-8\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AUH\">The plaintiff put his claim to a specific execution of the contract, on two grounds; I. on the validity of his title to the 209 acres purchased of the executor of <em>Haskins </em>and of <em>Albert Haskins, </em>his title to the 489 acres not being questioned; and 2. on the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the defect of the title to the 209 acres, supposing it to be defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">I think there was nothing in the allegation that the defendant was apprised of the defect in the title, if any, at the time he entered into the contract. It is probable enough, that both parties believed that the title to the 209 acres of land was a good title, when the contract was entered into: yet the plaintiff stipulated to make the defendant a good and lawful right to the land : and the defendant\u2019s knowledge of its defects could not affect him, since he did not rely on that knowledge when he made the contract. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Cook, 3 </em>Munf. 68. If <em>Jackson </em>was asking for a specific execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tion of the contract, the case would be different: proof that he knew of the state of the title when he made the contract, would compel him to take the title, as he understood it at the time; or the court would dismiss his bill; it would not execute the contract in the terms of it. But he is here asking nothing of the court, and insisting on his legal rights under the contract; and there is nothing in his conduct to 'affect his conscience. If he had purchased the land at the sale made by <em>Haskins\u2019s </em>executor, at which he was a bidder, and had relied on,his understanding of the title, and that alone, on a bill for specific execution, he would be compelled to take the title, as it was represented to him by the auctioneer; that is, the title he bargained for. But, in the case before us, however confident he may have been, when he made the contract, that the title was a good one, he was not bound to make an adventuring contract on his knowledge of the title; and he did not do so; on the contrary, he took a contract binding the vendor to make him a good and lawful title.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In this view of the case, there was nothing before the county court, to justify a reference of the title to a commissioner. Its validity depended on a just construction of the will of <em>Owen Haskins, </em>and the authority of his executor to sell the land under it. It was a dry question of law, for the decision of which the report of a commissioner could furnish nothing, and which the court alone was competent to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">That the county court erred in its decision is very clear. The sale by the executor was certainly premature. There are cases, in which the power of a trustee to sell, may be executed before the expiration of the time prescribed by the instrument giving the power; as in the case of <em>Uvedale </em>v. <em>Uvedale, </em>where the widow claimed as a creditor. But, in the case before us, the sale cannot be justified by the authority of that case, or any other. The renunciation of the will by the widow, was a release of her interest in the execution of the power, but was not equivalent to her mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>riage or death (the events, on the happening of either of which, the executor was authorized to sell) either in the intention of the testator, or as regarded the interests of the parties, under the power. Some of them were infants; and <em>they </em>entitled to unequal interests in the subject, until one of the events prescribed by the will should happen. The intention of the testator was, in either of those events, the marriage or the death of the widow, the whole, and not a part, of the subject should be sold. The power to sell the whole and divide the money among the children, was a trust, which was not properly executed by selling a part after dower was assigned to the widow. The county court erred, then, in deciding that the title was a good and lawful title. There is nothing in the case to justify its decree, on the ground of a waiver by <em>Jackson, </em>of his title according to the terms of his contract. There is no proof, that, at the time he took possession of the land, he agreed to take any but a good and lawful title according to his written contract. His abandonment of it, in a few weeks after he discovered that the vendor could not make him a title until infants should come of age, nor then, if others also, in whom the title was in part, should dissent and elect to take the land, was evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Neither is this a case for compensation. It would be to make a contract for him, to compel him to take the 489 acres only, at a value not put on it by himself; for he has valued it in connexion with the 209 acres, and not by itself. As to time not being of the essence of the contract, unless expressly made so (which it is not in this case); time, nevertheless, may be very material to the justice of the case. <em>Jackson </em>was to pay for the land by instalments, and might reasonably calculate on the profits to assist him in the payments. To continue in possession under a <em>doubtful </em>title (at least) might be ruinous to him: he might pay the instalments, and put improvements on the land, or its value might be enhanced by other causes, and then he might lose all.</p>\n<p id=\"APv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>It is the settled rule of this court, not to compel avendee to pay the purchase money until he gets a title. In the state of the case before the county court, the bill ought to have been dismissed. And when the cause came into the court of chancery by appeal, that court ought to have reversed the decree of the county court, and to have rendered such decree as the county court ought to have rendered; there being no ground on which to retain the cause in that court, laid in the proceedings of the county court. Both decrees ought therefore to be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b208-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Asqo\">In examining this case, I shall begin with the inquiry, what decree the court of chancery ought to have pronounced upon hearing the appeal from the decree of the county court ? The practice in such cases is perfectly familiar to the profession. Where the appellate court is of opinion, that the inferiour court has erred, it proceeds not only to reverse its decree, but to make such decree as the court below ought to have made. Thus, its reversal may be absolute and <em>in omnibus, </em>not only annulling what has been done in favour of one party, but entering an absolute decree in favour of the other; or it may be partial and interlocutory, when the court below has proceeded prematurely to adjudicate finally between the parties, without such preliminary inquiries, as appear, upon the face of the record, to have been essential to enable the court to pronounce upon the rights of the parties, with a full understanding of the case. Thus, in the present instance: if the county court ought to have decided, that there was no ground for specific performance, the decree should have been wholly reversed, and the bill dismissed with costs: for this the appellant\u2019s counsel contend. But, if there was enough in the record to shew that, instead of decreeing specific performance, on the one hand, or dismissing the bill on the other, the court should have directed a reference of the title to a commissioner, before it proceeded to pronounce definitively between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the parties, then the court of chancery ought to have reversed the decree, and to have proceeded to direct that reference, which ought to have been directed by the inferiour tribunal. Nor do I think the irregularity of omitting to affirm or reverse the decree, definitively, when the appeal was first heard, is material, provided the chancellor did not, in his subsequent decision, bring matters, introduced into the cause <em>esc post facto, </em>to bear upon the antecedent question of error or no error in the county court. This, indeed, would be altogether erroneous; for, except in a few cases, founded on the practice of the spiritual courts, and some others resting on particular statutory provisions, it is a practice unknown to our law, for a superiour court, when reviewing the sentence of an inferiour, to examine the justice of the former decree, by evidence which was never produced below. We must, therefore, consider the decree of the county court, upon the proofs in the cause at the hearing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In that state of the cause, ought the county court to have pronounced the decree it did ? If not, ought it to have dismissed the bill? or directed a reference of the title to a commissioner ? That the decree of the county court was not justified by the proofs in the cause, was admitted by the chancellor. But I go further than he has done, being of opinion, that nothing appeared before the court to justify even a reference of the title, and that the bill of the plaintiff should therefore have been dismissed. This brings us to an examination of the merits of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">By the contract between the parties, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>contracted to give <em>Jackson possession </em>on the 25th December 1822, and to make him a good and lawful right, on or before the 1 st January following. It was not a mere engagement to seal and deliver a <em>conveyance, </em>with the usual covenants of title, which <em>Jackson </em>regarded; the vendor bound himself to make <em>a good and lawful right, </em>and this, by the terms of the contract, was to be accomplished by the 1st January. Whether <em>Jackson </em>knew, or did not know, at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>contract, that the title was defective, is wholly immaterial: if he did n'ot know it, he surely o,ught not to be compelled 'to take a defective title that was concealed from him, and which he could not have intended to receive: if he did know it, he provided against it expressly, by the covenant that required <em>a good and lawful right </em>to be made <em>by </em>a given day; and if, in the present case, the purchaser would be concluded from objections to the title, by the fact of his prior knowledge of its defects, it is not perceived what course a buyer is to take who desires to secure himself ,against known defects. The case of <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>3 Munf. 68. very clearly shews the understanding of this court, that a covenant against incumbrances, comprehends known as well as unknown incumbrances, and that the vendee is not precluded by his previous knowledge, from claiming the fulfilment of the covenant. Were it otherwise, it would be impossible for him to provide for his security.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The contract, then,.having bound the vendor to make <em>a good and lawful right, </em>not with reference, as he supposes, to <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>notions of a good title, but with reference to the .well established principles of the law, the next question is, whether a rigorous compliance with this engagement on the appointed day, was essential to <em>Ligorfs </em>right to specific' execution ? This brings us to the subject of time <em>being of </em>the essence of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">At law, in <em>every </em>case of dependent covenants, time is of the essence of the contract, since the plaintiff cannot recover without shewing performance on his part, or readiness and ability to perform. But, in equity, it is, upon general principles, otherwise. It is the boast of that court, that it \u25a0looks at the substance of things, and is regardless of forms; that it relieves against penalties and forfeitures incommensurate to the injury which the party has done, and where ample compensation can be made will compel his adversary to accept such compensation. On like principles, although a vendor may not have complied in strictness with his contract to convey,\u2014or the vendee may not have paid his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ney precisely at the stipulated time, equity will, nevertheless, upon a proper case made, enforce the contract, instead of permitting either party to insist on an arbitrary forfeiture of its benefits. Out of the exercise of this jurisdiction has grown the idea, that, in equity, time is not regarded as of the essence of a contract, and a false report of an opinion of lord <em>Hardwicke, </em>in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>1 Atk. 12. carries it to an extent in no wise justified by reason or later authorities. That parties may, if they please, make time of the essence of their contract, is now clearly admitted, and seems to follow from the unquestioned right of parties to frame their contracts at pleasure, unless, indeed, it can be shewn that this stipulation is against moral right, or positive law. It would seem, then, <em>that </em>the intention of the parties is, in this, as in other cases, to be looked to <em>\u2022, </em>and where it is plain that, in default of a strict performance on one part, it was the intention that the contract should cease to be binding on the other, that intention must be carried into effect: for courts do not sit to overthrow the agreements of parties, but to carry them into effect, where they are legal, equitable, and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">It cannot be denied, however, that the mere appointment of a day for the payment of money, or delivery of a title, has not been regarded as a sufficient indication that time is of the essence of the contract. <em>Seton </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>7 Ves. 273-5. And, in the case at bar, there appears to me nothing to shew, that the parties so designed it here. There is, indeed, a strong provision to prove the contrary; the provision, namely, that <em>Jackson </em>might proceed to prepare for a crop, and should have possession on the 25th December, only seven days before the day fixed for making a title. On that day, he accordingly took possession, and actually went on the land to reside. Now, if time was of the essence of the contract, the first of January must have decided that it was either good or void ; and, in that view, it is scarcely to be conceived, that <em>Jackson </em>would have contracted for the possession on the 25th December, with the risque of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>obliged to relinquish it on the 1st January for want of title, instead of fixing the day of possession to the 1st January, only seven days later, when all suspense would have necessarily terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">But though time may not have been of the essence of the <em>contract, </em>yet it may have been rendered by the conduct of the vendor or vendee, subsequent to the contract, of the essence of the <em>transaction </em>between the parties. Such, I conceive, has been the case here. <em>Jackson, </em>I have little doubt, supposed that the title from <em>Haskins </em>the executor, and perhaps, that from <em>Albert Haskins, </em>would be good. But when he had, as I suppose, taken counsel of his friend, or of his lawyer, and found that the will conferred no authority on the executor, to sell during <em>Mrs. Haskins\u2019s </em>life and widowhood, he distinctly announced his objection to <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>refused to receive the title, and, <em>in a few weeks, </em>renounced the possession. It is said, indeed, that the time of his quitting the premises does\" not \u2022 appear; that it might have been months, or a year. But I think we cannot infer that <em>Lig\u00f3n\u2019s </em>own witness would have used the terms <em>weeks, </em>if the continuance of possession had been for <em>months; </em>nor, indeed, does any man, even in common parlance, ordinarily use the lesser denomination where the use of the greater is appropriate to the fact. I take it, then, that the possession was relinquished within.a month; the rejection of the title was distinctly announced, and <em>Jackson </em>returned to his own home. In this, I think, he was fully justified, if he had good reason to be dissatisfied with the title. To have continued the possession would have been <em>to close the door upon his objections. </em>Moreover, if his objection to the title was a valid one, (the want of power in the executor to sell) it was most formidable, since it would have required years, and a fortuitous occurrence of events, ever to make it good. Whether, therefore, time was or was not of the essence of this contract, I think the vendee was justified at this early stage of the transaction, in this prompt, and (as far as we can see) this <em>bona fide </em>rejection of the title, and of <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>purchase. He has not, in the language of the books, <em>\u201c </em>turned round the contract upon frivolous objections.\u201d He has renounced it upon vital and well founded objections, which it would have required years to remove, if indeed they were ever susceptible of removal. After this measure, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>is not heard of until the commencement of the suit, just twelve months after the renunciation of the contract by <em>Jackson: </em>he gives no notice to <em>Jackson, </em>that he shall attempt the completion of the title, or the enforcement of the contract; nor does he sue for that purpose until twelve months have elapsed. Neither has he proved, that <em>he </em>also abandoned the property, which, if true, would have been a fact of some importance in estimating <em>his </em>conduct in this affair. The case is thus brought, I think, strongly within the influence of that of <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 469. 4. Ves. 689. See also 4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 559. It is not reasonable, that a purchaser, who in proper time has prged his objections to a title, and who on discovering that a good title cannot be made, has at once refused to perform the agreement, should be compelled to abide by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In this view of the transaction, it will be perceived, I have assumed as a postulate, that the title in this case was clearly defective, and that there was no reasonable calculation that it could be rendered otherwise. It is, therefore, proper that this question should in its turn be examined, though very cursorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The better opinion, upon the authorities cited at the bar, seems to me to be, that a power given to an executor to sell after the determination of a life, cannot be executed during that life. The sacrifice inevitably attendant upon the sales of reversionary interests, renders such a measure always hazardous; and, therefore, it is not fair to presume, where such a power is not given by the testator, that he could have designed it should be exercised by his executor. In this case, however, the widow by renunciation of the will has relieved two thirds of the estate from the incumbrance of her life, and has thus enabled the executor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>proceed to a sale, which would not be liable to the objec- <em>. , . </em>. . tions, applying to the sales of reversionary interests. But, while one difficulty is removed, another is substituted of a not less formidable character.- The testator directed the <em>whole </em>tract to be sold <em>after his wife\u2019s death or marriage. </em>His wife has claimed her dower; that has been laid off to her. If, as usual, it comprehends the dwelling house, and curtilage, and other improvements on the land, then it is impossible to say, that either the sale already made by the executor has not been injured by this partition, or that the sale of the dower land, after the widow\u2019s death, will not be so affected. It is not only very possible, but highly probable, that the sale of either without the other, would be prejudicial to both; and this is a matter which the heirs of <em>Haskins, </em>at a remote period, might have thought proper to litigate with <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>or with <em>Jackson, </em>if he had been the purchaser. It is impossible, I think, (to use the language of the books) that this court should compel <em>Jackson </em>to buy a law suit. Whether the legal title was in the executor or not, whether there was a trust, or an imperative duty or a mere power, the act of the executor in selling under such questionable circumstances, and in selling, moreover, -the shares of two out of four heirs, when each had a right that the intirety should be sold for the joint benefit,\u2014was liable to a rigourous scrutiny by the heirs, when they should attain to full age. When this would have been, does not distinctly appear in the record; but, as there were several under age at the time of the contract, it is certain that several years, must have intervened, before the youngest would attain his full age, so as to ratify the act of the executor, and to quiet the title of the vendee. Could it be expected, that <em>Jack-son </em>was to be held in suspense during this interval; and encounter, when it was determined, the sheer chance of the children ratifying the transaction ? But this is not all. Those children might die before they attained their majority. Their interests might have devolved upon numerous heirs scattered over the country, some perhaps <em>femes covert, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>others infants of more tender years than themselves, whose acquiescence in the premature exercise of his power by the executor, would be the less easily acquired, in the disadvantageous situation in which he vras placed. Thus circumstanced, I do not think <em>Jackson </em>was bound to accept a title so defective, and which could\u201e not be rendered good for several years, and might never be rendered good. He was not bound to speculate on the possibility of <em>Ligon\u2019s </em>being able to buy out or quiet the claims of the heirs. He was not bound to take an estate, which he must either suffer to remain unimproved, till the cloud had passed which hung over the title, or which he must improve at imminent hazard. He was not bound to take an estate without a <em>marketable </em>title, since without such title he might be subjected to the heaviest loss. Had he taken it, and found it necessary to sell, the doubt about the title would have rendered it a dead property on his hands; and (as this very decree shews) it might be forced by <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>himself into the market for sale, with a cloud hanging over it, arising out of his own failure to fulfil his express engagement to make a good and lawful title.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">It may be said, indeed, that it was impossible for <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>to obtain the title. Be it so. Then what is the consequence ? The answer is plain. As he <em>cannot </em>do what he undertook to do, as <em>he </em>cannot perform his contract, he ought not to expect <em>Jackson </em>to abide by it. He ought to be well satisfied, that there are no worse consequences, from his having contracted to do, what he now finds he cannot do. I have no doubt, that he contracted in good faith; that he supposed the executor\u2019s conveyance and <em>Jllberfs </em>contract were sufficient- and so, very possibly, did <em>Jackson. </em>But the <em>latter did not choose to rest upon this opinion: </em>he bound his vendor to make him, by a given day, a good and lawful right; and that vendor, too confident in his title, undertook accordingly. When he found he could not perform, and that <em>Jackson </em>promptly renounced the contract, he ought not to have hesitated to abandon his pretension to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In the view which I have taken of the title under the ex-_ , , ecutor, I have not thought it necessary to scrutinize narrowly, the character or extent of his power; since, under any aspect, a purchaser under him must inevitably be exposed to the hazard of loss and litigation. It is, however, my opinion, that the executor in this case had but a <em>bare power; </em>that there is nothing from whence a technical trust can be inferred; and that the legal title descended to the heirs, subject indeed to the provision made for their support during the life and widowhood of the wife, and subject further to be divested by a due execution of the power after her death or marriage. If this be so, then thp legal title was not conveyed by the premature exercise of his power by the executor, and all that his deed could pass was a questionable equity; which no purchaser is bound to take.</p>\n<p id=\"AXH\">It is not necessary to point out the other defects of this title, at the time of the decree rendered by the county court. The invalidity of the conveyance of the executor, is itself sufficient to vacate the contract, unless it could be shewn that the vendee, even without <em>this </em>land, would get what he substantially contracted for. Of this, no evidence was before the county court; nor is it reasonably to be inferred, when we find that <em>Jackson </em>himself was a bidder for this very property at the executor\u2019s sale; that <em>Lig\u00f3n purchased </em>it and sold it as an appendage to his own land, and that, to say the least, others besides <em>Jackson </em>deem the <em>Haskins </em>tract an important appendage to the <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>tract. <em>Besides </em>this, there is no such allegation in the pleadings, but they stand solely upon the question, whether there has or has not been a compliance with the contract on the part of <em>Lig\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AR-\">Upon the whole, I think it clear, that at the time of the decree in the county court, <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>had not complied, and could not comply, with his contract; and, of course, the bill ought to have been dismissed, unless that court ought either to have referred the title to a commissioner, or have given further time for the completion of the title. Neither of these things, in my opinion, ought to have been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>As to reference of title : This practice, now so well set-tied in <em>England, </em>has not, I believe, prevailed very generally with us. The reason for having a report, is said to be, that the ground upon which the court proceeds, may appear upon the record. And, in <em>England, </em>where titles are complicated by mortgages, terms, family settlements, and outstanding trusts, it is of great importance as well as convenience, that such references should be made. The necessity can more rarely exist with us, where the title is generally more simple and the question of its validity is fairly presented by a few title papers of the simplest form. For, as the commissioner\u2019s opinion upon the validity of the title, is liable to exception, and to the revision of the court, it is obvious, that where the question of title is already fairly presented, and a distinct point is offered to the court for its consideration, a reference would only lead to embarrassment and expense, without subserving any beneficial end. The english practice will be found, indeed, I think, to coincide with this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">There, when a vendor files a bill for a specific performance, stating that he was unable to complete his title at the time fixed, but that he is now ready to do so, <em>if he makes such a case as entitles him to relief in case he can make a good title, </em>the court will refer the title to a master for his report. And, even when the vendor states that he is yet unable, but shews that he will soon be able, to perfect the title, the court, <em>upon a proper case made, </em>will direct the master to report whether a good title can be made at the time of the report, and if so, or if it can even be made at the date of the decree, it may suffice. In these cases, it must be observed, a single naked question is not often presented to the court, but the general question of the validity of the title proposed to be made; and, therefore, a reference is directed, in order that the necessary abstracts and information may be laid before the court, and the points of dispute fairly and distinctly pointed out, either by the report, or by exceptions which may be filed to it. So, if the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fendant in answer to the allegation that the plaintiff can now make a good title, asks for a reference, by his answer or by motion, he is peculiarly entitled to it, as the plaintiff is aslting relief beyond the law. 6 Ves. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqbl\">But, I think, there is no invariable rule, even in <em>England, </em>that the court ought never to decide upon the validity of the title, but should send the title to a master. This is established by the cases of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Calland, </em>and <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman. </em>The latter is peculiarly strong and appropriate. (By the way, the remarks of the judges, upon the <em>merits </em>of the case, have a strong bearing upon this case). The bill was filed in the court of chancery of the county palatine of <em>Lancaster, </em>for specific performance, by a purchaser. The defendant by his answer took a variety of objections to the plaintiff\u2019s ability to make a good title; all of which, however, grew out of the instrument under which the plaintiff assumed the power to sell the premises. \u2022 The vice chancellor dismissed the bill, without referring the title. In the argument, this omission is made the substantive objection <em>to </em>the decree of dismission, although the counsel admitted, that if it had incontestibly appeared, that a good title could not have been made, the decree would have been right. <em>Chambre, </em>J. said, <em>\u201c </em>against this decree it is said, that there is an\" invariable rule that the court ought not to decide upon the validity of the title, in the first instance, but that the title ought to be sent to the master, and should be taken into consideration by the court upon his report. If there was an inflexible rule of that sort, it would dispose of the case. But if no authority had been cited, I should find it very difficult to accede to that idea, that there should be such inflexible rule: for if it should clearly appear to the court, upon the pleadings and the evidence, that there are objections <em>not to be removed, it would be an idle and unnecessary expense to the parties, </em>to answer no purpose, to make such a reference. We are, however, relieved from any difficulty from the circumstance of a very recent and decided authority by the lord chancellor,\u201d (meaning <em>Rose </em>v. Calland) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Baron <em>Graham </em>coincided in this opinion : \u201c What\u201d (he em- . phatically asks) \u201c is the effect of sending the case to a master, when we see the title can only be good, if the heir and other persons join ?\u201d And these opinions seem to be strongly sustained by the lord chancellor, in the case of <em>Jenkins v. Hiles, </em>which was cited for the appellee : he there distinctly intimates, that it is not the practice of the courts to refer the title to a master, where the answer of the defendant offers, \u201c for the decision of the court, <em>one neat dry point </em>upon which his objection rests.\u201d Speaking, moreover, of the case of <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman, </em>he appears to approve the principle laid down by the judges as to this doctrine of reference, though (if I understand him rightly) he had some doubt of the propriety of its application to that case. He considers the cases of <em>Rose v. Calland, </em>and <em>Omerod </em>v. <em>Hardman, </em>as not within the ordinary rules requiring a reference, being cases where the vendor comes for specific performance, and the vendee calls for a decision upon the title offered by the vendor, who, instead of shewing by his bill that he can heal defects, puts himself upon the title he has offered, and chooses to abide by that. He says, that admitting the vendor\u2019s right, under the general rule, to clear away difficulties between the hearing and the report, \u201c it would be difficult to say, that there could be no case, in which the plaintiff might not have stated himself so conclusively, that the court should hesitate in the first instance to decide. If I am to state a doubt upon the case in the duchy court, it would be a doubt, whether it could be collected from what was stated by the plaintiff, that, if the title was imperfect, it was stated conclusively, or whether, if stated conclusively, it was doubtful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">From this view of the cases, I am clearly of opinion, that a reference to a commissioner by the county court, was neither necessary nor proper, as this case appeared in that court; and <em>a fortiori, </em>it could not have been proper to give time to the plaintiff, from month to month, or from year to year, to see whether he could buy out or extinguish the outstanding rights to this property. It is going far enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>to give time, as is sometimes the effect of a reference, to enable the party to get in the <em>title, </em>where he has already a right to the estate, and where the vendee is in possession, as was the case in <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>a fact I conceive of the utmost importance in these cases. But, I doubt whether any case can be made, in which it would be proper to give a plaintiff, who seeks a specific performance against a defendant, who has promptly rejected the title as defective, and thrown up the possession, an indefinite time to see, whether he can purchase up the rights of others in the estate, in order to enable him to comply with his engagements after the lapse of years. Such, in effect, 1 conceive this case to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Both decrees reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
