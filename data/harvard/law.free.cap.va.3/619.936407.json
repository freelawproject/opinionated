He paid <em>Brockenhrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>the first mentioned sum of .12,750 dollars, and they conveyed to him the undivided moiety, which had been conveyed to them by the commissioners of the court of chancery; that is, <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>moiety. They also, immediately, suggested to <em>Blythe </em>and <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>friends in <em>South Carolina, </em>that the only way in which a conveyance of her title in the other moiety could be effected, during her infancy, was by authority of a special act of assembly, passed for the purpose. And, in consequence of that suggestion, a petition on behalf of <em>Miss Young, </em>of her mother who was entitled to dower of her moiety, the administrator of her father, and <em>Blythe, </em>was presented to the legislature at the session of 1815-16 (through the agency of <em>Brockenhrough </em>and Taylor) stating <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title to an undivided moiety of the lands; that the <em>Red Springs </em>were mineral waters; that the value of the property depended, chiefly on improving it as a watering place; and that her mother, who was her natural guardian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>and the administrator of her father, did not consider themselves authorized to expend money belonging to her, in such improvements as were necessary to make this property pro\u00editable: and therefore praying the legislature, by special act to be passed for the purpose, to authorize the sale and conveyance of her interest in the lands in question. In consequence of this petition, a bill was passed by the <em>house of delegates, </em>authorizing the guardian or guardians, who should be duly appointed for <em>Miss Young, </em>according to the laws of <em>South Carolina, </em>to sell and convey her interest in the lands. But this bill was rejected by the senate. Thus, <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>failed to procure a conveyance of the legal title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, in the only way in which it was possible to procure such conveyance, within the year next after the date of their agreement with <em>Rogers ; </em>and, thenceforth, <em>they </em>regarded their agreement with <em>Rogers, </em>in respect of that moiety, as at an end.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">Meantime, in July 1815, a <em>subpoena </em>was sued out of the superiour court of chancery of <em>Staunton, </em>in the name of <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>against <em>Blythe </em>and <em>Stribling, </em>his agent in <em>Virginia, to </em>attach in <em>Stribling\u2019s </em>hands, the 6750 dollars which <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>had paid for <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>moiety of the land, till <em>Blythe </em>should comply with his contract with respect to the other <em>(Miss </em>Young\u2019s) moiety. It did not distinctly appear who sued out this process : <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were apprised of it, and made no objection. <em>Blythe </em>died in 1817, no proceedings having been had on the foreign attachment in chancery, during his life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">In May 1819, <em>Rogers, </em>without the knowledge or consent of <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, or </em>either of them, caused a bill to be exhibited in their names, against <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>real and personal representatives, <em>Stribling, </em>the agent of <em>Blythe, </em>and <em>Miss Young </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Staun</em>ton\u2014setting forth the contract of September 1813, between <em>Blythe </em>and the plaintiffs, <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>the conveyances of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>undivided moiety of the lands to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>them, their payment of 6750 dollars to Stribling, his agent, and the expenses they had incurred in improvements : alleging, that <em>Blythe </em>had died, without having in any way complied with his contract, with respect to <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>mo\u2019ety 5 that the plaintiffs had thereby been prevented from improving the property as a watering place, to the degree of which it was susceptible, and so had been disappointed of the profits which they expected, and of the chief advantage which induced them to make the purchase; that <em>Miss Young </em>was still a minor, residing in <em>South Carolina; </em>and that her guardian was claiming her moiety, and threatening a suit for it; a measure which would be very injurious to the plaintiffs, since it would deprive them of the benefit of the improvements they had made, and would render the moiety which would be left them of comparatively little value, the lands being only valuable in one entire parcel, on account of the mineral waters, and so not admitting of convenient partition. Therefore, they expressed their earnest desire, that <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title should be conveyed to them; called upon her to disclose the nature of her title; and prayed, that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives might be decreed to procure and convey her title; or, if that could not be done, that the court would direct an issue to ascertain the damages the plaintiffs had sustained, by reason of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>failure to perform the agreement with respect to <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, and that they might be indemnified out of the money they had paid to <em>Stribling </em>for <em>Blythe, </em>which was still in <em>Stribling\u2019s </em>hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-3\">In this bill, there was no mention of, or allusion to, the sale made by <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to <em>Rogers, </em>or the fact that he was, and had been since 1815, in possession of the lands, enjoying the whole profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-4\">The representatives of <em>Blythe </em>put in their answer in 1820. They denied that <em>Stribling </em>had any authority from <em>Blythe, </em>to make the contract with <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>of September 1813, so far as it respected the sale of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety of the land; and if he had such authority, they said, the purchasers had retained the purchase money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>of that moiety in their own hands, which was an ample security for the fulfilment of <em>Blythe's </em>contract in that particularj and if <em>Miss Young </em>should refuse to convey her moiety, when she should attain to full age, the purchase money contracted to be paid for it, would be the exact measure of damages which the purchasers would sustain by the breach of the contract. Therefore, they claimed the whole of the money in <em>Stribling's </em>hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-4\">No steps were taken to bring the suit to an early hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuJY\"><em>Miss Young </em>attained to full age in 1823. And, in 1824, she put iu her answer, in which she said, that she was willing to ratify the contract made by <em>Stribling </em>with <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>so far as it respected her moiety of the lands, and to convey the same to the purchasers; and that she would execute a conveyance, and transmit it to her counsel in this cause, to be exhibited to the court, and to be delivered to the purchasers, so soon as they should pay the purchase money with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-6\">She accordingly executed the conveyance, and it was filed in the court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-7\">Neither <em>Miss Young's </em>title to a moiety of the lands, nor the particulars of <em>Blythe's </em>title to the other moiety, were shewn and regularly deduced : and upon the documents that were filed in the cause, the title, particularly as to the parcel called <em>Greenwoods, </em>did not appear to be perfectly clear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-8\">But the title was nowise questioned in the pleadings, or at the hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-9\">As to the defendant <em>Stribling, </em>it appeared, that he had, as <em>Blythe's </em>agent, received from <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>in July, 1815, the sum of 6750 dollars, in full of the purchase money for <em>Blythe's </em>moiety, which was immediately attached in his hands, and that he had paid it into court, soon after the filing of the bill, in 3 819. And the only question was, whether he was bound to pay interest in the interval between 1815 and 1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-10\">In July 1825, the court of chancery decreed, that upon the plaintiffs, <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>paying to <em>Miss </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>Young </em>the sum of 6750 dollars with interest from the times appointed for the payment of the instalments thereof by the agreement of September 1813, the deed executed by her, conveying her moiety of the lands to them, should be delivered to them; and, in case they should fail to pay the same to her within six months, the marshal of the court should sell the <em>whole </em>of the lands, at public auction for cash, and bring the proceeds of sale into court, to be disposed of by future order\u2014and that <em>Stribling </em>should pay <em>Blythe's </em>representatives, the sum of 6750 dollars which he as <em>Blythe's </em>agent, had received of the plaintiffs on account of the purchase money of <em>Blythe's </em>moiety, with interest from July 1815, when he received it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-3\">\u2022 After this decree was pronounced, <em>Broclcenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>exhibited their bill against <em>Blythe's </em>representatives, <em>Miss Young </em>and <em>Rogers; </em>setting forth the contract between them and <em>Rogers </em>of the 31st May 1815, and the proceedings and decree in the first mentioned suit prosecuted by <em>Rogers </em>in their names; and alleging, that they had no knowledge whatever of the proceedings in that suit, till after the decree made therein, and had taken no part in the prosecution of it; <em>Rogers </em>was the real, they only nominal plaintiffs in that cause. That, having by their contract with <em>Rogers, </em>covenanted to use their best endeavours to procure the legal title of <em>Miss Young's </em>moiety of the lands, and, if the title thereof could be procured, to convey that moiety to <em>Rogers, </em>for which <em>Rogers </em>was to pay them 6750 dollars, in addition to the 12,750 dollars which he was to pay them for <em>Blythe's </em>moiety; but, if they could not procure the legal title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety <em>within a year after the contract, Rogers </em>should be at liberty, <em>in their names </em>or his own, to institute any proceedings against <em>Blythe </em>[only] for <em>his 'own benefit and advantage; </em>and, in case they should not be able to procure the title of <em>Miss Young's </em>moiety, <em>Rogers </em>should pay them <em>only </em>the 12,750 dollars, the purchase money stipulated for <em>Blythe's </em>moiety;\u2014they had used their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>best endeavours to procure the title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, \u2022 , , \u2022 ... , . , in the only way in which it was possible to obtain it, namely, by procuring the petition to the legislature at the session of 1815-16, praying a special act to authorize her guardians to sell and convey the same; and when they failed in that effort to procure a conveyance of her title, <em>within the year, </em>the contract between them and <em>Rogers, </em>according to the true construction thereof, so far as it related to the sale of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, was at an end: they had no longer any right to demand of <em>Rogers </em>the purchase money for that moiety, nor he to require them to procure and convey the title thereof to him. That, though they covenanted with <em>Rogers, </em>that, in case the title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety could not be procured, he might either in their names or his own, institute any legal proceedings against <em>Blythe, </em>yet such proceedings were to be for his own benefit and advantage; consequently <em>he </em>was to incur any responsibility which those proceedings should impose on the plaintiffs; he had no right to institute such proceedings in their names, for his own benefit, and to throw the responsibility on them. That they covenanted, that <em>Rogers </em>might institute such proceedings against <em>Blythe only, </em>not against <em>Miss Young </em>also; they had no right to demand of <em>her </em>specific execution of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract as to her moiety, nor had she any right to demand specific execution thereof from them; she was only entitled to demand her moiety of the lands in question, and <em>the profits </em>of her property, from <em>Rogers, </em>who held the property, and had received the profits. That, consequently, the proceedings which <em>Rogers </em>instituted and prosecuted in their names, were wholly unauthorized. That, by sinking the fact of his purchase of the property from them, and the terms of the purchase, he had contrived to subject them, instead of himself, to <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>demand ; and, by calling on her, in their names, for specific execution of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract, had, in effect, made a purchase of her moiety from her, which <em>they </em>never made. And that <em>Rogers </em>now insisted, that, though he had enjoyed the whole profits of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>property since May 1815, when he received possession, yet he was only bound by his contract with <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>to pay <em>them </em>the principal sum of 6750 dollars for <em>Miss Young's </em>moiety, and <em>they </em>were bound to pay <em>Miss ^oung </em>that sum and <em>all the interest </em>which had accrued ^lereon\u2019 and which the chancellor had directed <em>them </em>to pay her; whereas, they insisted, if <em>Miss Young </em>was entitled to demand interest from the <em>purchasers </em>(which, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, they denied) <em>Rogers </em>was the person bound to pay it. Therefore, they prayed the court to suspend and inhibit, by injunction, all proceedings on the decree in the other suit, prosecuted in their names by <em>Rogers, </em>against <em>Blythe's </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young; </em>and to declare and decree, that, as <em>Rogers </em>was the real plaintiff in that cause, and was the only person justly bound to pay the purchase money to <em>Miss Young </em>for her moiety, and whatever interest was justly due thereon, he and not <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>should pay the same to her; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-4\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\"><em>Miss Young </em>answered, that she had consented to ratify <em>Blythe's </em>contract of September 1813, for the sale of her moiety of the lands, only upon condition, that the purchase money thereof should be paid to her, with interest from the time stipulated by the contract; and that she would part with her property on no other terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-6\"><em>Blythe's </em>representatives, in their answer, insisted,' that they had a right to the money which had been paid <em>Stribling </em>for <em>Blythe's </em>moiety, whatever might be the result of the controversy as to the other part of the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-7\"><em>Rogers, </em>in his answer, insisted, that he had a right, by the terms of the contract of May 1815, between him and <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>to prosecute the suit, in their names, against <em>Blythe's </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>for a specific execution of <em>Blythe's </em>contract of September 1813, according to the terms of that contract. That whatever duty a specific execution thereof would impose on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, they </em>were bound to perform it: if <em>Miss Young </em>was entitled to interest on the purchase money of her moiety, they were bound to pay it; for, by their contract with <em>Blythe, </em>they had stipulated to pay the interest as well as the principal of the purchase money for <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, when the title thereof should be conveyed to them, after her attainment to full age. And that he, <em>Rogers, </em>by his contract of May 1815, was only bound to pay <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>the principal sum of 6750 dollars, when they should procure and convey to him <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety. He admitted, that he had been in possession of the whole of the lands, enjoying the whole profits, from May 1815, the date of his purchase; but he insisted, that he was not bound on that account, any more than by his contract, to pay interest; for the uncertainty of the title had rendered it impossible to improve the property without gross imprudence, and so had in a great measure disappointed him of the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-4\">The chancellor, upon the motion of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>dissolved the injunction, which had been awarded to <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>in this suit, to suspend and inhibit the execution of the decree in the other suit. And from this decree <em>Brockenbrough </em>and, <em>Taylor </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-11\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Wickham </em>and <em>Leigh for </em>the appellants, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellee <em>Rogers, </em>and by <em>Stanard </em>for <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-12\">I. The counsel for the appellants examined the contract between them and <em>Rogers </em>of May 1815, and insisted, that the just construction and effect of that contract, was, that <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>should sell <em>Rogers </em>the moiety they had bought of <em>Blythe, </em>of which they had acquired the legal title, for 12,750 dollars; and that they should endeavour to get in the title to <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, within the ensuing year; if they should succeed in getting the title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that moiety within the year, they should sell and' convey that als0 to <em>Rogers, </em>for 6750 dollars; if they should fail to get \u00a1a <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title within the year, their contract with <em>Rogers, </em>in respect of her moiety, should be at an end; and sh\u00b0u^ pay them the stipulated price for <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>moiety, 12,750 dollars, only. If they should fail to get in <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title within the year, and if, in consequence of such failure, their contract to sell <em>Rogers </em>her moiety should be at an end, they, indeed, authorized <em>Rogers </em>to institute proceedings against <em>Blythe, </em>in their names, but for his own benefit, not for their\u2019s; and, as <em>he </em>was to have all the benefit, <em>they </em>were not to incur any reciprocal duty or obligation which might result from the benefit that <em>Rogers </em>should derive from such proceedings. They had a right to call upon <em>Blythe, </em>for a specific execution of <em>his </em>contract to procure a conveyance of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, or to give them good and sufficient security that a conveyance thereof should be made when Miss <em>Young </em>attained to full age, or for damages for his breach of the contract in that particular; and this was the right which they authorized <em>Rogers </em>to assert against <em>Blythe, in their names. </em>But they had no claim whatever against <em>Miss Young; </em>and, therefore, did not pretend to authorize <em>Rogers </em>to assert any claim, in their names, against <em>her. </em>They had no right to call upon <em>Miss Young </em>for a specific execution of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract to sell them her land; and, by consequence, she had no right to call upon them, for a specific execution of their contract with <em>Blythe </em>to purchase it; for there should be no specific execution, where the remedies are not mutual; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Kinney, ante, </em>272. <em>Rogers, </em>by exhibiting the bill against <em>Miss Young, </em>asking of <em>her </em>specific execution of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract for the sale of her property, in truth, proposed and made a bargain with her, for himself. And, as he exhibited the bill, in the names of <em>Brockenhrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>without their knowledge, and without any manner of authority from them, <em>Miss Young </em>had no right to hold, them to a specific execution of their contract with <em>Blythe </em>for the purchase of her moiety, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>cause <em>Rogers, </em>in their names, thought proper to propose specific execution. That bill of <em>Rogers </em>ought to be considered as <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>bill, to all intents and purposes; not <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor\u2019s, </em>to any purpose whatever. As <em>they </em>had no claim against <em>Miss Young, </em>and <em>she </em>had none against <em>them, Rogers </em>could not give <em>her </em>a claim against <em>them, </em>by asserting a claim in their names against her. The only right she had, was, to demand her property from the person who held it, and the profits of it from him who had received them. She had no claim to purchase money for her property, and interest upon it; because she had never sold it. But if <em>Rogers </em>thought proper, in order to keep the property, and to exempt himself from an account for profits, to propose to take the land upon the terms of <em>Blythe\u2019s. </em>contract with <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>as he did by his bill (for it was <em>his </em>bill), and she thought proper to assent to those terms, <em>Rogers, </em>and he alone, was bound to pay her the purchase money. If <em>Rogers </em>had exhibited his bill against <em>Blythe?s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>in his own name, instead of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor\u2019s ; </em>or, if in the bill he exhibited in their names, he had disclosed the fact and the terms of his purchase from <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor; </em>and, in either case, had asked specific execution, for his own benefit; the chancellor should, in that suit, have imposed on <em>him </em>all the duties which resulted from a decree of specific execution at the instance of the purchaser, and ought to have imposed no duty whatever on <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor: </em>and therefore, when the truth was disclosed in this suit, he ought to have so corrected the decree in the other suit, as to exonerate them from the performance of any duty, and to impose on <em>Rogers, </em>who alone ought to bear it, the whole duty to be performed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b655-4\">The counsel for <em>Rogers </em>argued, that the just construction and effect of the contract between him and <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>was,\u2014that they sold him the <em>whole </em>of the lands in question; the moiety which had belonged to <em>Blythe, </em>and of which they had acquired the legal title, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>12,750 dollars, and that which belonged to <em>Miss Young, </em>and which <em>Blythe </em>sold them, and bound himself to have conveyed to them, for 6750 dollars: that <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were to get in the title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety ^ ^ey could, and then to convey it to <em>Rogers </em>for the stipuJated price; if they could not get it in, within the year, they authorized <em>Rogers </em>to institute proceedings in their names against <em>Blythe, </em>for his own benefit; and if by such proceedings he could get in the title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, no matter when he should succeed in getting it in, he was to pay <em>them </em>6750 dollars for it: that the authority to institute proceedings in their names, against <em>Blythe, </em>was an authority to exhibit a bill against him for a specific execution of his contract with them for the sale and conveyance of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety; and as <em>Miss Young </em>was a proper and necessary party to such a bill, it was an authority to exhibit a bill, in their names, against <em>her </em>as well as <em>Blythe: </em>that the limitation of a year from the date of the contract, was the limitation of the term at which <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>duty to make endeavours to get in <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title, was to cease, and <em>Rogers\u2019s </em>right to institute proceedings to. get it in, to commence; not the appointment of a time, at which, if <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title was not previously procured, the contract with respect to the sale of her moiety by <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>was to be at an end; and that, therefore, the suit which <em>Rogers </em>had brought, in the names of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>against <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>was authorized by their contract with him; he had a right to demand specific execution of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>in their names; they were bound to perform the duty which the vendors had a right to demand of them as purchasers asking specific execution, according to their own contract; and <em>Rogers </em>was only bound to perform what he had covenanted to perform as a purchaser from them, namely, to pay them the principal sum of 6750 dollars, according to his contract with them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>II. The counsel for the appellants, and for <em>Rogers, </em>contended, that, though <em>.Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>had held the possession from September 1813 to May 1815, and <em>Rogers </em>had held the possession ever since, yet <em>Miss Young </em>was not entitled as against thorn, because <em>Blythe </em>would not have been entitled to interest on the purchase money of her moiety. They thought, that the english doctrines on this subject, however equitable <em>there, </em>could not be applied in <em>this country, </em>without producing the greatest hardship and injustice ; since <em>here, </em>the rents of real estate, rarely if ever, equalled the interest of the purchase money; the rents of unimproved lands were almost nothing; and any uncertainty in the title, was a bar to all permanent improvements, without which no profit could be derived from them. The present case was very peculiarly circumstanced. <em>Blythe, </em>being tenant in common with <em>Miss Young, </em>contracted to sell and convey, not only his own moiety, but a good title in her moiety also, or to give good and sufficient security that it should be conveyed, when she should attain to full ago. He did neither. It was impossible for the purchasers to improve the property, with any safety to themselves, so long as they had no conveyance of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, nor any security that a conveyance would ever be made. Yet it was agreed on all hands, that the value of the property, its capacity to yield profits, depended, chiefly, on improving it as a watering place: this was stated in the petition to the legislature presented by <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>friends in 1815-16, and assigned as the reason why authority should be given to her guardian to sell her interest in it. The purchasers were thus prevented from persisting in the improvements necessary to render the property profitable, and so deprived of the chief benefit of their purchase, during the ten years of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>minority. <em>Their </em>duty to pay interest on the purchase money could only arise from the full enjoyment of the profits. Indeed, <em>Miss Young </em>ought not to be considered as having been, at any time, out of possession of her moiety of the land ; for the purchasers being entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>by purchase from <em>Blythe </em>to his undivided moiety, were tenants in common with <em>Miss Young; </em>their possession was that of tenants in common, and no wise adverse to her\u2019s; and as to her moiety, they ought not to be regarded as ven(^ees 'n possession. But if any body ought to be charged w\u2019t^ interest on the purchase of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, it was <em>Blythe. </em>For he contracted to sell <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, and to convey the title, or to give good security for the conveyance of it; and by his breach of his contract in that respect, he, in effect, put it out of the power of the vendees to improve the property to the degree of which it was susceptible, and to enjoy the full profits of it. At any rate, <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>estate should be responsible to the purchasers, for so much as the amount of the interest may have <em>exceeded </em>the actual profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\">The counsel for <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>adverting to the contract between <em>Blythe </em>and <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>of September 1813, said, it was obvious, that <em>Blythe </em>sold the <em>whole </em>of the lands, <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety as well as his own ; that the purchase money of her moiety was to be paid in instalments with interest; and that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>covenant was, that until he should convey <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, or give security that it should be conveyed when she should attain to full age, <em>the </em>purchasers should retain the purchase money. If he had given the security, he would have been entitled to demand the instalments, as they fell due; as he did not do so, they had a right to retain the purchase money; which was their security, and security exactly adequate. Meantime, he put the vendees in full possession of the <em>whole </em>lands. It could hardly be doubted, that if on <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>attainment to full age, <em>Blythe </em>had purchased her title of her, and tendered it to the vendees, he'would have a right to claim specific execution of them; and her ratification of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract, upon condition that she should receive the benefit of it, and the conveyance of her interest directly to the vendees, came to the same thing as if she had conveyed to <em>Blythe, </em>to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>him to perform the contract, and he had tendered a conveyance to the vendees, and claimed specific execution. That <em>Blythe, </em>and, by consequence, <em>Miss Young </em>ratifying his contract, was entitled to interest on the purchase money of her moiety, resulted from the express terms of the contract of September 3 813, and from <em>the best </em>settled priueipies of law. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Martyr, </em>8 Ves. 146. <em>Fludyer </em>v. <em>Cocker, </em>12 Ves. 25. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Kearney, </em>1 Scho. Lef. 132, 4. <em>Burnell </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 168. <em>Selden </em>v. <em>James, </em>6 Rand. 465. Therefore, as between Brocken<em>brough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>and <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>the chancellor\u2019s decree in the first suit was perfectly right. The vendor had no concern in the controversy between his vendees, <em>Broekenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>and their vendee <em>Rogers; </em>and a decree just with respect to them, ought not to be suspended till their controversy with <em>Rogers </em>should be determined. And, in fact, there was no decree directing <em>Broekenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to pay any money; the decree was, that if they should not pay the money, the lands should be sold ; so that the decree, in its direct operation, affected only <em>Rogers, </em>who held the subject, and they had no right to complain of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-8\">III. <em>Johnson </em>objected, that it did not appear that the vendors, especially <em>Miss Young, </em>had any good title in the lands, which a purchaser should be bound to accept; and as to the parcel called <em>Greenwoods, </em>the title appeared defective or doubtful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-9\"><em>Stanard </em>answered, that there never had been any objection made to the title, by the pleadings or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-10\">IV. It was objected to the decree in the first suit, that it authorized and directed the sale of the <em>whole </em>of the lands, to pay the purchase money of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety thereof: that her own moiety only ought to be held subject to her claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>It was answered, that <em>Blythe's </em>contract was one and in-tire, to sell the <em>whole </em>of the lands ; and that he had a lien on the whole of them for the purchase money of each and every part.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AeT\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Al6\">In the examination of this case, as between <em>Blythe </em>and his vendees, <em>Broclcenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>I shall put out of view their contract with <em>Rogers, </em>and shall consider it, as if they had continued to hold the lands, and had exhibited the bill in the first suit, and prosecuted it to a decree : I shall so consider the case, in order to simplify it, and because it can do no injustice to <em>Broclcenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor; </em>since their contract with <em>Rogers </em>could no wise vary <em>Blythe's </em>rights; and, as to him, <em>they </em>must be considered as having exhibited the bill that was filed in th.eir names, and as having prosecuted that suit. From the date of <em>Blythe's </em>sale, in September 1813, he took no step to perform his contract in respect of <em>Miss Young's </em>moiety; made no conveyance thereof to the vendees, with warranty; gave no security that her title should be conveyed when she should attain her full age. The <em>subpoena </em>against him was sued out in July 1815. The bill was filed in 1819. It made <em>Blythe's </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young </em>parties defendants: it contained an earnest call for a specific execution of <em>Blythe's </em>contract, as to <em>Miss Young's </em>moiety; and it was only in case <em>Blythe </em>should be unable to execute it specifically, that it asked damages for his breach of contract. <em>Miss Young </em>came of age in 1823, and put in her answer in 1824; in which, while she denied her obligation to do so, she consented to convey her title, upon receiving the purchase money with interest, which by the contract of September 1813, was to be paid to <em>Blythe; </em>and she filed a conveyance in court, to be delivered to the vendees, upon their paying the purchase money with interest. The chancellor\u2019s interlocutory decree in that suit, pronounced in July 1825, was a decree for specific execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The principal objection to that decree, was, that interest; , , \u2022 t.7 7 / . . . . , . . was thereby given <em>to Blythe </em>(or, which is the same thing in effect, to <em>Miss Young,) </em>from the dates from which the instalments were to bear interest by the contract of September 1813, though <em>Blythe </em>had made no conveyance of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety with warranty, nor given security that the title should be conveyed, nor procured <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title till 1824, but had in these particulars, broken his contract, to the serious injury of the vendees. It is true that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>contract binds him to make a deed to the vendees, with general warranty, for <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>part of the land : but it names no time for doing this. It was well known, that the title was in her, and that she was an infant: it could not be the meaning of the parties, that <em>Blythe </em>should make the deed before he got the title; this was not the security the parties contemplated; that was, to hold the purchase money until the deed should be made, or until <em>Blythe </em>should give sufficient security for a good title, when <em>Miss Young </em>attained her age. The vendees took possession of the property under the contract, and have never been disturbed in it. They say, indeed, that they have suffered damages, by being prevented by the uncertainty of the title, from making the various improvements necessary for a watering place, and reaping the golden harvest, which would have followed: but we have no evidence upon this point; and these speculative damages are the most difficult of all things to be estimated. Perhaps, they might have made thousands; perhaps, they might have sunk every thing. But this is certain, they have had possession of more than 900 acres of land; some of it among the most fertile I have ever seen. The record tells us, this land adjoined the <em>Sweet Springs, </em>a long established watering place; which, we may fairly presume, would furnish a ready market for the products of the soil. Be all this as it may, the vendees have not brought an action for damages: they have filed their bill for a specific execution, praying that the title, if it can possibly be had, may be decreed to them; and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>is only in case they cannot get this, that damages are asked for. This suit they prosecute in such a lingering way, as not to bring it to hearing till 1824; waiting (it would seem) till <em>Miss Young </em>(whom, without legal or equitable cla*m uPon her, they had made a party) should come of age. She attained her age in the latter part of 1823, and before the hearing, her answer is filed agreeing to ratify the contract, and tendering a deed, to be delivered, on receiving her purchase money and interest. To this deed there is no exception taken, no reference asked as to title : and the question is, was the chancellor wrong, under these circumstances, to decree interest on the purchase money ? It is most clear, that against <em>Miss Young, </em>he could make no decree, except such as she assented to; and the plaintiffs knowing this, and still making her a party, and praying for her title, must be considered, as consenting to take it, on such terms as she should prescribe. But independently of all this, it is the settled rule, that a vendee, in possession of both land and purchase money, coming for a specific execution, shall pay interest, even though the vendor has been in default, unless he has not only kept the purchase money idle, but has given the vendee notice that it was so. I think the rule a sound one, and applicable to this case. There was no error then in decreeing interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">But it was objected, that the decree directs the sale of the <em>whole </em>of the land, unless the purchase money should be paid within a given time. This objection would seem to come with a bad grace from vendees, who have insisted on the specific execution of the cpntract. They could only expect to get the title which they have prayed for on paying for it. The purchase money was a lien upon the whole land.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Thus I am of opinion, that, as this case appeared upon the record in the first suit before the chancellor, his decree was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">But, before the institution of that suit, other circumstances had occurred, other transactions had taken place; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>and these have been made the subject of the new bill filed by <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>seeking to suspend the decree in the first suit, and, so far as it affects them, to set it aside. And we are now to consider the case in this new aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In this bill of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and Taylor,\u2014after setting forth their contract with <em>Rogers </em>of May 1815, and the proceedings and decree in the first suit, and alleging that that suit was brought and prosecuted by <em>Rogers, </em>in their names, without their knowledge or consent,\u2014-they charge <em>Rogers </em>with misconduct in several respects : 1. in bringing the suit in their names alone, concealing from the court every trace of his contract with them, his possession of the property, and enjoyment of all its profits, making himself no party, and so stating the case, as to make them appear still the owners and possessors of the property: <em>2. </em>in making <em>Miss Young </em>a party, against whom they pretended no claim whatever: and 3. in procuring a decree for her title, and putting upon them the burden of paying the purchase money of her moiety with interest, whereas <em>Rogers </em>was the person bound to pay both, and the person against whom the court would have decreed such payment, if he had made himself a party and fairly stated the whole case. Therefore, they prayed, that the decree in the first suit should be set aside, so far as it affected them, and that the execution thereof should be suspended and inhibited by injunction. The injunction was awarded; but the chancellor afterwards dissolved it; and it is from this order of dissolution in this cause, that the appeal was taken to this court. Was the injunction properly dissolved ?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">It was said that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young, </em>who are in pursuit of the money justly due to them, ought not to be delayed by the disputes between the plaintiffs and <em>Rogers. </em>But it must be remembered, that those parties have ample security, and are getting interest on their money. We must remember, too, that \u201cthe constant aim of a court of equity, is, to do complete justice, by deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>upon and settling the rights of all persons interested in the subject of the suit to make the performance of the order perfectly safe to those who are compelled to obey it, and to prevent future litigation:\u201d Mitf. Plead. 144. And we may well say with this court, in <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Tidball, </em>Gilm. 133. that, <em>\u201c </em>compared with these objects, a little delay is deemed of no account, in a court of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">It was said also, that the original decree did not touch <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>and that therefore the dissolution could not hurt them. I cannot assent to this position : I think the decree does touch them, and very nearly too. The decree, to be sure, does not say, in so many words, that they shall pay the purchase money : but it says, that.upon their paying the purchase money with interest, the title deeds shall be delivered to them, and that, unless they pay it by a certain day, their lands (as the chancellor supposed them) shall be sold. Is not this, in substance, a decree against them for the money? Suppose the marshal sold these lands for half the purchase money due; upon the confirmation of his report, would not an execution issue at once against <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>? I doubt, whether even an order of the court would be necessary; but if so, it would be an order merely in execution of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">But I place this point upon broader ground: I think <em>Rogers </em>was clearly wrong in bringing this suit in the name of <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>solely, and concealing from the court his purchase of the land, and possession under it. I think this omission has operated injuriously to them; and that they had a right, by such a bill as they have filed, to have it reheard and corrected; and this without waiting till an execution had issued against them. I have already stated that the great object of equity is, to settle the rights of all persons interested, and cut up future litigation. Another ground of rehearing laid down in the books, is, where any facts materially affecting the case have been kept back. Suppose iJog-ershad made hirnself a joint plaintiff with <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>or made himself plaintiff, and them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>and the other parties defendants; had stated his own contract, and Ins possession under it; and had prayed a specific execution: what ought to have been the decree of the court? Clearly, I think, that <em>Rogers </em>should pay the 6750 dollars of purchase money due, with interest; that upon such payment, <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>conveyance should be delivered to him ; that upon <em>his </em>failure to make such payment by a given day, the land should be sold to raise the purchase money; and that, if that did not bring the amount, <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>should be personally liable to the vendors. Can it be doubted, that such a decree against <em>Rogers </em>would be correct ? I cannot imagine' the ground of such a doubt. He had bought of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>the moiety of the land to which they had the legal right; and as to the other half, he had bought their rights, their contract; and on the terms of paying the same sum, which they were to pay on getting a title : he had enjoyed possession under the contract, and now came into equity for the title.: must he not pay the purchase money with interest? When he was asking the execution of one part of the contract, must he not execute the other part, which he had taken upon himself? This seems to me the clearest equity in the world. All the remarks which I made on this part of the subject, as between <em>Blythe </em>and <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>apply emphatically to Rogers\u2014because, instead of pursuing <em>Blythe </em>for damages, he has gone out of his way, and out of the power <em>given him by Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>in making <em>Miss Young </em>a party, and praying for her title; as there was no obligation whatever on her, she had a right to make her own terms; and, surely, <em>Rogers </em>had no right to throw any part of this burden off his own shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">It was objected, that there was not a perfect title to the lands. The answer given was a very satisfactory one; that there was not the slightest objection to the title in the hill, or any of the pleadings; that the parties had not put it in issue, and could not now raise the objection. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Miss Young </em>and the representatives of <em>Blythe </em>filed their or <em>j </em>answers, setting out their titles, and tendering their deeds; if <em>Rogers </em>had doubted on the subject, he might have asked a reference of the title; and before the master, it might have ^een s^ewn\u00bb that the defects now imagined, did not exist. the evidence might have been furnished there in a moment, which not being required, may not appear in this record. The chancellor expressly predicates his decree upon the fact, that no exception was taken to the deeds filed. Nay more, <em>Rogers </em>in his answer to <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>bill (an answer filed after a full disclosure of the title) makes no objection to the title, nor to any thing else, except the payment of <em>interest on </em>the purchase money. That, in truth, is the only point in difference between him and <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor. </em>Surely, we ought to suffer parties to judge for themselves, and say with what titles they will be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-20\">I am therefore of opinion, that the order dissolving the injunction was erroneous, and that it ought to be reversed, the injunction reinstated, and the cause remanded, to be proceeded in according to the principles now declared.</p>\n<author id=\"b666-21\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARr\">I am of the same opinion. If we were now deciding this case as on an appeal from the interlocutory decree of July 1825, in the first suit of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>against <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young; </em>or, in other words, if we are to be intirely uninfluenced by a regard to the contract between <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Rogers; </em>it would be perfectly clear, that that decree must be affirmed. For it would be nothing more than the common case of a vendee of land coming into a court of equity for specific execution of the contract; praying a conveyance of the land, on the terms of paying the purchase money. In that aspect of the case, <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>cannot complain: they get the title which they ask, and with which they are satisfied, and they are directed to pay no more than the balance of the purchase money which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>is confessedly due, with interest from the time indicated by <em>J </em>their contract. And, if we could suppose <em>Brockenbrougli </em>and <em>Taylor to </em>be out of the case, and that in the original suit, <em>Rogers, </em>as the sub-vendee of <em>Brockenbrougli </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>was the nominal plaintiff on the record, as he was the real plaintiff in fact, the decree of July 1825 would be equally free from objection; for he would stand in their shoes, and could object to no decree which would be proper as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">Has any thing been exhibited in the injunction case, calculated to shew, that the decree of July 1825 is in any respect wrong, so far as it may affect <em>Rogers </em>? I think not. It does not appear from his answer to the bill, that he has any objection whatever to the decree, either as to the title of the land, or as to the balance of the principal due from him, for the purchase money. He seems to be perfectly satisfied with the decree, provided he is not made to pay interest on that balance. An exemption from interest, is claimed, on the ground, that the land owed its principal value to its mineral waters, which could not be rendered valuable without expensive improvements; and that these improvements could not be safely made so long as the title was in a state of uncertainty. But this objection seems to be the effect of an after thought. It certainly had no influence with <em>Brockenbrougli </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>during their occupation of the land; for they say, they expended large sums in improvements. Nor does <em>Rogers </em>pretend, that it had any influence with him, between the years 1815 and 1818. He does however say, that after that, he in a measure abandoned the land, in consequence of the uncertainty of the title. If this be so, why did he not communicate the fact to <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives, and file a bill for the rescission of the contract, instead of a bill for specific execution ? If he had then filed a bill for rescinding the contract, there is very little doubt but that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives would have acceded to his wishes. He must submit to the consequences of his own acts. He made no complaint; he made no offer to rescind the contract; he retained possession of the land, preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>a bill for specific execution of the contract, andabas now ^ got all that he asked by that bill; a title with which' he is satisfied. Under such circumstances, it would be without precedent and contrary to equity, that he should not pay the Pechase money with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"ACJp\">But <em>Rogers </em>was not a party on the record in the first suit; and, consequently, the decree, so far as it relates to the payment of the purchase money, does not operate on him, the real plaintiff, but on <em>Brockenhrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>the nominal parties. When, therefore, it appeared from the bill in the second suit, that <em>Rogers </em>was the real party in interest, the chancellor ought to have reheard the original suit, so as to make the decree for the purchase money and interest fall exclusively on him; unless, indeed, he should be unable to pay it.</p>\n<author id=\"b668-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ArFx\">I am clearly of opinion, that interest upon the purchase money of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>undivided moiety of the estate ought to be paid. To this conclusion I am equally led, in whatever aspect I view the transactions between the parties. . If we look upon her acquiescence in the contract upon the terms of receiving the principal and interest, as of the nature of a <em>new contract, </em>then it is obvious, that <em>she </em>must be entitled to receive <em>that </em>interest, upon which she insists as an indispensable part of the consideration of her conveyance. Whether <em>Blythe </em>ought to be charged with it to the exoneration of the appellants and of <em>Rogers, </em>will best appear by the examination I propose of the conduct and obligations of <em>Blythe. </em>Whether <em>Rogers </em>or the appellants ought to bear the burden, will appear hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Looking upon <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>acquiescence in the contract, not as a new contract, but as confirming and carrying the contract of <em>Blythe </em>into execution, how does the case stand ? Taking the .contract of September 1813, as one made by <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>authorized agent (for though <em>Stribling\u2019s </em>authority was questioned, yet all parties have united in waiving that question) what was <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>engagement as to that portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the estate which belonged to <em>Miss </em>Young? \u201cFor her undivided two-fourths,\u201d it is provided \u201c that <em>Blythe </em>should make to <em>Brockenbrovgh </em>and <em>Taylor </em>a good and sufficient deed with general warranty.55 And for the security of <em>the </em>purchasers, it is also provided, \u201cthat nono of the deferred payments\u201d [which, without doubt, was regarded as the price or consideration of <em>her </em>interest] \u201c shall be demanded, until he shall either make a deed, or give good security that a good title will be made when <em>Miss Young </em>shall come of age.\u201d Here then, the fact that he had not tide <em>to Miss Young\u2019s </em>portion is disclosed; tho fact that she was an infant is avowed, and the means of security for the purchasers is provided. Those means are, either the retention of the purchase money, the execution of a deed with general warranty, or the giving of good security that a good title would be made when <em>Miss Young </em>should come of age. Here are clearly <em>three distinct </em>modes of indemnity, of which Blythe, by the frame of the instrument, clearly had the option. He was not bound by its terms to do which <em>they </em>pleased. He was inlirely at liberty to do which <em>he </em>pleased. If he chose to give security, or to execute a deed with warranty, he would then have been entitled to receive the purchase money: but if he chose to waive the receipt of the purchase money, he was at liberty \u00edo do so, and then it was unnecessary to give the security, or to execute the deed. It could not be a reasonable interpretation of the contract, that he should leave the money in their hands, and give the security also. The money was the best security, and the amount was precisely that which they would have recovered back, had he gone on to receive it. For, having only engaged for the title of a third person, the measure of damages, if he failed to get it in, would bo the purchase money of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Blythe, then, did not break his contract by failing to give security or to execute a deed with warranty. Has he failed to comply with it since ? ! think Until that date. at age in 1833 not. <em>Miss Young </em>arrived ho was not hound \u00edo pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>cure her title, though he united in the effort to effect that object <em>by </em>petition tp the legislature. Within a very reasonable time after her maturity, his representatives did procure , . , her acquiescence, and she executed a conveyance accord-\u2018ngbr- There has been a more than customary punctuality an&lt;^ Prec*s'on in the fulfilment of his engagements, and Rogers, the vendee of the appellants, is now in full enjoyment of the whole title. I say nothing of the minor objections to the obscurity of part of the title, since if <em>Rogers </em>had had any doubt about it, the matter should have been distinctly brought before the court by a reference of the title, or otherwise. The failure to do this, must be taken as a proof of <em>Rogeis\u2019s </em>consciousness, that there was no material difficulty or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">In the short view of the transactions which I have taken, it appears, then, that <em>Blythe </em>and his representatives have been in no default. He has procured the title of <em>Miss Young, </em>within a reasonable time. How that title was procured, how her acquiescence was obtained, is matter of no concern to the vendees. He did not represent himself as the owner. He fairly represented a minor as the owner, and engaged for her executing a title when the legal impediment of infancy should be removed. That engagement has been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"AEWt\">Then, how does the question stand as to interest? The record presents the case of a vendor, who has delivered possession of the premises to the purchaser, which he has continued to enjoy without molestation; of a vendor, who has also faithfully complied with his engagement, that a good title should be made upon the happening of a particular event; until which event, he has left the purchase money in the hands of the vendee, as his security; and that vendee has thus, for more than eighteen years, by himself or his vendee, received the rents and profits, and held the purchase money also. Is there any principle of law or equity, which can justify us in saying he shall keep both ? Shall the purchaser for so long a period receive the profits, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>he is enjoying the interest of the purchase money?\u2014for it would be wilful blindness to the ordinary course of transactions, to suppose, that this money has lain idle. If raised at all, it has been put to interest beyond question; if not raised, the interest has been saved to the party, which amounts to the same thing: for, in either event, he would have enjoyed the vendor\u2019s estate for eighteen years for nothing. The injustice of such a proceeding has long since given rise to the rule, that, as to interest and profits, the vendor is to be considered the owner of the money and entitled to the interest, while the vendee is regarded as the owner of the land and entitled to the profits. But he cannot have both. The principle is too familiar to require more than a reference to the cases which were cited at the bar. They establish, beyond question, <em>the general </em>rule, that where the purchaser is let into the possession, and the perception of the rents and profits of the purchased estates, he must pay interest for his purchase money; and if the rule be not universal, the party who claims an exemption from its operation, must bring himself within some established exception. This has been attempted, in the argument of the case; but it has moreover been contended that the english rule is too rigorous for our country.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">That rents and profits ordinarily bear but a small proportion to the interest of purchase money, cannot be denied. This is very strikingly the case in <em>Virginia. </em>Hence, where there has been a sale and delivery of possession, and the contract has been disaffirmed, there can be no propriety in the application of the rule. Accordingly it never has been so applied. But where a man purchases land, he has made up his mind to give his money, which would produce a good interest, for land, which will produce much less. Thus, in the present case: had the title been made, and the money paid, the purchaser must have been content with the scanty rents, while the seller would have been receiving full interest. Now, since a court of equity looks upon the sale, as complete so soon as the parties have contracted, it is, <em>quoad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>this matter, the same thing as if a conveyance had been actually made 3 provided the vendee has had actual possession, and uninterrupted enjoyment, and there are no particular circumstances to take the case out of the general rule. \u2022^\u2019rom the moment of the contract, the buyer is the owner ^an(^\u2019 and must rest satisfied with his rents 3 and the seller is the owner of the money, and is entitled to his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">But it is said in this case, there were objections to the title which prevented the vendees from proceeding to improve the property, so as to render it profitable. To this there are many answers: 1. The difficulty in the title was one contemplated at the very inception of the transaction, and yet it was not provided that interest should not be paid. 2. If there <em>were </em>objections to the title, Blythe, I have shewn, was in no default. 3. The vendees have always had ample indemnity in their power 3 for they have not only retained the purchase money of the portion of which the title was doubtful, but they have also attached the whole purchase money of the residue, for the purpose of securing themselves. Had the title ultimately failed, they would have had, at this day, the 6750 dollars in <em>Strihling\u2019s </em>hands, with the accumulated interest of eighteen years, to indemnify them for their improvements 5 or, if the whole contract had been rescinded, so that this sum would have become their\u2019s again, then the <em>land </em>would have <em>become </em>Blythe\u2019s, and <em>that </em>would have become liable. I cannot, therefore, but consider this as a pretext on the part of <em>Rogers, </em>who seems to have made no progress in improving 3 and as to <em>Broclcenhrough </em>and Taylor, they were obviously not arrested in <em>their </em>measures, as in less than two years they had laid out 4500 dollars. Upon the whole, I am satisfied, that <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives, or (which amounts to the same thing) <em>Miss Young </em>is entitled to interest as decreed by the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We come next <em>to </em>Inquire who must pay it. Shall the burden fall on <em>BrocJcenhrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>or on <em>Rogers </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>By their contract with <em>Rogers </em>of May 1815, <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>recited thoir contract with <em>Blythe, </em>and thus distinctly announced, that their title was imperfect as to <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety; with respect to which, it was also provided, that they were to use their best endeavours to procure the legal title, to ho conveyed to <em>Rogers; </em>and if tho legal title could be obtained, <em>Rogers </em>was then to pay <em>them </em>6750 dollars ; but, if a legal title could not be procured <em>by them </em>within one year from the date of that agreement, <em>Rogers was then to be at liberty, </em>in <em>their name </em>or his own, to institute any legal proceedings against tho said <em>Blythe, for his own benefit and </em>advantage.; it being understood, that in the event of <em>their </em>not procuring the legal title to more than <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>moiety, <em>Rogers </em>was to pay for that moiety <em>only. </em>It was also provided, that, as it might be necessary to attach the money in <em>Stribling\u2019s </em>hands to <em>secure performance of the contract </em>by Blythe, or obtain damages for non-performance thereof, it was agreed, that any proceedings might be had for that object, and that they should be for the benefit of the party entitled thereto, according to the purport and intent of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">By these articles, then, as I understand them, <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were bound to use their best endeavours <em>for one year, </em>to procure the legal title of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety, to be conveyed to <em>Rogers; </em>and if they succeeded, they were to receive 6750 dollars: if they did not, then they passed over to <em>Rogers </em>their rights as against <em>Blythe, </em>to be pursued by him in their names, if be pleased, but at bis own risque, and for bis own <em>account; </em>and <em>in this event, they were to receive nothing for Miss Young\u2019s </em>moiety. If no title could be procured eventually, <em>Rogers </em>would have been entitled to any damages he could recover in their names, and they would neither have participated in those damages, nor received any equivalent for them. Or, if he proceeded for the title and recovered it, be would recover Jt <em>l' </em>for his own benefit and advantage,\u201d and for his own account! and, of course, upon his own responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the performance of the contract on the part of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>with <em>Blythe. </em>For it is observable, that although in the event of their procuring the title to be made to him, he was to pay <em>them </em>the 6750 dollars, since <em>they </em>would have to pay it to <em>Blythe ; </em>yet, after the year expired, when he was authorized to sue on the contract for his own benefit and advantage, there is no obligation on him to pay them one cent. He is left to the responsibilities of the contract, which he was authorized to enforce, and charged with its obligations which he was bound to fulfil.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">- Such, I think, is the clear interpretation of this contract. In compliance with it, <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>within the year, issued the attachment against <em>Stribling. </em>I attribute the act to them, because it was their duty to do it <em>by </em>the contract; and the compliance with that duty may be presumed, as the act was a proper one, as the suit is in their names, and there is no testimony going to fix the act on another. They also in further fulfilment of their contract to endeavour to get the legal title for <em>Rogers, </em>made an effort to procure an act of assembly authorizing a sale of <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title. This was the <em>only </em>practicable mode of getting that title, within the year; and when they failed in this, and the year had elapsed, their rights and obligations were both at an end. From that moment, <em>Rogers </em>stood in their shoes, with full title to the benefit of their contract with <em>Blythe, </em>and of course bound by all its provisions. He acted accordingly. In 1819, he procured counsel, and instead of instituting a new suit, grafted his bill upon the proceedings already instituted against <em>Blythe </em>and <em>Stribling. </em>From that moment, the suit was his. It stood, indeed, in the names of <em>Brochenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>but not improperly, as <em>Rogers </em>had a right to use their names. It was for his own benefit and advantage, and under his exclusive management and control. They were not entitled to meddle with it, because they had contracted to permit' him to sue in their names \u201cfor his own benefit;\u201d and he, and not they, was the proper judge of what was so. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the other hand, they were not bound to concern <em>themselves </em>with it, because they had passed over their rights to him <em>pro bono clique </em>malo,\u2014for better, for worse: and had excluded theraselves from any right of interference. Whether, therefore, as it respects <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives, this was the suit of <em>Rogers, </em>or of <em>Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>it was as between those parties, unquestionably the suit of <em>Rogers </em>from the time the bill was fded.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that from the expiration of the year after the date of their contract with <em>Rogers, Brockenbrough </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were cut loose from the transaction, except so far as they might have been liable to <em>Blythe. </em>The chancellor, however, has not decreed against them <em>personally, but only against the land; and I think he </em>has rightly considered the contract as intire, and the whole liable <em>for the </em>purchase money yet due with interest..</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">But although this view of the case would absolve the appellants from any liability except to <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives, in case the whole lands, and <em>Rogers </em>himself, should prove inadequate to the discharge of the purchase money; yet it is by no means a consequence of this opinion, that the chancellor erred in dissolving the injunction, obtained by the appellants to the decree in favor of <em>Blythe\u2019s </em>representatives and <em>Miss Young. </em>This is, in truth, the only question before this court. There is no reason afforded by that bill for longer postponing <em>their </em>recovery of the equivalent for their estates, now for eighteen years in the uninterrupted enjoyment of their vendees, and of the claimant under them. I am clearly of opinion, that the injunction was properly dissolved. Whether the original decree was erroneous or not, we are not entitled to inquire, as it has not been appealed from, and as it is clear, that it was a matter of no concernment to the appellants, if I am right in my view of their rights and responsibilities. That decree, though rendered in a cause in which they were nominal plaintiffs, was not personally against them. It decrees, indeed, a <em>sale of the lands, </em>in the event of the purchase money not being paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>by them: for <em>Rogers </em>was unknown in the case. But it d\u00b0es not decree, that they shall pay it $ and no execution can be taken out against them. Had it done so, then their bill would have been perfectly proper. At present, it acts, *n e\u00aebct, upon <em>Rogers </em>only, by directing a sale of his land. ^\u00a3 *s ProPer 1^3\u00a3 i\u00a3 should do so, and he must pay the purchase money, or submit to a sale; for the decree is rendered in a cause emphatically his own, and over which the appellants had no control; and while they, on the one hand, are not entitled to appeal from the decree, because it does not affect them, and because they have no right to meddle with the cause which was prosecuted in their names by their own assent, he on the other hand, has acquiesced in the decree, by asking no appeal. Therefore, I am of opinion, that the order dissolving the injunction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Acm\">The decree entered by the court, declared, that the interlocutory decree of July 1825 in the first suit, was correct, so far as it decreed the payment of the purchase money to <em>Miss Young, </em>with interest on the instalments thereof from the dates when they were payable, or from which they were to bear interest, by the contract of September 1813, between the appellants and <em>Blythe, </em>and so far also as it subjected the whole of the land to sale, for payment of the purchase money and interest thereon remaining <em>due; </em>and there was no just grounds for a further delay of the sale. That, according to the just construction of the contract of May 1815, between the appellants and <em>Rogers, </em>and considering the possession of the lands taken and held by him,\u2014. <em>Rogers, </em>after the lapse of a year from the date of that contract, and the failure of the appellants to get in <em>Miss Young\u2019s </em>title within the year, was entitled to all their rights under their contract with <em>Blythe, </em>and liable (as between him and them) to all their responsibilities under it, and to all responsibilities that might arise out of any remedy he might select to enforce it. That the suit in which the decree of July 1825 was made, was one that <em>Rogers </em>had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>right to proseeute, and did in fact prosecute, for his own benefit; with which suit the appellants did not, and could not, interfere. That <em>Rogers </em>(as between him and the appellants) was liable to all the responsibilities arising out of the first suit so prosecuted, and was bound to exonerate the appellants from them all. That the purchase money and interest due, ought to be sought for, <em>out of the lands, and from Rogers, </em>before resort should be had to the appellants. That the injunction awarded to the appellants in the second suit, ought to be continued, until resort to them should become necessary, so as to protect them from personal responsibility, but no further; it being the opinion of this court, that the decree of July 1825 in the first suit, ought in no other respect to be longer suspended, unless <em>Rogers </em>should, within a reasonable time, to be appointed by the court of chancery, pay the purchase money and interest thereon due; in which case, the court ought to decree, that the appellants shall convey to <em>Rogers </em>the title conveyed to them by <em>Miss Young. </em>But that this decree, while it expressed the clear opinion of the court, as to the construction of the contract between the appellants and <em>Rogers </em>of May 1815, and on the points now in controversy between them, was not intended to preclude <em>Rogers </em>from any defence, of which it might he in his power to avail himself, by adducing new evidence, or in any proper way giving a new aspect to the case. Therefore, the chancellor\u2019s order dissolving the injunction in the second suit, so far as it conflicted with the principles here declared, was reversed, and the cause was remanded &amp;c. And the court decreed the appellants their costs against <em>Rogers.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
