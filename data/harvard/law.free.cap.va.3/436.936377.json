That the testator was of sound mind at the time. That, <em>after the will was written, </em>the testator was apprehensive he had not secured a slave in the will mentioned, to one of his daughters and her children, and asked the witness if the will could be altered so as to effect that end; the witness told him it could, and altered the will, by erasing a part and inserting the alteration ; but the witness could not say when the alteration was made.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That <em>he </em>wrote <em>Phoebe Maxey\u2019s </em>name as a witness to the will, in her presence; be did not recollect, whether she made her mark or he made it for her; but she was present, and he would not have put her name to the paper, unless she had been present, and in the presence of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">2. <em>Bernard Hendrick </em>testified, that he being at the testator\u2019s house in the spring of the year 1825, <em>one </em>of the <em>wppellees </em>remarked, loud enough to be heard by the testator, \u201c that that was a favourable time to have that will witnessed;\u201d the testator assented; and a paper was produced, which was the will in question. That the witness took it near to the testator, and inquired <em>whether he acknowledged it; </em>the testator said he did; aud the witness subscribed the paper in the testator\u2019s presence.

That the testator told the witness, after-wards, that she must go to court, and testify that it was not his will, and she promised him she would never bear witness in support of it. That the testator said, that when he executed the will he was out of his senses: he always said, that it was not his will, that his wife had won the victory, and that his household was managed \u201c not by whom it should be.\u201d That the witness <em>Pasley, </em>altered the will in the testator\u2019s absence, during the summer after the execution ofi it.

The testimony of the subscribing witness <em>Pasley, </em>is directly contradicted and im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>pugned by that of another subscribing witness, <em>Maxey. </em>It cannot be doubted that the testimony of <em>Pasley </em>is essential to the due proof of this will. Whether a will ought to be established upon the strength of testimony thus contradicted and impugned, is submitted to the court. But even <em>Pasley </em>does not say, that, after he wrote the will, it was read to the testator before it was executed. 2. Supposing credit given to <em>Pasley, </em>there is but a single witness to the will. <em>Hen-, drick </em>does not prove the execution of it as a will of <em>real </em>estate. He says, the testator acknowledged the paper, and he attested in the testator\u2019s presence <em>; </em>but the testator\u2019s signature was put to it by <em>Pasley; </em>and <em>Hendrick </em>does not say, that the testator declared that he had authorized <em>Pasley </em>to sign it for him; nor is it proved, that <em>Pasley </em>signed the testator\u2019s name <em>by his direction and in his presence, </em>as the statute requires, by any evidence but that of <em>Pasley </em>alone. His signing for the testator by his direction and in his presence, is an essential requisite to the due execution; and every fact essential to the due execution of a will of lands, every material requisite of the statute, must be proved by two witnesses. <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>1 Rand. 131. is directly in <em>point </em>to this case. And two witnesses are necessary also, to prove a will of <em>personal </em>estate. <em>Redford's adm'r </em>v. <em>Peggy, </em>6 Rand. 316.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-5\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADqq\">1. The first question is, simply, which shall be believed, <em>Pasley </em>or <em>Maxey </em>? They were examined in open court, both in the county and in the circuit <em>court; </em>and the justices of the county court (who probably knew them), and the judge of the circuit court, concurred in giving credit to <em>Pasley. </em>This court, reviewing the sentence of those courts, upon the <em>written depositions </em>of the witnesses, will, as it always has done in such case, give intire confidence to the concurring opinions of the county and circuit courts. 2. If it were necessary, I should ask the court to reconsider the points decided both in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>and <em>Bedford's adm'r </em>v. <em>Peggy. </em>But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>came before the court on a special verdiet J the court could infer nothing, intend nothing. In this case, the court is sitting as a court of probat; its province is, like a jury, to draw the natural, fair and just inferences of fact from the evidence. The distinction was taken in <em>Smith </em>v. Jones, 6 Rand. 33. and approved in the recent case of <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Vass, ante, 32. </em>This will had been signed for the testator, long before <em>Hendrick </em>attested it; and to <em>Hendrick, </em>the testator acknowledged the will so signed. He thus acknowledged the signature to be his; and no matter when or by whom it was put to the will, the clear inference from the testator\u2019s acknowledgement, was, that it was duly put there. There are, then, two witnesses to the due execution of this will in all respects.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-12\"> What this alteration was, did not distinctly appear. The will in question contained no devise of <em>real estate </em>to any of the testator\u2019s daughters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-4\">Cjvrr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAzf\">This is a question of probat. There is a direct clashing of evidence in two of the subscribing witnesses to the will: both cannot have sworn truly. The county and circuit courts, having these witnesses before them, have given credit to the witness in favour of the will. Taking him to have spoken the truth, I think his evidence, with that of <em>Hendrick, </em>establishes this as a good will of lands. It was said, in the argument, that the point in this case, is decided by <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin; </em>that the distinction taken in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>between a court of probat acting upon evidence, and a court of chancery, acting--on a special verdict found on an issue of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>would not reconcile the cases; and that we must overrule <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, if </em>we sustained the will here. For myself, I must say, I think that case went too far. Yet there is, surely, a sound distinction between a court of probat acting upon <em>evidence, </em>and a court deciding the <em>law </em>upon <em>the facts </em>found by a special verdict. Upon this distinction, the court, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>meant to leave <em>Burwell </em>v; <em>Corbin </em>undisturbed: and I am not disposed, at present, to inquire, whether, on the strict and narrow ground of a special verdict, it may not stand: but, certainly, I can never consent that it shall govern a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>court of probat, in deciding upon evidence. I am for affirm- . ing the sentence.</p>\n<author id=\"b465-7\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZZ\">This is a controversy as to the probat of the will of <em>Gwin </em>Dudley, as a will of lands. It was established by the concurrent sentences of the county and circuit courts of <em>Franklin; </em>and the evidence for and against the will, having been spread upon the record, the case now comes before this court, on an appeal from the sentence of the circuit court, upon that evidence. There are four subscribing witnesses to the will. One was not examined at all. Another, <em>Phmbe Maxey, </em>so <em>far </em>from supporting the will, deposes to facts, which, if true, would invalidate it, and would shew that <em>R. Pasley </em>the first subscribing witness is totally unworthy of credit. This would leave but a single witness in support of the will. But it is manifest that both the courts below disbelieved <em>Maxey, </em>and gave full credit to <em>Pasley. </em>There is nothing in this record sufficient to destroy the credit of either of these witnesses, except it be the testimony of the other. The credibility of witnesses depends on a variety of circumstances, which may be seen and known by those who are present at their viva voce examination, but which cannot be transmitted through their written testimony, to an appellate court. On a mere question of credibility, therefore, when there is nothing in the record to throw light on the subject, this court will always presume, that the inferiour court, that saw and heard the witnesses examined, has decided correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">This will, then, depends on the sufficiency of the testimony of <em>R. Pasley </em>and <em>Hendrick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">I shall first inquire as to the sufficiency of <em>Hendrick's </em>testimony. In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>judge <em>Carr, </em>speaking for the court, draws a distinction between a case where the court is deciding upon a <em>special verdict, </em>as in the' case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>and a case like the present, where the court has to decide, as a court of probat, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>evidence </em>given for or against a will: in the former case, we are limited to the facts as stated; we can deduce no inference from them : in the latter, we may infer every thing from the evidence, that a jury might fairly infer. I sat in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin. </em>It is due to candor to admit, that I did not proceed on any such distinction as that taken in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones. </em>My opinion would not have been different, at that time, had the case stood on a statement of the evidence, and not on a special verdict. But I have had occasion to reconsider, with great attention, the case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>and I have come to the conclusion, that the decision can be justified, only on the ground that it was on a special <em>verdict; </em>and that, even in that aspect of the case, it ought to have been sent back for a more perfect finding of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"Apv\">Proceeding then on the principle, that it is competent to this court, to infer from the evidence, whatever a jury might fairly infer from it, let us see what is proved by the testimony of <em>Hendrick. </em>I will premise, however, that the only requisites to a will of lands, are, that it shall be in writing, and signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction ; and, if not wholly written by the testator, that it shall be attested by two or <em>more </em>credible witnesses, in his presence. But the statute does not prescribe the kind or degree of proof, by which the fact of signing, whether by the testator or some person for him, shall be established. It is not necessary, that the witnesses shall see the signing. Proof of an acknowledgement of the signature by the testator, is as sufficient to prove the signature, as proof by the witnesses that they saw the act of signing. <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>2 Ves. sr. 454. <em>Ellis v. Smith, </em>1 Ves. jr. 11. In-like manner, an acknowledgement, that a writing to which a man\u2019s name is signed, is \u201chis will,\u201d is proof that he <em>signed </em>the will. <em>Westbeech </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>1 Ves. &amp; Beam, 362. Now, the writing in controversy, purports to be the will of <em>Gwin Dudley, </em>and his name is signed to it as the testator; and <em>Hendrick </em>deposes, that this very paper was acknowledged by <em>Dudley, </em>and that he subscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>his name, as a witness, in his presence. It is true, he does not expressly say, that <em>Dudley\u2019s </em>name was or was not signed to the will, at the time it was acknowledged. But it is not usual for men to acknowledge papers, either as deeds or wills, and to call on others to attest them, before they are signed. Such a thing may happen; and when it is proved to have happened, the acknowledgement and attestation will be disregarded. But, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, the acknowledgement and attestation give rise to an irresistible inference, that the instrument had been previously signed. A contrary course would defeat a vast number of deeds and wills; for it may often happen, and frequently does happen, that a witness, not only does not remember to have seen the signature, but he does not remember the acknowledgement or the attestation; but when he sees his name subscribed by himself, as a witness, and knows that he would not have witnessed a blank or unacknowledged paper, he feels no more doubt of the due execution of the paper, than if he distinctly recollected all the circumstances. We must take it, therefore, that this will was signed, when it was acknowledged before the witness <em>Hendrick. </em>That acknowledgement is proof, <em>prima facie, </em>that it was signed by the testator himself. But if the signature was, iu fact, by some other person, then the acknowledgement is a ratification of the signature; and from that ratification we may fairly infer, that the signature was made in his presence, and by his direction. Therefore, I am of opinion, that the testimony of <em>Hendrick </em>is full and ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">As to the testimony of <em>Pasley, </em>he says, that he wrote the will, and signed the testator\u2019s name, in his presence, and at his request, and that he subscribed his name as a witness in the presence of the testator. This testimony was objected to by the counsel for the appellants, because it did not state that the will, after having been written, was read to or by the testator. But I think we may fairly infer from the testimony, as it now7 stands, that the will was written according to instructions given by the testator, and that as it was writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ten in his presence, he was sufficiently acquainted with its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay6y\">I think the sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"As-\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACE\">The case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>(which has been much commented on, and, in my opinion, not correctly understood) was a case of an anomalous character; but the principle decided by it, was, I think, intirely correct. It was an issue of <em>devisavit vel non </em>out of chancery; and, by the acquiescence of the parties, if not by their express consent, the jury which tried it, was permitted to find such evidence as it gave credit to. The verdict was not found as a special verdict; if it had been, it would have been sent back, that the <em>facts </em>and not the <em>evidence </em>of facts, might <em>be </em>found. It,, therefore, left the inquiry as to the validity of . the will, as open as if. the case had stood on an appeal from the sentence of a court of probat. And the case was so treated here, as may be seen by a reference to the opinions of all the judges. The material inquiry in the case, was, whether the <em>factum </em>of signing the will, by the authority of the testator, must be proved by two witnesses under our statute ? In examining the testimony found by the jury on that point, the first question was, whether, one witness having proved the signing of the will by <em>Corbin, </em>at the request of the testator, his acknowledgement to a second witness, who did not see the signing, that the paper produced tvas his will, was proof by two witnesses, that it was signed by <em>Cor-bin, </em>by the testator\u2019s direction, at his request and in his presence. I said, that the question, whether the <em>factum </em>of signing must not be proved by all the witnesses, had been much discussed by the judges in <em>England, </em>from the case of <em>Lemayne </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>down to the case of <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>and (I might have said) to the case of <em>Westbeech </em>v. <em>Kennedy. </em>In <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>lord <em>Hardwiclce </em>calls the acknowledgement of the testator, <em>that it was his signature, </em>proof of the <em>factum </em>of signing by him, in some sense; and explains what he meant, by the example <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>he put of the obligor of a bond acknowledging to the witness that it was <em>his signature. </em>In this case, then, the acknowledgernent by the testator, that the signature was his, was deemed equivalent to proof, that the witness saw him sign the will, as seems to have been before required, and was much stronger evidence of the <em>factum </em>of signing the will by the testator, than the bare acknowledgement by the testator that it was his will. And in <em>Westbeech v. Kennedy, </em>it is very clear, that the bare acknowledgement by the testator, that the writing was his will, was not held to be equivalent to proof of the <em>factum, </em>of signing by the testator. There, two witnesses having proved the will according to the statute, the question turned on the evidence of the third witness, <em>Henry Boys: </em>his testimony may be seen by turning to the case. <em>The </em>testator did more than acknowledge to <em>the </em>witness, that it was his will: he also <em>sealed the will in his presence; </em>which was said by the counsel, sir S. <em>Romilly </em>and <em>Mr. Parker, </em>to be a recognition by the testator of his signature; but it was not said or pretended, that the bare acknowledgement that it was his will, or the publication of it as his will, to the witness, in the absence of the fact that he had sealed it in his presence, was a recognition of his signature. And f have seen no case, in which the bare acknowledgement of the will to a witness, in the absence of all proof that it was signed at the time by the testator, or by some one for him by his direction, was held to be a recognition of his signature, equivalent to proof of the <em>factum </em>of signing by him or some one for him. As to the latter, in the case of <em>Ellis v. Smith, </em>the acknowledgement of the signature by the testator, was held to be sufficient proof of the signing by him : but lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, \u201c it lias been hinted, that this decision would lead the way to farther deviations from the statute, and, by consequence, would allow a testator\u2019s declarations, that another signed for him, to be good : but authority given by a testator, is a collateral thing, and a thing that ought to be proved; consequence is not to be built on consequence he does not say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>how </em>proved : but can it be doubted, that he meant <em>proved according to the statute, </em>or by some equivalent proof, which the acknowledgement of the testator was not? This of itself would justify the decision in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin. </em>But it is said, that, in that case, we had the testimony of <em>Scrimger, </em>the first witness, that <em>Corbin </em>had signed the will for <em>Burwell, </em>by his direction 8sc. and we should have taken it to have been signed, when <em>Burwell </em>acknowledged it to be his will, to <em>Braddick, </em>the second witness. In <em>Westbeech </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>there were two witnesses who had proved the sigture of the testator, before <em>Henry Boys, </em>the third witness, was called; yet the acknowledgement of the testator, that it was h;s will, would not have been held a recognition of his signature, if he had not <em>sealed </em>the will in his presence; an act which naturally follows, and does not precede, the act of signing, and was of itself a recognition of the signature. It must be admitted, that a paper attested before it is signed, is not a will under the statute; that the statute requires the attestation of two witnesses, after ir is a perfect will. If all the witnesses die, or are out of the jurisdiction of the court, then, of necessity, proof is admitted of their handwriting, and is all that can be required to identify the paper attested by them.' But if they are present, all must identify the paper attested by them. In such case, the statute requires, that two witnesses shall prove the <em>factum </em>of signing by the testator. Suppose he acknowledge the will only, before both of them, and before it is signed, as was the case in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>as to one of the witnesses; would such an acknowledgement be a compliance with the statute ? The witnesses, in such case, by looking at their signatures, might identify the paper they attested; but they could not say, that it was a will executed by the testator by signing his name to it. This would open the door to fraud: a paper not signed by the testator, but afterwards by another, might be palmed upon a court for a will. I have seen no case, in which the acknowledgement of the testator, that the paper was his will, in the absence of all proof that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>was signed by him at the time the acknowledgement was made, has been held a recognition by the testator of his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>the point in <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>was not involved. The ground we went on, was, that one witness having proved the signature, and it not appearing that <em>Pendergast, </em>the other witness, was dead or out of the power of the court, we would not, as in case of his death or being out of the jurisdiction of the court, admit proof of his handwriting ; and we reversed the judgement, and sent the cause back, that his testimony, if to be had, might be adduced. What was said by the judge who reported the opinion of the court, of the case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>was certainly not relied on, as making any part of the opinion of the court in the case, as it was unnecessary to the judgement pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">. I shall not repeat the evidence in the case now before us. I am inclined to think that it is insufficient to establish the will, and, therefore, that the sentence ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b471-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANl\">The county and circuit courts having coincided, in this case, in giving credit to the witnesses in support of the will, though contradicted by a witness against it, we are bound, by reason and authority, to follow their judgement in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Taking then for true, as I shall do, the testimony of <em>Pasley </em>and <em>Hendrick, </em>I cannot hesitate in affirming the sentence. The former explicitly states, that he wrote the will, and subscribed it as a witness, at the request and in the presence of the testator. It was objected, indeed, that it is not proved that it was dictated by, or read over to, the testator. But if, as the witness says, it was written by the request and in the presence of the testator, we might fairly presume, that the testator did dictate the will which was written. But the proof of that fact has never been deemed necessary, where the testator has duly executed the will by signing and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>knowledgement. Innumerable wills, written by third persons anc* signed by testators, are attested without any evidence whatever of the circumstances under which they were drawn. The recognition of them -by execution, is sufficient. It can never be fairly presumed, that a testator performs so solemn an act, without having dictated or understood it. Where, indeed, in the case of personal property, the will is <em>not </em>executed, it must be shewn, that it was written as dictated by the testator, or was approved after having been read. In this case, if the execution be regular, according to the statute, we must take it, that the testator was aware of the contents of the paper, before he executed itand the rather as it bears date so many years before his death; as his fears of having pretermitted a daughter evinces a general knowledge of its <em>contents; </em>and as the witnesses against the will, if they are to be believed, themselves establish the fact of his having spoken of the will he had made with disapprobation, which could not well have been if he was ignorant of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The execution of the will seems to me to have been sufficient. <em>Pasley </em>proves the signing it by himself at the request of the testator, and attesting it in his presence. Here, then, is one complete witness to the will. <em>Hendrick </em>also proves, that the testator acknowledged the will in his presence, and he attested it accordingly. It is objected, that this acknowledgement is not sufficient, according to the statute, and the authority of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin. </em>That case is not exactly in point; and though I shall certainly not disregard its authority where it is so, yet I am sustained by the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>in saying that it affords no binding precedent in this case. The case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>was decided on a special verdict rendered upon an issue <em>devisavit vel non. </em>This case is before a court of probat. In that, the court was, perhaps, tied down to the facts as found 5 in this, it discharges the functions, not only of judges, but of jurors; having the power to infer a fact from the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>deuce before it. In this case, therefore, I think myself entitled to infer, that when the testator acknowledged the will produced to <em>Hendrick, </em>as his will, he did acknowledge thereby the signature also. For <em>Hendrick </em>says the paper produced at the trial was that which was acknowledged, and we must therefore presume, it was signed as we see it, in the absence of proof to the contrary. Although, therefore, I do not contest the necessity of two witnesses to the recognition of the signature, since the case of <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>demands them, yet I think that recognition may fairly be inferred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">If these views are right, then the will was duly executed in its original form, to pass real estate. What then was the effect of the alteration ?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">1. What was the alteration? It was to provide, for a daughter, and upon the face of the will not a particle of <em>real </em>property is given to a daughter. We may, therefore, fairly infer, that no part of the will <em>devising real </em>estate was then inserted ; and, indeed, that no such part was' erased, though even this would not have affected the residue. The will, then, is unimpaired as a will of realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">2. How as to the personalty? The alteration having been made, and reduced to writing, in the testator\u2019s presence, and by his direction, I think the reasons very strong for sustaining it without <em>Hendrick\u2019s </em>testimony. But it is clear, that the alteration and his attestation were made about the same time. To suppose that the alteration was first made, will account for the desire to have a new witness to the will, seven years after it was first executed. To suppose the contrary, would leave that matter very obscure. If the alteration was first made, and then the will was acknowledged before Hendrick, there can be no doubt it is good as to the personalty <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the sentence should be affirmed : to which opinion I incline more readily, as the parties may, (if they please to pursue this matter further) prosecute their objections to the will, by bill in equity, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>have its validity determined by an issue <em>devisavit vel non; </em>whereas if we, as a court of probat, decide against the will, the decision may, perhaps, be conclusive on the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Sentence affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
