A reference to that report will be necessary in order to understand, fully, the report of the subsequent proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-9\"><em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>by deed dated the 18th November 1801, conveyed a p\u00e1rcej of land called <em>Laurel Grove </em>in <em>Westmoreland, </em>to <em>Peter P. Cox, </em>to secure a debt of 1500 dollars, money of certain wards of <em>Cox, </em>which she had borrowed of him; and thereby entrusted and empowered <em>Cox </em>himself to sell the mortgaged subject to pay the debt. In 1803, <em>Chowning </em>purchased <em>Laurel Grove </em>of <em>Mrs. Thompson </em>for \u00a3876. out of which he undertook to pay certain debts she owed, and among them the debt of 1500 dollars to <em>Cox. Chowning </em>exhibited a bill in chancery in 1806, to injoin <em>Cox </em>from selling the land under the deed of November 1801, upon the ground of some alleged defect in <em>Mrs. Thompson\u2019s </em>title. This injunction was dissolved in April 1812. And on the 29th May 1812, <em>Cox </em>proceeded to sell the land at public auction to <em>William Taylor. </em>In August 1812, <em>Chowning </em>exhibited his original bill in this cause, against <em>Cox </em>and <em>Mrs. Thompson, </em>wherein he alleged, that <em>Cox </em>had sold the land to --, whether on the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>chaser\u2019s own account or on that of Coa;, he professed not to know, and he objected, that <em>Cox </em>being the creditor secured by the deed <em>of </em>November 1801, could not lawfully <em>J </em>,,, - ri i act as trustee for himself, and had no rightful power to make sale of the mortgaged subject; and, therefore, he prayed that he should be permitted to redeem the land, upon payment of the principal and interest of the debt remaining due on the mortgage. <em>Cox, </em>in his answer to this bill, stated all the circumstances of the sale of May 1812, and that the purphaser was <em>William Taylor. </em>Yet <em>Clowning </em>did not make <em>Taylor </em>a party defendant in the suit. The chancellor, on the hearing, dismissed the bill, as to so much thereof as sought to set aside the sale. <em>Clowning </em>appealed from the decree. <em>This </em>court declared, that <em>the deed of </em>November 1801, did not give <em>Cox </em>any rightful power to sell the land for payment of a debt due to himself, so as to bar <em>Clowning1 s </em>right of redemption: but it added, \u201c If' there were no other persons than the debtor and creditor, interested in this controversy, the court would not only reverse the decree, hut provide for a sale under the directions of the court of chancery. But the person who purchased under the former sale, and who has the legal title, has not been made a party. Had he been before the court, he might have given a <em>different aspect to tie cause. </em>He might have shewn, that, although the sale cannot <em>be </em>justified on the sole ground of the powers derived from the deed, yet it ought to be confirmed in <em>lis </em>favor, in consequence of the <em>subsequent </em>acts of the appellant. He ought, therefore, to have been a party; and the chancellor erred in pronouncing a final decree, without affording an opportunity to bring him before the court.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s decree was accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded to the court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b679-8\"><em>Clowning </em>then exhibited a supplemental bill and bill of revivor, setting forth the former proceedings, and the decree of this court of February 1823; and stating, that, at the sale of the land in question, by <em>Peter P. Cox, </em>on the 29th May 1812, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>William Taylor, </em>late of <em>Westmoreland </em>deceased, was the purchaser, at a very inadequate price; that <em>Taylor </em>was well apprised of the authority under which <em>Cox </em>pretended to make the sale, and that <em>Cox </em>was acting as a trustee under a jggj jn which he himself was a mortgagee, and, therefore, had no rightful power to make the sale; and that <em>Taylor </em>had taken possession of the land, and he and his representatives had enjoyed the profits thereof for many years; and that <em>Cox </em>also was now dead.' Therefore, this bill made the administrator with the will annexed of <em>Taylor, </em>and his heirs, and the executors of <em>Cox, </em>parties defendants; and prayed, that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>real and personal representatives should be ordered to account for the profits of the land, since the same came to <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>possession; that an account of the debt due by <em>Chowning </em>for which the land was mortgaged, should also be taken; and that <em>Chowning </em>should be allowed to redeem the land, upon payment of any balance of debt, which, after crediting him for the payments he had made, and for the profits which should be found to have accrued to the holders of the subject, should be found due from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b680-6\">The administrator and heirs of <em>Taylor, </em>in their answers, insisted, that whatever might be the merits of the controversy as between <em>Chowning </em>and <em>Cox, Chowning </em>had no just claim to the relief he asked as against <em>Taylor </em>and his representatives. For, they alleged, the sale of the land made by <em>Cox, </em>was a sale at public auction for cash, fairly conducted in all respects; that <em>Taylor </em>became the purchaser at that sale for the full cash value of the property, without notice or suspicion of any defect in <em>Cox\u2019s </em>title, or in his power to make the sale, and <em>Chowning </em>himself was present at the sale, and made no objection whatever to <em>Cox\u2019s </em>proceeding ; and that <em>Taylor </em>had paid the whole purchase money to <em>Cox. </em>They stated, that <em>Taylor </em>died in 1814, and they exhibited his will, whereby it appeared, that <em>Taylor </em>devised this land to two of his sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>Cox\u2019s </em>executors answered, that their testator sold the land to <em>Taylor, </em>at public auction, for cash, in <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>presence, without any objection on his part; that <em>Taylor </em>paid <em>Cox </em>the purchase money, which was <em>\u00a3 </em>626. and <em>Cox </em>acting as a trustee, conveyed the land to <em>Taylor, </em>with a covenant of special warranty; that the debts charged upon the land, and to satisfy which it was sold, amounted to <em>\u00a3 </em>571. 6.9.; that their testator was, therefore, accountable to <em>Chowning </em>for the balance <em>\u00a3 </em>54. 13. 3. with interest from the date of the sale of the mortgaged subject; and they insisted, that <em>Chowning </em>had no other just claim against their testator\u2019s estate. They also alleged, that they had fully administered the assets of their testator\u2019s estate; and they exhibited their accounts of administration, audited and settled by a commissioner of the county court of <em>Westmoreland, </em>by which it appeared probable, that <em>Cox\u2019s </em>estate was insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-5\"><em>Cox\u2019s </em>deed of conveyance of the land to <em>Taylor, </em>was dated the 13th October 1813.

Therefore, he directed a commissioner to take an account of the rents and profits of the land since the sale thereof made by <em>Cox </em>to <em>Taylor, </em>ascertaining by whom the same were received; to inquire and report, whether <em>Cox </em>had paid <em>Mrs. Thompson </em>the whole of the debt due to her, and had paid the same out of the purchase money paid him by <em>Taylor; </em>and to set-off the amount of the rents and profits against the balances of debt due by <em>Chowning, </em>so as to shew how much was now due from or to <em>Chowning </em>to or from the defendants or either of them.

Whatever was the defect of <em>Cox\u2019s </em>power, his sale was, in itself, perfectly fair, in all respects. The only objection to it, was, that <em>Cox </em>being himself the creditor and mortgagee, could not rightfully act as trustee in selling the mortgaged subject, though <em>Mrs. Thompson </em>the mortgagor, and <em>Chowning, </em>who purchased of her subject to the mortgage, both, undoubtedly, intended to confide that trust and power to him. <em>Chowning </em>was exactly apprised of all the facts, and had ample time for deliberation. He had suspended the proceedings of <em>Cox, </em>by an injunction, for six years, during which time he never hinted this objection. After this long delay, <em>Cox </em>proceeded to make the sale, regularly, and in execution of what he deemed his power and trust; a sale at public auction, for cash; so that the purchaser was to part with the purchase^rrtoney the instant the biddings were closed, to be applied to \u00a1the discharge of <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>debts. <em>Chowning, </em>present at the sale from first to last, so far from making any objection to <em>Cox\u2019s </em>right to make the sale, after a vain, endeavour to r\u00e1se money to pay the debt, and so to prevent,the sale, declared publicly, that the sale must proceed. Nay more, though he was apprised by <em>Cox\u2019s </em>answer to his original bill, that <em>Taylor </em>was the purchaser, he forbore to make him a party for years, and thus deprived him of all pretense to prefer any claim against <em>Cox, </em>to refund the purchase money he had paid him, or to demand security that it should be refunded : he never made <em>Taylor </em>a party, till <em>Cox </em>was dead, and his estate insolvent. <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>objection to the sale, was founded on the equity he had to insist, that <em>Cox, </em>who was interested as a creditor, should not exercise the powers of a trustee\u2014that the trust should be executed by some disinterested person; an equity not founded on his own contract, but on the policy of the law, which, in spite of the contract of the parties, denies to a person standing in the relation <em>Cox </em>did, the character or powers of a trustee. He waived this equity by wilful acquiescence in <em>Cox\u2019s </em>sale, without objection; nay, by posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tive assent to it. He barred himself from asserting it against <em>Taylor, </em>by his subsequent conduct: seeing <em>Taylor </em>purchase the land, knowing he was to pay cash, knowing that , , , V, \u00b0 the purchase money was to be applied to the payment ot his own debts, he stood quietly by till all this was done, and never asserted his equity against <em>Taylor, </em>until, by reason of <em>Cox\u2019s </em>death and insolvency, if <em>Taylor </em>shall lose the land, he must lose his money too. To these obvious objections to the equity, so late asserted by <em>Chowning </em>against <em>Taylor, </em>it is no answer to say, that ho was ignorant of the incompatibility of <em>Cox\u2019s </em>interest in the trust with the character of trustee, and of his own legal right to object to his proceedings on that ground. For, in the first place, <em>Chowning, </em>was certainly apprised of his rights, at least as early as August 1812, when he exhibited his original bill against <em>Cox, </em>and wilfully forbore to make <em>Taylor </em>a party; and, in the next place, he was exactly informed of all the facts, from the beginning, and he cannot be allowed to excuse himself for neglecting to assert his rights, and thereby involving the innocent purchaser in loss or difficulty, on the ground of ignorance of the law. 1 Fonb. Eq. book 2. ch. 3. \u00a7 4. pp. 151-6. and the cases collected in the notes. If it be said, that <em>Taylor </em>also, as well as <em>Chowning, </em>was apprised of all the facts, and therefore he, no more than <em>Chowning, </em>shall bo allowed to allege ignorance of the legal defect of <em>Cox\u2019s </em>power to sell; the answer is, that the objection to <em>Cox\u2019s </em>proceeding as trustee, lay for <em>Chowning </em>only; and as he alone had a right to make the objection, so he had a right to waive it; and the bidders at the sale had a right to infer that he did waive it. <em>Chowning </em>must be considered as the actor; for <em>Cox </em>was in effect acting as <em>his </em>trustee, since he stood in the place of <em>Mrs. Thompson, </em>who had expressly constituted <em>Cox </em>the trustee to sell the mortgaged subject, to pay the debt which <em>Chowning </em>undertook to pay out of the purchase money he contracted to pay her for the laud. In the casos in which it has been hold, that money paid under a mistake o\u00ed the law, cannot be rc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>covered back, the receiver as well as the payer has been conusant of the facts: and it is because the payer is the actor, and because to permit him to recover it back, would , . ... . . be to allow him to involve the receiver in a debt or duty wjjicji but for jjjs own mistake he never would have incurred, that the receiver is exempted from all obligation to refund the money. <em>Brisbane </em>v. <em>Dacres, </em>5 Taunt. 144. 1 Com. Law Rep. 43.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b686-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvV\">Though the sale was made in May 1812, yet <em>Cox </em>did not make a conveyance to <em>Taylor </em>till October 1813. Hence it is to be inferred, that the terms of sale which required the purchase money to be paid in cash, were not strictly complied with; that the purchase money was not in fact paid, till about the time when the conveyance was executed. And the very peculiar covenant inserted in <em>Cox\u2019s </em>deed, evinces, that <em>Taylor </em>was as well apprised as <em>Cox </em>himself, of the equity asserted by <em>Chowning </em>in his original bill filed in August 1812, and that <em>Taylor </em>contracted and intended to take on himself the hazard resulting from <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>claim. <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>will too, made in March 1814, clearly indicates his knowledge of <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>suit then in prosecution for the recovery of the land, and that his rights were to abide the result of that suit. Therefore, <em>Taylor </em>was no wise injured by, and had no just ground to complain of, <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>neglect to make him a party to \"his original bill. And he must be considered as having not only purchased, but as having also paid the purchase money, and taken his conveyance, with actual notice. He made the purchase at <em>Cox\u2019s </em>sale, with actual and exact knowledge of the power under which <em>Cox </em>professed to make the sale $ that is, in other words, with full notice of <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>equity to redeem the land, notwithstanding the sale thus made without competent authority. He saw the authority under which his vendor was acting: it was his business to inquire and to ascertain, whether that authority was legal and sufficient to warrant the vendor in proceeding to sell; and <em>he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>must bear the consequences of his neglect to do so, or, if you please, of his ignorance of the principle of law which condemned <em>Cox\u2019s </em>proceedings. <em>Chowning </em>was passive, and there was no necessity that ho should be otherwise. For the sale made by Co\u00ae, being made without lawful power to sell, could convey no just right to the vendee; and whether the title should remain in <em>Cox, </em>or bo by him conveyed to the vendee, <em>Choivning\u2019s </em>right to redeem the subject would remain the same. Why should he be bound to interfere to prevent a sale, which no wise impaired his rights ? <em>Cox </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>the unauthorized vendor and the negligent or wilful purchaser, were the actors, if indeed, it be material to determine which of the parties is to be considered as the actor. But, in truth, the cause depends on very simple principles: here was a mortgaged subject sold by the mortgagee, who had (acknowledgedly) no power to sell it, and purchased by a person who had exact notice of the power under which the sale was made, and who meant to take, and did take, the hazard of any defect in the power of the vendor; and the plain legal consequence is, that the mortgagor has, in equity, the same right to redeem as against the purchaser, which he had as against the mortgagee. The former decree of this court is decisive of the controversy. The court indeed declared, that \u201c had <em>Taylor </em>been before the court, he might have given a different aspect to the cause.\u201d But how? by shewing, \u201c that, though <em>Cox\u2019s </em>sale could not be justified on the sole ground of the powers derived from the deed, yet it ought to be confirmed in <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>favor, in consequence of <em>the subsequent acts of Chowning.\u201d </em>Now, certainly, <em>Chowning </em>has done no act whatever, subsequent to the sale, that can have the remotest tendency to the confirmation of it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\"> He decided the cause in. the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b687-5\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABJ\">When the case of <em>Chowning </em>v. <em>Cox </em>(of which this is the sequel) was formerly before this court, I consider that the court decided a mere abstract principle. This is apparent from the whole opinion. It commences thus: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>\u201c </em>This case presents the <em>general question, </em>whether a deed , , r , , T \\ . ,. , executed by a debtor, conveying land to his creditor, and purporting to constitute him the trustee for selling the land, , . , , , , , and applying the proceeds or the sale to the payment of the (jue t0 himself, can be regarded otherwise than as a mere mortgage, to which the right of redemption is incident.\u201d Such a deed was decided to be a mortgage. But when the court came to apply the general principle to the case before it, it said, \u201c If there were no other persons than the debtor and creditor intereste'd, it would reverse the decree, and provide'for a sale under the directions of the court of chancery. But the person who purchased under the former sale, and <em>who has the legal title, </em>has not been made a party. Had he been before the court, he might have given a different aspect to the cause. He might have shewn, .that, although the sale cannot be justified on the <em>sole </em>ground of the powers derived from the deed, yet it ought to be confirmed in <em>his </em>favor, in consequence of <em>the subsequent acts </em>of the appellant. He ought, therefore, to have been a party, and the chancellor erred in pronouncing a final decree, without affording an opportunity to bring him before the court.\u201d The decree was therefore reversed, and the cause sent back.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">It is thought, that by the words \u201c the <em>subsequent acts </em>of the appellant,\u201d the court meant to limit the defence of the vendee to the acts of <em>Chowning </em>done <em>after the sale.. </em>I do not believe the court meant any such restriction. It had said, in a prior sentence, that if the vendee had been a party, he might have <em>given a different aspect to the cause; thus </em>throwing the whole open to him. It proceeded afterwards to particularize one of the means by which this new aspect might be given; namely, by shewing <em>Chowning\u2019s </em>acts of confirmation or assent subsequent to the sale. But, suppose the vendee <em>before </em>the sale, had gone to <em>Chowning, </em>and said, \u201c I see that <em>Cox </em>has advertised your land for sale ; is it your purpose to suffer him (who is the creditor) to act also as the trustee? if so, I am inclined to buy:\u201d and <em>Chowning </em>had answered, \u201c Yes; you may buy safely:\u201d Can it be ima<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ffined, that this court meant to shut out such a defence ? Is r . it not a fundamental maxim, that no man shall be affected by <em>res inter alios aetac\u00a1 </em>Had not the court pronounced, that <em>Chowning </em>had done wrong in bringing this cause to hearing, without making the vendee, who had the legal title, a party ? And would it enable him to profit by his own wrong ? which he surely would do, if by omitting to make <em>Taylor </em>a party to his original bill, he could cut him off from a defence, which as an original party he would unquestionably have had. It is clear to me, then, that <em>Taylor </em>comes to his defence, wholly unprejudiced by what has been done; and free to avail himself of any matter of fact or law arising out of the old case or the new.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Taking the genera] \u00a1principle to have been correctly decided by the court, we are to inquire, whether, under all the circumstances of the case, the sale of the land made by <em>Cox, </em>shall stand or be set aside ? That the parties to the deed intended to give <em>Cox </em>the full power to sell and convey the land, no body can doubt. They expressly swear, that such was their intention. Nor is this an unheard of thing: in the state of <em>New York </em>(as their reported cases shew us) nothing is more common than to give to the mortgagee a power of sale : and in such cases, if he is proceeding to sell, improperly, as the debtor thinks, he files his bill, stops the sale, and brings the matter into equity, just as the debtor does here in deeds of trust. In the case before us, it is the less strange that <em>Mrs. Thompson </em>should place so much confidence in <em>Cox, </em>as to make him the trustee, because he was not, in his individual character, the creditor: the answers and the deed itself declare, that it was the money of his wards, which he was lending out upon the security of this land. <em>Chowning </em>bought the land with a full knowledge of this incumbrance, and it was a part of his contract to discharge it. He went on to pay a part of the money; but failing to pay the rest, <em>Cox </em>advertised the land for sale. <em>Chowning </em>then filed a bill of injunction to stay the sale, on the ground of defect of title; but made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>objection to <em>Cox\u2019s </em>selling as trustee. . This injunction was dissolved: <em>Cox </em>again advertised to sell the land for cash, to discharge the incumbrance. The sale took place on the <em>'29th May 1812, Chowning </em>being present and making <em>no </em>0kject\u00a10n&gt; <em>Taylor </em>became the purchaser; and in August after, the original bill was filed to set the sale aside, not for unfairness, but because the deed was a mortgage, and the plaintiff had a right to be let in to redeem. I am clearly of opinion, that under all the circumstances, it would operate a cruel injustice to set aside the sale. This deed being in law a mortgage, we must presume, that <em>Chowning </em>knew it to be so; for every man is bound to know the law, and ignorance does not excuse. This is laid down in many cases. In <em>Bilbie v. Lumley, 2 </em>East, 471. the court said, \u201c Every man must be taken to be conusant of the law. Otherwise there is no saying to what extent the excuse of ignorance might be carried. It would be urged in almost every case.\u201d But, besides the conclusion of law, we have the statement of the plaintiff in his original bill, that he did know this to be a mere mortgage : after describing the deed as having a power of sale, he says, \u201c that at the time of entering into the said agreement [with <em>Mrs. </em>Thompson] your orator understood, that there was a <em>mortgage </em>on the said land, as evidenced by this indenture, <em>and that it was nothing more.\u2019\u2019 </em>Possessing this knowledge, he made no objection in the first bill he filed, to a sale by <em>Cox. </em>Failing in that bill, he attended the sale; stood by, and saw an innocent purchaser buy and pay his money, and receive his deed, and made not one word of objection. The sale too, we are told by witnesses, was well attended, and conducted with perfect fairness. After this, can he be heard to object to this sale ? It is not worth while to quote the cases which decide, that a man.thus concealing his right shall be bound : they are too familiar. If we were even to say (contrary to the conclusion of law, and the statement of the bill) that <em>Chowning </em>did not know that this was a mere mortgage, and therefore was not guilty of fraudulent concealment, still I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>should he of opinion, that he could not succeed ; for where equity is equal, the law must prevail 5 and here the vendee has the legal title, and far superiour equity, since <em>Chouming, </em>, , - ,. to say the least, was guilty ot gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree be that the sale of the land made by <em>Cox </em>to <em>Taylor </em>be confirmed, and so much of the bill as sought to set it aside, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">The other judges concurring, decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
