That <em>Horrei </em>was not bound to perform the condition of the said bond of submission, which ought to be equally and mutually binding between the parties thereto; and because the same is not binding on the said Horrei, it is void in law: 2. That the award is not mutual and final between the parties, because the arbitrators have not awarded, that upon the defendant\u2019s procuring the land, and making a good title to the plaintiff, the defendant should be acquitted and <em>released </em>by the plaintiff from all actions, causes of action, or all other demands or claims on the part of the plaintiff against the defendant, which might be in controversy between them, concerning the premises, &amp;c.

That the declaration was variant from the bond, inasmuch as the declaration describes a bond executed by <em>M\u2019 Alexander </em>and <em>Horrei, </em>wherein they stood reciprocally bound to each other to abide and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>form, &amp;c.; whereas the bond itself only binds <em>M\u2019Alex-under </em>to pay to <em>Horrel </em>the sum of <em>$ </em>500, upon condition that <em>he, M'Alexander, </em>shall abide and perform the award, while <em>Horrel </em>is not bound to abide and perform the award on his part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">2. That the award is not final and conclusive between the parties to the said bond, not being made pursuant thereto, because <em>Horrel </em>was not bound to abide by and keep the award, and the said award only having relation to a controversy about 300 acres of land, when, by the bond, it appears, that there were various other controversies then existing between the parties, upon which the arbitrators have made no award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">3. That the award was not made within the time appointed in the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">4. That the defendant did procure the 300 acres of land mentioned in the award, and made the plaintiff a good and lawful title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">5. That he had paid to the plaintiff the sum of <em>501. </em>with interest, Sic. in pursuance of the award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">The plaintiff demurred to the first plea, and joined issue on the rest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">The plaintiff then obtained leave to amend his declaration; upon which, the defendant demurred to the declaration, writing obligatory, and award. The grounds of this demurrer are the same as those assigned in the last mentioned pleas. The Court refused to compel the plaintiff to join in the demurrer, to which opinion the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">On the trial of the issues, the jury found for the plaintiff 50f. damages, with interest, Sic. subject to certain deductions; to which the defendant filed errors in arrest of judgment. The errors stated are the same that had been before stated in the pleas and demurrer, except the following; that the plaintiff had assigned no breach in the nonpayment of the <em>penalty </em>of the said bond of submission, as he ought to have done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\" The Court refused to hear any argument upon the errors }n arrest of judgment, \u201cbecause, there had been, hereto-f\u00b0re&gt; a demurrer in this cause, which had been adjudged of by the Court;\u201d whereupon, judgment was rendered for the plaintiif, for <em>501. </em>with interest, &amp;sc. according to the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The defendant appealed on this second judgment to the-Superior Court. That Court reversed the judgment of the County Court, on the ground, that the County Court erred in over-ruling the first demurrer, filed by the defendant, to the declaration; which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to have been sustained, and judgment rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">From this judgment, the plaintiff appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-8\"><em>Nicholas, for the </em>appellant, contended.-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">1. That the assignment of the breach was sufficient, as it alledges a breach in the words of <em>the </em>covenant. If not good, originally, it is sufficient after verdict. Thus, <em>non infregit couventionem, </em>although not a good plea on demurrer, is cured by a verdict. 1 <em>Chitt. Pl. </em>481. The assignment of the breach is only deficient in <em>form, </em>but the <em>substance </em>is sufficiently alledged in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">2. The Court only reversed up to the declaration, and therefore the declaration remained as a foundation for other pleadings. The defendant filed a demurrer to the declaration; but, the Court never decided, that it was defective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-12\">3. After the cause was sent back to the Rules, the County Court was correct in over-ruling the demurrer. It is objected, that the bond was not equally binding on both parties. But, this is a mistake, because <em>Horrel </em>signed the bond. The usual course is to execute <em>two </em>bonds. In that case, no notice is taken of the other bond. <em>Kyd on Aw. 8. Cayhill </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>1 Wilson\u2019s Rep. 28, <em>58.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>4. It is objected, that the award is not <em>mutual, </em>because it omits to require <em>Ilorrel </em>to execute a <em>release </em>to <em>MV Alexander, </em>upon the latter conveying the lands to the former, The answer is, that the doctrine of <em>mutuality </em>is exploded in modern times. <em>Kyd on Aw. </em>147, 153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">5. It is objected, that the bond speaks of <em>several </em>matters to be referred to the arbitrators, and the award only decides <em>one </em>of them. But, these words will be considered a mere <em>formula, </em>and no other matter will be intended to exist, unless it be shewn. <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>8 East, 445.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-6\"><em>Gilmer, </em>1'or the appellee, urged the following objections to the judgments of the County Court:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">In the first judgment:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">1. No sufficient breach of the covenant was assigned in the declaration. There is no averment, that the defendant had not paid the <em>$500, </em>the penalty of the bond, which is the direct breach. <em>Laughlin </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>3 Munf. 255; <em>Falcon </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 550.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">2. The award set out is had: 1. Because it was not reciprocal. 2. It was not final. It is true, that if no other controversies appeared, than those decided upon by the award, the Court will intend that there were no others. <em>Hawkins </em>v.----, 1 Burr. 277. But, the bond, as well as the award, recites other subjects of reference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-13\">3. The declaration is vitiated by a <em>quod cum. Winston </em>v. <em>Francisco, </em>2 Wash. 187; <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, 1 </em>Call, 83; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Dawney, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 127.

If the Superior Court erred in its reversal of this judgment, we may correct the error without meddling with the multifarious matter, with which the subsequent part of the record abounds. To the first judgment of the County Court, there are three objections: 1. That the award is not <em>mutual,. </em>2. That it is not <em>final. 3. </em>That the breach in the declaration is not sufficiently laid.</p>\n<p id=\"Aql7\">The first objection rests upon the idea, that something must be awarded on both sides. This was certainly the law formerly. As (for example) if it had been awarded, that the obligor, in a single bond, should pay the debt; the award was held not binding, for want of <em>mutuality, </em>unless.it was added, that he should thereupon be discharged. <em>Kyd on Aw. </em>224; <em>Hob. </em>49; <em>Brownl. </em>58. But, this has long been exploded; and <em>Kyd, </em>153, says, \u201cit may now be safely laid down, that it is not necessary that the award itself should express, that a sum awarded to be paid, or an act to be done in favor of one of the parties, shall be in satisfaction. A discharge to the other must necessarily be presumed, from the payment of the sum, or performance of the act.\u201d Here the arbitrators state, that <em>M\u2019Alexander </em>had sold to <em>Horrel, </em>land; which <em>land had been </em>sold for taxes, before <em>Horrel </em>had either title or possession; that, therefore, <em>M,Alexander </em>shall, by a given day, procure and convey to <em>Horrel </em>a good title, or failing to do so, shall pay him 50/. with interest, &amp;c. Can any thing be clearer, than that this land to be conveyed, or this 50/. to be paid, is in satisfaction? Surely not. There is nothing, then, in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The second objection is, that the award is not <em>final. </em>This rests upon the ground, that the bond of submission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>states, that <em>divers disputes had </em>arisen, <em>fyc. </em>and that <em>all matters in dispute </em>were submitted; and yet the arbitrators have decided on <em>one </em>matter only, leaving the other matters still undetermined. This objection seems as unsubstantial as the first. The bond is in the usual form, submitting all matters in dispute; and it states, that <em>divers disputes </em>had arisen. But, this does not prove that there was more than one <em>subject matter </em>in dispute. Divers disputes might arise on the single subject of the land, or the usual words might be inserted, without meaning to describe the subject matters as one, or divers. <em>Kyd on Aw. </em>171, says, the award must comprehend every thing submitted, and must not be of parcel only. This, however, (he adds,) must be understood with a considerable degree of limitation; for, though the words of the submission be more comprehensive than those of the award, yet if it do not appear that any thing else was in dispute between the parties, beside what is comprehended in the award, the award will bo <em>good. Now </em>here, there is no tittle of evidence, that there was any thing in dispute between the parties, but the land contract. The award, therefore, deciding this, is good.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The third objection is, that the breach in the declaration is not sufficiently laid; and if this objection had been raised by demurrer, I do not undertake to say how I should have been inclined to decide it, The declaration is certainly drawn awkardly; perhaps, as to the breach, defectively. But I am clearly of opinion, that it is a defect, cured by the verdict. The distinction taken in <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>1 Call 83, and in <em>Fulgham </em>v. Lightfoot, 1 Call, 250, is between necessary facts not being stated at all, and being <em>imperfectly </em>stated. In the first case, a verdict does not cure; in the second, it does. Here all the facts, necessary for the information of the defendant, are stated. The bond of submission, with its penalty and condition; the award made in consequence; the breach by the defendant of his covenant, in not conveying the land, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>paying the money awarded, to the plaintiff\u2019\u00bb damage <em>$ </em>500; the amount of the penalty of the bond of submission; these seem to be all the facts necessary for the defendant\u2019s information and defence. He took issue on them, and the finding was against him for the sum awarded. The judgment was for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the sum found. This judgment, the Superior Court reversed; in which, I think, it erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">It has occurred as a question, whether it is not now too late to affirm the first judgment of the County Court, as that was reversed by the judgment of the Superior. Court; and the plaintiff, not appealing or making any objection to such reversal, went to trial again in the County Court. I do not consider this material. The first judgment of the Superior Court does not put an end to the <em>question of right </em>between the parties, or to the <em>action; </em>but reverses the proceedings to a certain point, and sends the cause back for a new trial; \u201cleaving the whole of the proceedings so far in <em>fieri, </em>as that the Court may take notice of the first error, wherever it may happen.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 237; <em>Robinson et al. </em>ex\u2019rs. v. <em>Gaines\u2019 adm\u2019r. </em>3 Call, 243; 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 64.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">My opinion therefore is, that both the judgments of the Superior Court of Law, and the second judgment of the County Court, be reversed, with all the costs; and the first judgment of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Judges Coalter, Cabell, and the President, concurred; and judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
