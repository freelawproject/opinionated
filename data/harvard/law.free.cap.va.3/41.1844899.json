Co. </em>filed a bill against <em>Mexander Sharp, </em>alledging, that <em>Sharp </em>had sundry dealings with <em>William Brown 8? Co. </em>upon which there was a considerable balance due the said <em>Brown 8? Co. </em>upon account: that <em>William Barret </em>was the only witness who could prove the said transactions and balance: that the said <em>Sharp </em>had left the State of <em>Virginia; </em>and, that as the complainant had no opportunity of bringing suit against him at common law, he was desirous of preserving the testimony of the said <em>William Barret. </em>He, therefore prayed, that the testimony of the said <em>Barret </em>might bo taken and recorded: that an account of the transactions aforesaid might be had; and that the said <em>Sharp </em>might bo decreed to pay to the complainant the balauee which might be found due, with legal interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">Publication was duly made against the said <em>Sharp, </em>and an order for an account was obtained. The deposition of <em>Barret </em>was also taken under a commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-10\">The commissioner reported a considerable balance to be due from <em>Sharp.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\">On the final hearing, the Chancellor was of opinion, that the Court could not entertain jurisdiction of the case, either to perpetuate testimony or to afford relief: that, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>to the English practice, both objects cannot he embraced by same bill; and that, to entertain jurisdiction in this case, would be to assume a jurisdiction co-extensive with the world. He therefore dismissed the bill, and decreed to the defendant his costs. In the preamble to this decree, it is stated, that the <em>cause was argued by </em>counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-3\"><em>Miller </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-4\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">1. That it was not irregular to proceed against <em>Sharp </em>as an absent defendant. The Court proceeds, in such a case, on the principle of <em>quia timet. Coop. Eq. </em>52, 57. <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>Ambler, 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\">Our act of Assembly points out the mode of giving no\u201c tice in such a case, and applies to this case. 1 <em>Rev. Code </em>476, \u00a7 5. There is no difference between the proceeding against absent defendants, and an attachment against the effects of an absent debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">2. The record shews, that this cause was <em>argued by Counsel, </em>and this cures all error. <em>Hind\u2019s Chan. </em>144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">3. As to the bill praying <em>relief </em>as well as to <em>perpetuate testimony, </em>this objection can only be taken advantage of by demurrer. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Goodburn </em>et al.; Rep. Temp. Finch, 391.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b54-9\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-10\">The appearance of counsel was only of the counsel of the <em>plaintiff. </em>This is a demand for the balance of an account, which would be fit for a Court of Law, if the parties were in this country. That a bill to <em>perpetuate testimony </em>cannot pray relief, is expressly stated in <em>Coop. Eq. 52; Mitf Plead. 50; Hall </em>v. <em>Hodsden, </em>2 P. Wms. 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-11\">Another question is, can a plaintiff maintain a bill to perpetuate testimony against an absent defendant? In England, there is no process against an absent defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Mitf. P</em>l. 30. As to the case from Ambler, it does not appear whether the plaintiff or defendant was absent. The power is only given by our act of Assembly, which applies only to eases, where either the person of the party, or some subject, is within the jurisdiction of the Court. But, where neither the party nor his property is within the reach of process, a Court of Equity, upon its established principles, has no color of jurisdiction. The <em>contract </em>cannot give jurisdiction, because it is <em>transitory.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b55-5\"><em>November </em>10.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"APU\">The President,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">delivered the following as the opinion of the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The Court is of opinion, that there is no error in the decree, except so far as it gives costs to the appellee in the Chancery Court, as to which the said decree is erroneous; therefore it is decreed and ordered, that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant do pay unto the appellee, as the party substantially prevailing, his costs by him in this behalf expended, &amp;ic. and it is further ordered and decreed, that the bill of the appellant be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> Judges Cabell and Carr, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
