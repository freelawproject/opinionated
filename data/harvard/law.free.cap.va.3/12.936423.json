Before the sale was made, <em>Gaines </em>had contracted a small debt to <em>Richard Morris, </em>a retail dealer, to the amount of about 82 dollars, for articles of cloathing furnished by his directions, to his <em>three </em>wards, <em>Clarissa, Susan </em>and <em>Mary, </em>in different proportions; and he had contracted another debt to <em>William Thompson, </em>for like articles furnished by his directions, to his <em>four </em>wards, <em>Clarissa, Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>in different proportions, and <em>Thompson </em>held a bond of his testator <em>Thomas Gaines, </em>for a small debt; these claims of <em>Thompson </em>amounted to about 300 dollars; and <em>Gaines </em>owed <em>Thompson, </em>on other accounts, 300 dollars more.

Upon this, <em>Gaines, </em>in order to enable himself to command the fund, agreed to <em>give Broadus the younger </em>counter security; and, accordingly, at the county court of <em>Culpeper, </em>on the 17th January 1814, he gave a new administration bond, wherein <em>Boswell Yates </em>and <em>Larkin JValle </em>were his sureties. There was little doubt, that <em>Yates, </em>when he became <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>surety in the new bond, was aware of his object in giving it; namely, to obviate the objection of his original surety, <em>Broadus the younger, </em>and to enable him to command the fund arising from the sale of the land to <em>Broadus the elder.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">On the 18th January 1814, <em>Broadus the elder, </em>with <em>Broadus the younger </em>as his surety, executed <em>three </em>bonds for the purchase money of the land, though these bonds were <em>ante-dated </em>the 1st of that month; one to <em>Yates </em>for' his wife <em>Clarissa\u2019s </em>share of the purchase money; and <em>two </em>to <em>Gaines, as the guardian of Susan, Mary and Jjucy Gaines, </em>one for 600 dollars, the other for 183 dollars 50 cents; <em>Gaines </em>apprising him, that he wanted the bond executed for 600 dollars, in order that he might transfer it to <em>Thompson, </em>and the other bond executed for 183 dollars 50 cents, in order that he might transfer it to <em>JVorris. Yates </em>was present, understood the whole arrangement, and made no objection. <em>Gaines, </em>at the same time, executed a conveyance of the land to <em>Broajdus, </em>(which he afterwards sold to other persons.) And <em>Gaines </em>then transferred the bond for 600 dollars to <em>Thompson, </em>in satisfaction of the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>due him on the various accounts above mentioned ; and he transferred the other bond to <em>JYorris, </em>the debt due <em>JYorris </em>for the goods furnished by him to the wards <em>Clarissa, Susan </em>and <em>Mary Gaines, </em>being discounted from the amount, and the balance paid by <em>JYorris </em>to <em>Gaines </em>in cash. At the time these bonds were assigned to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>they each knew the consideration for which they had been executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">Very shortly after these transactions, <em>Gaines </em>went off to <em>Tennessee, </em>where he died insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\">In March 1814, <em>Boswell Yates </em>was appointed the guardian of <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>and <em>James Yates </em>was his surety in his guardian\u2019s bond. And upon the 24th of that month, he gave a written notice to <em>Thompson, JYorris </em>and <em>Broadus, </em>warning <em>Broadus </em>that, as the money for which the two bonds for 600 dollars and for 183 dollars 50 cents were executed to <em>Gaines, </em>belonged to his wards, he must not pay the amount thereof to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris </em>the assignees, and warning <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris </em>not to assign them away. Nevertheless, <em>Broadus </em>paid <em>Thompson </em>the whole amount of the larger bond which had been transferred to him by <em>Gaines, </em>with the avowed purpose of securing the money to him; and he paid <em>JYorris </em>150 dollars in part of the other bond that had been assigned to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">Afterwards, <em>Susan Gaines </em>intermarried with <em>JYimrod Rosson: </em>and then a bill was exhibited in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg </em>by <em>Boswell Yates </em>and <em>Clarissa </em>his wife, <em>JYimrod Rosson </em>and <em>Susan </em>his wife, and <em>Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>infants by <em>Boswell Yates </em>their next friend, against <em>Broadus the elder, Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>setting forth the facts of the transaction; insisting, that the money for which the bonds executed by <em>Broadus </em>to <em>Gaines, </em>and by him assigned to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>were given, belonged to <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>that <em>Broadus </em>was bound to look to the application of the purchase money of the land sold to him by <em>Gaines </em>under his testator\u2019s will, and that <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>taken the assignments of those bonds from <em>Gaines, </em>with full notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, were not entitled to hold them; and praying, that <em>Broadus </em>should be decreed to pay the money due by those bonds to the three plaintiffs thereto entitled, and that <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris </em>should be compelled, respectively, to deliver the bonds, if they yet held them, or it they had received the contents, to account tor and pay the amount they had respectively received, to the three plaintiffs entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\"><em>Broadus, </em>in his answer, to this bill, insisted that he was not bound to see to the application of the purchase money, and that his only duty was to pay the same to <em>Gaines </em>or to his assignees. And <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>in their answers, respectively, insisted that they were entitled to hold the bonds under <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>assignment, and that the plaintiffs could only look for redress to the sureties bound for <em>Gaines </em>in his guardian\u2019s bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">Pending this bill, <em>Mary Gaines </em>intermarried with <em>Willis Carr, </em>and the suit was thenceforth prosecuted in the name of <em>Carr and wife. </em>And the cause being heard on this bill, the answers thereto, exhibits and proofs, the court dismissed the bill as to the plaintiffs <em>Boswell Yates and wife </em>with costs; and gave the other plaintiffs leave to amend and make new parties, and substituted <em>Nimrod Rosson </em>in place of <em>Yates, </em>as the next friend of the infant plaintiff <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>to prosecute the suit on her behalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">Whereupon, <em>Nimrod Rosson </em>and <em>Susan </em>his wife, <em>Willis Carr </em>and <em>Mary </em>his wife, and <em>Lucy Gaines </em>by <em>Rosson </em>her next friend, exhibited an amended bill, wherein, referring to the former bill and proceedings thereupon, they made the following parties defendants, in addition to those made by the former bill; namely, <em>William Broadus the younger, </em>the surety of <em>William Gaines </em>in his first bond for the due administration of <em>Thomas Gaines\u2019s </em>estate; <em>Boswell Yates </em>and <em>Larkin Nalle, </em>the sureties in <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>second administration bond; <em>Arch.

It also appeared, that <em>Jones </em>the co-surety with <em>Tutt </em>for <em>William Gaines </em>as guardian of <em>Susan Gaines, </em>was not a resident of <em>Virginia: </em>That the three wards <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>had other property besides their shares of the proceeds of the land bequeathed to them by <em>Thomas Gaines\u2019s </em>will: And that in another suit prosecuted by the plaintiffs against the sureties of <em>Gaines </em>as their guardian, accounts of the guardianship had been taken, in which the,proceeds of this land had not been accounted for, and yet on those accounts there was a balance found in favor of the wards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-8\">The chancellor held, that the sureties of <em>Gaines </em>as guardian for <em>Susan Gaines, </em>were responsible to her for her share of the proceeds of the land, subject to a deduction for the goods furnished her by <em>Thompson </em>and by <em>JYorris </em>respectively; and deducting, accordingly, the amount of their bills respectively, from her share, he decreed that <em>Tutt (Jones </em>being a non resident) should pay the balance with interest, to the plaintiffs <em>Rosson and icife. </em>He held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>likewise, that <em>Tutt, Winston, </em>and the executrix of <em>Hughes, </em>the sureties of <em>Gaines </em>as guardian for <em>Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines </em>(the other surety, <em>Freeman, </em>being dead insolvent) were responsible to them respectively for their shares of the proceeds of the land, subject to deductions for the goods ^urn\u2019s^ec^ them respectively, by <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris; </em>and deducting the amount of <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>and <em>Morris\u2019s </em>bills por g00(js furnjshed to each of them, he decreed that <em>Tutt, Winston </em>and <em>Hughes\u2019s </em>executrix should pay to <em>Carr and wife, </em>and to <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>the balances due to each respectively, with interest. And he decreed the plaintiffs their costs against the defendants <em>Tutt, Winston </em>and <em>Hughes\u2019s </em>executrix. But the decree required the plaintiffs to release, by proper deeds, all their right, title and interest in the land, directed to be sold by <em>Thomas Gaines\u2019s </em>will, to the purchaser thereof from <em>William Gaines </em>his administrator, as a condition upon which they should be entitled to payment of the balances decreed to them. And the chancellor, declaring that the liabilities which he had thus imposed on the sureties of <em>G\u00fcines </em>as guardian of the plaintiffs, were caused by a fraudulent combination of the defendants <em>Thompson, Morris, Broadus the elder, </em>and <em>Boswell Yates, </em>with <em>Gaines </em>the guardian ; that each and all of those defendants participated in procuring <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>breach of trust, in regard to the fraud; and that, therefore, he would not undertake to discriminate among them, or to inquire how far the transaction enured to the benefit of either, but would hold each and all bound to reimburse the sureties, to the full extent of the injury sustained by them in consequence of this fraudulent combination ; therefore, decreed against the defendants <em>Thompson, Morris, Broadus the elder, </em>and <em>Boswell Yates, jointly, </em>that they should pay to the defendants <em>the sums </em>which .they were respectively decreed to pay the plaintiff, and their own costs expended in their defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">From this decree, <em>Broadus, Thompson </em>and <em>Morris, </em>first, appealed; and afterwards, <em>Winston </em>also, one of <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>sureties, prayed an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Y\"><em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>1. endeavoured to maintain, that they were entitled to hold the bonds assigned to them respectively by <em>Gaines, </em>or the money they had received from <em>Broadus </em>upon them : that they acquired by the assignment, the legal right to the bonds, and were not chargeable with any fraud, or participation in fraud, which could impair that right in equity. <em>JYorris </em>had a just claim against <em>Gaines </em>as guardian of <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines : </em>he took an assignment from <em>Gaines </em>of a bond executed to him as guardian of the same persons, for a greater amount, and paid him the difference in cash. <em>Thompson, </em>having claims against <em>Gaines, </em>as the representative of <em>Thomas Gaines, </em>upon that testator\u2019s bond, and as the guardian of <em>Clarissa, Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>the <em>cestuis que trust </em>to whom ho was accountable for the proceeds of the land he had sold to <em>Broadus, </em>amounting to 300 dollars, took from <em>Gaines, </em>the assignment of <em>Broadus\u2019s </em>bond for 600 dollars, in discharge of those claims, and of a debt of 300 dollars due him from <em>Gaines </em>on other accounts. To the amount of 300 dollars, then, this part of the fund was justly applied. And as to the residue of the bond assigned to <em>Thompson, Gaines </em>got no other advantage, and his wards, or the sureties for his guardianship, sustained no other loss, than he would have got, or they sustained, if he had sold the bond in the market. The assignees, in effect, did no more than cash the bonds; <em>they </em>paid <em>Gaines </em>the <em>money, </em>instead of <em>Broadus. </em>If <em>Broadus </em>had paid it to him, and he had then paid it to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>for exactly the same consideration for which he assigned them <em>Broadus\u2019s </em>bonds; in that case, he asked, could they have ever been held bound to refund the money ? and would not <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>sureties have been held liable for his alleged misapplication of the fund, without recourse against them ? He said, the actual case, in substance and in principle, was not materially different. And ho argued, that if <em>cestuis que trust </em>may pursue the trust subject in the hands of assignees of the trustee, in a case where the trustee has given no security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>for the due discharge of the trust, it was because the trustee has given no security, and the rights of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>can no otherwise be preserved; and it by no means followed, nor had it ever been held, that where the trustee has given ample security, his sureties, who have expressly undertaken to stand sponsors for his fidelity, may, for their . , . , .... . J V \u2022 own indemnity, pursue the subject in the hands ot assignees who have acquired the legal title from the trustee. But, 2. supposing <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris </em>bound to refund to <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>wards, or to his sureties, he said they could not be held jointly liable,, each with the other and with <em>Broadus </em>and <em>.Yates: </em>each of them should be held severally liable for what he had received of the money due on the bond assigned to him, over and above the amount of the debt due him by <em>Gaines </em>in his character of trustee. Now, <em>Norris, </em>had received of <em>Broadus, </em>only 150 dollars, in part of the bond for 183 dollars 50 cents assigned to him; he was entitled to 82 dollars for goods furnished <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>wards <em>Clarissa, Susan </em>and <em>Mary, </em>and was, therefore, bound to refund only 68 dollars with interest: the balance still due from <em>Broadus </em>upon this bond, ought to be decreed against <em>him. </em>And <em>Thompson </em>was also entitled to retain, out of the bond for 600 dollars assigned to him, the amount of the debts which were due to him from <em>Gaines </em>in his character of trustee, and which were fairly chargeable upon this .fund, and ought only to refund the residue with interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-11\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Briggs, </em>for <em>Tutt, Winston </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Q\">1. that there ought to have been no decree against these parties, the sureties bound for <em>Gaines </em>in his guardian\u2019s \u25a0bond. For the fund consisted wholly of the proceeds of land, sold by him as administrator with the will annexed of <em>Thomas Gaines: </em>the purchase money was due to him only .in that character: he was accountable for it, as administrator, to the legatees of his testator, not as guardian of the legatees, to them as his wards: he could not vary the character of his responsibility, and charge his sureties as guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>dian, by taking the bonds as guardian, for money due him as administrator. But 2. supposing these sureties were responsible at all, they insisted, that they ought not to be held primarily liable. <em>Broadus, </em>after he had been warned, that <em>Gaines </em>would probably misapply the fund, with full knowledge that he was in failing circumstances, with express notice that he intended to transfer the bonds to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>and for the purpose of enabling him so to transfer them, executed the bonds, at <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>request, for different sums: he was, therefore, a party to <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>breach of trust. He paid the money to the assignees, after he was warned of the just claims of the legatees : he thus wilfully, aided the assignees in appropriating the funds to themselves. As to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>they too knew that <em>Gaines </em>was in failing circumstances; and the bonds bore evidence on the face of them, that they were the property of <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>wards, <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines; </em>yet they took the assignment of them from <em>Gaines, </em>and enabled him to appropriate the money, in part at least, to his own use : <em>they </em>also were parties to his breach of trust. It was immaterial, whether they were seeking advantage to themselves, at the expense of his <em>wards, </em>or at the expense of his <em>sureties. </em>The parties entitled <em>to </em>the fund, have a right to pursue it in their hands. <em>Graff v. Castleman, </em>5 Rand. 195. Then, 3. <em>Broadus, </em>having participated and aided in <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>breach of trust; <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>having received the fund from him, with notice of the trust and of the breach of it; and these parties being bound to make good the loss ultimately, either to <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>wards, or to his sureties, whichever shall sustain it; and they, as well as the sureties being before the court, they ought to be held directly and primarily liable, instead of subjecting the sureties in the first instance, and giving them a decree over against the others. And 4. the chancellor ought to have given the sureties a decree against the same parties, for the costs of the plaintiffs which were decreed against them, as well as for their own costs incurred in their defence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees who were plaintiffs below, and f\u00b0r <em>Boswell Yates, </em>maintained,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWn\">that the former were entitled to relief against the sureties of their guardian; and, if necessary, against <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>who had got possession of their funds by improper dealings with the guar^an <em>&gt; </em>anc^ case these parties should prove insufficient, against <em>Broadus, </em>who had aided the guardian to misapply the fund. That the sureties of the guardian were, by law, directly responsible to the wards; and though in equity they might have recourse against others, if the sureties should fail, yet they were not bound to pursue their recourse against any but the sureties; and though it might have been immaterial, perhaps, how the order of responsibility had been arranged, there was no occasion to correct the decree in this respect. That the sureties of the guardian, being held accountable to the wards, for the fund which he had transferred to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>these parties, who had received the fund, ought to be compelled to pay it to the sureties; and if they proved insolvent, <em>Broadus, </em>who had certainly aided in the misapplication of the fund, ought to be held responsible to the sureties. But, he said, there was no reason why <em>Yates </em>should be held responsible in any way, in any event, or to any body; for, even supposing, with the chancellor, that he was a confederate with <em>Gaines, Broadus, Thompson, </em>and <em>Norris, </em>in the misapplication of the fund, yet he had received none of it himself, and it was not the province of the court to punish him : however, no such confederacy was justly imputable to him. The dis-mission of the original bill as to him and his wife was improper ; and it was yet more improper to decree the defendants their costs against him, and that before the final hearing. The decree was erroneous in two other respects: 1st, in requiring the plaintiffs to execute deeds of release of the land; a condition imposed upon them, it seemed, upon the supposition that it was doubtful, at least, whether <em>Gaines </em>had a right to sell it under the will of his testator: but there could be no doubt about it: for, though the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of <em>Thomas Gaines </em>devised that the land should be sold, as <em>was directed in a power of attorney to John Hilton, </em>yet that power was annulled by the testator\u2019s death, and the administrator with the will annexed was the proper person, and the only proper person, to make the sale. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 104. \u00a7 52. p. 388. 2ndly, In deducting the amount of the claims of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>for the goods furnished by them to <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy Gaines, </em>from their shares of the fund in question; because there was no proof that the claims were just; and because the guardian of an infant cannot apply the principal of his ward\u2019s estate to his maintenance, without an express order of court. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>G Rand. 444. But if the chancellor properly allowed this deduction, he was plainly right in allowing only the amount of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Morris\u2019s </em>bills against <em>Susan, Mary </em>and <em>Lucy, </em>respectively, to be deducted from the share of each; they had no pretence to claim, that their bills against <em>Clarissa, </em>should also be deducted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-4\"><em>Stanard. </em>The claims of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Morris </em>for goods furnished the wards, were well proved; for it appears, that their accounts were settled by <em>Gaines </em>the guardian, who was competent to make such settlement, and had no motive to admit any item which was unjust. As to the expenditure of the principal of the wards\u2019 estate: it appears they had other estate; and it nowise appears, that the whole expenditure for their support, exceeded the profits of their whole property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b47-9\">Txjckeb, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ArR\">It seems to be agreed on all hands, that there are errors in the proceedings and decree in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The first that occurs, is the dismissal of the original bill, as to <em>Yates and wife, </em>and decreeing them to pay costs. Whether he was or was not a participator in the fraudulent transaction complained of, his wife, and he of course, were necessary parties, either as plaintiffs or defendants, in this suit for the proceeds of the sale of the land, which were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>be divided among them all; and he being a proper party with his wife, they might well be joined as <em>plaintiffs, </em>for conformity. The dismissal as to them was therefore erroneous, and the more so, as the defendants were decreed their costs against them, before the cause was finally heard. Out of this error grew another. <em>Yates </em>having been, by the amended bill, made a party defendant, solely upon the supposition that he was liable for the fraud, his wife was not made a party, and was not a party at the hearing. These errors, however, are rendered unimportant by the subsequent proceedings in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">The errors in the final decree, are much more vital. All the parties complain of it. The plaintiffs complain, that <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris\u2019s </em>store accounts against them were allowed, and thus their recovery against the sureties of their guardian, was improperly reduced; and that the chancellor improperly required them to execute deeds of release of the land to the purchaser; which last objection, indeed, seems very obvious. The sureties of the guardian complain, that they are improperly charged, because the money claimed was not due to their principal <em>Gaines </em>as guardian, but as the representative of his testator, and he was responsible as administrator to the legatees, not as guardian to his wards; that, supposing them chargeable, they ought not to have been charged in the first instance; and that only their own costs are decreed to them against <em>Thompson and others,, </em>without including the costs decreed to the plaintiffs against them. <em>Thompson, Norris, Broadus </em>and <em>Yates, </em>each and all, insist that there ought to have been no decree against them; and complain yet more, that they are made jointly responsible for the whole of the sums decreed. Let us consider these objections, succinctly, in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">As to the plaintiffs\u2019 objection to the allowance of the store accounts. This rests upon two grounds; that there is no sufficient proof of the advance of the goods; and that, if there was, they were improperly paid for out of the principal of the infants\u2019 estate. The first of these grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>is not tenable. As it respects <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris\u2019s </em>deinands, the <em>bona fide </em>settlement and acknowledgement of the guardian, are, I think, conclusive. He and his sureties, indeed, are bound to shew, that those advances were necessary, and that they were really made; but the merchant is not bound to shew that they were necessary, since it is the province of the guardian to judge of that; nor can he be called upon for further proof of the delivery and price, than the acknowledgement of the guardian with whom he dealt. The other question is more difficult. If the guardian runs up an account for his ward, and pays it out of the principal of his estate, the merchant cannot be bound to refund if he was ignorant of the fact. But, where he is aware that he is receiving payment out of a fund which the law will not permit to be encroached on without an order of the court, I think he stands on no more advantageous ground than the guardian himself. In this case, both <em>Norris </em>and <em>Thompson </em>knew, before they received this money, that it was a part of the wards\u2019 principal estate. As such, according to <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>it could not properly be applied to their current expenses, without the authority of the proper tribunal; and it is, therefore, as necessary in reference to them, as it would be in relation to <em>Gaines, </em>to institute an inquiry, if it be insisted on, as to the propriety of the charge upon this portion of those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We come now to consider the objections of the sureties to the decree. They insist, that they ought not to be charged at all, because their principal was not chargeable as guardian, but as administrator to the legatees. But, in selling the land, he did not act as administrator, properly speaking; he acted as trustee. In taking the bonds as guardian, he charged himself with the fund as guardian; and in this he did right. But the sureties complain, that, at any rate, they should not be first charged. And this complaint I think well founded. If, as I suppose, <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris </em>are responsible and bound to refund, <em>they </em>ought to have been first charged. It is natural justice, not only to put the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>den on the right person, but to place it there in the first instance; since, otherwise, the most innocent party will bear the brunt of the suit. The only injury the plaintiffs can sustain by this compliance with the terms of the tribunal aid he invokes, is a short delay which is more than comPensated hy his proceeding here against all the parties together, instead of in detail. The claim of the sureties to jlave tjj0 costs which are decreed to the plaintiffs against them, reimbursed to them by the parties ultimately responsible, is deemed well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The other parties, over against whom the decree is rendered in favour of the sureties, are most loud in their complaints. They complain, and very justly, that they are all banded together, and the whole made responsible on the ground of fraud and conspiracy, not only for what they <em>have </em>received, but for what they have <em>not </em>received. <em>Yates, </em>for instance, has received nothing over and above his wife\u2019s just portion of the money; yet because he is supposed to have connived at the fraud, he is made responsible for the whole amount, although he has neither participated in the spoils, nor been the means of enabling others to acquire them. He was only engaged, I think, and that very naturally, in securing his wife\u2019s portion of the proceeds of sale which he had a right to receive. He was therefore improperly made a party with the view to charge him with this responsibility, but as he was a necessary party on other grounds (for a settlement of <em>his </em>accounts as guardian is demanded) the question of his costs must await the final decree as to that matter. Neither were <em>Yates </em>or <em>JYalle, Gaines\u2019s </em>sureties in the counter administration bond, necessary or proper parties in that character, since the sureties of the administrator were not liable for the proceeds of sale of the land. For the like reason, and because there was no foundation for proceeding against him, <em>Wm. Broadus the younger </em>was an improper party. And as to <em>James Yates </em>the surety in the guardian\u2019s bond of <em>Boswell Yates, </em>it is difficult to conceive on what ground he was made a party. As to all these the bill should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>With respect to <em>JYorris </em>and <em>Thompson </em>the case is very-different. <em>Thompson\u2019s </em>case seems to me beyond all doubt. He procured the payment out of the funds of <em>Gaines\u2019s </em>wards, of debts which were not due from them, or fairly chargeable on them. He procured this payment from a guardian notoriously failing, if not intirely insolvent, with a full knowledge of the misapplication of the funds, to the prejudice of bis wards or of his sureties. He was thus getting payment of his claims out of money which he knew could not be so applied without defrauding an infant or a surety. Equity has no allowance for such transactions, and will rigorously compel the restoration of the unjust acquisition. Whether be shall bo made responsible directly to the infant, or held responsible over to the sureties, is a matter, indeed, which the court arranges with regard to the rights of the plaintiffs who have a title to charge them all: but in whatever mode the responsibilities are arranged, he is bound (and in my opinion primarily chargeable) for what he has illegally received, though for nothing more. This can only be finally adjusted by an account, ascertaining how far the store account against the wards was fairly chargeable on the fund in question, unless the plaintiffs in the cause should waive the inquiry, and admit the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The case of <em>JYorris </em>is less clear so far as respects the money advanced for the bond. But, as by cashing the bond with a knowledge of the failing condition of <em>Gaines, </em>he must have foreseen, that he was facilitating the perpetration of a fraud and misapplication of the fund, I think he cannot shelter himself behind the technicality that <em>Gaines </em>had a right to receive the amount of the bond from <em>Broadus, </em>and that the transfer of it for the full amount in cash, was the same thing in effect. But for his interference the money might not, probably would not, and perhaps ought not to have been paid by <em>Broadus, </em>eleven months before it was due; and in the mean time, the sureties might have protected themselves by the ordinary remedies afforded by the law. I am therefore of opinion, that he too is chargeable in like manner as <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>As to <em>Wm. Broadus the elder, </em>if his case rested solely on the ground of his obligation to see to the proper application of the purchase money for the land sold by the administrator, I should regard him as exonerated by the execution of the bonds to the guardian, if the subsequent payment of them had been without objection. So far from its having been fraudulent to execute the bonds to the guardian, it was a prudent step, and not an improper one in <em>Broadus, </em>who was bound to see that those funds came to the guardian\u2019s hands. But his knowledge of the embarrassments of <em>Gaines, </em>his objecting to make any payment while his son was bound, and waiving all objection as soon as he was released, certainly place his conduct in an unfavourable light; and, as he has paid or in some manner satisfied the amount of the bonds or the greater part of them, notwithstanding the early warning he received not to do so, it cannot be denied that he ought to be held ultimately responsible in case of the insolvency of the other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">I, therefore, should reverse the decree, and enter a decree conforming with the opinions I have expressed on the several points. But the other judges differ with me in opinion upon some of the points, and concur in an order to be entered, which expresses the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">The decree which was entered upon <em>Winston\u2019s </em>appeal, declared, that he, and consequently his co-sureties for <em>Gaines, </em>were not injured by the decree of the court of chancery ; and, therefore, affirmed it as to him, with damages and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\" The decree entered upon the appeal taken by <em>Broadus, Thompson </em>and <em>JYorris, </em>declared, that so much of the chancellor\u2019s decree as was pronounced between the appellants and <em>Boswell Yates, </em>on the one side, and the sureties of <em>Gaines </em>the guardian, on the other, was erroneous in charging the <em>former, jointly, </em>to indemnify the latter against their responsibility to the plaintiffs; that <em>Yates </em>was in no way liable to indemnify them in any respect; and that the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>pellants were bound to indemnify them only to the amount of the bonds of <em>Broadus the elder </em>assigned by <em>Gaines </em>to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris, </em>respectively, after deducting their respective accounts against him as guardian, for the three female plaintiffs, respectively, and in respect to which, <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Norris </em>were <em>severally </em>liable, in the first instance, each for the amount of the bond assigned to him, subject to that deduction, and <em>Broadus the elder </em>was only responsible for any part thereof, which could not be recovered from them respectively; that <em>Winston and others, </em>the sureties, should not be at liberty to enforce payment of the sums of money decreed to them respectively, against <em>Thompson, Norris </em>and <em>Broadus the elder, </em>until they themselves should have paid the plaintiffs the sums decreed to be paid by them respectively; that the plaintiffs in case th'e sureties, or any of them, should fail to make due payment to them, should be at liberty to resort to this decree, and to prosecute it for their benefit, in the name of the surety so failing, against <em>Thompson, Norris </em>and <em>Broadus, </em>to make good the deficiency. And <em>Thompson, Norris </em>and <em>Broadus </em>were decreed to reimburse to the sureties, the costs of the court of chancery, decreed to the plaintiffs against them, as well as to pay them their own costs expended in their defence there.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
