Within thirty days thereafter an execution was levied upon the goods and chattels of <em>Imboden; </em>they being the same which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>removed from the demised premises; and within the same period <em>Geiger </em>gave notice to the sheriff that he claimed satisfaction of the rent due him, out of the proceeds of the sale thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-4\"><em>Imboden </em>being in fact insolvent, and <em>Lewis Harman </em>being bound in the execution as security; and having indemnified the sheriff, gave him notice not to pay <em>Geiger. </em>The sheriff applied to the Superior Court for the county of Augusta, from whence the execution issued, for directions in the case ; and the parties being brought before the Court, and heard, the Court held that <em>Harman </em>was entitled to have the money applied to the execution.
