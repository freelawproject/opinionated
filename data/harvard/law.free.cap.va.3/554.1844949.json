A forthcoming bond had been executed on the 14th day of March, 1821, by <em>John C ought an, </em>with <em>Drury Childers </em>and <em>Charles Garrott, </em>as his sureties. This bond was returned \u201cforfeited.\u201d A motion was made, and the defendants pleaded that they had performed the condition of the bond by delivering the property at the day. of sale, to the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-9\">On the trial, the defendants proved by witnesses, that the slave mentioned in the forthcoming bond, was tendered to the sheriff at Buckingham court-house, in the evening after 4 o\u2019clock, and before 5 o\u2019clock of the day of sale: that the sheriff refused to receive it, saying it was too late; and that the slave was in the cellar of a tavern at Buckingham courthouse, between 12 and 1 o\u2019clock of the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-10\">The County Court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs; and the defendants excepted to the opinion of the Court, setting out the foregoing evidence, and appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-11\">The Superior Court reversed the judgment, and the plaintiffs\u2019 appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-12\"><em>Bacchus, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2jl\">relied on the act of Assembly, <em>Sessions Acts of </em>1821, <em>p. </em>35, to prove that the property must be sold before 4 o\u2019clock of the day of sale; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>this not having been done, the bond was forfeited and the sureties remained bound.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-7\"><em>S. </em>Taylor, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9g5\">The bond was executed in Buckingham county, only ten days after the passage of the act in question. It is hardly to be supposed, that the defendants could have had notice of it. But however this may be, the act was made entirely for the benefit of the debtor, who might renounce its benefit if he pleased. In this case, he <em>did </em>renounce it by delivering the property <em>after 4 </em>o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-8\">The proceedings were irregular, because no issue was joined, and none tendered.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b567-9\"><em>December </em>1.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Adqr\">Judge Green,</author>\n<p id=\"AqL\">delivered his opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The objection, that no issue was joined in form upon the defendants\u2019 plea, has no weight. Executions are awarded on forthcoming bonds, in a summary way, upon motion. The pleadings may be <em>ore terms; </em>and the Court may pronounce judgment on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">The forthcoming bond in question, was given after the act of 1821, vvas in force; by which it was directed, that in certain eases, sales under executions should be made at the court-houses, on the first day of the Court, and between the hours of 12 and 4 o\u2019clock. The parties are to be presumed to have known this law; and I am satisfied, upon the facts stated in the bill of exceptions, did know it. When the obligors bound themselves to deliver the property, at the time and place appointed for the sale, \u201c to be sold to satisfy the execution,\u201d they bound themselves to deliver it, at such time as that it might then and there be legally sold, for that purpose; and the legal effect of the contract would be the same, if those words were omitted in the bond. In contracts appointing some act to be done on a given day, there is no inflexible rule that the party shall have until sun-down of the day, to perform his con\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tract. That time is allowed, when it appears, from the c\u00a1rcumstances 0f the case, to be most convenient to both parties; as if a sum of money is to be paid, that rule is adopted to avoid the inconvenience of one party being bound to wait the whole day for the other. But even in that case, payment must be made in time to count the money before sun-down. So that if a very large sum were \u2022to be paid, the payment should be made early in the day. 5 <em>Co. </em>114. The true rule is, that the stipulated act is to be performed at that period of the day, which may appear, from the circumstances of the case, to be the most proper for attaining the object of the contract, as, in case of a contract to pay money upon the transfer of stock; the party must pay within the hours, when the transfer of the stock can be made, according to the rules of the institution, which can alone complete the transfer. 1 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>160. If the parties are bound by the rules, in this respect, and must be supposed to have those rules in view when contracting, they ar\u00e9 surely bound by a statute. This statute, I incline to think, may fairly be considered as declaring the common opinion of the country, as to the convenient time for effecting a sale under execution, and as affording a good general rule, even in cases to which it does not, in terms, apply.</p>\n<p id=\"A8y\">It is true, as was said at the bar, that this statute was in troduced for the benefit of the debtor, in respect to the <em>place of sale, </em>but not as to the period of the day when sales should be made. In respect to that, the plaintiff, as well as the defendant, is interested; and it requires the consent of both parties, to justify the sheriff in departing from the directions of the statute. The consent of the defendant alone, would not be sufficient; nor would the delivery of the property, after the appointed hour, amount to such consent. In this case, the defendant did not intend that the delivery of the property should have that effect. The property was on the spot between 12 and 1 o\u2019clock. He delayed delivering it, until after 4 o\u2019clock, for the purpose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of avoiding the sale, at the same time that he supposed that the bond would be saved. If the sheriff liad accepted and sold the property, we should probably now be considering, whether he was not liable to the defendant, in damages, for that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court should be reversed, and that of the County Court, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The other Judges concurred. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> Absent, the President, and Judge Goalteb.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
