The declaration stated, that the slaves had been delivered by the plaintiff to the defendants\u2019 testator in his lifetime, on the 16th September 1822, to be by him re-delivered to the plaintiff when thereto requested, and the failure and refusal of the testator, in his lifetime, and of the defendants, his executors, since his death, to re-deliver them to the plaintiff. The defendants pleaded <em>the general issue.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-12\">At the trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel, after the argument before the jury had been begun and was nearly concluded, offered a demurrer to the evidence; and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that, in that stage of the trial, it was too late to demur; but the court overruled the objection. Then the defendants\u2019 counsel demurred to the evidence, and the plaintiff\u2019s joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>It appeared from the demurrer, that the plaintiff adduced four witnesses, <em>Massie, Mallory, Malle </em>and <em>Willis; </em>whose testimony was, in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">1. <em>Massie </em>testified, that on the third Sunday of September 1822, <em>Peter Hansbrough </em>deceased, called on the witness, and requested him to go with him to the plaintiff <em>Thom's </em>house, saying <em>he had made an arrangement with Thom to let him have some </em>negroes; the number was mentioned, but that the witness did not remember; the witness <em>Mallory </em>was present, and he probably remembered it. That <em>Hansbrough </em>further said, he was going to <em>Thom's </em>house <em>to complete the arrangement; </em>and, at the same time, told the witness, that <em>Thom </em>had purchased a tract of land at an unfortunate time, and (as he, <em>Hansbrough, </em>thought at the time the purchase was made) had given too much for it; that he had already assisted <em>Thom, </em>and intended to do more for him, if necessary; that it gave him pleasure to do so, as <em>Thom </em>had been very kind and attentive to him,' and bad rendered him services; that he had given <em>Thom </em>3000 dollars ; that he had given him a claim upon one <em>Carneal </em>of <em>Kentucky </em>(but the witness did not understand, that that claim was part of the 3000 dollars, nor did he remember that the amount of the claim was mentioned); that the 3000 dollars he had given <em>Thom, </em>was to <em>enable him to </em>comply with his unfortunate purchase of land, before alluded to, from one <em>Armistead. </em>The witness went with <em>Hansbrough </em>to <em>Thom's </em>house, according <em>to his </em>request, but returned without alighting from his horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-12\">2. <em>Mallory </em>testified, that, in September 1822, he fell in company with <em>Peter Hansbrough </em>deceased, who, in the course of conversation, informed him, that he was on his way to <em>Fredericksburg, </em>and below. That the witness invited <em>Hansbrough </em>to go home with him, as he lived immediately in his route; which <em>Hansbrough </em>declined, stating as his reason for taking another route, that he had <em>made arrangements with Thom to let him have some slaves, and that there ivas to be a final close of the arrangement the next</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>morning; he mentioned the number of slaves, <em>seventeen. </em>That, in the same conversation, <em>Hansbrough </em>said, that he had great confidence in <em>Thom; </em>that <em>Thom </em>appeared from his habits and management likely to do well; that <em>Thom </em>had rendered him considerable <em>services, for ivhich he had fully compensated him; </em>that he had let <em>Thom </em>have some money that was due him in <em>Kentucky, </em>and <em>had more than compensated Ms services. </em>That, some two or three weeks after this conversation, as <em>Hansbrough </em>was returning home from the lower country, the witness fell in with him again, and he went home with the witness to breakfast; he then told the witness, he should have come to his house the evening before, but for some business he had with <em>Dr. Waugh, relative to the slaves he had let Thom have, as Dr. W. had hired one of them. </em>That <em>Hansbrough\u2019s </em>residence was some twelve or fourteen miles from <em>Thom\u2019s. </em>That <em>Hansbrough </em>was a man of strong mind, and particular in matters of business ; and both he and <em>Thom </em>were well acquainted with the mode and forms of doing business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-4\">3. <em>JYalle </em>testified, that, in the spring of 1822, there having been some motions made in the circuit court of <em>Culpeper </em>against <em>Thom </em>as the surety in some forthcoming bonds, <em>Peter Hansbrough </em>deceased observed to the witness, that he had a great regard for <em>Thom, </em>and wished him to do well; he thought him too liberal in becoming surety: upon which the witness observed to <em>Hansbrough, </em>that if <em>Thom </em>should have the money to pay to any of them, he <em>Hansbrough </em>was so wealthy he would not let him lose it: <em>Hansbrough </em>answered, he would like to aid <em>Thom. </em>That, about a month before <em>Hansbrough\u2019s </em>death, in another conversation between him and the witness concerning <em>Thom, Hansbrough </em>said that he had done a good deal for <em>Thom; </em>that <em>Thom </em>had purchased land at an unfortunate time, and that he had aided him in paying for the land. And the witness was induced to believe, from what <em>Hansbrough </em>said in this conversation, though he did not expressly say so, that he intended to pay for the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>4. <em>Willis </em>testified, that, in September 1822, a day or two before <em>Peter Hansbrough </em>deceased set off on his journey below (to the county of <em>King George) </em>the witness had a conversation with <em>Hansbrough, </em>in which <em>Hansbrough </em>observed he had some women and children that rendered him but little service; that, on his way down he should call at <em>Thom\u2019s </em>house, and expected <em>to let him have some of his negroes. </em>That, some time previous to this conversation (it might be two, three, or six months before), <em>Hansbrough </em>told the witness, he intended <em>selling a parcel of his negroes to Thom; that Thom might pass them off to Armistead, for a debt he owed him; and that he Hansbrough could wait with Thom for the purchase money. </em>That <em>Hansbrough </em>lived twelve or fourteen miles from <em>Thom\u2019s </em>residence. That when <em>Hansbrough </em>went down the country in September 1822, he was absent from home about two weeks; and he was taken sick about three days after his return home, and died the 15th October 1822. That, in November 1822, <em>Thom </em>shewed the order herein after mentioned to the defendants, and demanded of them the slaves in the declaration claimed, which they refused to deliver to him. That <em>Hansbrough </em>had four children, <em>Peter </em>(the father of <em>Mrs. Thom) James </em>and <em>William Hansbrough, </em>and <em>Amelia </em>the wife of <em>James Pell; </em>and he had had another son, <em>John, </em>who was dead leaving five children. This witness also proved the values of the slaves claimed in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">5. It was admitted by the parties, that the whole number of the deceased <em>Peter Hansbrough\u2019s </em>grand children, was thirty-five; and that he was a very wealthy man, not much in <em>debt; </em>his estate disposed of by his will, was worth from 100,000 to 150,000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">6. The plaintiff also gave in evidence the order mentioned by <em>Willis; </em>which was in these words: <em>\u201cMr. John Henderson </em>will <em>shew and deliver </em>to <em>Col. George Thom, </em>the following negroes, viz: <em>Pompey (he has seen), Moses, Harry, Sarah </em>and her three children with her, <em>Patt, </em>(about the house), <em>Caroline </em>and her two boys, <em>Sally </em>and her three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>children, <em>Linda </em>and her child. And oblige <em>P. Ilansbrough. </em>16th September 1822.\u201d And it was admitted by the defendants, that this order and the signature thereto, was in the hand writing of <em>Peter Ilansbrough </em>deceased; and that <em>John Henderson, </em>to whom the order was addressed, was at its date, and at <em>Ilansbrough\u2019s </em>death, his overseer, and had in his custody the slaves in the order mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">The slaves mentioned in the above order, were the slaves claimed in the declaration. And this was all the evidence in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for the slaves in the declaration claimed, ascertaining the value of them respectively, subject to the opinion of the court upon the demurrer to evidence. The court held that the law upon the demurrer was for the plaintiff, and gave him judgement upon the verdict. And the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-13\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apb\">said, that upon the evidence stated in the demurrer, <em>Thom, </em>certainly could not sustain his claim to the slaves in question, upon the ground of a <em>gift </em>made to him by <em>Ilansbrough. </em>The statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. \u00a7 <em>51. </em>p. 432. annulled <em>every gift of slaves, </em>unless the same be made by deed or will, duly proved and recorded, or unless the subject at some time come into the actual possession of, and remain with, the donee or some person claiming under him. Yet, he had little doubt, the judgement of the circuit court proceeded upon the opinion, that here was proof of a gift of slaves to be delivered <em>at a fu~ ture day, </em>and that the provision of the statute applied not to gifts of that kind, but only to gifts of slaves which, by the terms of the gift, are to <em>be presently </em>delivered to the donee. But this distinction had been exploded by a decision of this court, of which the circuit court, when it decided this cause, was not apprised. <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Dunkly, </em>6 Rand. 135. Then, the only question was, whether a <em>sale </em>of these slaves by <em>Ilansbrough </em>to <em>Thorn, </em>could <em>fairly </em>be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>inferred from the evidence set out in the demurrer ? For though, upon a demurrer to evidence, the court may and must presume every fact, which the jury might have inferred from the evidence; yet those conclusions of fact must be such as a jury might <em>from a just and reasonable construction, have made, </em>and not arbitrary inferences or such as might be drawn from a part only of the whole evidence; <em>per Roane, </em>J. in <em>Stephens v. White, </em>2 Wash. 210, 11. The demurrant waives all evidence on his part, that directly or by inference conflicts with the evidence adduced by the other party, and admits all that can <em>reasonably be </em>inferred from his adversary\u2019s evidence; <em>per Green, </em>J. in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>2 Rand. 357. Now, he said, the definition of a <em>salq </em>was, a transmutation of property from one man to another, in consideration of some price or recompense in value; for there is no sale without a recompense; there must be a <em>quid pro quo. </em>And though there be a contract to <em>sell </em>goods for a stipulated price, yet if neither the money or some part of it be paid, nor the goods or some portion thereof delivered, nor tender made, nor any subsequent agreement entered into, it is no contract, and the owner may dispose of the goods as he pleases. 2 Black. Comm. 44G, 8. In the case at bar, there was no evidence of any price or recompense stipulated to be paid or given by <em>Thom </em>to <em>Hansbrough; </em>not even a pretence of the kind; much less, that any money was actually paid; and it was certain, that there was no delivery of the slaves, or any of them. Bearing these principles in mind, it would not be a <em>reasonable </em>inference from the evidence, it would be a very strained inference indeed, that here was a sale of these slaves by <em>Hansbrough </em>to <em>Thom.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-10\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellee, premised,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtB\">that a party cannot by demurrer to evidence, withdraw a contested question of fact from the jury, and submit it to the court; that would be to abrogate <em>pro tanto, </em>the trial by jury; the demurrant admits every fact which the jury <em>could </em>find from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the evidence; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>5 Rand. 1. And then, they said, it was apparent, that <em>Thom </em>claimed these slaves, upon the ground of a <em>sale, </em>not a <em>gift, </em>thereof by <em>Hansbrough </em>to him ; that was the question of fact contested between the parties; <em>that </em>the point to which <em>Thom's </em>evidence was adduced. And the sale might be <em>fairly </em>inferred from the evidence; or rather nothing but a <em>sale </em>could be inferred from it. <em>IIansbrough, </em>in the first conversation with <em>Willis, </em>told him he intended <em>selling </em>some of his negroes to <em>Thom, </em>and that <em>he could wait with him for the purchase money; </em>and, in the second conversation with that witness, just before the transaction, he told him he intended <em>to let Thom have some of his slaves. </em>He told <em>Massie, </em>he <em>had made an arrangement </em>with <em>Thom, </em>to let him have some negroes, and that <em>he </em>was going to <em>Thom's to complete the arrangement. </em>He told <em>Mallory, </em>he had <em>made arrangements </em>with <em>Thom, </em>to let him have <em>seventeen </em>slaves, and that there was to be <em>a final close of the arrangement </em>the next morning ; and after-wards, that he had been to <em>Dr. Waugh's </em>on business relative to the slaves he had let <em>Thom </em>have, as <em>Dr. W. </em>had hired one of them. This language was wholly incompatible with the idea of a <em>gift, </em>and only to be accounted for upon the supposition that a <em>sale </em>was intended and made. The order of the 16th September 1822 sufficed of itself to shew that a <em>sale </em>had been made : Why else was the property to <em>he shewn </em>to Thom? As to the want of evidence of the price to he paid, that was evidence which would naturally be placed in <em>Hansbrough's </em>own bands, and (it might fairly be presumed) was in the hands of the defendants, his executors. And <em>Johnson </em>said, he had laboured in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>to induce the court to bring back our practice, in relation to demurrers to evidence, to the true, convenient and just practice of the english courts, that of compelling the demurrant to make a distinct admission upon the record, of the facts which the evidence demurred to conduces to prove: it conformed best with the right of jury trial; it was due to the party whose evidence was demurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to; it was safest for the demurrant himself. If the <em>Virginia </em>practice was to be persisted in, he said, the court upon the argument of the law on a demurrer to evidence, must take the demurrant as admitting <em>all that the evidence conduced, to prove; </em>otherwise, these demurrers will be only a device to give' the trial of questions of fact to the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-11\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ayy\">This case comes before us upon a demurrer to evidence. My general view of the practice with respect to such demurrers, has been given in the case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>to which I refer. In the case before us, the evidence is all on the side of the plaintiff, and we are to say whether it makes such a case as would authorize a jury, by fair inference, to say that the slaves for which this action was brought, are the property of the plaintiff? (Here the judge stated the substance of the evidence, and then proceeded). In my mind the natural, fair, and, I might say, necessary inference from the evidence is, that <em>Hansbrough </em>sold these slaves to <em>Thom; </em>and the order to the overseer was such a transfer and delivery, as passed the property, and enabled him to maintain <em>detinue </em>for them. That it was a <em>sale, </em>the whole course of the transaction seems to shew: <em>Hansbrough </em>said nothing about <em>giving Thom </em>the slaves: and if it had not been for the relative situation of the parties, and the wealth of <em>Hansbrough, </em>such an idea could never have arisen. He told one witness, that he meant to <em>sell </em>slaves to <em>Thom; </em>and to others he said, he had made or was <em>making arrangements </em>for letting him have slaves &amp;c. What <em>arrangements </em>could be necessary if he meant to <em>give </em>them ? Finally, the order itself imports a <em>sale: \u201c </em>you will <em>shew </em>and deliver &amp;c.\u201d Why <em>shew </em>them, if <em>Thom </em>was a donee merely ? That such an order upon a sale is a transfer of the property, was decided by this court in <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Pendleton, </em>6 Rand. 473. and many cases there cited to shew that it is settled law. I am well satisfied, therefore, that upon this record the plaintiff has a good title to the slaves, and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">I cannot perceive that any inconvenience arises, from the practice in this country, of compelling a joinder in demurrer, without a formal admission on the record, on the part of the demurrant, of all the inferences of fact which the court may conceive to be fairly deducible from the evidence demurred to. On the contrary, I think our practice is better calculated to effect the purposes of justice, than the practice, said to prevail in <em>England, </em>of compelling the demurrant to make the admissions, before the opposite party is compelled to join in the demurrer. It is <em>the court, </em>according to both practices, that is <em>to </em>determine on the inferences which are fairly deducible from the evidence, and the court can, certainly, perform this function much more correctly, on grave consideration, on the final argument of the demurrer, than in the hurry and bustle of a jury trial. Nor is it any objection to a demurrer to evidence, that the evidence is circumstantial, and even complicated ; as will clearly appear from the case of <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>White. </em>In the case before us, the evidence, circumstantial in its nature, was all offered by the plaintiff, and was free from contradiction. If the defendant chose to risk a demurrer I can perceive nothing in the case, to deprive him of the right to do so. Sales and gifts need not be <em>positively </em>proved. They may be inferred from circumstances. And the defendants here, in admitting by their demurrer, the truth of all the facts positively proved by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, necessarily <em>left </em>with the court the right to <em>infer </em>from those facts, whatever the jury might have fairly and reasonably inferred from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The real question before us is, whether we are to infer a <em>sale </em>or a <em>gift </em>? It seems to be admitted, that the one or the other may be <em>fairly </em>inferred. And I will here take occasion to say, that a demurrer admits only those things which may be <em>fairly </em>inferred.\u2014I am decidedly of opinion, that the just and fair inference from the testimony, is that <em>Hansbrough sold </em>the slaves to <em>Thom, </em>and that he did not <em>give </em>them. It is true, that he regarded <em>Thom </em>with eyes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>favour, and that his obiect was to aid him in paying for the land which he had bought. But a <em>gift </em>was not the only mobe by which that object could be accomplished. Aid might be extended by a sale of slaves, which <em>Thom </em>could readily apply towards discharging his debt; the vendor <em>Hansbrough </em>consenting to take a <em>very </em>low price, or even a full price, on long time of payment. It is in express proof that <em>Hansbrough </em>said, two, three, or six months before the transaction took place, that he intended to <em>sell Thom </em>a parcel of his negroes, and <em>wait with him for the purchase money; </em>and that <em>Thom </em>might apply them to the discharge of his debt. And the testimony exhibits him to the last moment, as engaged in negotiations and arrangements, in relation to these negroes, to which he regarded the concurrence of <em>Thom </em>as necessary. All this is intirely consistent with the idea of a <em>sale, </em>but is utterly incompatible with the idea of a <em>loan </em>or <em>gift. </em>The order, therefore, given to <em>Thom </em>for the slaves, proves, when taken in connexion with the other testimony, a <em>sale </em>and not a <em>gift. </em>I think the judgement should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b180-6\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayq6\">Upon the trial of this cause in <em>the </em>circuit court, the defendants by their counsel tendered a demurrer to evidence, which was joined by the counsel for the plaintiff. He objected, it is true, to the court\u2019s permitting the defendants to demur; but this seems to have been because it was allowed after some progress had been made in the cause before the jury; an objection which according to the case of <em>Hoyle </em>v. <em>Young, </em>1 Wash. 150. was not tenable. It is not distinctly asserted, that he was <em>compelled </em>to join in the demurrer, and may therefore be considered as having voluntarily done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Upon this demurrer to evidence, nothing appears but the evidence produced by the plaintiff to support the issue joined on his part; and the case is, therefore, freed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the embarrassment which has arisen, and may often arise, . . where a variety of testimony is introduced on both sides, and all inserted in the demurrer, in pursuance of our settled _ i i \u2022 i \u2022 t practice in <em>Virginia. </em>But, though the case is disembarrassed in this regard, it is not without its difficulties, arising out of the exceedingly remote inferences, which it is proposed to draw from the matters set forth in the demurrer. The discussion has given rise to renewed remarks upon the difference between the english practice and ours, on demurrers to evidence; a subject fully discussed in <em>Green v. Judith, Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>and other cases. The practice with us is assailed, both as inconvenient, and as trenching upon the unquestioned privilege of the party, to have the facts of his case determined by the jury, instead of their being submitted to the decision of the court. Without meaning to bring these matters into serious discussion, or to compare the relative conveniences of the two modes of proceeding, I shall avail myself of the occasion to make one or two observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In the first place, I will remark, that I perceive no essential difference between the english practice and ours, as to the privilege of jury trial. By the former, it is required that the demurrant shall admit <em>every fact, </em>which the evidence of his adversary conduces to prove; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 H. Black. 207. Who is to decide what facts the evidence thus conduces to prove? Not the jury, assuredly, but the court. <em>Id. </em>209. So with us : the demurrant being held to admit all that the jury could reasonably infer against him from the evidence, and to waive all his own testimony which contradicts that offered against him, and all objections to the credit of the testimony demurred to, the court rio more passes upon the credit or the weight of evidence here, than in the english courts. The only difference is, that in <em>England, </em>according to what is <em>said </em>in the cases, the facts which the evidence conduces to prove, are ascertained by the court at the time of the demurrer, and spread upon the record, and thus distinctly admitted by the demurrant; whereas, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Virginia, </em>those facts are ascertained by the court at the time of the argument of the demurrer, as fairly inferrible from the testimony of the party, the verity of which his adversary is not permitted to question. Whether the one or the other course is most convenient, seems to be a subject of difference between the most able judges : Compare the opinion of <em>Green, </em>J. in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>2 Rand. 357. with that of <em>Carr, </em>J. in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Judith, </em>5 Rand. 4. But, I confess that I am upon reflection strongly inclined to think with judge <em>Green, </em>that with the limitations prevailing in our courts, \u201c the party whose evidence is demurred <em>to, </em>has all the benefit of the ancient practice, without subjecting the other party to its <em>inconveniences; </em>and no disputed fact is taken from the jury and referred to the court.\u201d There are, it is true, some difficulties, where there is a variety of facts on <em>both </em>sides, the practice in reference to which yet remains to be settled. With those I shall not meddle here.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">I remark, next, that, notwithstanding the position that the demurrant must admit upon the record, the facts which the evidence conduces to prove; and notwithstanding the observation of lord chief justice <em>Eyre </em>in <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>that the court is to regulate the admissions which are to be made upon the record; yet the demurrer to evidence in that case, set forth, as we do, the evidence at length, and not the facts it was supposed to prove. And though it is true the court decided \u201cthat'the examination of witnesses had been conducted so loosely, or the demurrer been so irregularly framed, that there was no manner of certainty .in the state of facts, upon which judgement could be founded,\u201d and moreover declared that the defendant could not compel the plaintiff to join in demurrer, \u201c unless he distinctly admitted upon the record, every fact and every conclusion which the evidence given for the plaintiff <em>conduced </em>to prove;\u201d yet this rule does not appear to have been rigorously followed in other cases, even in <em>England. </em>For, in <em>Cocksedge </em>v. <em>Fanshaw, </em>Doug. 119. long anteriour to <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>the demurrer was framed precisely like our <em>own; </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>will appear from the note to <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 H. Black. See too, 2 Plow. 1. and Tidd\u2019s prac. forms 325. I doubt not, our practice has been taken from that case, decided in the court of king\u2019s bench by <em>Mansfield </em>and <em>Puller. </em>Be this as it may, our reports, from <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>time to the present day, bear recorded evidence of the uniformity of the practice in <em>Virginia, </em>of inserting the evidence in the demurrer, putting no admissions upon the record, and leaving the inferences from the evidence, to the court, as is now customary in our tribunals. In all our courts (and there are more than <em>two hundred </em>of them) this is the received practice. It would be pregnant with mischief to attempt to change it judicially. On the faith of the decisions of this court, parties litigant have acted, and are perhaps at this moment acting. It is one of those matters of practice which goes to the very right of the parties, and not to form merely? and he who has rested his case upon a demurrer drawn according to the established practice of our courts, may lose his estate through faith in our adjudications, if we should now unexpectedly alter the course of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Lastly, I will observe, before I proceed to pronounce on the particular case before us, that I think the expression, \u201c that the demurrant must admit, or is considered as admitting, every fact which the evidence may <em>conduce </em>to prove,\u201d must not be understood too broadly. The language of this court is more appropriate; \u201c that the demurrant must be considered as admitting all that could <em>reasonably be inferred </em>by a jury from the evidence given against him.\u201d For evidence may <em>conduce, </em>that is, tend or contribute towards the proof of a fact, which it is very far from establishing, and which could not be fairly inferred from it. Thus, in the present case: the order from <em>Hansbrough </em>to his overseer to shew and deliver the slaves to <em>Thom, </em>is one link, and a very important one, in the chain of proof to establish the fact of a sale by the former to the latter; and, in this sense, it may very truly be said to conduce to prove a <em>sale. </em>But, surely, from that fact alone, no jury or court could be justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>fled in inferring a <em>sale, </em>which is a transaction complicated of various facts, such as the transfer of the property by the vendor, and the actual delivery of the possession to, and the payment of a consideration by, the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">What then, is the case under consideration ? It is a case in which, aocording to my conception, nothing can be inferred in favour of the plaintiff, except that <em>Hansbrough </em>had made him a <em>present </em>of the slaves from motives of regard. So strong, indeed, is this evidence\u2014evidence too introduced by the plaintiff himself\u2014that I have not the slightest doubt he went for a <em>gift </em>upon the trial of the cause, and that the judgement of the court proceeded upon the sufficiency of the evidence to establish such gift. On no other principle, can we account for his introducing this sort of evidence, instead of that of agreed price. The circuit court was not apprised of the decision in <em>Durham </em>v. <em>Dunkly, </em>6 Rand. 135. and it is very possible, that very decision has induced the appellee to shift his battery, and go for a <em>sale, </em>as he now finds he cannot sustain his title as a <em>gift. </em>Be this as it may, there is nothing which, to my mind, can justify the inference that there was a <em>sale. </em>A sale implies a contract, for a valuable consideration. The case, as it is presented, affords no foundation, on which to rest even a violent presumption, that there was a consideration paid, contracted to be paid, or contemplated by the parties. Had there been such a consideration, the evidence would lead us very fairly to infer that we should have heard of it, through the witnesses, from the communicative old man. But his design was to <em>aid </em>his grandson, not to traffic with him. He meant to relieve him by paying his debt, not by shifting his burden. The only instance of his speaking of <em>selling </em>the slaves, occurred some months before ; while all his recent conversations pointed to an act of benevolence from a rich old man to a favourite kinsman. The whole testimony, indeed, <em>conduces\u2019, </em>that is, leads or tends, to prove that a <em>gift </em>was intended and not a <em>sale. </em>I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgement ought to be reversed. But the opinion of the court is that it be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
