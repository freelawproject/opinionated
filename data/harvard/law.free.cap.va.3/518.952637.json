And forty-one years having elapsed from the time of the survey, without their having taken any steps to procure a patent, the land was liable to be entered and patented under the act 1 Rev. Code, ch. 86, \u00a7 38, p. 329. And that when <em>Norvell </em>procured a patent for this land in 1794, in the name of all the children of <em>George Christian, </em>it vested in them the legal title. That the evidence not only did not establish a fraud on the part of <em>Norvell </em>in procuring the patent in the name of the four-children, but it shewed that he could have had no motive for the commission of such a fraud. That conceding <em>James Christian </em>was a minor when the patent was obtained, he had, after coming of age, ratified and confirmed it by repeated acts and declarations; with a full knowledge of his rights, and was thereby estopped from avoiding it. <em>Zouch </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>3 Burr.

And as it was a contract executed, the doctrine of champerty and maintenance could have no application to it, even if it could have been applicable before the contract had been executed. This contract having been fairly made upon a valuable consideration, which had been fully and successfully rendered ; and having been executed, it is not competent to <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>now to set it aside. <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Mason\u2019s R. 252; <em>Gore </em>v. <em>Brazier, </em>3 Mass.

They bought with the patent and joint deeds before them; and thus have been misled by <em>James Christian </em>himself; and cannot now be affected by any claim which he may set up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>It was argued, thirdly, that as there was an actual adversary possession of the lands conveyed to <em>Norvell </em>by <em>James Christian </em>and the other children of <em>George Christian, </em>when the deed of 1805 was made by <em>James Christian </em>to <em>Watts </em>and <em>Murphy, </em>and as that was a deed of bargain and sale, these lands did not pass by it. <em>Duvall v.

And as there was no warranty of title in it, the lands, when afterwards the possession was obtained by <em>James Christian, </em>in 1820, did not vest in the trustees. <em>Doswell </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>3 Leigh 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-15\">For the appellees, it was insisted: That the fact that <em>James Christian </em>was the unquestioned heir at law of <em>George; </em>that <em>Reuben Norvell </em>was his guardian and the guardian of the younger children ; that without any assigned or assignable just cause, he abandoned the rights of the heir at law, and obtained the patent in the name of all the children; that in managing the controversies which grew out of this patent, the guardian <em>Reuben Norvell, </em>never disclosed the rights of the heir at law, and that with reference to the pre-existing equitable rights of <em>John </em>and <em>George Christian, </em>the Court of Appeals has held this patent entirely inoperative, except so far as to constitute the patentees trustees for those who held the prior equitable rights, necessarily characterize the patent as fraudulent and void to every other purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-16\">Regarding this patent as thus fraudulent and void in its inception, nothing has subsequently occurred to give it effect. Prior to the deed of 1805, no written act is pretended which could sanction this patent, except the contract with <em>Norvell </em>in 1801. This contract does not confirm it in terms, nor does it confirm it by any fair impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>cation. On the contrary, that contract itself was a gross fraud. As it respects the younger children of <em>George </em>Christian, the contract does not profess to give any consideration for the relinquishment to them of <em>James'1 </em>rights as heir at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-4\">Prior to the deed of trust of 1805, no other act of <em>James Christian </em>is relied upon; and the only things relied upon are parol declarations made without consideration and without solemnity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-5\">Every thing done and said by <em>James Christian </em>subsequent to the year 1805, is without authority, so as in any manner to affect the rights of the other <em>cestuis que trust. </em>By the deed of trust, he had divested himself of all title, legal and equitable, in the <em>subject; </em>had vested that title in others, and could neither do any thing, nor say any thing to impair that title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-6\">But the acts themselves subsequent to 1805, which are relied upon to give efficacy to the joint patent, are of very little import; such as uniting in deeds, co-operating in sales, and standing by seeing the purchase money distributed to the younger children. These are acts which the trustees, who had assumed the control of his whole estate for the benefit of others, ought not to have permitted, and must themselves be responsible for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b559-7\">This view of the case, seems to render almost superfluous a reference to authorities on the subject of this patent.

R. 292, and to the cases there collected in a note by the reporter at the end of his report of the case, p. 302; and to <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>1 Atk. 488; <em>Mellish </em>v. <em>Mellish, </em>1 Cond.

The patent was procured by the sole act of <em>N\u00b0rveM </em>guardian, in gross violation of his duty, without any apparent agency of <em>James, </em>or the other infants. And the younger children do not appear to have contributed one cent towards the expense, or to have incurred one moment of trouble about the matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQM\">The authorities, therefore, to shew what is a valuable consideration, are misapplied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-10\">2d. Does the contract with <em>Norvell </em>of the 16th January 1801, or the deed alleged to have been made to him in 1820, confer any rights on him, or on those claiming under him ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-11\">It is supposed that the fairness of the contract of 1801 cannot be doubted. This is a bold assumption, at least in the mouth of <em>NorvelVs </em>counsel. Its fairness is confidently denied. That the contract was fraudulent in fact, is proved by all the circumstances, and especially by the very terms of it ,\u2022 and that it was fraudulent and void in law, is proved by the relation of agent which <em>Norvell </em>then held towards the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-12\">Counsel are mistaken in supposing that the consideration for this contract was <em>past </em>and <em>prospective </em>expense and service. The contract itself shews that the only consideration was <em>past </em>expense and trouble in the suits in Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-13\">As to the deed of 1820. It is a misfortune that this deed is not in the record. It would then be seen who are the parties to it, what were the lands conveyed by it, and what the consideration. It is conceded, however, that its foundation was the contract of 1801, and that, therefore, only one half of the lands embraced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the deed were to be paid for. And enough does appear in the record, to shew that much more land was embraced by this deed than the defendant <em>Norvell </em>had any colour of claim to under the contract of 1801, had that contract been fair and lawful; if indeed under that contract he had any colour of claim to any part of the land embraced by the deed of 1820.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-4\">Under these circumstances, the alleged deed of 1820 cannot be held as giving to <em>Norvell </em>even the legal estate. But if it gave that, he took the naked legal estate as trustee for the rightful owners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-5\">Does the deed of 1820 give any rights to those claiming under <em>Norvell ?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">The only party now before the Court of Appeals, preferring such claim, is <em>Charles Mundy. </em>To sustain that claim, he must shew that he is a complete purchaser, having obtained the legal title and paid the purchase money without notice of the equity. We submit that he has failed in all these things. He has not sufficiently pleaded that he was purchaser without notice; he has not proven that he has paid his purchase money; and he has not proven that the legal title was ever in <em>Norvell, </em>or is now in him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\">3d. What was the effect of the deed of 1805 f The first objection made to this deed is, that it does not pass the lands in controversy, because <em>James Christian </em>was not in possession of them at the date of the deed, but that there was then an actual adversary possession of them. It is not necessary to criticise the language of this deed, it is as broad as can be, and certainly sufficient in law to convey all the rights, legal and equitable, which <em>James Christian </em>could then convey by any form of words. We may admit that he could not convey lands then in the actual adversary possession of another, but we deny that there is a particle of proof in the record to shew that he was out of possession, or that any one else was in adversary possession of one acre of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lands. But if there had been any actual adversary possession, so that the title did not pass at the date of the deed, and the trustee afterwards recovered <em>the lauds, or </em>sold them and received the purchase money, it would not be in their mouths to allege that the lands never passed by the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYaa\">It is urged against this deed that, on account of its vagueness and generality in the description of the property conveyed, even although duly recorded, it was not binding on purchasers without actual notice of it. It is submitted that this objection cannot be valid. Subsequent purchasers must take notice of deeds duly recorded ; and in what respect is this deed less effectual as notice than if each particular tract of land owned by <em>James Christian </em>were enumerated in it ? This deed gives full notice that <em>James Christian </em>had no lands after its date ; and that would be sufficient to prevent any one from taking a conveyance from him of any lands owned by him prior to the date of the deed of trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-5\">As to this deed, we insist that it gave the trustees no authority whatever to sell the land, not even for the payment of debts; unless under the direction of a Court of Chancery. And if the trustees had authority to sell if necessary for the payment of debts, that necessity did not exist. We insist that under it <em>James Christian </em>had not only no authority to convey, or sanction conveyances or improper applications of the purchase money, but that he had no interest as <em>cestui que trust, </em>which could be severed from the trust subject, so as to enable him to incumber it, or to alien it. The support provided for him was so blended with the other trusts for his family that it could not be withdrawn without injury to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-6\">4th. Is there any error injurious to <em>Watts' </em>ex\u2019or in the adjustment of the balance of the accounts against him ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-7\">It will be seen that the only error committed by the Court in respect to these accounts, is in overruling some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions, of which those affecting <em>Watts' </em>estate are the 11th, 12th and 13th.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-4\">The 11th and 13th are to allowances made to <em>Watts </em>on account of the dower interest of his wife. We insist that that allowance was erroneous, because the widow had no title to dower. She seems never to have asserted such title; but on the contrary, in the old suit in <em>the </em>High Court of Chancery, she gave a deposition renouncing her claim to dower. And her administration account, never having been settled by her or her husband, there might have been very good reason why dower in the land should not have been claimed for her. Moreover, as to a great part of the lands in controversy, she never had any title to dower. Her first husband, <em>George </em>Christian, at the time of his death, had only an equitable title to the lands; and it is a well known principle of the common law, in force at his death in 1784-, that a widow is not dowable of an equity. See 1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. title 6, ch. 3, p. 189, pi. 12, p. 192, pi. 25; 1 Lomax\u2019s Digest, title 5, ch. 2, p. 85, pi. 16; <em>Claiborne </em>v. Henderson, 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-5\">The 12th exception is for not charging the trustee with the value of the land in <em>Buckingham </em>sold to <em>Hard-wick, </em>instead of charging the price for which it sold. We humbly submit, that as there was no necessity for the sale, and no authority for it in the deed; and as the purchaser was protected, merely on the ground of -want of notice, the trustee is bound to account for the fair value of the land. We think it fully proved that that value was at least double the price for which the land was sold by the trustee; it having been resold very shortly after at an advance of about an hundred per cent.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-22\"><em> Cabell, </em>P. was related to some of the parties.

</em>with the exception of so much of said tract of 1036 acres, (being part of a survey for 390 acres, and of another for 123 acres,) as was allotted <em>by the </em>said division between <em>George </em>and <em>John Christian </em>to the latter: and that the said <em>George Christian, </em>at the time of his death, by virtue of the last will and testament of the said <em>James Christian, 2d, </em>had also acquired the title, both legal and equitable, to the tracts of 253 acres, 250 acres, and 400 acres, patented to the said <em>James, 2d, </em>and adjoining the said tract of 1036 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the said <em>George Christian </em>having died intestate in the year 1784, all his real estate, including his equitable interest in the said tract of 1036 acres, and his legal and equitable right to the three adjoining tracts aforesaid, descended to the said <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>who was his eldest son, and as such, under the law of descents then existing, his sole heir at law; that the said patent for 1036 acres, obtained after the death of the said <em>George </em>in the names of all his children, by the procurement of their guardian <em>Reuben Norvell, </em>was in derogation of the right of the said <em>James, 3d; </em>and that the legal title conferred by said patent, to the extent of the equitable right which so descended from said <em>George, </em>must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>regarded as held in trust for tho sole and exclusive benefit of the said <em>James, 3d, </em>notwithstanding any parol disclaimers on his part of his exclusive right.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the deed of the 17th of June 1805, executed by the said <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>to <em>Stephen Watts </em>and <em>James Murphy, </em>conveying to them as trustees, for the purposes therein mentioned, \u201call the estate, both real and personal, to which the said <em>James </em>was in any manner entitled at law or in equity,\u201d notwithstanding its want of designation and description of the lauds of said <em>James </em>intended to be conveyed, was good and valid between the parties, embraced the rights of said <em>James </em>in the said tract of 1036 acres, and to the three adjoining tracts aforesaid acquired by descent from the said <em>George Christian </em>his father; and, if the operation of such a deed could have been affected in regard to those lands by an adversary possession thereof, or any part thereof, at the time of its execution, there was in point of fact no such adversary possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">But the Court is further of opinion, that the registry of the deed just mentioned was not, because of the want of designation and description of the lands intended to be conveyed, notice in point of law to a subsequent purchaser from the grantor of the existence of said deed; nor would notice in point of fact of such existence and contents affect such purchaser, unless he had further notice that the land purchased by him was embraced by the provisions of said deed ; and the proof of such notice, whether direct and positive, or circumstantial and presumptive, must be such as to affect the conscience of the purchaser; and is not sufficient if it merely puts him upon enquiry, but must be so strong and clear as to fix upon him the imputation of <em>mala fides.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">And the Court is further of opinion, that no power whatever was conferred by the said deed of the 17th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>June 1805, upon the trustees therein, to make sales of the lands thereby conveyed, whether for payment of the debts of the grantor, or any other purpose, however urgent the necessity for such sales; and that in point of fact, no such necessity has ever occurred : and therefore, that purchasers from said trustees acting in that character, could acquire no title from them to any of the lands conveyed by said deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">And it appears to the Court, that the tract of 336 acres purchased by <em>James Dillard, </em>was part of the aforesaid tract of 1036 acres, and of that portion thereof, the equitable title to which descended as aforesaid, from <em>George Christian </em>to <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>his heir at law; and that the said <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>purchase was from the said <em>James, 3d, Charles Christian, 2d, Horsley </em>and wife, and <em>Murphy </em>and wife. And it further appears, that the said <em>Stephen Watts </em>and <em>James Murphy, </em>the trustees in said deed of the 17th of June 1805, did in that character unite with <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>his brother and sisters, and the husbands of the latter, in their deed of conveyance to said <em>Dillard </em>of the 17th of December 1807; whereby the said <em>Dillard </em>not only had notice of the existence of the said deed to the trustees, but that it conveyed to them, for the benefit of their <em>cestuis que trust, </em>the interest of <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>in the land he the said <em>Dillard, </em>was purchasing ; and he was.consequently' bound to know that said trustees were not, by the provisions of said deed, invested with the authority or power to make any sale or conveyance of the interest of their <em>cestuis que trust, </em>so derived from the said <em>James, 3d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">But it does not appear that the said <em>Dillard </em>had notice of the extent of the interest in said land owned by the said <em>James, 3d, </em>and by him conveyed to said trustees by his deed aforesaid. On the contrary, the Court is well satisfied that the said <em>Dillard </em>had reasonable grounds for believing, and did in good faith <em>believe, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the interest of <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>in said land, at the date of his deed to the trustees, was not exclusive, but only to the extent of one undivided fourth part thereof. All the circumstances of the case tended to warrant that belief. The said tract of 1036 acres was entered, surveyed and patented, in the joint names of <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>his brother and sisters, through the agency of their guardian. That joint title was asserted for them jointly, during the whole controversy with <em>John Christian </em>and his devisee. The latent equity of <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>to exclude his brother and sisters from participation had never been asserted for or by him. On the contrary, he claimed only an undivided interest with them, united with them in the joint sale and conveyance to Dillard, and suffered them to receive equal proportions of the purchase money; and this with the knowledge and assent of the trustees <em>Watts </em>and <em>Murphy, </em>who set up no exclusive interest in their <em>cestuis que trust, </em>but also united in the joint conveyance to <em>Dillard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said <em>James Dillard </em>must be treated as a purchaser with notice of the rights of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the deed of the 17th of June 1805, only to the extent of one undivided fourth part of the land purchased by him as aforesaid ; and that <em>Vawter, </em>the trustee substituted for said <em>Waits </em>and <em>Murphy, </em>is entitled to recover against his representatives, for the purposes of the trust, such undivided fourth part of said land, and no more, together with the rents and profits which have accrued upon such undivided fourth part only. And it is no good objection to such recovery for the purposes of the trust that <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>one of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>united in the sale to said <em>Dillard; </em>his interests as a <em>cestui que trust, </em>being inseparably connected with those of the other <em>cestuis que trust, </em>and therefore indispensable to the enjoyment by them of their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>And the Court is further of opinion, that a recovery against <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>representatives, as aforesaid, entitles them to recover back one fourth of the purchase money Pa'd by him, with interest thereupon ; and though they wo'dd have a remedy at law therefor upon the joint warranty of the grantors in the deed; yet as the relief to which they are entitled arises out of the decree against Ibera, and upon the pleadings and proofs <em>between the </em>plaintiffs and said grantors, such relief is within the pro-7 . , <em>1 </em>vmce of equitable jurisdiction; and is the more proper by a decree over in their behalf, that it can be given with a view to the equities amongst the grantors themselves. The relief to <em>Dillard\u2019s </em>representatives arises out of the loss of the undivided fourth of the property which <em>James Christian, 2d, </em>undertook to sell, and which he was enabled to sell by the concurrence of the trustees <em>Watts </em>and <em>Murphy. </em>It is equitable, therefore, that the decree for reimbursement should be primarily against the said <em>James, 2d, </em>and the representatives of the said <em>Waits </em>and <em>Murphy; </em>with the reservation of decreeing thereafter amongst them according to their relative equities; and if the decree against them should prove unproductive, of enforcing the liabilities upon the warranty in the deed, of <em>Charles Christian, 2d, </em>and <em>William Horsley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Al9\">And it further appears to the Court, that the tract purchased by <em>Stephen Watts, </em>was also part <em>of </em>the aforesaid tract of 1036 acres, and of that portion thereof the equitable title to which descended as aforesaid from <em>George Christian </em>to <em>James Christian, 2d, </em>his heir at law; and that the said <em>Watts\u2019 </em>purchase was from the said <em>James, 2d, Charles Christian, 2d, Horsley </em>and wife, and <em>Murphy </em>and wife; who conveyed to him by their deed of the 8th of November 1809. And though it does not appear that the said <em>Watts </em>in making said purchase was actuated by any fraudulent intent, yet the land so purchased by him being embraced in the deed of convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>anee from <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>to the said <em>Watts </em>and <em>Murphy, </em>as trustees, it was utterly incompetent for the said <em>Walts to </em>acquire any title thereto to the prejudice of his <em>cestuis que trust; </em>and his said purchase and the deed of conveyance to him must be treated as wholly nugatory. Nor can his voluntary gift and conveyance to his son <em>Henry H. Watts </em>avail any thing against the rights of said <em>cestuis que trust, </em>and the claim, for the purposes of the trust, of the substituted trustee, who must recover the said tract of land against the representatives of said <em>Henry H. Watts, </em>together with the rents and profits which have accrued therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the recovery against the representatives of <em>Henry H. Watts, </em>as aforesaid, entitles them to the benefit of the provision for his indemnity, made in <em>the </em>codicil <em>to the </em>will of the said <em>Stephen Watts; </em>the proper measure of which is the value of the land lost, the costs and expenses incurred in their defence, and the amount of the rents and profits to which they are subjected.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the relief to the representatives of said <em>Stephen Watts, </em>in consequence of the loss of the land so purchased by him, cannot be based upon the joint warranty in the deed of his vendors; the effect of which would he to make each, including one of his <em>cestuis que trust, </em>liable for the consideration received by all, upon a contract utterly null and void, according to the rules of equity; and upon a warranty in a deed which ought to be wholly vacated. Whereas the principle upon which the representatives of said <em>Watts </em>are entitled to any relief is, that the contract between him and his vendors was founded upon a mutual mistake in the state of the title, in supposing that all the children of <em>George Christian </em>had an equal interest in the subject: when in truth <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>was, at the time of his deed to the trustees, the exclusive equitable owner. The representatives of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Stephen Watts </em>must, therefore, recover back separately from each of his vendors, <em>James Christian, 3d, Charles Christian, 2d, James Murphy </em>and <em>William Horsley, </em>or their representatives, so much of the purchase money as was paid by him to each respectively, with interest thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"AaSg\">And the Court is further of opinion, that in the recovery of rents and profits, as aforesaid, which have accrued since the deaths of said <em>James Dillard </em>and <em>Henry H. Watts, </em>respectively, regard must be had to the nature of the representative character in which those rents and profits were received; so as not to throw upon the personal representative such as are properly chargeable to the heirs or devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">And the Court is further of opinion, that by the terms, true intent and meaning of the contract of the 16th of January 1801, between <em>Reuben Norvell </em>of the one part, and <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>and <em>Elizabeth Christian </em>and <em>Stephen Watts, </em>in behalf of <em>Charles Christian </em>and <em>Sally Christian, </em>of the other, the said <em>Norvell, </em>for his services in conducting the controversy with <em>John Christian, </em>was to receive, in the event of success, a moiety of so much of the aforesaid tract of 1036 acres, as was separated for the said <em>John Christian, </em>from the rest of that tract, by the division line already mentioned, and no more; and the same not having been recovered from the said <em>John Christian, </em>or his representatives, but on the contrary their right thereto having been established by the decision of this Court above referred to, the said <em>Norvell </em>had no well founded claim arising out of that contract, to any part of the lands to which the title of <em>George Christian </em>was established, as above set forth. And those lands having descended to <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>his sole heir at law, passed by his deed of conveyance of the 17th of June 1805, to the trustees therein for the purposes of the trust; and the rights of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>therein could not be affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>subsequent deed of conveyance of 1820, from <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>and the other children of <em>George Christian, </em>to said <em>Norvell; </em>under which the latter claims a large portion of the lands to which the title of <em>George Christian </em>was established as aforesaid, embracing the aforesaid tracts of 250, 253 and 400 acres, patented to <em>James Christian, </em>2cZ, adjoining the aforesaid tract of 1036 acres, and a moiety of the <em>Stonewall </em>tract, recovered from <em>Boothe </em>and <em>Staples; </em>in regard to which last, the rights of the parties have not yet been adjudicated by the Circuit Court. The said <em>Norvell </em>could have acquired no title under that deed, unless he was a purchaser, without notice of the exclusive right by descent of <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>and his conveyance thereof by his deed of the 17th of June 1805, to the trustees therein: And the Court is satisfied from the pleadings and proofs that he had such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the rights of the said <em>cestuis que trust </em>must prevail against the pretensions of said <em>Norvell; </em>and it would be proper that the substituted trustee should recover against him, for the purposes of the trust, the aforesaid tracts of 250, 253 and 400 acres, patented to <em>James Christian, \u2018Id, </em>but for the intervention of the claims of others. But the claims of said <em>cestuis que trust </em>cannot prevail against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers and incumbrancers, from said <em>Norvell, </em>without notice. And the three tracts last mentioned appear to be embraced in a deed of trust executed by said <em>Norvell, </em>for the security of creditors : a part of one of them is claimed by <em>James London's </em>ox\u2019or, as having been purchased by his testator from said <em>Norvell: </em>another of them, that of 253 acres, appears to be in the possession of the representatives of <em>Henry H. Watts: </em>and <em>Charles Mundy </em>claims a parcel of 180 acres of laud, as purchased by him from <em>Norvell's </em>trustees. But the deeds to <em>.London </em>and <em>Mundy, </em>and the deed to <em>Norvell </em>himself, are not in the record; nor does the record ascertain whe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ther <em>Mundy\u2019s </em>purchase is part of either of the three tracts aforesaid, or whether it is part of some other, if any, of the lands embraced in the deed to <em>Norvell; </em>nor under what title, if any, the representatives of <em>Henry H. Watts, </em>hold the said tract of 253 acres. The causes, therefore, were not in a condition for a decree by the Circuit Court in regard to <em>Norvell, </em>nor for a decision upon the rights of those claiming under him; all of whom ought to have been made parties; and proceedings ought to have been had by a reference to a commissioner, a survey, and other appropriate means, if requisite, to ascertain the state of the title claimed, and possession held under said <em>Norvell. </em>If it should be ascertained by proper proceedings, that the purchasers and incumbrancers from <em>Norvell </em>are entitled to protection against the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the deed of the 17th of June 1805, then the relief of the substituted trustee, for the purposes of the trust, against <em>Norvell, </em>must be for the value of such of the lands embraced therein, and conveyed to him as aforesaid, as cannot be recovered for said <em>cestuis que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the causes were not in a condition for a decree over by the Circuit Court in favour of <em>Norvell </em>against his vendors, if to any he be entitled; inasmuch as his right to relief <em>against them </em>is dependent, in one aspect, upon the recovery against him for the <em>cestuis que trust </em>of the lands conveyed to him as aforesaid; and, in another, upon the recovery for them and the actual payment by him of the value of said lands: and of the terms of the contract between him and his vendors, assumed by the commissioners, the evidence is not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">And the Court is further of opinion, that so far as the estimated price between <em>Norvell </em>and his vendors of the lands conveyed to him by them as aforesaid, consisted of his claim to a moiety of said lands for his services in conducting the controversy in relation thereto, he is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>titled to no relief in any event; his claim thereto under his agreement of the 16th of June 1801, being without foundation; and the allowance thereof, in the said conveyance to him of 1820, if not fraudulently procured, which the Court deems it unnecessary to decide, being merely gratuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">And the Court is further of opinion, upon the authority of the case of <em>Claiborne </em>v. Henderson, 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 322, that as the law stood at the death of <em>George </em>Christian, in the year 1784, a widow was not dowable of an equitable estate; and consequently that <em>Mrs. Watts, </em>the widow of said <em>George Christian, </em>had no right to dower in the land sold to <em>Dillard, </em>nor in the land purchased by her second husband <em>Stephen Watts </em>as aforesaid; and therefore that the said <em>Stephen Watts </em>ought not, in the settlement of his trust accounts, or in any other mode, to be allowed in right of his said wife, a third of the rents and profits of those lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Bat in regard to the lands to which <em>George Christian </em>was entitled by devise from his grandmother <em>Mrs. Whitney, </em>he having died seized of the legal estate thereof, his said widow was entitled to dower in the <em>same; </em>and though there was no formal assignment thereof, yet the said <em>Watts </em>having received the rents and profits of those lands while unsold, and the purchase moneys thereof when sold, and being now held by the assignee of the heir at law to a strict accountability therefor, he ought to be allowed, in the settlement of his trust accounts, one third of said rents, and one third of said purchase moneys, during the life of his wife, on account of her said <em>dower; </em>though they may not have intended, but on the contrary disclaimed the intention of asserting said right to dower, while his management of the trust subject was unimpeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the said <em>Stephen Watts </em>ought not to be allowed, in the settlement of his trust accounts, the price of the tract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>land purchased by him from <em>John </em>Loving, and by said <em>Watts </em>conveyed to said <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>by his deed of the 24th of June 1816, unless it shall appear that said purchase was with or for the trust fund, and can be made available for the purposes of the trust. If the said land was improperly conveyed to the said <em>James, 3d, </em>individually, and he still holds the same, so that by the proper decree, it can be secured as a part of the trust subject for the purposes of the trust, in that event, and in that only, ought the said <em>Watts </em>to receive a credit with the trust fund for the price aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">And the Court is further of \u25a0 opinion, that the said <em>Stephen Watts </em>is properly chargeable with the price of the land sold to <em>Hardwick, </em>and the price of the land sold to <em>North, </em>but not with the supposed sacrifices at those sales; no such case having been made by the pleadings, whatever may be the sufficiency of the evidence <em>; </em>which the Court deems it unnecessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">And the Court is further of opinion, that a trustee accountable for rents received by him, is properly chargeable with interest thereupon <em>; </em>and therefore, in the settlement of the trust accounts of the said <em>Stephen Watts, it is </em>not error to his prejudice to apply <em>his </em>disbursements to the discharge of such rents, and so leave other debts against him to carry interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-15\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that the decrees of the Circuit Court, so far as they conflict with the foregoing opinion, whether to the prejudice of the appellants or the appellees, be reversed and annulled, and the residue thereof affirmed: with separate costs to the appellant or appellants on each separate appeal. And the causes are remanded to the Circuit Court, to be further proceeded in, according to the principles of the foregoing opinion and decree: with a direction that the plaintiffs in the suit brought by <em>Vawter, </em>trustee, and others, be required to amend their bill, by making the said <em>James Christian, 3d, </em>a defendant thereto.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
