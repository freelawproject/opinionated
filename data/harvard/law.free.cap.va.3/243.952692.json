A vendor of land retaining the title as a security for the purchase money; his lien upon the land cannot bo affected by any lapse of time short of the period sufficient to raise the presumption of payment; whatever might be the operation of the statute of limitations in an action at law brought to recover the purchase money. \u2019</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b263-14\">2. The assignee for value of a note given lor the purchase money of land, may maintain a suit against his assignor the vendor, and the vendee, for a specific performance of the contract, in a case proper for such relief, and to subject the land to the satisfaction of his claim.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-15\">In December 1843, <em>Joseph Hanna </em>filed his bill in the Superior Court of the county of Greenbrier, against <em>James B. Wilson </em>and <em>David Walls, </em>in which he charged that <em>Wilson, </em>by a certain writing duly executed, on the 5th of November 1838, bound himself to pay to <em>David Watts, </em>the sum of 154 dollars 34 cents, and that <em>Watts </em>had assigned the same to the plaintiff, for value. That this debt was a part of the purchase money of a tract of land sold by <em>Watts </em>to <em>Wilson. </em>That <em>Watts </em>had executed a deed to <em>Wilson </em>for the land, and tendered it to him, and demanded the purchase money, but that <em>Wilson </em>neglects and fails to pay it. He therefore prays that the land, or so much thereof as may be necessary, may be decreed to be sold in satisfaction of his debt and interest, and the costs of this suit, and for general relief. And he files the deed from <em>Watts </em>to <em>Wilson </em>with his bill, as an exhibit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-16\"><em>Waits </em>was regularly proceeded against as an absent defendant. <em>Wilson </em>answered the bill, admitting his indebtedness ; but he insists that he had received no deed for the land purchased by him of <em>Watts, </em>and he does not believe <em>Watts </em>is yet able to make him a deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>according to the contract. He then proceeds to state the difficulties in the way of <em>Waits\u2019 </em>conveying to him according to his contract; but there was no proof of his allegations. He concludes by pleading the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">When the cause came on to be heard in the Court below, that Court sustained the plea of the statute of limitations, and dismissed the bill; whereupon <em>Hanna </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-7\">The <em>Attorney General, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-8\">\u25a0 This is a case in which the vendor has retained the title, and has a lien upon the land for the purchase money. It is an equitable lien which can only be enforced in equity; and the statute of limitations does not apply to the case. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Cockerell, </em>2 Gratt. 88. In cases of trust, over which Courts of Law have no jurisdiction, Courts of Equity do not enforce the statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-9\"><em>Price, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-10\"><em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Cockerell </em>was a case where the contract of sale was under seal; and therefore the statute could not bar the claim. In this case the evidence of debt is a simple note, which the statute will bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXE\">The general rule certainly is, that Courts.of Equity will enforce the statute of limitations. <em>Elmendorf </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 Wheat. R. 152; <em>Cholmondelly </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 1. It is true that in a case of pure equity, the statute does not bar, but where there is a concurrent remedy at law\u2019 and in equity, there it does-apply. This appellant had a remedy at law upon the note; and if he had sued there, the statute would have been a bar. When, then, he comes into equity upon the same note, the objection must be equally fatal here. The rule is clearly laid down in <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, 7 </em>John. Ch. R. 90; shewing that it is only pure technical trusts wffiieh the statute will not bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>It may be said that the title <em>not </em>having passed, the vendor may bring ejectment: and thus force the vendee into equity. This may be true, unless the vendee can shew that he has paid all the purchase money he is bound to pay, which will be a good defence to the action under the act of 1831, Sup. R. C. p. 159, 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\">The Court is referred to <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Lewis, 5 </em>Leigh 686, which though not precisely like this case yet bears upon it, and to <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 89.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-5\">Aluen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AHI\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u2022 The Court is of opinion, that as by the contract between <em>David Watts </em>and <em>James B. Wilson, </em>the former was only bound to make a deed for the land upon the payment of the purchase money, it would have been <em>competent for </em>the vendor at any time whilst he retained the legal title as a security for the payment of the purchase money, to have filed a bill for the specific execution of the contract; and to subject the land to sale, for the purchase money in arrear; and this right in equity, under such circumstances, could not be affected by any lapse of time, short of the period sufficient to raise the presumption of payment; whatever might be the operation of the statute of limitations in an action at law brought to recover the purchase money. The Court is further of opinion, that it was competent for the assignee for value of the note given for the purchase money, <em>by </em>a bill against his assignor, the vendor, and the vendee, to enforce the specific execution of the contract, in a case proper for such relief, for his benefit, and to obtain satisfaction of the amount due to him by subjecting the land to sale for the payment thereof. And it appearing from the papers in the cause, that the defendant <em>Watts, </em>as to whom the bill was taken for confessed, has complied with the contract on his part, by executing and acknowledging a deed for the land sold, to bo delivered to the vendee on'his paying the purchase money; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>affirmative allegations of the answer, that the deed is not in pursuance of the contract, being unsupported by proof, the Court on the hearing, under the prayer for general relief, should have decreed \u00e1 specific execution of tjie contract, instead of dismissing the bill with -costs. It is therefore considered that said decree is erroneous, and should be reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">And this Court proceeding, &amp;c. doth adjudge, order and decree, that the plaintiff recover of the said <em>James B. Wilson, </em>the sum of 154 dollars 34 cents, with interest thereon from the 5th day of November 1838, until paid, and his costs by him about the prosecution of his suit in this behalf expended; and upon the payment of said debt, interest and costs, it is further ordered that the clerk do deliver to the said <em>James B. Wilson, </em>the original deed filed as an exhibit with the bill, retaining a certified copy thereof to be filed with the papers in the cause. And it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that unless the said <em>J. B. Wilson </em>shall pay to the plaintiff the debt, interest and costs aforesaid, within sixty days after the entering of this decree, the sheriff of <em>Greenbrier </em>county after advertising the time and place of sale by advertisement published, &amp;c., and posted, &amp;c., for four weeks successively, do proceed before the courthouse of said county, on some court day, to sell said land in said deed described, upon a credit of six and twelve months, taking from the purchaser bond and security, and retaining a lien on the land for the security of the purchase money; and report his proceedings in order to a final decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
