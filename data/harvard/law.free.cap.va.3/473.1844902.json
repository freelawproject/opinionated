The cases are precisely similar in their circumstances, and depend upon the same question. They were two writs of right brought by <em>Eockbold, </em>who claimed two tracts of land, which had been sold by <em>Thomas Tavenner </em>as deputy of &lt;7. <em>Spencer, </em>high sheriff of Wood county, for non-payment of taxes. Deeds were executed by <em>Tavenner </em>to <em>Eockbold, </em>who became the purchaser at the sale. These deeds recite that <em>Tavenner is </em>deputy sheriff of <em>J. Spencer, </em>sheriff of Wood county, and signed by <em>Tavenner </em>in the same manner. At the trial, the tenants moved the Court to instruct the jury, that the deeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>produced were not, of themselves, sufficient evidence of title in the demandant to enable him to recover. The Court gave the instruction, and the jury found for the tenants&gt; Judgment was given accordingly, and <em>Rockbold </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-5\"><em>Scott, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJk\">contended, that the deputy was competent to execute the deeds, as it was merely a <em>ministerial </em>act. <em>Wroe </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>2 Wash. 126; 6 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>\u201cSheriff,\u201d 154-5; <em>Acts of </em>1814, \u00a7 20, 24, 25.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-6\"><em>Hay, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHQW\">admitted that the deputy might execute the deeds in this case, but said that they were void for uncertainty in the description of the land, and that there must be some evidence that the person professing to be deputy, was so in fact.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b486-7\"><em>October </em>19.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ACkP\">Judge Gbeen,</author>\n<p id=\"AmqT\">delivered his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Th\u00e9se two cases are precisely the same in all their circumstances. The demandant claimed the land in controversy, under a patent to <em>Abraham Thomas. </em>The patent is set out in the first bill of exceptions, and it is therein stated, that the patent is for the land in controversy. He also introduced a deed from <em>Abraham Thomas </em>to <em>Michael Thomas; </em>and a deed dated August 16, 1815, from <em>Thomas Tavenner, </em>professing to be deputy sheriff for <em>J. S. Spencer, </em>sheriff of Wood county, to the demandant, reciting that he had sold a tract of land belonging to <em>Michael Thomas, </em>returned delinquent in the name of <em>Michael Thomas, </em>for the non-payment of taxes, for several years; and that the demandant was the purchaser thereof; and conveying to him a tract of land of 400 acres in Wood county so sold, being a tract of land late the property of <em>Michael Thomas, </em>and sold as aforesaid for delinquency of taxes. The tenant moved the Court to'instruct the jury, whether the last-mentioned indenture, with the deeds mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>die first bill of exceptions, was sufficient evidence of title in the demandant, to enable him to recover in this cause, The Court being of opinion, that the last-mentioned deed was not, of itself, sufficient evidence of the transfer of the land in controversy, from <em>Michael Thomas, </em>jr. to the demandant, instructed the jury accordingly; to which, the demandant excepted, and the jury found for the tenant. The only question in the cause, is, whether this instruction was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It was indispensably necessary, in order to give the effect to this deed of transferring the title of <em>Michael Thomas </em>to the demandant, that <em>J. Spencer </em>should have been sheriff of Wood county, and <em>Thomas Tavenncr </em>his deputy, at the lime that the advertisement and sale were made; and without proof of those facts, the deed was not, of itself sufficient evidence, that the title of <em>Michael Thomas </em>was vested in the demandant. The instruction was, therefore, right, and the judgments are respectively to he <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The other Judges<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred, and the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> The President, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
