Campbell </em>only, one of the partners of the house, in his individual name, and therefore did not conform with the requisitions of the statute, 1 Rev.

The entry of the judgement was as follows : \u201c <em>Hugh Campbell </em>one of the firm of <em>W. &amp;p D. Kyle &amp;p Co., </em>having obtained an attachment in favor of the said <em>W. &amp;p D. K. Sp Co. </em>against the estate of <em>Daniel Connelly, </em>whom the said <em>Campbell </em>had just cause to suspect and verily believed was about to remove himself with his effects out of the commonwealth, for the sum of 1103 dollars due by single bill, on the-day of-next, to the said <em>W. D. K. fy Co. </em>This day came the said <em>W. 8p D. K. Sp Co. </em>by their attorney, and the said D\u2022 <em>Connelly </em>being solemnly called, and not appearing to replevy the said attached effects; therefore, it is considered by the court, that the plaintiffs recover against the said defendant, the said sum of 1103 dollars, together with their costs <em>he.\u201d </em>And it was ordered, that the sheriff should make sale of the merchandize attached, on a credit till the date when the debt to the plaintiffs should become payable, and should take bonds of the purchasers with good <em>surety </em>for the proceeds, .and assign the same to the plaintiffs, to the amount of the debt due them and their costs, and if the proceeds should exceed that amount, should assign the bonds for the surplus to the defendant, and return an account of his proceedings to the court. And it appearing, that there-were debts due to the defendant, <em>from the </em>garni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>shees who appeared according to the summons, to the amount of 332 dollars, the court ordered those garnishees to pay to the plaintiffs the several debts by them respectively due to the defendant, with a stay of execution against the garnishees till the date when the defendant\u2019s debt to the plaintiff should become due and payable; and several of the garnishees who had been summoned, not having appeared, the proceeding was <em>as to them, </em>continued till the ensuing term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-4\">To this judgement of the county court, the circuit court, upon a petition presented in the name of <em>Connelly, </em>awarded a <em>supersedeas, </em>and afterwards reversed the judgement, and quashed the attachment, and all the proceedings upon it. And then <em>W. &amp;f 1), K. 8f Co. </em>applied to this court, for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement of the circuit court; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b747-6\">The argument here, by <em>Bacchus </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>Johnson </em>for the defendant, turned on objections taken by the latter, to the regularity of the proceedings, and to the judgement of the county court.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b747-7\">The counsel for the defendant in error, premised, that the statute which gives this summary remedy of attachment,\u2014a new remedy contrary to the course of the common law, and one obviously liable to much abuse,\u2014ought to be strictly pursued; <em>Asberry </em>v. <em>Calloway, </em>1 Wash. 74. <em>Stuart v. Hamilton, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 48. <em>Mantz v. Hendley, Id. </em>308. And then he insisted, 1. That, as the statute requires, that every complaint on which an attachment shall be issued, shall be made <em>on oath, </em>and as it no wise appeared that the complaint on which the process was issued in this case, was made <em>on oath, </em>the attachment was therefore irregularly issued, and ought for this cause alone to be quashed. 2. If it could fairly be presumed, that the complaint was <em>made on oath, </em>yet it was not the complaint of <em>the creditor, </em>but of one of several creditors; a complaint by <em>Campbell </em>one of the house of <em>W. &amp; D. K. &amp; Co. </em>to whom the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>was due. <em>Campbell </em>could not have taken the oath required by the statute.: <em>the creditor </em>praying the attachment, is required to make oath, that he had no knowledge, when the debt was contracted, of the intention of the debtor to remove ]]\u00a1mse]f with his effects out of the commonwealth before the debt shall become payable. But, in this case, the house of <em>W. &amp; D. K. &amp; Co. </em>was <em>the creditor: </em>all the partners should have joined in the affidavit to the justice of the complaint: <em>Cdmpbell </em>might, indeed, have made oath, that <em>he </em>had no knowledge of the debtor\u2019s intention to remove, but he could not have known, and therefore could not with truth have deposed, that all his co-partners were alike ignorant as himself, of that intention. 3. The attachment bond was naught. Though <em>Campbell </em>obtained the attachment, it was an attachment for <em>W. &amp; D. K. &amp; Co. They </em>were the plaintiffs. The costs would be adjudged to the defendant only in case <em>they </em>were cast; and <em>they, </em>not <em>Campbell </em>alone, would have been liable for damages at the suit of the defendant, for abuse of the process. But the bond bound <em>Campbell </em>and his surety to pay the costs, in case <em>Campbell </em>one of the partners in the house, not in case <em>the house, </em>should be cast, and to pay the damages which should be recovered against <em>Campbell </em>one of the partners, not such as should be recovered against <em>the house, </em>which was certainly liable to the action for damages. 4. The condemnation of the attached effects was excessive. The court ought to have directed the sheriff to sell only so much of the merchandize attached, as together with the debts due from the garnishees, would have satisfied the debt due the attaching creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b748-4\">The counsel for the plaintiffs in error, maintained, that the, proceedings, and the judgement of the county court, were perfectly right. And, in answer to the objection's made to them, they said\u20141. That though the statute required that the complaint should be made on oath, to justify the issuing of the attachment, it did not require, that the <em>affidavit </em>should be returned to court, or that the fact of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>plaint being made on oath, should be certified, and made <em>1 </em>\u201e <em>\u00b0 </em>, , , \u2019 . . . <em>rr. </em>part of the record; and the objection came too late. <em>Mawkins v. Gibson, </em>1 Leigh, 476. Had it been made at the \u00b0 . trial in the county court, it might have been obviated by proof, that the complaint on which the attachment was issued, was in fact verified by oath. 2. One partner of a mercantile house to which a debt has been contracted, might sue out an attachment in such a case as this; and to hold that he could not, would be, in effect, to deprive such creditors of the benefit of the remedy. For aught that appeared in this case, <em>Campbell </em>may have been the partner with whom this debt was contracted; and if so, he was the proper person to depose, and the only person that could depose, that the creditor was ignorant, at the time the debt was contracted, of the debtor\u2019s intention to remove. 3. <em>Campbell </em>had a right to sue out the attachment for the house: he, therefore, was the party from whom the attachment bond was to be taken. Tate\u2019s Dig. <em>Attachment, </em>p. 35. note (b). and the cases there cited, of <em>Wilson &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Turpin, </em>in the circuit court of <em>Henrico. Twiss </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>1 Atk. 67. <em>Pleasants v. Meng &amp; al. </em>1 Dall. 381. <em>Ex parte Hodgkinson, </em>Coop. Ch. Ca. 99. <em>Ex parte Roberts, Id. </em>102. The bond bound <em>Campbell </em>and his surety to pay the costs, in case he should be cast in this proceeding for <em>W. &amp; D.K. &amp; Co. </em>They, being the plaintiffs, would be bound by the judgement for the costs, if they had been cast, without any bond. As to the damages, <em>Campbell </em>who resorted to this remedy, would alone have been liable for damages, if the process had been sued out without just cause; it was a wrong, and <em>he </em>was the wrong-doer: therefore, the bond properly bound <em>him </em>and his surety to answer for the damages resulting from such wrong. It would be found, on examination of the provisions of the 7th section of the statute, that the bond could not have been conformed with them, more literally and precisely. 4. The judgement of the county court was entered exactly according to the directions of the 14th section of the statute, which prescribes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>judgement to be entered in. such cases, and prescribes also the duty of the sheriff in executing the judgement, and <em>in the directions to the sheriff, </em>guards the debtor against any injury that may arise from the condemnation of <em>all his effects </em>a(;taChed for the debt, when <em>part </em>will suffice to satisfy it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-12\"> The 14th section of the statute provides, that \u201c whenever any creditor, whose claim amounts to <em>ten </em>dollars or 400 pounds of tobacco, shall have sufficient grounds to suspect, that his debtor will remove, with his effects, out of the commonwealth, before bis debt will be payable, or whenever such debtor shall have so removed leaving effects, it shall be lawful for such creditor to go before any magistrate of the county or corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>where his debtor resides, or in case such debtor has removed, where he last resided, or where his effects may be found, and <em>make oath </em>to the true amount of his debt, and that he has just cause to suspect, and verily believes, that such debtor will remove himself with his effects out of the commonwealth before the said debt will become payable, or hath actually so removed, and <em>also that he had no knowledge, when the said debt was contracted, of the intention of such debtor so to remove; </em>and thereupon, such magistrate, taking bond and security from such creditor as in other cases of attachments, shall issue an attachment against the goods and chattels of the debtor, returnable to the next court to be held for such county or corporation, which attachment may be served on any goods and chattels of such debtor, or any garnishee or garnishees.\u201d The section then proceeds to prescribe the manner of proceeding on such attachments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"><em> </em>The 7th section of the statute provides, \u201c that every justice of the peace, before granting such attachment, shall take bond and security <em>of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>the party for whom the same shall he issued, </em>in double the sum to <em>be </em>attached, payable to the defendant, for paying and satisfying all costs which shall be awarded to the said defendant, in case <em>the plaintiff suing out the attachment therein mentioned </em>shall be cast in his suit, and also all damages which shall be recovered against <em>the said plaintiff, </em>for his suing out such attachment; which bond shall be by the said justice returned to the court to which the attachment is <em>returnable; </em>and the party entitled to such damages, may thereupon bring suit and recover: and every attachment issued without such bond taken, or where no bond shall be returned, is hereby declared illegal and void, and shall be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b750-4\">Caek, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A6W2\">delivered the opinion of the court, That the judgement of the county court was right, and the judgement of the circuit court reversing it, wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We are bound, in the construction of every statute, to look at the mischief, and the remedy; and so far as the words are not plain and peremptory, to consult the meaning of the legislature. The mischief here, was, that a debtor frequently absconded before his debt became due, and thereby defeated his creditor of the common law remedies. This statute enacts, that, in such case, the creditor may go before a justice, and make oath to the true amount of the debt and when it will become due, and that he believes the debtor is about to remove himself and his effects out of the commonwealth &amp;c. and also that he had no knowledge when the debt was contracted, that the debtor had an intention so to remove; and thereupon, the justice, taking bond and security from the creditor, as in other cases of attachment, shall issue an attachment against the goods &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In this case, the attachment was issued, levied on goods and debts in the hands of garnishees, and returned to the county court. There an attorney appeared for certain persons claiming to be creditors of the absconding debtor, and objected to the proceeding. The county court gave judgement, which was reversed by the circuit court on a <em>supersedeas </em>obtained <em>in the name of the debtor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The first objection I shall notice, is, that it does not appear on the record, that any oath was made by the attaching creditor, before the justices who issued the attachment. The answer is, that the law requires the oath to be <em>made, </em>and that <em>thereupon </em>the attachment shall issue; but does not require, that the <em>affidavit </em>shall be certified or returned by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the magistrate to the county court, or shall in any way appear upon the record of the proceedings. If on the return of the attachment, it had been objected before the county court, that no oath had been made, the court would, no doubt, have required evidence of the fact: but no such objection having been taken then, it comes too late before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The next objection is, that the law requiring that the oath shall be made by <em>the creditor, </em>one partner \u00f3f a mercantile firm cannot make it; because the whole firm (and not an individual member) constitute <em>the creditor </em>contemplated by the act: and this construction is the more relied on, as the remedy by attachment is a summary proceeding, and the law must be strictly followed. This is certainly true: but still it is the <em>law, </em>not the mere <em>letter, </em>that we must follow: we must not so construe it as to sacrifice the clear meaning to the words. The law says, \u201c Whenever <em>any creditor </em>shall suspect his debtor is about removing\u201d <em>he. </em>ho shall have this attachment. It certainly meant to give the remedy to <em>all creditors </em>alike, not to exclude any class, especially the mercantile class, which, from the extent and multiplicity of their dealings, are the very persons standing most in need of this remedy. And yet the construction contended for, would, in most cases, whore there was a <em>firm, </em>deprive them of this remedy. Wo know that such firms consist of several partners, and, most frequently, that these persons reside at different places, sometimes far asunder; one managing the concerns of the trade here, another in <em>.New York, </em>in <em>France, </em>in <em>England, </em>or elsewhere. In all such cases, the creditor would be cut off from the attachment given to all; for the different members could not unite in the oath. The object of the law, in requiring the oath of the creditor, was to furnish to the magistrate, such evidence of the facts sworn to, as would justify the issuing the process. Is not this evidence just as strong, when the facts are sworn to by a partner of the creditor firm, as if that same person were the sole creditor ? A partner represents the firm : he can bind them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>for thousands,, or give an acquittance for any debt due to them: he may then be fairly called the creditor, and he swears to the debt, to the removal, or intended removal, of the debtor, and to his ignorance of such intention when the wag contracted. Thus, I think the words and the reason of the law, are satisfied in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\">It was then objected, that the bond was not a good one, because it did not bind the firm. If a partner was <em>the creditor </em>to make the oath, he was equally <em>the creditor </em>to give the bond; and if he gives a bond with good surety to pay all costs and damages, which may accrue from suing the attachment, it is all that a debtor has a right, to ask; and such bond has been given here. To require that the bond should bind the whole firm, would (equally with requiring the oath to be made by all) cut off all mercantile houses, whose members are scattered abroad, from this remedy: for we know, that one partner cannot, <em>by deed, </em>bind the firm : and the individual partners could not be collected, to seal and deliver, each for himself. It has been decided too, in the cases cited at the bar, that a partner may in cases like this act for the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">These are the principal objections, and all which it is material to notice. The judgement of the circuit court is reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
