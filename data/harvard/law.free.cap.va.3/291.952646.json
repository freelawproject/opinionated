The power of attorney from <em>Matthew Ralston to William </em>is not produced, nor is there any proof of its existence, but no claim has since been set up to the land by <em>Matthew Ralston, </em>or his heirs. <em>Beale </em>held the land under the deed from <em>William Ralston, </em>and rented it to <em>John Rogers; </em>and about the year 1814 <em>Septimus Goodwin </em>moved upon it, under some agreement with <em>Rogers. </em>By this time <em>Beale </em>was dead, and <em>Goodwin </em>paid no rent for the land; but it still stood upon the commissioner\u2019s books in the name of <em>Beale; </em>and <em>Goodwin </em>paid the taxes upon it. <em>Goodwin </em>held possession of the land in this way until 1820, when he obtained a patent for it. He continued to live upon it until 1825, when <em>James Breclcenridge, </em>claiming the land as the agent of <em>Henry Thompson, </em>who represented <em>Hodgson, Nicholson Sf Co., Goodwin </em>left it, and removed to the State of <em>Indiana.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-4\">The partnership of <em>Hodgson, Nicholson Sf Co. </em>was dissolved on the 1st of January 1799, and <em>Hodgson </em>was authorized to wind up the business of the concern. He appointed <em>Henry Thompson </em>his agent, to do the business. The partnership effects of this concern were transferred to <em>Hodgson, Rotten Sf Thompson, </em>and upon the dissolution of their partnership, which took place about the year 1802, the property and effects of <em>Hodg</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>son, Nicholson Co. </em>became the property of <em>Hodgson Thompson ; </em>of which <em>Henry Thompson </em>was a partner; and he was authorized by a power of attorney from <em>Hodgson </em>to settle the whole business of all these firms. <em>Thompson </em>being thus authorized both as partner and attorney in fact to dispose of this land, he by a power of attorney dated the 5th of January 1825, appointed <em>James Breckenridge </em>his agent, with power to take such measures as should be necessary to recover possession, and then to sell and convey <em>it; </em>and <em>Breckenridge </em>having gotten possession as before stated, from <em>Goodwin, </em>sold one hundred and sixty-seven acres of the land to <em>John M </em>\u2019 <em>Cluer; </em>and convoyed it to him by deed dated the 15th November 1825. <em>John MA Cluer </em>conveyed it in March 1829, to the appellee <em>Andrew M\u2019Cluer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">In 1840, <em>Septimus Goodioin </em>brought a writ of right in the Superior Court of <em>Botetourt </em>against <em>Andrew M'Cluer, </em>to recover from him the land conveyed by <em>Breckenridge, </em>as attorney in fact of <em>Tho'mpson, </em>to <em>John AT Cluer, </em>And then M: <em>Cluer </em>filed his bill in the same Court, in which, after stating the facts as to the title to the land in controversy, he charged that when <em>John M\u2019 Cluer </em>was in treaty with <em>Breckenridge </em>for the purchase of the land, he was apprised that <em>Goodwin </em>had previously set up some sort of claim to it, but did not know what the character of his claim was. That <em>M1 Cluer </em>not being satisfied with the title, a meeting at length took place, at which <em>Breckenridge, Goodioin </em>and <em>AT\u2019Cluer </em>were present. The subject of the title was there discussed : <em>ATA Chiefs </em>intended purchase was mentioned ; and <em>Goodioin </em>then and there expressly renounced all claim of title <em>to the </em>land. In consequence of this disclaimer <em>John AH Cluer </em>purchased the land, and received a conveyance for it from <em>Breckenridge; </em>and <em>Goodwin </em>soon afterwards removed to the western country. He made the heirs of <em>Matthew Ralston, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Beale, </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>and <em>Septimus Goodwin </em>parties, and prayed that he might have a decree for a conveyance of the legal title from the parties in whom it might he A considered to be vested, and that <em>Goodwin </em>might be enj0jne(j from aq further proceedings in his suit until the matters set forth in the bill should be heard and determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\"><em>Goodwin </em>filed an answer, in which after objecting to the jurisdiction of the Court, he denied that he had abandoned his claim to the land in controversy, or that the meeting between <em>Breckenridge, John M\u2019Cluer </em>and himself, stated in the bill had ever taken place; or' that he ever compared his title with that by which <em>General Breckenridge </em>claimed ; or ever admitted the inferiority of his title to that. And he denied that, by any act or declaration of his, he induced <em>M\u2019Chier </em>to purchase the land; or stood by-and saw the land sold to him without setting up his claim. He alleges that, being too poor to employ counsel, and having a large family, when <em>Breckenridge </em>set up a title to the land, he removed from it, from fear of a controversy with that gentleman ; that he received nothing for removing from the land, and always intended to assert his rights when he should be able to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-7\">The cause came on to be heard in April 1845, when the Court being of opinion that <em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>patent was obtained by a false suggestion that the land was waste and unappropriated; and being also of opinion that the plaintiff had a superior equitable title, decreed that <em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>patent should be repealed ; and ordered that the decree should be certified to the register of the land office. From this decree, <em>Goodwin </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-8\"><em>John T.

Code, ch. 119, a particular mode is prescribed, by which a patent may be repealed, which was not pursued in this case; and as by said act no letter patent or grant which issued upon or after the 26th of February 1818, can be repealed upon any <em>scire facias </em>sued out more than ten years after the date of such letter patent or grant, and more than ten years had elapsed from the 13th day of June 1820, the date of the patent to the appellant, before the institution of this suit, it was error to render a decree repealing the said patent.</p>\n<p id=\"AaC\">But the Court is further of opinion, that as it appears the appellant acquired the possession of the land under some arrangement with <em>Rogers, </em>who is proved to have held as tenant under <em>John Beale, </em>who claimed the land by virtue of the title to which the appellee <em>Andrew M\u2019Cluer </em>alleges he is equitably <em>entitled; </em>that during the period the appellant so held possession, the said land was charged on the books of the commissioner of the revenue to the said <em>John Beale, </em>and the taxes so charged were paid by the appellant; that the appellant having thus acquired possession with the knowledge of the claim of said <em>Beale, </em>subsequently acquired a patent for said land; but thereafter abandoned the possession upon a claim being asserted by those interested in the title alleged to have been vested in said <em>Beale; </em>and those under whom the appellee <em>M\u2019Cluer </em>claims, thereupon purchased the land from a party supposed to be authorized to convey the title so as aforesaid alleged to be vested in <em>Beale, </em>and have paid up the purchase money and remained in the undisturbed possession of the land until the commencement of the writ of right in the bill mentioned, the circumstances aforesaid authorized the Court of Chancery to award an injunction to stay proceedings at law for a reasonable time, to afford the tenant an opportunity to get in the legal title to the land outstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>in a third person, if he could shew he was in equity entitled to call for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">And the Court is further of opinion, that as it appears said land was part of a tract granted to <em>Matthew Ralgf0n </em>^ patent dated the 23d December 1790, and was conveyed by <em>William Ralston, </em>professing to act as attorney in fact of <em>Matthew Ralston, </em>to the said <em>John Beale, </em>as attorney in fact for the firm of <em>Hodgson, Nicholson Sf Co. </em>by deed dated the 13th of September 1796; that said <em>Matthew Ralston </em>at the date of said deed was not a resident\u2019 of <em>Virginia, </em>and continued to reside without the same up to the time of his death; that said <em>William Ralston </em>was the son of said <em>Matthew, </em>and came\u2019 to this county alleging himself to be duly authorized to sell said land; that he did sell and convey the same as such attorney in fact, and received the consideration therefor; that the land has since that-period been held under such conveyance- by the said <em>Beale, </em>as attorney of said <em>Hodgson, Nicholson Sf Co., </em>and his and their tenants, agents or vendees, with the exception of the short period the same was in the possesssion of the appellant, acquired and abandoned under the circumstances aforesaid; and during all that period, (a length of time sufficient to bar a recovery in a writ of right,) no claim to the land has ever been asserted by said <em>Matthew Ralston </em>or his heirs; a presumption amounting to full proof arises, that said <em>William Ralston </em>was the duly' authorized attorney in fact of said <em>Matthew Ralston, </em>with full power to sell and convey said land, and that a regular power of attorney from the said <em>Matthew </em>to said <em>William Ralston </em>did exist. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said deed from the said <em>William Ralston </em>to the said <em>John Beale, </em>dated the 13th September 1796, was good and effectual as the deed of said <em>Mattheio Ralston, </em>and as against him and his heirs, vested the legal title to the land so conveyed in the said <em>John Beals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>And the Court is further of opinion, that said <em>John Beale </em>held the legal title as trustee for the firm of <em>Hodgson, Nicholson </em>4* <em>Co. </em>his principals, who would have been entitled to a conveyance of the legal title; but it furthermore appears by the exhibits and letters of members of said firm, that the same was taken <em>by </em>their agent <em>Beale </em>in payment of a debt or debts due the firm, and that the firm desired the same to be sold for the benefit of the firm and to discharge the debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">That said firm was dissolved on the 1st January 1799, and <em>John Hodgson, </em>one of the firm authorized to close the transactions of said firm, and that said <em>John Hodgson </em>on the 7th January 1799, constituted said <em>Henry Thompson </em>his agent to adjust and settle up the concerns of said firm. That said <em>Thompson </em>in pursuance of such appointment assumed the agency and the control over the land in controversy as appears by his letter to said <em>John Beale </em>of the 12th April 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">That in addition to such authority of said <em>Thompson </em>as agent, it appears by the evidence of <em>John Nicholson </em>a member of said firm of <em>Hodgson, Nicholson Sp Co., </em>that the effects of said firm were transferred to the firm of <em>Hodgson, Rotten fy Thompson; </em>and that upon the dissolution of said last mentioned firm the effects and assets thereof became the property of <em>Hodgson Sp Thompson, </em>in which firm <em>Henry Thompson </em>was a partner ; and being such partner, the said <em>John Hodgson </em>by power of attorney dated the 23d May 1801, constituted him his attorney to attend to the transactions of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Court is of opinion, that by virtue of the authority vested in said <em>Henry Thompson </em>as aforesaid, as agent and attorney in fact, and in consequence of the transfers of the interests of said firms successively, until the assets vested in the firm of <em>Hodgson Sp Thompson, </em>of which he was a member, (and as it seems surviving member,) it was competent for said <em>Henry Thompson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to dispose of the equitable interest held by said firms in said land, and that upon the sale of such equitable interest made by the said <em>Henry </em>Thompson, through his attorney in fact <em>Gen. James Breckenridge, </em>to the party unc[ei. whom the appellee <em>M\u2019Cluer </em>claims, and the full payment of the price and the conveyance of the land by said last mentioned attorney, the purchaser became invested with the equitable right of the said mercantile firms and each of them, and all the members thereof in and to said land, and entitled in their right and for his own benefit to call for the legal title.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the appellee <em>A. M\u2019Cluer </em>was entitled to a decree affirming the validity of the deed from <em>Matthew Ralston, </em>by his attorney <em>William Ralston, </em>and that the legal title of said <em>Mattheio Ralston </em>to said land passed thereby to the said <em>John Beale; </em>and that in virtue of the purchase made from said <em>Henry Thompson </em>as aforesaid, he was entitled to call for the outstanding legal title in the heirs of said <em>John Beale; </em>and as the said heirs were regularly before the Court, a decree should have been pronounced directing a commissioner for and on behalf of the heirs of <em>Beale </em>to convey to the appellee by deed with special warrantee the tract of land conveyed to <em>John M\u2019Cluer </em>by <em>James Breckenridge </em>as attorney in fact for <em>Henry Thompson, </em>by deed dated the 15th of November 1825, and subsequently conveyed by said <em>John M\u2019Cluer </em>and wife to the appellee <em>Andrew M\u2019Cluer, </em>by deed dated the 9th day of March 1829. Therefore reversed with \u2022costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">And this Court proceeding to make such decree as the Court below ought to have made, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the injunction awarded to restrain the said <em>Septimus Goodwin </em>from using the patent to himself for the land in the bill mentioned upon the trial of the suit at law between himself and the said <em>Andrew M\u2019Cluer, </em>be dissolved, and that the bill of the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>bo dismissed as to said Goodwin, but without costs, and without prejudice to the legal rights of the parties as respectively held under the patents in the bill and pro- ,. -i ceeaings EQGiitionGci.</p>\n<p id=\"A4_\">And it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the deed of the said <em>Mattheio Ralston </em>of the 13th of September 1796, by his attorney in fact <em>William Ralston </em>to the said <em>John Beale </em>was good and effectual as against the said <em>Matthew Ralston </em>and his heirs, and all others to vest the legal title of said <em>Matthew Ralston </em>to the land thereby conveyed in the said <em>John Beale. </em>And it is furthermore adjudged, ordered and decreed, for the reasons aforesaid, that <em>II. W. </em>Bowyer, clerk of the said Circuit Court, who is hereby appointed a commissioner for that purpose, do in the names of the said heirs of <em>John Beale </em>deceased, execute to the said <em>Andrew M\u2019Cluer </em>a deed with special warrantee for the land described in the said deed from <em>James Brechenridge </em>to <em>John M\u2019Clner. </em>and acknowledge the same in order to be recorded: and that each party pay his own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
