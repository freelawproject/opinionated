Brown\u2019s </em>declaration stated his case thus : \u201c that the defendant <em>Carthrae, </em>on the 8th December 1804, and during the life of one <em>Jarman </em>since deceased, by his certain written obligation sealed with his seal (of which <em>profert </em>was made), covenanted to and with the plaintiff <em>Brown </em>and the said <em>Jarman, </em>that he <em>Carthrae </em>would pay <em>the plaintiff and the said Jarman, </em>the sum of 300 dollars, to wit, <em>to each of them one moiety thereof, </em>on or before the 25th December then next ensuing, and also the sum of 400 dollars at and upon the day when a certain <em>turnpike road </em>in the obligation after mentioned, should be completed and delivered, but with this condition, that if <em>the plaintiff and Jar-man </em>should fail to complete the turnpike road across the south mountain agreeably to contract, <em>they thereby bound themselves </em>to refund all moneys received of the defendant <em>Carthrae, </em>with legal interest, but should the said road be completed agreeably to contract, then the obligation whereby the defendant bound, himself to pay the moneys aforesaid, should be valid and binding on the defendant. And the plaintiff averred, that he and the said <em>Jarman </em>in his lifetime, and the plaintiff since the death of the-said <em>Jarman, </em>did complete and deliver the said turnpike road agreeably to contract, to wit, on 8ic. Yet the defendant did not, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>would not, on or before the 25th December next ensuing the said 8th December 1804, pay to the plaintiff or the said <em>Jarman </em>in his lifetime, or to the plaintiff since the said <em>Jarman\u2019s </em>death, the said sum of 300 dollars, or any part thereof,\u2014and did not and would not, at and upon the day when the said turnpike road was completed and delivered as aforesaid, pay to the plaintiff or the said <em>Jarman </em>in his lifetime, or to the plaintiff since the said <em>Jarman's </em>death, the said sum of <em>400 </em>dollars,\u2014according to the form and effect of his said covenant &amp;c. and so the plaintiff in fact said, that the defendant had not kept the said covenant so made\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\"><em>Carthrae </em>pleaded in bar, that the plaintiff <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jarman </em>in <em>Jarman's </em>lifetime, and <em>Brown </em>since <em>Jarman's </em>death, failed to complete the turnpike road according to contract. And upon this plea an issue was made up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\"><em>Oyer </em>was not taken of the covenant, on which the action was brought, nor was it otherwise made part of the record <em>hy the pleadings ; </em>but, exceptions having been taken to an opinion of the court at the trial (on a point not necessary to be here stated), the covenant was set out in the bill of exceptions, and in that way only appeared in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\">Upon the trial, the jury found a verdict for <em>Brown, </em>for both the sums demanded, 300 dollars and 400 dollars, with interest, subject to some credits which they also found the defendant entitled to for payments made by him. The county court gave judgement accordingly. <em>Carthrae </em>appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the judgement; and then he applied by petition to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-7\"><em>Johnson </em>for the plaintiff in error, objected,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1F\">That the covenant, as it was set forth in the declaration, was a covenant of <em>Carthrae </em>to pay moieties of both the sums of money therein mentioned, certainly moieties of the first sum of 300 dollars, to <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jarman, </em>each severally, not to both jointly; and, consequently, <em>Brown </em>could not maintain this action, as surviving covenantee, to recover the whole of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>money. <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Clipsham, </em>1 Wms. Saund. 153-5,-notes 1 and <em>2. </em>Yet he had recovered a verdict and judgement for the whole of both sums.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKC\"><em>Leigh, contra, </em>endeavoured to maintain, that the covenant as alleged in the declaration, was a covenant to pay both sums to the covenantees <em>jointly. </em>It was stated, that <em>Carthrae covenanted to pay Brown and Jarman the sum of </em>300 <em>dollars, to wit, to each of them one moiety thereof: </em>the first part of the allegation representing them as <em>joint </em>covenantees, and the addition under the <em>scilicet, </em>being intended to represent their intei\u2019ests not as <em>several </em>but only as <em>equal. </em>This part <em>of </em>the covenant is laid in the declaration as a covenant to <em>hoth </em>to pay a sum of money to <em>each; </em>which is not distinguishable in principle from a covenant to <em>two </em>to perform a duty to <em>one </em>of them, which would certainly give the covenantees a joint action. As to the 400 dollars, that was stated as having been covenanted to be paid to them <em>jointly. </em>And this construction of the allegation of the covenant, ought the rather to prevail, seeing that it appeared in the sequel of the declaration, that both sums of money were to be paid to <em>Broion </em>and <em>Jarman </em>for a duty to be performed by them <em>jointly, </em>and that they covenanted <em>jointly </em>to refund the money, in case they failed to perform the joint duty. It was easy to see how, both being concerned in a joint undertaking, each might be interested that the other as well as himself should receive his compensation ; their contract with each other might have given them a common interest, each in the compensation to be paid the other. And he referred to the covenant itself, set out in the bill of exceptions, and argued from the frame of the instrument, that it was a covenant to the parties jointly.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-7\">Bkooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AD1\">As the bond is not made part of the record by the pleadings, it is not to be so treated, though it is noticed in the bill of exceptions, but the declaration alone is to be looked to, for the terms of the covenant on which the suit is brought. v</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>It is a well settled principle, that covenants are to be con- . , . . <em>, , </em>.. ... sidered as either joint or several, according to the rights and interests of the parties; and this on the soundest reason; for though a covenant with several persons be joint and several in its terms, yet if the legal interest and cause of action be joint, the action must be brought by all; and, on the other hand, if the interest and cause of action be several, the action must be brought by one only, though the covenant be in its terms joint. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Martindale, </em>1 East, 497; 1 Wms. Saund. 153. This rule of construction of covenants, though apparently technical, effects the great' purposes of justice, and avoids great inconvenience, and the costs of multiplied suits. So, where there is but one duty covenanted to be performed to two or more, they have a joint interest and but one action, otherwise, the defendant would be vexed with two or more suits for one thing, and the court would not know for whom judgement should be pronounced. On the other hand, where the rights are distinct, and plainly separate, the action must be several: for if a joint action be brought, there must be a joint judgement ; and one might recover a judgement for the rights of another, and by survivorship at the common law, claim the whole interest instead of his due proportion. It may happen also, that where there is but one duty to be performed to one of two individuals, yet both may be interested in the performance of it; in such case, the contract is joint, and both must sue : as where A. owes B. <em>\u00a3 </em>100. and C. owes A. a like sum, and covenants with A. and B. to pay it to B. here A. though he is to receive nothing, is interested in the payment to B. and the action must be joint. Indeed, where a party covenants with <em>two </em>to pay money to <em>one </em>only, the law presumes an interest in the other, although he is to receive nothing; because he is joined in the contract, and there can be no other assignable motive for it; and there, the action must be joint, as in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Martindale. </em>The interest presumed in such case, must be a <em>joint </em>interest, as <em>two </em>could not have a several interest, in the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>formance of a single duty to one of them. But where the <em>. . </em>. . . , , covenant is with <em>two jointly </em>to pay to them <em>\u00a3 </em>50 <em>each, </em>or to deliver a horse to <em>each; </em>in that case, though the language of the covenant is joint, yet the interest is <em>several; </em>for there are two duties to be performed, instead of a single duty, which two duties may be <em>severed; </em>and, as the interest of each is distinct and separate, and the one has ho interest in the performance of the duty to the other, by any inference from the covenant being joint, it is to be considered several and not joint: it is unlike the case in which the covenant is with two, and the duty to be performed to one only. So, where the covenant is joint and several, in its terms, yet if it appears that the interest and cause of action are joint, the action must be joint: as if one covenants to do an act for the benefit of two, and binds himself'to them <em>and each of them </em>for performance, the action must be joint, though these last words are words of severalty. <em>Slingsby\u2019s </em>case, 5 Co. 19. a. 2 Bac. Abr. <em>Covenant. </em>D. p. 68. For, as there is a single duty only, a single action only will lie, or there would be a double recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">These principles govern the case before us. The declaration alleges, that the defendant <em>\u201c </em>covenanted with <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jarman </em>to pay them 300 dollars\u201d (had it stopped there, it would have been a joint covenant; but it proceeds) <em>\u201c to wit, </em>to each of them one moiety thereof.\u201d These are obviously words of severalty: two distinct duties are to be performed, in which each has a distinct and several interest. The words that <em>follow\u2014\u201c </em>also the sum of 400 dollars\u201d\u2014 do not alter the character of the preceding covenant, but on the contrary take its character from it, as in <em>Northumberland </em>v. <em>Errington, 5 </em>T. R. 522. Neither do the words .to each of them a moiety thereof,\u201d\u2019 give <em>to </em>that part of the preceding covenant, a several as well as <em>joint </em>character merely : they extinguish its joint character, not by adding a new principle to the contract, but by explaining that which the previous words seemed to give it. Those words \u201c to each of them a moiety thereof,\u201d do not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the covenant joint and several, but several only. It is a , covenant to pay several sums to each ot them, and not to perform a single duty to both of them$ a covenant to pay several sums to each of two persons, respectively, 150 dollars to one and 150 dollars to the other. Each has a distinct interest in one of the sums, and no interest in the other. Nor does the joint contract of <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jarman </em>for the labour or duty to be performed on their part, affect the covenant of <em>Carthrae </em>to pay for that labour. Though their contract for the labour was joint, they might intend to be paid for it severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Upon this ground, without noticing the point presented by the hill of exceptions, both judgements are to be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
