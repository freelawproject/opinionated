at which basin the upper navigation of the river at present ends : that, just below the head of the canal, there was a large waste, so constructed as to discharge back into the river, all the water received into the canal at its head, beyond what was necessary to keep the water in it three feet deep : that, between that large waste and the waste at the locks at <em>lndian-town </em>creek, there were three other smaller wastes, the last of which was one and a half miles above the waste at the locks; and these three wastes were so contrived as to discharge back into the river, far above the plaintiffs\u2019 mills, all the water diverted into the canal, beyond what was necessary to keep the water therein three feet deep : that, at the said locks at <em>lndian-town </em>creek, there was another waste, so contrived as to discharge all the water in the canal immediately above those locks, beyond what was necessary to keep three feet depth of water in the canal there ; but the water discharged by <em>this waste at the locks, </em>was not returned to the river, but was conducted round the locks, into the canal below them; such being the method adopted to feed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the canal from the locks to the basin at <em>Petersburg: </em>that the <em>waste at the locks </em>was about 14 feet wide, and the water running over it, in ordinary seasons, about two inches deep on the waste: that there was another waste at the basin, to let off the water from the basin to the river; which waste was 25 feet wide, and the water running over it, in ordinary s\u00e9asons, only one inch deep on the waste : that, in dry seasons, the water running over the wastes, was not half so deep on the wastes, as at ordinary seasons : that the water discharged <em>by the waste at the basin, </em>passed over a stripe of land, owned by the company down to the river, into which it fell about 100 yards below the plaintiffs\u2019 mills; and on this stripe of land, were situated the mill seat and the mill, let to tenants by the company, of which, and of the lease of water for working the same, the plaintiffs complained in this action, as injurious to their property; and that, at dry seasons, there was a great dearth of water discharged over the waste at the basin, for working the company\u2019s mill there situate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-11\">And the plaintiffs adduced evidence to support the issues on their part, and in opposition to that adduced by the company; evidence to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the fall or graduation of the canal, of twelve inches in the mile, was greater than was necessary or convenient for the purposes of navigation, and the company thereby acquired, and was enabled to apply to mill power, a much greater quantity of water than was necessary for navigation, or for any other purpose except mill power : and that the surplus of water might be conveniently discharged at a waste, which was placed at a short distance below the locks at <em>Indian-town </em>creek, which would discharge the water above <em>Banister\u2019s, </em>as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 mills; but the waste last mentioned, has been so constructed by the company as to prevent the passage over it, of much of the surplus water in dry seasons, and to throw all or the greater part thereof over the waste at the basin, whence it was used and applied by the company for mill power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>And it was proved, that the supply of water for the plain- . <em>r , . , , </em>\u201e tiffs mills, was drawn from the river at a point below <em>t\u00edanister's </em>mills, and below all the wastes of the company\u2019s canals, except that at the basin : that, at dry seasons, namely, for a considerable time between the 1st August and the October, in ordinary years, there was a scarcity of water for the mills on the river, including the plaintiffs\u2019 mills: and that, during this time, the water discharged over the company\u2019s waste at the basin, was used by it, or under its authority, for mill power, and discharged into the river below the plaintiffs\u2019 mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-7\">Whereupon, the counsel for the company prayed the court to charge and instruct the jury as to the law of the case; and the court gave the following charge and instruction to the jury\u2014\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">That a grant of running water to a company, and a grant of a right to carry that water through a navigable canal, from one point of a river to a lower point, for the purpose of improving the navigation, conveyed an absolute right to the use of all the water which might be necessary for that purpose. That the right to carry the water through a canal, given to such company, gave no right to stagnate it, so as to injure the health of the people dwelling in the neighbourhood.' That, unless vessels were perpetually passing such a canal, there must be always a surplus of water, over and above what was necessary for navigation, and it was the <em>duty </em>of the company to parry off such surplus water, and its <em>right, </em>to carry it off, at the lower end of its canal, unless it was restricted by law as to the point at which it was to be carried off. That this company had a right to sell or lease the <em>surplus </em>water to others, for the purpose of working mills and the like ; in other words, that this mill power (as it had been called) so far as it could be given by the <em>surplus </em>water, was a necessary incident to the grant of running water, and of the right to convey it by a canal, as aforesaid. That this incidental power was so understood by the legislature, when it granted the charters of the <em>James </em>and Po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>towmac </em>river navigation companies; for it there recognized it; but fearing lest the companies might abuse their power, by trespassing upon the lands of adjacent proprietors, or'by condemning their lands for mill seats, under pretext of car''yh'Jg their canals through them, it restrained them from their water for mill power, except with the consent of those proprietors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That the act of 1787, ch. 53. granted to <em>The trustees of the Appomatox company, </em>the right to sell or dispose of all the <em>surplus </em>water, which might be in their canal, over and above what was necessary for navigation, for mill purposes, and was so understood by the legislature. That, by that act, the trustees could not let off this water <em>below Banister's </em>mill; and by the act of 1792, though they were allowed to open the navigation <em>below Banister's </em>mill, yet they were restrained from selling a mill seat below it. That the act of 1795, ch. 35. incorporating the present company, gave it the same powers as the old company had by the act of 1787, but did not allow the new company to open the navigation below <em>Banister's' </em>mill: therefore, the power to do so, conferred by the 4th section of the act of 1792, ch. 60. was repealed, by the act of 1795, as coming within its purview; and with the 4th section, the <em>proviso </em>contained in the 6th section, restraining the trustees from selling any mill seats except between <em>Atkinson's </em>and <em>Banister's </em>mills, was also repealed. That, by the act of 1796, ch. 26. express power was given to the company to extend the navigation from <em>Banister's </em>mills to tide water; and that, the former restriction as to selling1 mill seats not being renewed, the incidental power of carrying off the surplus water of the canal from the lower end thereof, and selling that surplus water to other purposes, for working mills, and the like, accompanies the power so to extend the navigation. That, for the purpose of improving the navigation of <em>Appomatox </em>river, a just and sound discretion \"was vested in the present company, by its charter, as to the location of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>canal, and the proper mode of cutting and graduating it 5 in the exercise of which discretion, it was bound strictly to keep in view the object for which it was authorized to cut the canal: if it had exercised this authority <em>mala fide, </em>for the purpose of taking from the river, more water than was convenient and sufficient for the commodious navigation of , . . ,,,,, boats <em>carrying eight hogsheads oj tobacco, </em>and had, by the graduation of the canal, increased the quantity of surplus water therein beyond what was necessary for such commodious navigation, so as to increase its own mill power to a greater degree than it would have by a canal judiciously made, then it was liable to an action for damages, by any owner of a mill on the river, whose quantity of water was reduced by such injudicious act: but, if it had exercised its authority soundly, having regard to the nature of the ground, the expense to which it was subject, the distance of the two points between which the canal was to be cut, and the health of the neighbourhood, then no injury was done to any of the proprietors of the mills on the river, for which an action could be maintained. That it was the duty of the jury to decide, whether or not this discretion on the part of the company, had been exercised soundly. That the company had a right to apply the surplus water of the canal to mill power, on its own account, or on account of such persons to whom it might lease or sell the same, so as not to trespass on the lands of other persons, in the use of the water, or letting it off, and a right to let off the surplus water at the basin terminating the canal in <em>Petersburg; </em>and was not restricted, by any of the acts of assembly referred to, from establishing mill seats, on any part of the river or canal, except between <em>Atkinson\u2019s </em>and <em>Banister\u2019s </em>mills. And that the plaintiffs had no right to claim redress in this action, for any injury to the navigation of the canal, between the basin and the locks at <em>Indian-town </em>creek, by the use of the water from the basin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\">The plaintiffs, by their counsel, excepted to so much of the above opinion and charge, as affirmed the right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>company to use water from-their canal for mill power, and to discharge the same below their mills, thereby lessening their supply of water, or to discharge any more water from the basin at the end of the canal, to a part of the river be- ^ plaintiffs\u2019 mills, than was necessary to keep the water in the canal and basin, from stagnating and injuring the ^ ne\u00a1gi1bourilooci) provided the surplus water, or the excess thereof beyond the purposes last mentioned, could be conveniently discharged above <em>Banister's </em>mills; and also, to so much of the said opinion and charge, as affirmed the right of the company to make sale of any mill seat on any part of the river or canal, except between <em>Atkinson's </em>and <em>Banister's </em>mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">II.

Whereupon the county court issued the usual writ of <em>ad quod damnum; </em>in pursuance whereof an acre of <em>Tabb's </em>land was laid off for the abutment, which the jury valued at \u00a3-20. and found, that the building a mill, <em>at the place set forth in Wheeler's petition, </em>would not damage any mansion house or offices, curtileges or gardens, thereto belonging, nor would any orchards be overflowed, nor would fish of- passage or ordinary navigation be in any manner obstructed thereby. The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>quisition being returned, and <em>Wheeler </em>producing <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>receipt for the \u00a320. the court, at May term 1791, with <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>consent, made an order, declaring that there appeared no legal impediment or reason why the leave asked by <em>Wheeler </em>should not be granted, condemning the acre land for the abutment of the dam, and giving <em>Wheeler </em>leave <em>\u00b0 </em>to erect the mill <em>on his island.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-11\">The plaintiffs then proved that <em>Wheeler </em>proceeded, without delay, to erect his mill, not however <em>upon his island, </em>but on <em>Tabb\u2019s land </em>on the main, taking the water from the river above the dam and abutment allowed by the order of the county court, and conducting it by a canal to his mill, which was built some distance below the abutment. And they offered evidence to prove, that the canal was dug through, and the mill built on, <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>land, with his assent and approbation ; that the plaintiffs had acquired the title of both <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Tabb; </em>and that they, and those under whom they claimed, had been in quiet and undisturbed occupation of the mills, <em>for more than twenty years before this action was instituted.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-12\">The plaintiffs also exhibited the record of another proceeding in the county court of <em>Chesterfield, </em>whereby it appeared, that in 1816, <em>they </em>applied by petition to that court, representing that they were now the owners of the land on the main on the northern shore of the river, and that, for the purpose of raising the head of water for their mills already established, they wished to make a dam from the main across an arm of the river, to an island therein belonging to <em>S.

The court issued a writ of <em>ad quod damnum; </em>an inquisition was taken and returned ; the whole of <em>Turner\u2019s </em>island (about 3-4ths of an acre) was, with his consent, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>demtaed for the abutment; and leave was given to the plaintiffs, to make the dam from the main to <em>Turner\u2019s </em>island, according to the prayer of the petition. The continuation of the dam, from <em>Turner\u2019s </em>island to the island which was the afJutment- of <em>Mackenzie &amp;f Christian\u2019s </em>dam, was made by them and the plaintiffs, uniting in the work for their mutual advantage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-10\">It appeared, by a map laid before the jury, that this new dam was some distance above the dam made by <em>Wheeler, </em>and that the water drawn from the river for the use of the mills <em>at present, </em>was taken out above the new dam, and thence conducted by a canal to the mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-11\">Whereupon, the court, on the motion of the counsel for the company, instructed the jury, that, under the order and proceedings of the county court of <em>Chesterfield </em>first above stated, <em>Wheeler </em>had no right to build his mill where he did build it, on' the land of' <em>Tabb, </em>or on any other land but his own, and no right to take water from the river for the mill he built on <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>land; that no consent or act of <em>Tabb </em>could authorize <em>Wheeler, </em>under the order of the county court, to build his mill and cut his canal on <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>land, <em>and </em>to take water from the river for the use of the mill so there built; that, therefore, the mill was not established according to law, so as to entitle <em>Wheeler, </em>or any claiming under him, to draw water from the river, by means of <em>his </em>dam, for the use of the mill; and that, upon the pleadings in this case, the plaintiffs could not recover damages for any injury done by the company, in diverting the water of the river, by means of its canal and works connected with it, from the plaintiffs\u2019 mills thus built without any authority of law. To which opinion and instruction the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-12\">There was a verdict for the defendants, and judgement accordingly; to which this court, upon application of the plaintiffs, allowed them a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-13\"><em>. </em>I. <em>Johnson, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_S\">upon the points presented by the first bill of exceptions, contended, that <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>charter of <em>The Upper Appomatox company, </em>did not, and could not, give the company a right to divert the waters of the river from their natural channel, even for the purposes of the navigation, to the injury of the owners of mills upon the river, whose rights to the use of the stream for working their mills, had been previously acquired from the commonwealth, under the general law of the land : that though the public had a right to the <em>use </em>of the <em>Appomatox, </em>as of all other rivers, for the purposes of navigation, yet the plaintiffs in this case, under the order of the county court of <em>Chesterfield </em>of May 1791 (supposing that order and the proceedings under it regular) acquired a right to the use of the stream for their mill, paramount to the <em>public right </em>to the river <em>for the purposes of navigation, </em>and paramount, of course, to the rights granted to <em>this </em>company, to improve the navigation, since <em>this </em>company claimed its charter under the act of 1795 : for, that the general statute of 1785, eh. 82. 12 Hen. stat. at large, p. 187, concerning mill dams and other obstructions of water courses, and all the subsequent statutes on the same subject, delegated to the county courts, full authority to grant leave to individuals to build dams across any stream, navigable or innavigable, for the purpose of raising a head of water to work mills; and empowered the county court to ascertain and determine, whether or no <em>ordinary navigation </em>would be thereby obstructed, and if it would, to lay the party under such conditions for preventing such obstruction, as to the courts should seem right; and these statutes proceeded on the principle, that the grantees of the mill rights, erecting mills which were of public use and convenience, performed a meritorious service to the public, which was a valuable consideration for the grant to them of the privilege to use the water. For these propositions, he cited <em>Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate river company, </em>6 Rand. 245. which, he insisted, was directly in point. In the present case, the county court of <em>Chesterfield </em>did ascertain and decide, that the building <em>ffheeler\u2019s </em>dam would not in any manner obstruct ordinary navigation, and granted him the privilege without any condition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Axf5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Stanard </em>and <em>Leigh, </em>for defendants in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZo\">said, there was an obvious distinction between <em>Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate river company, </em>and this case: <em>Slate river </em>had never been declared a navigable stream, and the legislature had never Passed any act to assert the public right to that stream, for PurPoses \u00b0f navigation, much more any act expressly declaring and providing, that all mill rights should be subordinate to the public right of navigation, until long after the mills of the <em>Crenshaws </em>had been established according to law; whereas, with respect to the <em>Appomatox </em>the legislature had, expressly and repeatedly, asserted the public right to the stream for the purpose of navigation, and had provided that all mill rights granted to individuals, should be held in subordination thereto, before any leave was granted by the county court to <em>Wheeler, </em>under whom the plaintiffs claim, to build any mill and dam upon the river. This distinction between <em>Slate river </em>and the <em>James </em>and <em>Appomatox, </em>was carefully stated by <em>Green, </em>J. in his opinion in <em>The Slate river company\u2019s </em>case, <em>Id. </em>268. Besides the several acts stated in the bill of exceptions, they referred to the act of 1745, ch. 18. 5 Hen. stat. at large, p. 375. and 1752, ch. 40. 6 <em>Id. </em>p. 291. to shew, that even thus early, the grant of any mill rights, that could at all interfere with the navigation of this river, or the improvement thereof, was inhibited. These early acts on the subject, indeed, were not set out in the bill of exceptions; but they were <em>public </em>statutes, of which the court would take judicial notice; for they were statutes concerning all persons generally, though in respect of a particular thing. 6 Gwill. Bac. Abr. <em>Statute </em>F. p. 374. <em>Stribling </em>v. <em>Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. 138. 148. 169. 188. Then, putting the authority of <em>The Slate river company\u2019s </em>case out of the way, it was impossible to find an objection to the charge given by the circuit court to the jury, stated in the first exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-4\">II. The general question presented by the <em>second </em>exceptions, was, Whether the mill that was in fact built by <em>Wheeler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>on the main upon <em>Tabb\u2019s </em>land, with his consent, under co-lour of the order of the county court of <em>Chesterfield </em>of May 1791, granting him leave to build a mill on his own land in the island, was a mill established according to law, for the use of which he acquired, by that order of court, a right to draw water from this navigable river, the bed and the stream whereof belonged to the commonwealth ? And this question led to a minute examination of the provisions, the principles and the policy, of the various statutes concerning mills and mill dams, which are referred to in a note upon the title of the revised statute of 1819, 2 Rev. Code, ch. 235. p. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">But <em>Johnson </em>contended, that the plaintiffs\u2019 legal right to their mills, and to the use of the water of the river for the same, could not be inquired into, in the collateral way, in which it was attempted to be drawn in question here. And if it might, and if their right was originally imperfect, yet they and those under whom they claimed, having enjoyed the use of the water for their mills, without interruption and without question, before the charter to <em>The Upper Appomatox company, </em>and for more than twenty years since the date of the charter, and before the commencement of this suit, such possession of itself sufficed to give them a right to the use of the water as an easement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">To this it was answered, 1. that the twenty years uninterrupted enjoyment of the water by the owners of these mills, was not stated in tho bill of exceptions: it was only stated there, that they had been in quiet and undisturbed occupation of the mills for more than twenty years <em>before the commencement of this suit, </em>not <em>before the company completed, its canal, basin and waste at the basin, </em>which was an interruption of the use of the water by the plaintiffs for their mills, and the very interruption they were now complaining of. 2. That the possession of such an easement, in order to give title to it, must be an <em>adversary one; Coalter </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>4 Rand. 58. Here, the use of the water for <em>Stokes 8f Smith\u2019s </em>mills, never became adversary to the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>company or of the public, till the company\u2019s use of the , , water became adversary to their s; that is, not till the company had completed its canal, basin, and waste there. Neither was it conceivable how any use of the water <em>below </em>the head \u00b0f the company\u2019s canal, by which it drew its supply 0f water from the river, could be adversary to the company\u2019s use of the water. And 3. That mill rights of this kind, being only acquirable in <em>Virginia </em>by order of court, and the precise title of <em>Stokes &amp;f Smith </em>appearing by matter of record, there could be no room to presume a grant to them from any length of possession and enjoyment. There was no attempt to inquire into the plaintiffs\u2019 mill rights in a collateral way; they were directly put in issue by the pleadings.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\"> See charters of those companies, 1 old Rev.

Was it correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Two preliminary objections were taken to it; 1. that the plaintiffs, and those under whom they claim, had been in quiet possession of the mill for more than twenty years; and 2. that the legality of the erection, could not be questioned in this collateral way. To the first, two answers present themselves: 1. that this is a <em>public right; Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate river company: </em>2. that the twenty years possession must be <em>adverse; Coalter </em>v. <em>Hunter. </em>The occupation of these mills on the stream <em>below, </em>could in no way affect the <em>Appomatox company </em>in their use of the water taken into their canal far <em>above. </em>As to the other objection, that we cannot inquire here, whether the order of court authorized the building the plaintiffs\u2019 mill; it must be recollected, that this case stands on ground very different from that of <em>The Slate river company. </em>The <em>Appomatox </em>had long been declared by law a public highway, and the rights of the riparian possessors, with respect to building mills Sic. modified and restricted. For the particulars on this point, I refer to my brother <em>Green\u2019s </em>remarks in <em>The Slate river </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>company\u2019s </em>case, 6 Rand. 267-9. The <em>Appomatox </em>company, under a public law, had erected their works, dug their canal, and taken out the water: for this, the plaintiffs, as <em>millers, </em>bring this action for an injury done to their mills: the defendants plead the very fact, that the order of court did not authorize the erection of this mill, and that therefore it is no legal mill; the plaintiffs take issue on this plea. Could it be wrong under this state of the pleadings, for the defendants to ask, or the court to give, instructions, as to the law of the subject ?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">But were those instructions right? <em>Wheeler, </em>owning the island, moved for leave to build a mill on it, and not owning the opposite shore, moved to condemn an acre for an abutment for his dam : he got this acre condemned, and leave to erect his mill <em>on his island. </em>Did this authorize him to build the mill on the opposite acre, condemned for his abutment? or on a canal taken out on the north side of the river, and away below that acre ? I say, clearly no. The words have a distinct and definite meaning, and to that they must be confined. Suppose <em>Wheeler, </em>owning the island, had moved the court to condemn an acre on the opposite side, to <em>build his mill on, </em>meaning to abut his dam on his island; could the court have done it? where is the authority? The law expressly says, that the party applying to build a mill, must <em>own </em>the lands on which he means to build it. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Boughan, </em>1 Call, 329. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 565. A mill is a great public benefit,\u2014 a <em>mill seat </em>a valuable property; and to him who owns this, the law has given power to have an acre on the opposite shore condemned, to enable him by means of his mill to subserve the public interest. The very words of the law are \u201c any person desiring to build a water grist mill, or other machine, or engine <em>useful to the public;\u201d </em>and, indeed, nothing but the public interest could justify the strong handed measure of taking from a citizen his own property, whether he will or no. But if one own the land where the mill is to be built, he owns the <em>mill seat; </em>and it is <em>his </em>privilege to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>condemn the acre opposite, not the privilege of the opposite owner, to condemn his <em>mill seat. </em>The county court, -therefore, in this case, neither meant to give, nor had power t0 give, or to sell, to <em>Wheeler, </em>an acre of <em>Tabb's </em>land, to <em>build his mill on. </em>If, then, under this order, <em>Wheeler </em>had 77 built his mill on the condemned acre; I should have said he nQ authority to do so. But it is worse than this : under the order to build <em>on his island, </em>he has taken water out, on the north side, by a canal cut through the land of <em>Tabb, </em>for some distance below (we are not told, whether a quarter or a half mile, or a mile) and has built his mill on this canal. If this is justified by the order, there is no locality at all about it. There is the dam to be sure, where the order designates; but the race may be as long, and the mill as far off, as you please. It must be observed that the inquest says, a mill built <em>at the place set forth in the petition, </em>will not damage any house, overflow any offices, or cause any of the other mischiefs which the law guards against, but says nothing of the effect upon the property or health of the citizens, of carrying this water through the canal to the mill where it was actually erected. We all know how often lands are injured by carrying water through them, and how often a canal affects the health of those living near it. Do not these considerations alone, shew, that a scite which was never viewed, and a canal that was never contemplated, by the jury of inquest, cannot be authorized by its report? I say, then, that the proceedings of the county court, did not authorize the digging this canal, and building this mill where it stands; and that the instruction of the circuit court on this point, was correct. I think the judgement should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b360-10\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">The merits <em>of </em>this case depend on the pleadings, and the several instructions given by the circuit court to the jury, at the trial. The two material issues joined in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>volve the inquiries, 1st, Whether <em>The Upper Appomatox company, </em>under the acts of 1795 and 1796 incorporating it, and the several acts referred to in the first bill of exceptions, was authorized to take the water of the river for the purpose of navigation, and also to use the surplus water incidental to the use of it for navigation, for milling purposes? and 2ndly, Whether <em>Wheeler, </em>under whom the plaintiffs claim, built and established his dam and mill, in pursuance of the order of <em>Chesterfield </em>court?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The <em>Appomatox, </em>it must be premised, had, before the order of <em>Chesterfield </em>court authorizing <em>Wheeler </em>to build his mill, been declared a navigable river by law. This feature of the case takes it out of the decision of this court in the case of <em>Crenshaws </em>v. <em>The Slate river company. </em>I think the instruction of the judge to the jury, which belongs to the first inquiry, was perfectly correct. It was, in substance, that the rights of this company, under the several acts referred to, were paramount to the rights of the plaintiffs under the order of <em>Chesterfield </em>court. The <em>jus publicum, </em>in the navigation of the river, expressly granted by those acts to the company, for the legitimate purpose of facilitating its navigation, gave to the company, for that object, all the water of the river necessary for the purpose, and also all the surplus water incidental to the use of it for navigation, for milling purposes. Though our institutions and laws are justly tenacious of private rights, yet the ruling principle of them is, that, when <em>private </em>rights come in conflict with <em>public, </em>the former must yield to the latter; in which event the legislature alone is competent to make compensation. The public right to the navigation of the rivers of the commonwealth, cannot be weaker, than the public right to a highway on the land ; and it will be found, on an examination of our legislation on that subject, that the right of way on the land, has uniformly been asserted, notwithstanding the grant of the land, in the broadest terms, and that without compensation to the proprietor, until a very late period, when by statute the writ of <em>ad quod damnum, </em>was provided in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>case. Nor should I think it material, but for <em>The Slate river company's </em>case, whether a river has or has not been dedared navigable by law. The common law on the subject, as understood in <em>England, </em>mixed up, as it is, with the preroSatave \u00b0f the crown, is not to be so understood here, its peculiar beauty is, that it adapts itself to the rights of parunc\u00a1er evepy change of circumstances. So far as it recognizes the prerogative of the crown, it was abolished by the revolution; and, even where that is not the case, it is not always applicable to the same objects here, as in <em>England; </em>as was said by some of the judges of this court, in the case of <em>Lightfoot </em>v. <em>Colgin, 5 </em>Munf. 42. <em>Findlay </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 Munf. 134. Therefore, even the grants of the crown before the revolution, are not <em>now </em>to be interpreted, as <em>before, </em>when the prerogative was in full force here. The public right to a way on the water, or the land, is a trust to be administered by the government for the community at large; never to be destroyed, but to be so administered as to facilitate the enjoyment of it by the public; as it was administered by the charter incorporating this <em>Appomatox </em>company. It cannot, in its nature, be the subject of a grant to an individual or corporation but for that object, since it cannot be enjoyed as private property in any other mode. I know, that there are rivers and streams in <em>England, </em>in which individuals have a property by grants from the crown, as to which the public right to a highway on them, has ceased to exist. Lord <em>Hale, </em>in his tract <em>de jure maris, </em>p. 8. 9. is not very precise, when he says, there be some streams and rivers that are private, not only in propriety and ownership, but in use, as little streams or rivers that are not a common passage for the king\u2019s subjects. He does not tell us, how these little streams or rivers became private property. We can only infer, that they became so by force of grants from the crown; especially, as he tells us also, that there be other rivers, as well fresh as salt, that are of common or public use for carriage of boats and lighters, and these, whether they are fresh or salt, whether they flow and reflow or not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>are, <em>prima facie, publici juris. </em>However this may be by the common law in <em>England, </em>I think the doctrine which gives private property in rivers, has no application here, for the reasons before stated. In considering this point, I can perceive nothing in the grants under our legislation, that authorizes the distinction, taken by <em>Hale, </em>as to the streams and rivers of this <em>commonwealth; </em>nor do I think the broadest of our grants can be so construed. Even the patents under the act of 1705, in which the form of grant is given, and in which rivers, waters, marshes &amp;c. are specified, ought not to be so construed as to deprive the people of this commonwealth of the <em>jus publicum in the navigation </em>of our rivers. In 3 Kent\u2019s commentaries, p. 333. it is said the doctrino was asserted in the state of <em>Jersey, </em>that the soil of its navigable rivers, and the waters also, was private and not public property, that passed in feesimple from the original proprietors under royal patents to the present occupiers and grantees; that the title was originally in the king, by right of discovery, according to the public law of <em>Europe; </em>and, upon that foundation, that the proprietors of land on rivers and waters, navigable and innavigable, have, immemorially, exercised the right to the soil, and to several fisheries; but this claim was decided to be subject to the <em>jus publicum </em>in the <em>navigation, </em>and also to the regulations of the legislature for the protection and passage of fish. And this too, under a grant to the duke of <em>York </em>from the crown, as comprehensive in its terms as it could well be, even broader than the grants under our land law of 1705, the form of which has been since changed by statute. But, in the present case, we have no such grant before us. And how it can be inferred, from the several statutes concerning mills, that the public right in the navigation of the rivers and streams, on which mills are by those statutes authorized to be erected, passed to the mill owners, I cannot perceive. One of the earliest of those statutes, the act of 1734, ch. 2. 4 Hen. stat. at large, p. 53, 4. expressly and carefully guards the right of way over mill dams. I think, there is nothing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the statutes authorizing the county courts, upon application to them, to grant leave to erect dams, and to build mills; on the contrary, the charge prescribed by them to be given to the jury, who are to estimate damages &amp;c. requires, that they are to inquire, whether navigation will be obstructed, or the passage of fish; and provides the remedy in such cageg^ ^ \u00bf\u00a1rect|ng s]0pes &amp;0, And, though mills are a great public convenience, yet as that convenience is of an intirely different character from the <em>jus publicum </em>in a highway, the latter, on the construction of the statutes, ought not to be made to yield to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">On the second head of inquiry, I concur with judge <em>Carr. </em>I think the defendants had a right to question the authority of the plaintiffs, or of <em>Wheeler, </em>under whom they claimed, to erect their dam or mill under the order of <em>Chesterfield </em>court; the more especially, as the defendants had a right to dispose of the surplus water for milling purposes, which would be materially affected in value, by the mill of the plaintiffs. I think the judgement must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b364-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ApY\">I am of opinion, that the instruction given by the circuit court upon the trial of this cause, as set forth in the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, was erroneous. That instruction was vital to the plaintiffs\u2019 action, though it determined but a single insulated question, not affected by the various interesting matters, which have been evolved in the discussion here, and very probably, were fairly before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The action was brought by the plaintiffs in error, to recover damages for a diversion of the water of the <em>Appomatox </em>from their mill, by the defendants. To support the allegation in their declaration, they produced the record of proceedings in the county court, giving leave to build the mill in question, and to erect their dam for its use. It was proved, that the mill was forthwith erected, and has been quietly occupied for twenty years, by the plaintiffs and those under whom they claim. But the plaintiffs, or those under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>whom they claim, having built the mill house and dug a mill race to it, on the lands of <em>Tabb, </em>on the main land opposite to <em>Wheeler\u2019s </em>island, instead of on <em>Wheeler\u2019s </em>island, as authorized by the order of the county court, the circuit court, on the motion of the defendants, instructed the jury, that, under the order of the county court, <em>Wheeler </em>had no right to build his mill on any other land than his own, and to take water from the river for such mill; that the mill in question, was, therefore, not legally established, and so the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Although I think it clear, that an order to build a mill on a particular scite, does not authorize the erection of the mill house at a spot so essentially variant as neither to possess the advantages, nor to avoid the mischiefs, which the county court may have had in contemplation, in authorizing the establishment; yet, upon mature reflection, I very much doubt, whether that question can be collaterally inquired into in this case; and, even if it may be, I am of opinion, that the defendants should have shewn, that the departure from the strict interpretation of the order of court, was so material a departure as to deprive the plaintiffs of the use of the privilege which had been granted them. No such evidence was adduced; on the contrary, the acquiescence of <em>twenty </em>years very strongly evinces, that the change of scite of the mill house, was not considered as material, or as injurious to any one, or inconvenient to the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The question would have been very different, had it appeared, that the <em>dam </em>was not erected where the county court authorized it, or that it had been abandoned, or that a new and unauthorized dam had been erected elsewhere. For the location of the <em>dam </em>is, indeed, required by law to be ascertained, but not the scite of the <em>mill house. </em>The dam is not only, <em>as to this matter, </em>the principal, and the mill house the accessary, but it is, moreover, as far as appears in this case, the only matter with which the defendants had any thing to do. Had their canal been so located, as to have required the removal of the house, then it might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>become a question whether the plaintiffs had had a right to <em>t </em>t i build a <em>mill house </em>there. But, in the case as it appears in this record, the location of the mill house was not a matter in which they had any concern. The question between the parties, is, merely, whether the plaintiffs had a right to have the water running to their dam ? If they had, and the de^encjants jjaye d\u00a1verted it, without lawful authority or superiour right, they are responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Nor is the instruction supported by the pleadings. The plea is that the mill <em>and dam </em>were not erected according to the order, and the essential part of the plea, in reference to this contest, is that the <em>dam </em>was not so erected. If that had been proved, then indeed the court might have instructed the jury, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to their action; but the mere proof as to the mill <em>house, </em>did not sustain the plea, and the instruction was therefore improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">If I am right in this opinion upon the <em>second </em>bill of exceptions, it is unnecessary to go into an examination of the various questions submitted by the other. For, although it is true, that this court will affirm a judgement notwithstanding an erroneous instruction, against the plaintiff, provided it appears that upon the whole matter the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, yet I do not think the facts are sufficiently stated to enable this court to pronounce definitively upon the rights of the parties. I am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgement should be reversed and the cause sent back for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
