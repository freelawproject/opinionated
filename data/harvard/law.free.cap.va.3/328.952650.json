These commissioners subsequently made a report to the Court; and the <em>Railroad Company </em>having moved the Court to affirm the report, the Court overruled the motion, and disaffirmed it. From this order of the County Court disaffirming the report, the <em>Railroad Company </em>appealed to the Superior Court; and that Court reversed the order of the County Court, and sent the cause back with directions to affirm the report. From this order of the Superior Court, <em>Hancock </em>applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Stanard </em>and <em>Bouldin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A0B\"><em>Rhodes </em>and <em>Macfarland, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-13\"> In the abstract of the case of <em>The Cheasapeake and Ohio Canal Company </em>v. <em>Hoye, </em>2 Gratt. 511, it is said: \u201c That <em>an appeal </em>lies from the judgment of the County Court pronounced upon an inquisition taken,\u201d &amp;c. The word \u201c appeal\u201d is there used not as indicating the mode of appeal, but the fact that the case may be carried from the County to the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-7\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AB4\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The Court is of opinion, that the law authorizing appeals as of right from orders of the County Courts in controversies concerning roads, is applicable only to a controversy concerning the establishment of a road, and not to a collateral controversy concerning the damages occasioned by a road already established; and that in such collateral controversy, the order of the County Court can be revised by the Circuit Court only by means of a writ of <em>supersedeas ; </em>and that where the order of the County Court is not final, but interlocutory only, it cannot be revised by the Circuit Court in any mode of proceeding. It is therefore considered by the Court that the said judgment of the Circuit Court is erroneous, and that the same be reversed and annulled, with costs. And this Court proceeding to give such judgment as the Circuit Court ought to have rendered, it is further considered that the appeal from the order of the County Court be dismissed, as having been improvidently allowed, with costs to the appellee there. And it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the said Circuit Superior Court, and from thence to the County Court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
