of which <em>Sisson </em>paid <em>Brock </em>2000 dollars in cash, and, by deed of the same date, conveyed the <em>whole </em>of the land to <em>Henry Qamhill, </em>in trust to secure the payment of the balance of the purchase money, 5000 dollars, in instalments. <em>Sisson, </em>having made sundry payments to <em>Brock, </em>and reduced the debt he owed him to about 400 dollars, and being indebted to <em>Reuben Harrison </em>and <em>Jesse Cravens, </em>in the sum of 3212 dollars, by deed dated the 23rd February 1822, conveyed the land he had bought of <em>Brock, </em>\u201c except about 75 acres on the east side of the tract, which the said <em>Sisson </em>was about to sell to <em>Peter Burrow,\u201d </em>to <em>Philip Koontz, </em>in trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to secure the debt of 3212 dollars due to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens. </em>At the time this last mentioned deed of trust was executed, <em>Sisson </em>was in treaty with <em>Durrow, </em>for the sale to him of the 75 acres reserved by the deed $ but that treaty was afterwards broken off, and no sale was made to <em>Durrow. </em>By deed dated the 4th April 1824, <em>Sisson </em>conveyed the <em>whole </em>of the land he had bought of <em>Brock </em>(including the 75 acres, which he had reserved out of his mortgage to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens') </em>to the same <em>Philip Koontz, </em>in trust to secure the payment of a debt of 820 dollars due to <em>Henry Conrad. </em>All these deeds were duly recorded : <em>besides, Conrad, </em>as well as his trustee <em>Koontz, </em>had full notice of all the preceding conveyances and incumbrances ; and <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>when they took their mortgage of February 1822, had full notice <em>of the </em>previous mortgage to <em>Brock. </em>After the execution of the deed of trust to secure the debt due to <em>Conrad, Harrison, </em>ono of the <em>ccstuis gue trust </em>and creditors secured by the deed of February 1822, purchased <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>equity of redemption in the whole of the land that had been bought of <em>Brock, </em>and procured from <em>Brock, </em>an assignment of his claim for the balance of about 400 dollars yet remaining due to him, and of the deed of trust of the 4th June 1817, executed by <em>Sisson </em>to secure the debt to <em>Brock.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-4\">In a bill exhibited in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Staunton, </em>by <em>Conrad </em>against <em>Harrison, Cravens, Sisson, </em>and the trustee <em>Gambill </em>(the trustee <em>Koontz </em>was not a party, having died before suit brought) the purpose of which was to adjust the rights of the incumbrancers, and to settle the priorities among them j <em>Conrad </em>insisted, that the balance of 400 dollars due to <em>Brock </em>and by him assigned to <em>Harrison, </em>should be satisfied out of that part of the land, which was mortgaged to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>by the deed of trust executed by <em>Sisson </em>to <em>Koontz, </em>of February 1822, leaving the 75 acres (reserved by the exception in that deed) which <em>Sisson </em>was then about to sell to <em>Durroio, </em>untouched, and applicable, in the first instance, to the satisfaction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>debt of 820 dollars secured to <em>Conrad </em>by <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>deed of trust to <em>Koontz </em>of April 1824.

Therefore, he decreed and ordered, That the 75 acres should be sold by the marshal of the court, and that the nett proceeds of the sale thereof should be applied, first to the the payment, to <em>Harrison </em>as assignee of <em>Brock, </em>of the balance due upon <em>Brock\u2019s </em>mortgage of June 1817, and the residue, if any, to the payment of the debt due to <em>Conrad </em>upon his mortgage of April 1824. And that, the 75 acres being first sold, the residue of the land should then be sold by the marshal, and the nett proceeds of sale applied in the following order: 1st, to the payment of any balance of the debt due to <em>Harrison </em>on <em>Brock\u2019s </em>mortgage, that might remain unsatisfied after applying the proceeds of sale of the 75 acres to that debt; 2ndly, to the payment, to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>of the debt due them on their mortgage of February 1822 ; 3rdly, to the payment of the debt due <em>Conrad, </em>upon his mortgage of April 1824; and 4thly, if there should be any balance remaining, that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>be paid into court, subject to future order.

For, the intent of the parties to the deed of February 1822, whereby 75 acres of the land, which <em>Sisson </em>was about to sell to <em>Durrow, </em>was excepted and reserved out of the mortgage to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>was, to enable <em>Sisson </em>to sell that parcel of 75 acres, clear and unincumbered to <em>Durrow; </em>and if that parcel had been sold to <em>Durrow, Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>who, with such intent, and with full knowledge of <em>Brock\u2019s </em>incumbrance at the time, assented to the reservation of it, ought not to have been allowed, as against <em>Durrow, </em>to insist that the debt due to <em>Brock </em>should be charged upon it, in exoneration of the parcel mortgaged to them. Neither could their rights be varied or made better, by the circumstance, that, not <em>Durrow, </em>but <em>Conrad, </em>became the purchaser of the 7 5 acres; they intended to leave it in <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>power, to sell a clear unincumbered title in that parcel; and it made no odds to them, who was the purchaser. But, 2. supposing <em>Conrad </em>not to be entitled to priority in respect of the 75 acres; yet here, in effect, the whole of the subject was first mortgaged to <em>Brock, </em>and then part of it mortgaged to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>and last, the residue of it mortgaged to <em>Conrad. </em>And <em>Conrad </em>has a right to insist, that the part mortgaged to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>shall contribute, rateably with the part mortgaged to him, to the satisfaction of the debt due to <em>Brock </em>the eldest incumbrancer; and this in strict analogy to the settled principle of the law, that if a judgement be recovered binding the lands of the debtor, and then the debtor sell parcels of the lands to several purchasers, at several times, all the purchasers shall contribute, in just proportion, to the satisfaction of the judgement. 5 Vin.

In <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>2 Leigh, 426. 439. 444. where a judgement had been recovered against a debtor holding lands, and the debtor had afterwards aliened his lands to several purchasers at divers times, I endeavoured to maintain, for the eldest purchaser, that the lands in the hands of the junior purchaser, ought, in equity, to be first subjected and applied to the satisfaction of the judgement debt: but the court held, that <em>the </em>Jaw was perfectly settled otherwise; that \u201c all the alienees of the lands of a debtor bound by a judgement or recognizance, no matter in what order the alienations were made, are bound to bear equally the burden of satisfying the judgement, by mutual contributions, <em>pro rata, </em>according to the value of the property held by them; all being considered as in <em>cequali jure, </em>without regard to the priority of their purchases or conveyances.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7bh\">1. When <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>took their mortgage of February 1822, whereby the 75 acres, which <em>Sisson </em>was about to sell <em>Burrow, </em>were reserved out of <em>the </em>mortgage, they had no other intent than to obtain adequate security for the debt due to them, and they acted under the belief, that the part of the land mortgaged to them was adequate security for the debt. They <em>knew </em>that <em>Brock </em>had a mortgage of the whole land; and that they would have a right, as against <em>Brock </em>and <em>Sisson, </em>to compel <em>Brock </em>to take satisfaction out of the part which was mortgaged to him but not to them. It was no part of their duty to take care of the interests of <em>Burrow, </em>or any other purchaser from <em>Sisson, </em>of the 75 acres. It was the purchaser\u2019s business to take care of himself, and to see that the purchase money he contracted to pay <em>Sisson, </em>should be applied to relieve the subject from <em>Brock's </em>incumbrance. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>purchaser of the 7 5 acres stood in <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>place; he purchased <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>rights; he purchased subject to all claims, legal or equitable, which attached thereto in <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>hands. 2. As to the question of contribution among the junior mortgagees, to satisfy the eldest mortgage ; the proposition contended for, seems hardly reconcilcable with the fundamental principle or maxim, that regulates priorities among equitable incumbrancers: <em>(\u00bfui prior est in tempore, potior est injure. </em>To say, that in the case of a mortgage of a subject, followed by successive mortgages of the equity of redemption of the <em>whole </em>of the same subject, every <em>elder </em>shall have priority over every <em>junior </em>mortgagee throughout\u2014but that, if after the mortgage of the <em>whole </em>subject, there shall be several mortgages of several <em>parts </em>of it, to different persons, at different times, all the junior mortgagees of the equity of redemption, shall contribute, <em>pro rata, </em>out of the parts mortgaged to them, respectively, to pay off the debt due on the first mortgage,\u2014seems a very odd distinction. There may be more reason, perhaps, for a distinction between the case of subsequent absolute purchasers of parcels of a subject under mortgage, and mere mortgagees of the parcels : but even this distinction would be irreconcileable with general principles of equity. Chancellor <em>Kent </em>has decided, upon full consideration and the strongest reason, that there shall be no contribution between purchasers, at several times, in succession, of several parcels of lands under the lien of a prior judgement, or of a prior mortgage. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 447. <em>Clowes </em>v. <em>Dickenson, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>235. 241, 2. I must own, that, in the argument of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>though <em>Mr. Johnson </em>did not cite the decisions of chancellor <em>Kent </em>in the cases just mentioned, yet he urged, and with great force too, the same general reasoning, on which that judge founded his opinion ; but as it was only a minor point in that cause, and no authorities upon it were cited at the bar, the argument in support of it was not reported. But <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke </em>is not exactly in point to the present case: the eldest lieu in that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was a judgement; and this court sitting in chancery, placed the subsequent mortgagees in the same situation, in which it supposed the law would have placed them, if the judgement creditor had sued out a <em>scire facias </em>against them as <em>terre tenants. Mayo </em>v. <em>Tomkies </em>is not at all in point: there, the subsequent purchasers of the parcels of the mortgaged lands, claimed under a devise which charged the parcels equally.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b562-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Axo\">The only serious question in this case, is that which has been raised, and very well argued, on the subject of contribution. I have laboured exceedingly, to understand it; but l feel doubtful of my success; especially, as the present inclination of my mind seems opposed to my former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">I premise, that I do not think this question at all affected by the exception or reservation in the deed from <em>Sisson </em>to <em>Koontz </em>for the benefit of <em>TIarrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>nor by the understanding, .which the appellant\u2019s counsel supposed, existed between the parties to that deed. For the intent and design of the parties, we must consult the deed itself. That gives a lien on <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>land, except 75 acres on the east side of the tract. As to the land thus excepted, <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>have no claim on it as a security for the debt due them : but that is all: they say nothing as to the effect of <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien upon it; much less do they stipulate to relinquish any right, which their position as incumbrancers may give them, to throw <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien on this excepted land. We must, then, decide this as a general question.</p>\n<p id=\"AHl\">Considering <em>Conrad\u2019s </em>claim to <em>preference </em>over <em>Harrison, </em>by throwing <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien off the 75 acres, wholly unfounded, has he a right to stand on equal ground with Harrison? to claim a rateable contribution of him, in the payment of <em>Brock\u2019s </em>debt ? It lies at the very root of this doctrine of contribution, that the parties shall stand in <em>cequali jure. </em>The vendor or his heir can never call on his vendee for contribution. Suppose, after <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Harrison </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and <em>Cravens, </em>and before that to <em>Conrad, Brock\u2019s </em>trustee had advertised, and sold the 75 acres retained by <em>Sisson; he </em>could never have called on <em>Harrison </em>to bear his part of a common burden. So far from it, if <em>Brock\u2019s </em>trustee had advertised the <em>whole </em>land for sale, there can be no doubt, that <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>could have injoined the sale of the part covered by their deed, until it should be found, that the sale of <em>Sisson\u2019s </em>75 acres would not satisfy <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien; and for such deficiency only would the residue of the land have been liable. So, if <em>Sisson </em>had died, and this land (the 75 acres) had descended to his heirs, it would have been first liable in their hands, nor could they have asked contribution of any body; except indeed of <em>each other, </em>if they bad borne the burden unequally. <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>then, having this 75 acres between them and <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien, <em>when they took their deed, </em>is there any act or omission of their\u2019s <em>since, </em>which could deprive him of this protection ? None such is relied on. Could the sale or mortgage of this 75 acres by <em>Sisson </em>to <em>Conrad, </em>with full notice, change the equity of the parties, and give <em>Conrad </em>a right to contribution, which all must admit <em>Sisson </em>had not? This would violate that settled rule, that a vendee with notice, takes the land with all its equitable burdens, and stands precisely in the shoes of his vendor. Look at the position of these parties; do they stand in <em>cequali jure1} </em>I think not. <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>took their deed, knowing they had the 75 acres between them in danger: <em>Conrad </em>took the 75 acres, with the same knowledge: a knowledge calculated, essentially, to influence the contract of each. Suppose a man had bought a <em>thousand </em>acres of land, at the price of 10.000 dollars; that he had mortgaged it for the purchase money, and had paid all of it but 1000 dollars; and another wants to buy a <em>hundred </em>acres of this land : in making his contract, it will not weigh a feather in the scale, that the whole tract is still bound for 1000 dollars, while he knows that <em>nine hundred </em>acres still remain in his vendor\u2019s hands liable for this balance, before the hundred acres he proposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>to buy; can be charged. He would, without hesitation, give the full price, and pay the money, satisfied that the lien could never touch him. But suppose the vendee of the <em>thousand </em>acres, had sold to different purchasers nine hundred acres, and offered the last hundred to another, with the original lien for 1000 dollars still on the tract? assuredly, his prospects in the purchase would be very different; and common prudence would induce him to pause, till he should see clearly how the incumbrance was to be met. It seems plain to me, therefore, that the successive purchasers, or incumbrancers, do not stand in <em>cequali jure; </em>and that no one who comes after, can call on those before him for contribution. Sir <em>W. Harbert's case, </em>3 Co. 11. b. when carefully examined, will be found to rest on these principles of equity. The same subject is very ably handled by chancellor <em>Kent, </em>in several cases; especially in <em>Clowes v. Dickenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">If it be asked, how I can reconcile this decision with that of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>in which I sat, and agreed fully with the rest of the court? I answer, that I cannot reconcile them to my own satisfaction. I can only say, that, in each, I have decided as I thought right. I well remember to have examined with care, the authorities cited in <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>by our excellent and learned brother <em>[ Green, </em>J.] whose aid I most sincerely wish we had now; and to have thought his deductions from them correct. In that case, the decisions of chancellor <em>Kent </em>now cited, so powerful in their reasoning, seemed to have escaped both the bar and the bench. There was no reference to them. The counsel, indeed, took the ground in argument; but we thought all the authorities were the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">I am for affirming the decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b564-6\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Acs\">As to the first point, it is enough to say, that I concur with judge <em>Carr, </em>that the exception of the 75 acres out of the deed <em>of </em>trust of February 1822, to secure the debt due <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>furnishes no ground to sustain <em>Conrad's </em>claim to priority of satisfaction out of that reserved parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The other question is, Whether, on general principles, <em>Brock\u2019s </em>debt, which every body admits must be provided for, is to be first charged on the parcel of 75 acres? or whether it is to be charged, rateably, on that parcel and on the residue of the land conveyed in trust to <em>Cravens </em>and <em>Harrison </em>? There is no difference, as to this question, between creditors secured by mortgage, and creditors secured by deed of trust; and as the case may be thereby simplified, I will consider it as if <em>Sisson </em>were mortgagor and <em>Brock </em>mortgagee of the whole tract, and <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>and <em>Conrad, </em>were subsequent mortgagees, each, of particular parts of the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">All mortgages, whether original or subsequent, are regarded, in a court of equity, as mere <em>equitable </em>incumbrances for the security of the debt; and it is the business of that court, so to mould and direct these equities, as to effect the purposes of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">If there were no other persons concerned in this case, than <em>Sisson </em>the mortgagor, <em>Brock </em>the first mortgagee, and <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>the second mortgagees, all would admit, that a court of equity, in providing payment for <em>Brock\u2019s </em>debt, ought so to direct it as not unnecessarily to lessen or impair the security of <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens; </em>and, consequently, that <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien ought to be made to fall, in the first place, on the 75 acres not included in the mortgage to <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>and in which <em>Sisson </em>and <em>Brock </em>were alone interested. If this would be so, in that case, I cannot conceive how the alienee of <em>Sis-son\u2019s </em>equity of redemption, can stand on better ground than <em>Sisson </em>himself. And, accordingly, there never has been a case, where one of two <em>subsequent </em>mortgagees were held to be contributory to the other. They are not in equal right; but the last mortgage takes in subordination to him who precedes him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">It is supposed, that the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke </em>is in conflict with these principles. But that case is different from this, in some important respects. That was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>case of subsequent incumbrances, after a prior <em>mortgage, </em>but after a prior judgement. In that case, <em>English </em>had obtained a judgement against <em>Pickett, </em>who afterwards mortgaged a part of his lands to <em>Beverley, </em>and then, the whole to <em>Scott. English, </em>by his judgement, had a <em>legal </em>lien, and could have taken out an <em>elegit </em>against <em>all </em>the lands of <em>Pickett; </em>and it was not competent to a court of equity, to restrain or limit him in the exercise of that <em>legal </em>right. Besides, he was not plaintiff, nor did he ask any thing of a court of equity. He stood on his legal rights, which bound <em>all </em>of <em>Pickett's </em>lands; and this court, conforming to the law, executed that lien, by directing that all the lands should contribute, rateably towards the satisfaction of his judgement. Whether that decision was right or not, it will be time enough to inquire when a similar case shall occur. It is sufficient, for the present, to say, that that case is materially different from this; for here, the original lien is merely an equitable incumbrance, and not a lien by judgement; and here, the person claiming contribution, is plaintiff in equity, and therefore, can ask nothing but equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">I concur in the opinion, that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b566-5\">Tuckek, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AtU\">The rights of the parties in this case, must first be examined upon general principles of law, independent of the influence, which the exception in the deed of trust of February 1822, is supposed to have upon it. In this regard, <em>Conrad's </em>pretensions will be found to rest on no reasonable foundation. <em>Brock </em>having a deed of trust on the whole land, and <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>a subsequent deed of trust on one part of it, and <em>Conrad </em>a still later deed of trust on the whole, it is found, that there will not be enough to pay all. <em>Brock </em>must be paid, for he has the first lien. <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>or <em>Conrad, </em>must lose. Which ought to be the loser, the prior or the subsequent incumbrancer? The latter, assuredly. <em>Conrad </em>does not think so: but he can sustain his claim, only by shewing that he has a right, either to throw the whole burden from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>shoulders upon <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>or a part of that * 1 burden by compelling them to pay rateably.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">That <em>Conrad </em>should throw the whole burden upon <em>liarrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>who obtained their lien before he obtained his, would indeed be without example. The principle is clear, that where a first incumbrancer (as <em>Brock </em>in this case) has two funds to resort to, and a subsequent incumbrancer but one, the latter may compel the former to seek satisfaction out of that on which he has no lien, provided he does not thereby interfere with the superiour rights of a third person. Thus, if <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>had no incumbrance, <em>Conrad </em>might demand that his 75 acres should be relieved, and the burden thrown on that portion <em>which would yet have </em>remained in the debtor\u2019s hands. But <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>have an incumbrance on that part; an incumbrance prior to <em>Conrad\u2019s ; </em>and it would reverse the order of things, and upturn the established principles of equity, if he, who is subsequent in point of time, should be prior in point of right. <em>Conrad, </em>therefore, has no pretension to throw the <em>whole </em>burden upon <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Neither is he entitled to throw any part of the burden upon them. Before he purchased, no person had that right. His purchase was made with knowledge of their lien, and of <em>Brock\u2019s </em>incumbrance, and with presumed knowledge of the legal effect of those liens. Would it be just or reasonable, that <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>without any fault, or assent on their part, should thus be incumbered with any part of this burden? Far otherwise; for they not only have a right to resist <em>Conrad\u2019s </em>pretensions to throw the burden on them, but if <em>Brock </em>himself had been about to do so, they would have been entitled to demand that the whole burden should have been thrown upon <em>Conrad. </em>This is a necessary consequence of the principle of equity, already stated, that whore a first incumbrancer has two funds to resort to, and the subsequent incumbrancer can only charge one of them, the first incumbrancer shall be compelled to seek re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>dress, in the first instance from the other fund. Thus, if <em>Sisson </em>still held the 75 acres of land, <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cra-Wns </em>would have a clear right to demand that <em>Brock\u2019s </em>400 dollars should be paid out of that parcel, if adequate to the purpose, so as to leave their fund untouched. It is no sufficient objection to this, that <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>would thus, in effect, have satisfaction out of a fund on which they had no lien. That objection has never been considered availing, since the case of <em>Lanoy </em>v. <em>The duke of Athol, </em>2 Atk. 444. See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Tyndall, </em>Amb. 614. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>8 Ves. 381. The principle is firmly established, and cannot now be called in question, that if two funds of a debtor are liable to one creditor, and only one fund to another, the former shall be thrown upon that fund, to which the other cannot resort, in order that he may \u2022avail himself of his only security.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Now, if upon the execution of the deed of trust to them, <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>had this right against <em>Sisson, </em>they must have the same right against <em>Conrad, </em>because when <em>Conrad </em>purchased, he took his 75 acres, subject to its liability in the hands of the debtor, in preference to the land already incumbered to <em>Hamson </em>and <em>Cravens. </em>He sits (as has been well said) in the seat of his grantor, and must take the land with all its equitable burdens. It cannot be in the power of the debtor, by the act of selling the remaining land to discharge <em>it, </em>and throw the burden back upon <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens. </em>If so, we should then have this unheard of state of things, that one man shall lose his rights and property, without his fault or his assent, and another shall be enabled to take them away without an equivalent. The equity of <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>therefore, as against <em>Sisson, </em>to throw the burden upon his 75 acres, still subsists as against <em>Conrad, </em>who purchased from him with a full knowledge of all the facts, and a presumed knowledge of all the legal consequences of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">But it is said to be settled, that all the <em>alienees </em>of the lands of a debtor, are bound to contribute, rateably, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>satisfaction of a judgement which binds them, without regard to the time or order of their purchases. And it is contended, that the case of a mortgage does not differ from that of a judgement, nor the case of incumbrancers from that of alienees.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">That the principle contended for is in direct conflict with that which, I think, has been already shewn to be established, is sufficiently obvious. That it is in conflict with the reason of the thing, seems equally plain. <em>\u201c </em>If,\u201d says chancellor <em>Kent, \u201c </em>there be several purchasers in succession, at different times, I apprehend, that, in that case also, there is no equality, and no contribution as between those purchasers. Thus, for instance, if there be a judgement against a person owning three acres of land, and he sells one acre to A. the two remaining acres are first chargeable in equity, with the payment of the judgement debt, whether the land be in the hands of the debtor or of his heirs. If he sells another acre Lo B. the remaining acre is then chargeable, in the first instance, with the debt as against B. as well as against A. and if it should prove insufficient, then the acre sold to B. ought to supply the deficiency, in preference to the acre sold to A. because, when B. purchased, he took his land chargeable with the debt in the hands of the debtor, in preference to the land already sold to A. In this respect, we may say of him, as is said of the heir, <em>he sits in the seat of his grantor, </em>and must take the land with all its equitable burdens. It cannot be in the power of the debtor, by the act of assigning or selling his remaining land, to throw the burden of the judgement, or a rateable part of it, back upon A.\u201d Upon these principles, set forth in <em>Clowes </em>v. <em>Dickenson, </em>chancellor <em>Kent </em>proceeded in that case, and on the same principles, he had previously decided the case of <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Lyon. </em>I do not perceive how the reasoning, or the conclusion, of the judge can be successfully controverted. His decisions, indeed, are not binding authority upon this court; but wc are bound to follow the light of reason, from whatever luminary it may be poured upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"ATH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Sustained by this high opinion, I should have no difficulty pronouncing, that a <em>subsequent </em>alienee or incurnbrancer of one of several mortgaged subjects, can never call upon a <em>precedent </em>incumbrancer of another, for contribution, but for the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>in which the common law doctrines are cited, approved and enforced, in reference to incumbrancers, and that too in a court of equity. Without questioning the truth of the doctrine at law, I should have conceived the principles of chancellor <em>Kent </em>would have prevailed in equity. The distinction between the cases grows out of the difference of the tribunals, as happens in a thousand instances. It rests upon principles of equity unknown to the common law, and the creatures of courts of <em>chancery; </em>principles, which form a part of that artificial but beneficent system, which has so admirably contrived to soften the rigour of the common law, and to transfer the purest ethics through the whole of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">While, however, the case of <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Brooke </em>stands as the law of the court, we are not justified in taking a distinction from the difference of the tribunals of law and equity: that was a case in equity as well as this. But that was the case of a judgment; this, of a mortgage : and if I could see no distinction between them, I should not be disposed to extend to this case, as it is not identical, a principle with which my reason is not satisfied. There is, however, some distinction between the cases. The right of the purchasers, as we are told in the authorities cited, is not to compel each other to contribute, but to force the plaintiff in the judgement, by <em>audita querela </em>or <em>scire facias, </em>to issue his execution against all. If this is not done and one pays all, it would seem he is without remedy. 3 Co. 14. b. But, in the case of the mortgagee, there are no means of compelling him, <em>at law, </em>to turn all the parties out of the mortgaged premises. His title is at law absolute as to the whole. The incumbrancer who would enforce contribution, can only have it in equity: and if he asks it there, he must shew <em>that he has equityi </em>and this, I take it, the last incumbrancer cannot shew, as against the prior mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>It remains, as to this part of the case, only to say that the exception or reservation of the 75 acres, contained in the <em>deed of trust to Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens, </em>can have no influenco in withdrawing the case from the influence of general principles. The argument was, indeed, strong and imposing, and if there could have been no other motive for the exception than the protection of the 75 acres from the operation of this equitable principle, it would present a question of much difficulty. But there was another ample and more obvious motive for this exception : the protection of these 75 acres from <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens\u2019s </em>lien for 3212 dollars. <em>Brock\u2019s </em>lien was trivial; the debt due him was reduced to 400 dollars : it could prove no obstruction to a sale : whoever purchased could easily clear it off with part of the purchase money. Not so, if it bad been bound for the 3212 dollars. If offered for sale, it might well have been objected that that large debt would sweep the whole. If once bound, <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Cravens </em>might have been unwilling to release it, unless they got the whole proceeds of sale, which would have thwarted the views of <em>Sisson, </em>who wished the command of these funds. These, I conceive were the views of the parties. They are, at least, more likely to have been the operative motives, than a protection for a mere equitable right, of which, it is very probable, not one of the parties to the instrument had any knowledge or conception. We cannot consider the exception, therefore, as a waiver of that right, since it may be ascribed to a different and more obvious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Decree affirmed <em>in omnibus.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
