The declaration states, that the said note was executed to <em>Carter, </em>and endorsed by the latter, by his attorney <em>James Anderson, </em>to the plaintiff. The breach alledged, is in the non-payment of the note, either to the said <em>Carter </em>before the assignment, or to the plaintiff since the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-14\">The defendant pleaded: 1. <em>Nil debet. 2. </em>That the said <em>Carter </em>did not assign to the plaintiff the supposed note in writing, in the declaration mentioned, in manner and form as the plaintiff had alledged. 3. That the assignment and transfer of the said note, were made without any conside-. ration therefor, moving from the plaintiff to the said <em>Carter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>To the first plea, the plaintiff replied generally; and to the two others, he demurred specially. The causes assigned for demurring to the second plea, are, 1. Because the said plea offers to plead specially, matter which amounted to the general issue; 2. Because the plea is, in other respects, uncertain, informal, and insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">The causes of demurrer to the third plea, are the same as those to the second. The defendant joined issue on the demurrers; and the Court sustained the demurrers, and over-ruled the pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">A jury was impannelled to try the issue on the first plea, and rendered a verdict for the plaintiff; and the Court gave judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-6\">At the trial, the defendant filed two bills of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-7\">1. The first bill stated, that the plaintiff exhibited the note (which has been before described,) with the assignment of \u201c <em>John Carter </em>by his attorney <em>James Ander</em>sonthat the execution and assignment of the said note were admitted <em>by the </em>defendant, and the plaintiff <em>farther </em>exhibited a power of attorney from the said <em>E. Brooke </em>and <em>John Carter </em>to <em>James Anderson, </em>in which they constitute and appoint the said <em>Anderson, </em>their true and lawful attorney for them, and in their names <em>\u201c </em>to execute, from time to time, as it may become due, a note given by the said <em>Edmund Brooke, </em>to which the said <em>John Carter </em>is endorser, in the Merchants\u2019 Bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>and to do all things lawful and requisite for effecting the premises, hereby ratifying and confirming all that our said attorney shall do therein, by virtue thereof:\u201d that the plaintiff further proved by a witness, that the said note was discounted in the Merchants\u2019 Bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>for the accommodation of the defendant, and endorsed for that purpose, it being in fact a continuance, by renewals of a note discounted in July, 1815: that it was further proved, that the said Merchants\u2019 Bank, w7as an unchartered institution: that the defendant introduced the deposition of <em>Colin Auld, </em>stating that he was the acting trustee of the late Merchants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>for the collection of the debts due to it: that among the notes given up to the trustees as due t\u00b0 the said Bank, was one of the defendant, for the sum $ 5000: that when it became due, he wrote to the defendant, requesting payment of the note, but did not receive any answer: that in the month of January last, i?o<em>bert Young, </em>the plaintiff in this suit, made application for the said note, and paid for it (principal and interest,) in Merchants\u2019 Bank paper: that, on, a former occasion, the said <em>Young </em>made application for the note of a person, also a debtor to the said bank, and similarly situated to the note of the defendant; when he was informed, that the trustees had agreed to receive payment from any person, of any note belonging to the said Bank, in its paper, without, however, making themselves in any manner responsible, considering the person making the payment as the agent of the debtor; and the said note was accordingly taken up and paid for in Merchants\u2019 Bank paper by the said <em>Young: </em>that when the plaintiff applied for the note of the defendant, no such conversation took place; but from the anxiety shewn by the plaintiff to obtain possession of the note, the deponent drew the inference that he expected to obtain some advantage from it: that from the account of the said <em>Edmund Brooke, </em>with the said Merchants\u2019 Bank, it appears, he has credit on the 4tb. of May, 1816, for $300; on the 15th of June, for $99 25; and on the 23d of .July, for $ 14; the balance due by him at that date, exclusive of the said note, being $ 137 63; and that no other payments were made by him, except a payment of $ 120, which, the deponent thought, was endorsed on the said note for $ 5400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-4\">[The deposition contains much other matter, not important to the present report.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-5\">The bill of exceptions also contained a deed of trust, between <em>Peter Saunders, </em>president, and other persons, directors of the Merchants\u2019 Bank, (of whom, <em>Edmund </em>Brooke, the defendant, was one,) and <em>Colin Auld, Thomas Swann* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>and <em>Edmund J. Lee, </em>by which the president and directors transferred to the said <em>Auld, </em>&amp;e. all the property, real and personal, of the bank, and all out-standing debts, &amp;c. in trust, that they should be authorised to secure, compound, settle, collect and receive, the monies due to the said bank, in paper of the bank, which the debtors to the institution should bo allowed to pay in discharge, of their debts, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\">The bill of exceptions goes on to state, \u201cand this was all the evidence in the cause. Whereupon, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the jury, that if they believed, this testimony, this action could not bo supported, and they should find for the defendant. But, the Court refused to give this instruction,\u201d and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">The second bill of exceptions states, that the defendant, having exhibited the deed above mentioned, offered to the jury certain bank notes of the Merchants\u2019 Bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>to the amount of the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as a set-off. Whereupon, the counsel for the plaintiff moved the Court to instruct the jury, that these notes were not a legal set-off, unless the defendant should satisfy the jury, that he had acquired them before he received notice of the assignment to the plaintiff, of the note on which this suit was brought; which instruction, the Court accordingly gave, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\"><em>Brooke </em>obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-7\"><em>8lanard, </em>for the appellant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">1. That the plaintiff had acquired possession of the note, not by <em>purchase, </em>but by actual <em>payment; </em>and the note was no longer competent to support a suit. Besides, the note was <em>past due, </em>when it was assigned; which subjects the assignee to all the equitable discounts and set-offs, that the maker may have had against the intermediate endorsers. <em>Chilly on Bills, 100; Blake, </em>v. <em>Sewell, 3 </em>Mass.

The Bank was unchartered, and <em>Brooke </em>was one of the company. The note was transferred to the company, of whom <em>Brooke </em>was one. It was, therefore, a transfer by the debtor to himself; which extinguished the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">5. The maker of the note had the privilege of discharging it, by setting off the notes of the Bank.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-8\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellee, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">\u2022 That the refusal to instruct on the first bill of exceptions, was right. The questions related to the <em>sufficiency </em>of the evidence, and therefore, improper for the Court to decide. <em>Keel et al. </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>1 Wash. 203. <em>Wroe </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>1 Wash. 357. <em>Morton &amp; Jones </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>2 Call, 514. The appellant cannot object to the <em>action, </em>by motion to instruct. He should have demurred to the evidence. But, the action was well brought. A note with a blank endorsement may be sold in the market, and the blank filled up afterwards. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>147. The conveyance does not give a limited power to the trustees. They have a general power <em>to compound debts, Sec. </em>This was not a case of <em>payment, </em>but a <em>purchase </em>of the note. Even if it were a case of payment, the cases from <em>Chitty </em>prove, that a payment <em>supra </em>protest gives a right to sue the person, for whose benefit the payment was made. The case of the <em>Northampton Bank </em>v. <em>Pepoon, </em>11 Mass. Rep. 238, proves, that a note <em>past due, </em>may be transferred. As to the objection, that <em>Brooke </em>was a member of the company, it does not appear that he was. But if he was, the objection is not valid. A stockholder who becomes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>debtor, may be sued by the Bank. As to the last bill of exceptions, it is to be inferred, that there was notice of the assignment, before the paper of the bank was offered as a sot-off. Bringing the suit was sufficient notice; and the defendant ought to have shewn, that he acquired the paper before the suit was brought.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b123-3\"><em>December </em>14.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AXr\">Judge Cakk,</author>\n<p id=\"AC4\">delivered the opinion of the Court. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">This is an action of debt, brought by the plaintiff as assignee, on a promissory note. Upon the plea of <em>nil debet, </em>the plaintiff had a verdict for the amount of the note, &amp;c. On the trial, the defendant filed two bills of exception to opinions of the Court; and on these, the cause comes up.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The first contains a statement of the evidence, consisting of the note and endorsement, (the execution of each admitted;) the power of attorney to <em>Jlnderson; </em>proof, that the Merchants\u2019 Bank was an unchartered institution, and that the note was discounted there, for the accommodation of the defendant, and endorsed for that purpose; the deposition of <em>Colin \u00bfluid, </em>and the deed of assignment from the directors to certain trustees. The exception then concludes thus; \u201cand this was all the evidence in the cause. Whereupon, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the jury, that if they believed, this testimony, the action could not be supported, and they should find for the defendant.\u201d The Court refused to give this instruction; and we are to enquire, whether correctly or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">With respect to the abstract legal principles which govern this question, there can bo little difference of opinion. To the Court, belongs the law; to the jury, the facts. This is a fundamental maxim. Frequently, the cases submitted to the jury being complicated of law and fact, theii verdict involves a decision on both. Yet this is not of ne - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>cessity. The jury may find a special verdict, or reserve some question of l\u00e1w for the decision of the Court. If not, the parties may, by a demurrer to the evidence, bring the whole law of the case before the Court; or, may move to exclude inadmissible evidence; or, for instructions to the jury as to any point of law, arising out of the facts in the case. But here, the Court, while exercising its unquestioned privilege of declaring the law, must be very careful not to overstep the line which separates law from fact. Any assumption of a fact, as proved; any opinion as <em>to the weight, effect </em>or <em>sufficiency </em>of the evidence submitted to the jury; will be an invasion of their province. Any application tending to elicit such opinion, should be overruled. So, if the counsel in the question submitted to the Court, involve <em>fact </em>with <em>law, </em>and demand the opinion of the Court on both; the motion may, without error, be over-ruled. For, though the Court <em>might, with </em>propriety, separate the law from the fact, stating the legal principles and leaving the fact to the jury; there is no obligation on them to make the discrimination, and consequently, no error in refusing to answer the question propounded. I refer to the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Carrington, 4 </em>Cranch, <em>71, </em>in support of this last proposition. To ascertain the correctness of those which precede <em>it, </em>a brief review of some of the cases decided by this Court, may not be improper. 1. Of those which make it the duty of the Court to instruct as to the law arising out of the facts. In <em>Pickett </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Wash. 255, the counsel moved the Court to instruct the jury on the law arising from the facts; or by other means, to reserve the facts for their future decision. They refused or neglected to do either; which this Court determined to be error. In <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>3 Call, 201, the Court instructed the jury, that the deed of bargain and -sale was sufficient <em>in law, </em>to satisfy the averments in the declaration. This Court approved of the instruction, saying c&lt;it was not like the case of <em>Keel &amp; Herbert </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>where there was an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>press declaration to the jury, upon the whole evidence; for, in the present ease, it was a construction o\u00ed papers, and the opinion confined to a single point, without any attempt to prescribe the verdict, which the jury were to find.\u201d In <em>Boolright </em>v. <em>Meggs, </em>4 Munf. 145, the Court instructed the jury as to the law, arising upon a hypothetical statement <em>of </em>facts, in one instance; and in another, as to the law arising on an admitted fact; and this Court approved of those instructions. In <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>4 Munf. 462, an action for a .malicious prosecution, the Court, instructed the jury, that the warrant for arresting the plaintiff, the endorsement thereon of a magistrate committing him for trial, and a recognizance of the same date, for his appearance, furnished sufficient evidence of probable cause to induce the prosecution; and this instruction was approved by this Court, upon the ground that it was confined to the papers, and did not exclude any evidence which the plaintiff might offer, to disprove the probable cause, inferrible from the proceedings before the magistrate; an inference, founded, on the legal presumption, that magistrates and Courts are without malice towards the accused, which presumption was considered by the Court, equivalent to a rule of law. In <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Washington, 6 </em>Munf. 592, the defendant moved the Court to instruct the jury, that 20 years having intervened between the period when the note became due, and the institution of the suit, they ought to presume it paid, unless evidence was offered of some acknowledgment or some payment of principal or interest, within that time; the Court below refused the instruction, and this Court reversed the judgment for that error. These eases sufficiently shew, that within these proper limits, it is the right of the parties to demand, and the imperative duty of the Court to give instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Equally numerous and strong are the cases, to evince the jealous care, with which this Court watches over and protects, the legitimate powers of the jury., In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Gill, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>1 Wash. 87, it is said, \u201cIf the Court admit improper evi. dence, an exception may be taken; but if the question depend on the <em>weight </em>of testimony, the jury, and not the Court, are exclusively and uncontroulably the judges.\u201d In <em>Thweat &amp; Hinton </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>1 Wash. 217, the same language is held. In <em>Keel &amp; Roberts </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>1 Wash. 203, the Court below instructed the jury, that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was good and sufficient in law, to maintain the issue on his part. This Court say, \u201cThe District Court most certainly did wrong, in directing the jury that the evidence was <em>sufficient </em>to maintain the issue. This was a question which belonged exclusively to the jury, and ought to have been left with them, without any such declaration or direction, unless the Court, (by a demurrer to the evidence having been filed,) had been compelled to decide upon it.\u201d The same doctrines are held in <em>Wroe </em>v. <em>Washington, 1 </em>Wash. 257; <em>Martin, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Stover, </em>2 Call, 514; <em>Fisher\u2019s ex\u2019r. </em>v. Duncan, 1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 563; <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>4 Munf. 59; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>4 Munf. 373; <em>Whitacre </em>v. <em>M\u2019Ilhany, </em>4 Munf. 310; <em>Bogle, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Sullivant, </em>1 Call, 561. Having thus ascertained the correctness of the principles first stated, let us examine their bearing uppn the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The mass of evidence, submitted to the Court by the bill of exceptions, was voluminous; consisting both of written and parol evidence, and involving several distinct questions. As 1. Was the transaction between <em>Young \u00a7 Auld, </em>a transfer and assignment of the note, or a payment ? 2. Were the persons executing the deed of trust, directors; and had. they power to convey ? 3. If they had power, does the deed authorise the trustees to transfer the notes of debtors, so as to, vest the legal title in the assignee ? 4. If the <em>trustees </em>were authorised to transfer, had <em>Colin Auld </em>(a single trustee,) such authority? 5. Was the defendant <em>Brooke </em>a stockholder or partner in the banking association, during the time that the Bank was in possession of his note ? This analysis of the evidence will shew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>at once, the impropriety of the course pursued. The first, second, fourth and fifth, of these questions, arc merely questions of fact, depending on the weight and effect of the evidence, and belonging wholly to the jury. The third, is a question proper for the Court, depending on the legal effect of the deed. But, they were all blended and confounded with each other, in the instruction asked of the Court; and therefore, the motion was properly overruled. There is the soundest reason for requiring, that a party who asks the instruction of the Court, should specify the point of law on which he wishes it. It brings distinctly before the Court and the opposite party, the very objection insisted on; and there can be no mistake, omission or surprise. But, if it were permitted to a party, to ask instructions generally as to the law arising out of a great mass of evidence, and it wore the duty of the Court thereupon, to ascertain all the points of law which might arise; to separate them from the facts and decide them; it would have a strong tendency to entrap both the Court and the opposite party. In the hurry and confusion of a jury trial, the Court might well overlook one or more of the points of law, arising out of the facts; an oversight, which might involve a reversal of its judgment. The other party too, if the precise objection were pointed out, might have it in his power immediately to obviate it by further evidence; but, not seeing at once the points which lie buried in the mass of testimony, the opportunity of advancing these additional proofs is lost to him. Upon this reasoning, I presume it is, that Courts will not take upon them the office of separating the law from the facts; but require of the party who asks their instruction, to put to them a precise question of law, as arising out of the facts. Nor can this be considered a hardship on him. If he wishes to bring the whole evidence before the Court, for their opinion, he may either procured special verdict or demur to the evidence. But, a bill of exceptions can a.ever be converted into a demurrer to evidence. <em>Wroc </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>v. Washington, 1 Wash. 361; and other cases in this Court. I conclude, that the Court committed no error in refusing the instructions asked in the first bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"AGW\">We come now to the second bill of exceptions. It is in these words: \u201cOn the trial of this cause, the defendant, having exhibited the deed between P. <em>Saunders </em>and others, and <em>Colin Auld </em>and others, referred to in the former bill of exceptions, \u201cthis indenture,\u201d &amp;c. offered to the jury certain bank notes of the Merchants\u2019 Bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>to the amount of the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as a set-off in the present action. Whereupon, the counsel for the plaintiff moved the Court to instruct the jury, that these notes were not a legal set-off, unless the defendant should satisfy the jury, that he had acquired them before he received notice of the assignment to the plaintiff, of the note on which this suit was brought; which instruction the Court accordingly gave, and thereto the defendant excepted,\u201d &amp;c. Upon this bill, the first question which presents itself, is, whether the statement of facts is not too imperfect, to enable this Court to form an opinion. From the defendant\u2019s setting out, in the exception, the deed executed by the directors to the trustees, it is clear, that he claimed the right of off-setting the notes of the bank, under the terms of that deed; and, we should have no difficulty in deciding that he had a right to the set-off, if it appeared that the plaintiff claimed to hold the note on which he sued, under the bank, and through the same deed. This would sufficiently appear, if we might resort to the evidence contained in the first bill of exceptions; and this, it seemed to me, we might do, in this particular case, as the bill stated it to be all the evidence in the cause. But, the other Judges have thought it safest to confine our view to the exception immediately before us; because, we ought to act by general rules; because, although the evidence stated in the first bill might be <em>all, </em>when it was sealed, there might be other important facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>brought forward afterwards; and because, by thus supplying the defects of one exception from another, we may shut out evidence material for the other party, not noticed in either bill. In this opinion of my brethren, I cheerfully acquiesce. Confining ourselves to the second bill, it does not appear whether the plaintiff claimed under the deed or not. Yet tlxis decisive fact must have appeared one way or the other, on the trial, and is necessary to enable us to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The exception, therefore, is too imperfect; and, following the authority of <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Tazewell, </em>1 Call, 215; <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>Tabb\u2019s adm\u2019r. 2 </em>Munf. 254; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>4 Munf. 373, and other cases, the judgment of the Court below must, on that ground, be reversed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\"> Judges Brooke and Coaster, absent;</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
