That by deed executed in May 1808, <em>Vaughan </em>conveyed the buildings so revalued and reassured, to the defendant <em>Stone. </em>That, according to the rules and regulations of the society, there was, upon the revaluation and reassurance of these buildings, duly assessed, and due to the society, for <em>additional premiums, </em>76 dollars 76 cents, bearing interest from the 1st December 1806, and the further sum of 437 dollars 88 cents, the aggregate of the <em>annual quotas </em>of 36 dollars 49 cents, due on the said buildings so reassured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>commencing in 1809 and ending in 1820, with interest on each <em>quota </em>from 1st April in each year, the date when it fell due. That <em>Vaughan </em>died in 1811, and the defendant <em>James Vaughan </em>was his executor. And that application jjacj been made by the agents of the society, to both defendants, for payment, which they both had refused. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the premises insured should be declared subject, in <em>Stone\u2019s </em>hands, to the debt due the society for <em>premium </em>and <em>quotas, </em>and sold for satisfaction thereof; and that, if necessary, the defendant <em>James Vaughan </em>should be required to render an account of his administration of his testator\u2019s estate, and the assets in his hands, if any he had, should be applied to the payment of the debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">The executor of <em>Vaughan </em>answered, that his testator gave notice of withdrawal from the society in October 1806, and therefore, was exempt from the duty of paying any <em>quotas </em>subsequently called for; and that he had fully administered the assets of his testator\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKz\">The defendant <em>Stone, </em>in his answer, said he purchased the premises in 1808, without notice that the vendor had ever insured the buildings, or made any declaration for insurance in the <em>Mutual Assurance Society; </em>and he himself had effected an insurance with the <em>Eagle Fire Company </em>of <em>JYew York, </em>and continued his assurance there till 1818, when, for the first time, he was apprised of the demand now set up by the society; and as it was a rule of that company, as of this society, that insurance effected with any other company avoids the policy effected with it, the consequence to him was, that he had been insured in neither. That his vendor <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>estate was certainly liable for the debt, in the first instance; yet the society had so long neglected to assert its claim, that the assets of <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>estate, which he believed would have been sufficient to have paid the debt, and applicable thereto, if it had been timely claimed, had been probably fully administered, without notice of the claim; and this laches of the society alone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>ought, under the circumstances, to exonerate his property \u00b0 . . . 1 1 <em>J </em>from the lien asserted, if indeed any such lien ever existed. But he denied, that the society ever had the lien it claimed. And if it had such lien on the property in the hands of his vendor Vaughan, he insisted that it was only an equitable lien, and pleaded that he was a purchaser without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-10\">There was no proof, that <em>Vaughan </em>withdrew, or took any measures to withdraw, from the society, in October 1806.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMI\">It appeared, that <em>Vaughan, </em>first, by deed dated the 14th March 1806, conveyed the insured premises to <em>James Wallace, </em>in trust, to secure a debt of 600 dollars due to <em>Thomas Newton </em>as guardian of <em>George Kelly, </em>and to indemnify <em>James Taylor, </em>who was indorser at bank for <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>accommodation to the amount of 2500 dollars, against loss in consequence <em>thereof; </em>and in this deed, <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Newton </em>covenanted, that upon tender of the money, at any time before a sale of the trust subject, they would receive the same, \u201c and upon receipt thereof, that they would grant good and sufficient discharges for the same, thereby releasing and waiving all power to demand of the trustee the execution of the trust therein before declared.\u201d That <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>deed to the defendant <em>Stone, </em>dated the 23d May 1808, recited the deed of trust of the 14th March 1806, and that <em>Stone </em>had undertaken to pay the debts thereby secured to <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Newton </em>the guardian of <em>Kelly; </em>and in <em>consideration thereof, </em>convoyed the property to <em>Stone, </em>with general warranty. That, in January 1816, <em>Taylor, </em>by <em>deed, </em>acknowledged the receipt in full, from <em>Stone </em>of the money which he had paid as <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>indorser, and released all claim under the deed of trust; and <em>Kelly </em>also, by deed, in consideration of satisfactory arrangements made with him by <em>Stone, </em>for the payment of the debt due to him, released all <em>his </em>claim under the deed of trust. But that <em>Wallace, </em>the trustee to whom the legal estate was conveyed by the deed of trust, had never conveyed or released to <em>Stone. </em>This was the state of <em>Stone\u2019s </em>title at the hearing of the cause in the court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Als\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The chancellor was of opinion, that, according to the 6th and 7th sections of the 8th article of the constitution, rules and regulations of the society, formed and adopted in January 1805 (above quoted verbatim) no policy could issue on a declaration of revaluation, unless the <em>additional premium </em>was paid, and the society was not responsible for any loss, unless a revaluation was made and the <em>additional premium </em>paid, so that no insurance was effected, and therefore no <em>quotas </em>could arise in such case ; and that no pledge of property was ever, at any time, made by the assured to secure the payment of <em>premiums </em>or <em>additional premiums </em>.\u2022 therefore, he dismissed the bill with costs. The society appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-4\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Daniel </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee <em>Stone.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">I. One question was, Whether <em>Stone\u2019s </em>purchase was so completed, as to sustain his plea of purchaser without notice ? Upon which <em>Daniel </em>remarked, that <em>Stone </em>had even now only an <em>equitable </em>title, the <em>legal </em>title being yet outstanding in <em>Wallace, </em>the trustee, to whom it was conveyed by the deed of trust of March 1806\u2014he cited <em>Tourville </em>v. <em>Naish, </em>3 P. Wms. 307. <em>Wigg </em>v. <em>Wigg, </em>1 Atk. 382, 4. <em>Hoover v. Donally, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 316. <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Owles, </em>1 Munf. 38. <em>Leigh, </em>adverting to the peculiar covenant of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Newton, </em>the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>in the deed of trust of March 1806, and to the deeds of release executed by <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Kelly </em>to <em>Stone </em>in January 1816, said, that these were tantamount, in effect, to a defeasance of the deed of trust; and, if they did not amount quite to a defeasance, they certainly gave <em>Stone </em>a right to call for the legal title, in preference to all the world, which was equivalent with actually getting it in. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Gordon\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>5 Munf. 257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">II. Then there arose several points peculiar to the case of policies or declarations for assurance in this society. 1. Whether there was any lien provided by the 6th section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the act of December 1794, on the property insured or dei i <em>* </em>dared for assurance, <em>for original or additional premiums, </em>or whether the lien was provided to secure the <em>quotas </em>to be afterwards called for, only? 2. Whether the act of January 1805, making so vital a change as it did, in the stitution of the society, and by separating the town from the country assurance, altering the obligation, duties and rights of assurers and assured, was not an abolition of the lien for <em>quotas </em>given by the original act of incorporation ? If not, 3. Whether the 6th section of the act of February 1809, providing that no <em>quota </em>or <em>quotas </em>should afterwards be assessed, but authorizing the society to exact from the members, annually, for ten <em>years,portions of the premium, </em>these <em>requisitions </em>were <em>quotas </em>to which the 6th section of the original act of December 1794 applied, and gave a lien for, on the buildings insured ? 4. Whether, in case the <em>additional premiums </em>or <em>quotas </em>were not paid, on any property declared for insurance, before the act of February 1809, the declarant was to be regarded as insured, by force of the 6th section of that act, or of the 13th section of the 13th article of the revised constitution, rules and regulations, of May 1819 ? If such declarant was not insured, 5. Whether, nevertheless, the effect of the 6th section of the original act of December 1794, was to give a lien on the property <em>declared </em>for insurance, for <em>premiums </em>or <em>quotas </em>? 6. Whether, if the lien was given, to any extent, on the subject in the hands of the declarant for insurance, such lien did or could follow it into the hands of his assignee, without notice, and though he be not insured? Lastly, Whether the society had not lost its claim against <em>Stone, </em>if any it ever had, by its <em>laches </em>in not earlier giving notice of or asserting it? In the discussion of these questions, the counsel went into a minute examination of the provisions of the several acts of assembly above quoted, and the general principles of law which, they supposed, might influence the construction and effect of them : the general course of the argument will be collected from the opinions of the judges. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The following authorities were cited: <em>Currie\u2019s adm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Mut. Ass. Society, </em>4 Hen. &amp;. Munf. 315. <em>Greenhow &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>4 Munf. 590. <em>Korn &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Mut. Ass. Society, </em>6 Cranch, 192. <em>Mut. Ass.

But, though it was admitted as a point too plain to be argued, that this lien bound the property in the hands of the first owner, it was strongly denied, that such lien existed when the land had passed into other hands, and the broad position seemed to be taken, that the legislature could not raise a lien which should thus follow the subject into all hands. That the act <em>meant </em>to create such a lien, is clear from the use of the word <em>assigns, </em>which could have been introduced for no other purpose; nor can I doubt the power of the legislature to do this, since the law violated no right, but merely settled the terms of the contract, between the society and the insured, and left every one at liberty to become a member or not. Every man has a right to bind his property by a lien, a mortgage, for instance, which when perfected according to law, follows it into all hands. This was nothing more. The party insuring, for himself, his heirs and assigns, engaged his property as a security for all moneys due or to become due on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">But it was insisted, that the 8th section of the same act made the insured property liable in the hands of vendees, only where they received a notice of the insurance from the vendor. . That section enacts, that to the end, that purchasers, and mortgagees of property insured by virtue of this act, may not become losers thereby, the subscribers selling, mortgaging or otherwise transferring such property, shall at the time apprise the purchaser or mortgagee of such assurance, and indorse to him the policy thereof; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>every case of <em>such </em>change, the purchaser or mortgagee shall he considered as a subscriber in place of the original <em>he. </em>It was contended, that such <em>change </em>meant <em>a sale or mortgage accompanied by notice and assignment of the policy. </em>I cannot think, that the language used renders this construetion necessary; and it is most clear to me, that, so far from being the intention of the law, it would mar and prostrate the whole scheme on which the institution was founded. The law was speaking of changes of property by sale, mortgage or other transfer; and the following phrase \u201c in every case of <em>such </em>change,\u201d means of a change by sale, mortgage or other transfer. If the act, meant to hold the property hound, only where the sale was attended by notice, why did it say, that notice should be <em>given to save purchasers or mortgagees from loss ? </em>They could incur <em>no loss, </em>where there was no notice, if the sale to them without notice discharged the lien. There are many other considerations, which I need not state, that convince me, that such a construction would go far to destroy, at a blow, the whole institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">But it was insisted, that the act of 1805 was a new constitution, abolishing all pre-existing laws, liens <em>he. </em>I think clearly not. It was an amendment, and only abolished former laws, rules and regulations, so far as they were repugnant to that act. Such are its words. The former act creating a lien on the property insured, was so far from being repugnant, that it was the very foundation on which this amendment rested. This is apparent; for take away that act, and there is no lien on the property insured, even in the hands of the original subscribers. It was also insisted, that the company has been guilty of <em>laches. </em>I do not think that doctrine attaches, farther than it would to a mortgagee. The lien of the society is by an instrument under seal, which the law says binds the property, as a <em>security </em>for all charges growing due under the laws, rules &amp;c. of the society; and this is the exact definition of a mortgage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>There has been no such <em>laches </em>here as would affect the claim of a mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">There were several other objections made, but none of any weight. I think the decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Cabell, J. concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b254-11\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AO8\">The merits of this controversy mainly depend, upon the true construction of the laws, constitution, rules and regulations of <em>The Mutual Assurance Society.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">The scheme of this society, however simple in its principles, has, unfortunately, not been carried into effect, with an ability proportioned to the benevolence of the design. We have the authority of the act of 1794 for saying, that <em>the plan, </em>upon which the simple idea of an association of individuals for their mutual insurance against fire, was to be carried into effect, was formed, suggested and published, by <em>Mr. Ast; </em>and though he may have had the aid of some professional gentleman to throw it into the form of a law, its clumsy and inartificial execution can leave little doubt of its real parentage. Drawn without system, and expressed, in many instances, in terms wholly inappropriate, it is not wonderful, that it has been a fruitful source of litigation; and so deeply imbued was the first act with these defects, that all the subsequent legislation seems to have been marked by the original vice of its constitution. Such an instrument therefore requires to be construed with a liberality which will attain the real objects of the contracting parties, instead of a critical rigour which would defeat their most obvious intentions; and this, indeed, is the more proper, as the parties stand in the double relation of insurers and insured, and their contract cannot properly be interpreted, more strongly against them in one character than in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Awkward as is the draft of the original constitution, it is not difficult to penetrate its real design. Contemplating an association, which might embrace every owner of a building in the commonwealth, and which should engage to insure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>all its members against losses from fire, it was intended, that ^ each member of the association should contribute, to the common fund cut of which losses were to be repaired, a certain <em>per </em>centage, called a <em>premium, </em>upon the value of the property he should himself seek to have insured. And as the original sum thus subscribed or contributed, would in the ordinary course of things be exhausted, unless provision was made for replenishing the fund, it was provided, in substance, that whenever the reduced state of the funds should require a further contribution, there should be a call upon the members for such contribution, and each should be bound to pay an equal <em>per centage </em>upon his original <em>premium. </em>These subsequent contributions were called <em>quotas; </em>and thus, if the wants of the society required that it should call \u2022for a sum equal to <em>half </em>the original capital, each member was called upon to pay a sum equal to one half his <em>original premium, </em>which was called a <em>half quota; et sic de similibus. </em>Having ascertained the sums to be paid by each, as contributors to the common stock in which they were interested as <em>insurers, </em>or (which is the same thing) the sum to be paid by each as insured, it next became necessary to provide for the enforcing of these contributions from the refractory or the backward. To effect this object, the <em>projet </em>(whether wise or unwise) was to render the property, thus insured from destruction, and supported and upheld by the society, responsible for the payment; doubtless, upon the idea of some supposed relation between the advantage it derived, and the duty to be imposed. So it is, it was declared in the original act of 1794, that the subscribers <em>mutually </em>for themselves, their heirs <em>and assigns, </em>engaged the property-insured (but none other) as <em>security, </em>and subjected the same, if necessary, to be sold for the payment of such <em>quotas; </em>that is to say, <em>for such future contributions as might be necessary from time to time to maintain the integrity of the fund.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">A question has been much discussed heretofore, whether the property insured was or was not bound for the <em>original </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>premium, </em>if the subscriber failed to pay it j and, in <em>Greenhow </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>judges <em>Fleming </em>and <em>Roane, </em>though differing in the judgement they gave, seem to have agreed in the opinion, that until the payment of the <em>premium </em>the insurance was incomplete, and the property was not bound in the hands of the purchaser. It seems, however, to be a question of no importance in relation to the original insurance in this case, as the <em>original premium was </em>paid, and the assurance was of course complete; but we shall have occasion to examine it, as it respects the new declaration. Nor can it admit of doubt, that <em>Vaughan </em>himself was personally responsible for <em>quotas </em>anteriour to the act of 1805, and that the property was in like manner responsible while it continued in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">By that act, considerable changes were effected in the constitution of the society: some of them so vital, as to have been arraigned as unconstitutional and void. The separation of the <em>town </em>from the <em>country </em>insurance, in other words, the absolving a large portion of the society from the burdens of the contract, and thus depriving the rest of that aid in sustaining them, for which they had in effect contracted, was deemed by many, high-handed, unjust and unconstitutional. The small towns, particularly, complained of being left to encounter the hazard of the sweeping losses of the cities, without the aid of the country contributions. But this question was put at rest by this court, in <em>Currie\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>The Mut. Ass. Society. </em>One very salutary and acceptable provision, however, was introduced j I mean the clause which permitted any dissatisfied party to dissolve the contract as to himself, by withdrawing from the society. After the enactment of this provision, no party who did not avail himself of it, could fairly be understood to wish to give up its benefits, or get rid of the burdens it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">This act has been called a <em>new </em>constitution, out and out; but I think it must be regarded rather as an innovation in-grafted on the original stock. It did not repeal the old constitution and laws <em>in toto, hut only in such matters as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>were repugnant to the act itself. </em>What was its effect upon some of the most material provisions of the first act will be presently examined. At the time it passed, <em>Vaughan </em>was living, and still owner of the property, and the act having authorized, and indeed required, a revaluation, he acquiesced in the measure. A revaluation was made, and he signed a new declaration, binding himself to abide by the constitution &amp;c. of the society. A further <em>premium </em>was however required of him, as the revaluation proved the property to be worth more than before, which <em>premium, </em>it seems, never was paid by him, and constitutes in fact a part of the society\u2019s demand. It was the opinion of the chancellor, that no pledge of the property was at any time to be made to secure the payment of the <em>original premiums, </em>or of the <em>additional premiums ; </em>and it appearing <em>ihoi part </em>of the demand was for <em>additional premiums, </em>the bill was yet dismissed <em>in omnibus. </em>This would seem to have been an error, even if the premises were true ; for, though the property was not bound, it does not follow, that <em>Vaughan\u2019s estate, </em>if there was any (which ought to have been ascertained), was not responsible for the <em>additional premium </em>which accrued in his time. For judge <em>Roane </em>and judge <em>Fleming </em>concurred in the case of <em>Greenhow </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>in thinking the subscriber <em>personally </em>bound for the unpaid <em>premium, </em>though the former thought the <em>property </em>was not so liable in the hands of a purchaser, and the latter supposed it not so liable even in the hands of the insurer. Moreover, unless the failure to pay the <em>additional premium, </em>not only left the <em>new </em>contract incomplete, but also abrogated the old one, which cannot be pretended, it is not easy to conceive why the bill should have been dismissed as to the <em>whole </em>demand, merely because a part of the demand could not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Let us, however, pursue this subject of the non-payment of the <em>premiums </em>somewhat farther. The <em>personal </em>liability of the declarant, for the <em>premium, </em>has been already shewn to have been established by the concurrent opinions of judges <em>Roane </em>and <em>Fleming, </em>which opinion is sustained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>10th section of the act of 1794. The'liability of the jpro- <em>\u2022 !Periy </em>\u00b0f the declarant, for <em>the premium^ </em>seems equally to be provided for by the same section; which declares, that, in default of payment of the <em>premiums, </em>the subscribers may be to pay them, and their property shall be liable to be sold for the payment <em>of the same. </em>The meaning of this section, is further explained by the act of December 1795, which may be considered, indeed, as part of the <em>res gesta. </em>From this act also it is clear, that the property was to be held liable for the <em>original premiums, </em>as <em>a general principle; </em>but, it was declared to apply only to <em>subsequent </em>insurances, obviously with a view to favor those who had contributed to carry the scheme into execution by becoming subscribers, but who seem, from the preamble of the act, to have been inclined to withdraw before they were irrevocably bound, unless such a provision was enacted-. With these views, I intirely concur with judge <em>Roane, </em>that the property was bound for the <em>premiums, </em>while it remained in the hands of the declarant; nor can I perceive how judge <em>Fleming, </em>who expresses a different opinion, could avoid the force of the enactment in the 10th section. The fact, that by the law the society was not bound, while the <em>premiwth </em>was <em>unpaid, </em>cannot sustain this opinion; for it was not bound while a <em>quota </em>was unpaid, and yet it is agreed on <em>all hands, that </em>the property <em>was subject </em>to <em>quotas. </em>The truth is, the legislature obviously discarded (in relation to this institution) the ordinary principle of contracts, that both parties shall be bound, or neither; for it expressly provided, that the responsibility of the society for losses, should be suspended the instant a <em>quota </em>was in arrear, and yet left the insurer liable to the recovery of the <em>quota </em>with interest thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Having thus shewn, that the contract of insurance, however incomplete as to the responsibility of the society, was nevertheless complete as to the liability of the declarant, and of the property insured, while it continued <em>his, </em>it may next be asked, how the property can be considered as absolved in the hands of an assignee, who purchases <em>with no</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tice. If the property be bound m the declarant\u2019s hands, .... , ,. , ... , re , ' can he by Ins act remove that liability r It the contract was complete <em>before </em>the sale of the premises, so far as to render both person and property liable, is it rendered incomp\u00edete <em>by </em>the sale? I cannot think so; and cannot concur in the opinion expressed by judge <em>Roane </em>that \u201c the 8th section of the act of 1794, relating to the liability of purchasers and mortgagees, <em>is confined to cases </em>of property, the <em>insurance </em>of which has been <em>perfected </em>by the payment of the <em>premiums.\u201d </em>For, according to this opinion, if one declares for insurance, and then sells to another before he pays the <em>premium, </em>though the vendee have full notice of the assurance, the property, which in the hands of the <em>vendor </em>was <em>bound, </em>is in the <em>vendee\u2019s </em>hands <em>absolved, </em>because, as it is said, the insurance was not perfected, when the assignment was made. This does not seem reasonable; and I am, therefore, clearly of opinion, that the property continues bound, for payment of <em>premiums, </em>as well as <em>quotas, </em>in the hands of an assignee <em>with </em>notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">How is it as to an assignee <em>without </em>notice ? This question becomes important to be decided in the present case, because the defendant has not only pleaded, but has shewn, I think, that he is a purchaser without notice. As this matter was much discussed at the bar, it is my duty to shew the reasons of this opinion. The rule is unquestionable, that he who would protect himself as a purchaser without notice, must shew himself to be a <em>complete </em>purchaser. If, therefore, either his purchase money remains unpaid, or he has not completed his title by obtaining a conveyance before he receives notice, the notice will affect him; for, if he receive that notice before <em>both </em>of those acts are perfected, he ought to stop until the equity is inquired into, or he will be bound by it. Sugd. Law Vend. 530. Thus, although he has paid every cent of his purchase money, and the hopeless insolvency of his vendor would prevent his ever recovering it back, yet if ho has not completed his title by having a conveyance prior to his notice of the prior equity, he must stop, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>arid will not be permitted to go on to secure himself by obtaining the legal title, from the common vendor. And this is in strict consonance with justice, and in strict analogy with equitable principles. It rests upon the maxim which prevaj]s jn equity, as well as at law, <em>Qui prior est in tempore, potior est in jure, </em>where two equities are equal, the prior equity shall prevail. If then A. has made the first purchase of an estate, he has prior equity to B. who purchases afterwards; and, in a mere contest of equities, A. must prevail; for if the vendor refused to make title to either, and a suit were brought in equity for a title, the court would obviously decree a conveyance to A. Such then being the case, as soon as B. receives notice of the prior equity of A. he becomes at once apprised of the fact, that he has the best right to the land, and that a court would so decree. It is then, obviously, a fraud in B. to proceed to get a title to that property which he knows to belong to another, though the formality of a conveyance has not been complied with. But\"if he has paid his money <em>and </em>obtained his conveyance before notice, his conduct has been fair, and having equal though posterior equity, he will be protected, because he has the legal title also, fairly acquired. He must, however, have obtained the <em>legal </em>title, or must shew, that, though posterior in time, <em>he has the lest right to call for the legal title. </em>In this case, <em>Stone </em>most certainly <em>has </em>not the legal title : that legal title is in the trustee <em>Wallace: </em>the releases of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>never can pass it. But, though he has not the legal title, <em>he has the lest right to call for it. </em>He stands, in relation to the purchase, in the shoes of the creditors whom he has paid. He bought from <em>Vaughan </em>with the knowledge of the creditors\u2019 claims, and upon engagement to pay them; and his case comes clearly, I think, within the principle of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Gordon\u2019s ex\u2019or; </em>and he has proved, very clearly, that he had paid the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">I recur then to the question, whether an assignee <em>without </em>notice, will be protected in equity against the claim <em>of </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>assurance society? On this subject, we have the express decision of the supreme court of the <em>U. States </em>in <em>The Mut. Ass. Society </em>v. <em>Watts\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>and also the opinion of judge <em>Fleming </em>in <em>Greenhow </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>that the clause of the act, which requires the seller to give notice to the purchaser, a matter merely between themselves, with which the society has no concern, and that the property is bound in the assignee\u2019s hands without notice. Let us examine this matter for ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"Aac\">The contract of assurance is a covenant real, entered into by the insured with the insurer. It is a covenant entered into by the fee simple holder, whose <em>jus disponendi </em>is absolute. His charges upon the property by way of covenant, cannot be gainsaid by a subsequent purchaser. That purchaser, in making his purchase, takes the property <em>cum onere, </em>and he can only look to his vendor\u2019s covenants to protect him against the incumbrance. Like the grant of a right of way, or of a right to divert a water course, this covenant is binding upon a subsequent purchaser, who has notice of its existence, and even if he has no notice, provided the rights arising under the covenant are <em>legal </em>and not merely <em>equitable. </em>For the covenant is one of those which runs with the land. It is indissolubly connected with a covenant on the part of the society to insure against fire; a covenant which goes to sustain, support and uphold, the property which is charged. It is emphatically, then, one of those contracts, which being for the benefit of the estate, and annexed to it, passes with the title to all who purchase with a knowledge of its existence. And having taken with such knowledge, they are personally bound in respect of the estate which they hold, so long as the property continues theirs. <em>A fortiori, </em>the lien upon the property remains; and neither can be removed but by notice of withdrawal, as provided by law. But, not only is the assignee <em>with </em>notice bound both in person, and as to the property purchased; but the property is bound even <em>without </em>notice, whether he is bound personally or not; a question, which I do not mean to touch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>For, the liability of the property is not only imposed by the party himself, in adopting and consenting to abide by the constitution, laws &amp;c. of the society; but the act of the legislature itself declares, that the subscribers, as soon as tjiey gjiap jnsur6j <em>sc \u00bf0 </em>mutually for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators <em>and </em>assigns, engage their property insured, as security, and subject the same to be sold, if necessary, for the payment of quotas.\u201d This charge declared and imposed by the law itself, cannot be regarded as a mere equitable claim. The jurisdiction exerted by a court of equity for carrying it into effect, does not change its nature from a <em>legal lien </em>into a <em>mere equity. </em>Like other cases, in which parties are before a court of equity, where the claim of one is superiour to the other in the estimation of the law, <em>equity </em>will respect the <em>legal </em>preference. Thus, if various creditors are before the court, seeking the distribution of <em>legal </em>assets, the legal superiority of a claimant is duly respected. If various creditors have judgement liens, which are obstructed by a fraudulent conveyance; upon setting aside that conveyance, the eldest judgement creditor will have his priority of right duly preserved. So in this case; though equity lends its aid to the enforcement of this lien, yet is it emphatically a <em>legal </em>and not an <em>equitable </em>lien. It is declared <em>by </em>the law itself, as strongly as the lien on the debtor\u2019s land created by judgement in behalf of private individuals, or the lien on the lands of public defaulters in behalf of the commonwealth. It must, therefore, be treated as <em>a legal </em>lien, and as such it cannot be successfully repelled by the plea of purchaser without notice; a plea which can avail only against a merely equitable title.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In the argument of this case, it has been contended, that whatever may be the effect of the act of 1794, the act of 1805 contains no provision giving to the society a lien on the insured premises, for the <em>additional premium, </em>and the <em>annual instalments </em>required by that act, or for those which have been subsequently authorized by the act of 1809. It is true, there is. no such express provision in either of <em>those </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>acts, bnt the first of them repeals only such parts of antecedent laws as are repugnant to itself. It left untouched the sections of the act of 1794, which declare the liability of the property insured, for the payment of the <em>quotas. </em>But it was said there are no longer any <em>quotas, </em>but instead of them, an annual contribution, first by the act of 1809 for ten years, and now continued by that of 1819, at the discretion of the society. These are, however, the same thing in effect. For, as I have already said, the <em>quota </em>was itself but such <em>contribution as might be necessary from time to time, to maintain the integrity of the fund. </em>And what else are the annual assessments made, first under the act of 1809, and afterwards under that of 1819? The terms, indeed, are changed, but the substance is the same; and so, for more than twenty years, the law has been universally understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">With respect to some other topics, I must content myself with very succinct remarks. No fault is attributable to the society, for not giving notice to the purchaser, for it is not presumable the agent in this city is conusant of the sales made in remote parts of the state. Nor am I aware, that the legal rights of the society can be affected by their omission to demand payment at an earlier day; by which failure, as it is said, the defendant <em>Stone </em>will be a sufferer. Whether it would have forfeited its lien by failure to give notice of it, if a notice of <em>Stone\u2019s </em>purchase and of <em>Vaughan\u2019s </em>situation could have been brought home to it, is a question which the facts in the case do not require me to examine; but without any evidence of fraudulent concealment on the part of the society or its agents, or of knowledge of the interest of <em>Stone </em>in the transaction, it is impossible, I think, that it can justly be deprived of its lien. I cannot but observe, that common prudence would naturally dictate an inquiry on the part of a purchaser, whether his vendor is or is not an insurer; an inquiry so easily satisfied, by an application to the public office established by the society according to law. Yet, on the other hand, I will remark, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>is singular the society have not made an effort to prevent, as far as possible, disputes as to notice, by affixing, as is usual with insurance companies, some emblem of the insuranee on some conspicuous part of the tenement insured. por) though I am of opinion, that, notice or no notice, the lien is preserved, yet this opinion, it is well known, has not always nor universally prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The decree entered by this court, declared, that the appellants were entitled to have a sale of the premises for the amount of their demand, unless the appellees or one of them should pay and satisfy the same within a reasonable time to be fixed by the court of chancery: therefore, the chancellor\u2019s decree was reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, to be proceeded in, according to the principles here declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
