Salyards </em>three fourths of a furnace and lands attached thereto in the county of Hardy, (the other fourth belonging to <em>Abraham Baker,) </em>for which they were to give 8609 dollars. Of this sum they paid 3000 dollars in cash, and gave their bonds for <em>the </em>remainder. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\">Soon after this sale, <em>Samuel Scott </em>and <em>William Slater </em>filed their bill against these parties in the Superior Court of <em>Frederick </em>county, in which <em>Scott </em>claimed <em>by </em>purchase from <em>William Salyards, </em>an interest of three eighths in the property sold by him to <em>Bryan </em>and <em>J. J. Salyards, </em>and <em>Slater </em>claimed one fourth by purchase from <em>Baker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-11\">In the progress of this cause, <em>Bryan </em>paid to a receiver of the Court, 1864 dollars 69 cents, part of the purchase money due from him for the property purchased of <em>William Salyards; </em>and on the final hearing of the cause, the Court made a decree in favour of <em>Scott </em>for 2054 dollars 7 cents, with interest on 1607 dollars 77 cents, from the 31st of May 1837, till paid; subject to a credit for the amount in the hands of the receiver. Prom this decree, <em>Bryan </em>and <em>William Salyards </em>appealed ; but before the appeal was perfected, <em>Bryan </em>compromised with <em>Scott, </em>by paying him on the 2d of November 1837, 1150 dollars, in full of the decree in his favour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Whilst the case of <em>Scott </em>and <em>Slater </em>was progressing in the Superior Court of <em>Frederick, </em>the bonds given by <em>Bryan </em>and <em>J. J. Salyards </em>for the property purchased of <em>William Salyards </em>were assigned by him to various persons, and suits were brought upon some of them and judgments obtained. <em>Bryan </em>thereupon obtained an injunction to these judgments <em>from </em>the Superior Court of <em>Hardy, </em>on the ground of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>claim, and that he had been directed to pay the money due for the property purchased, to a receiver of the Court in that suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\">After the determination of the suit of <em>Scott </em>and <em>Slater, </em>and the compromise between <em>Scott </em>and <em>Bryan, </em>the injunction cause in the Superior Court of <em>Hardy </em>came on to be heard, when, the Court held, among other things, that <em>Bryan </em>was entitled to credit upon his <em>bonds for the </em>whole amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>decree j and referred the account to a commissioner. The report of the commissioner having been returned, the Court made a decree dissolving the injunction for the balance reported to be due from <em>Bryan </em>for the purchase money. From this decree, <em>Bryan </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-6\"><em>Mason, </em>for the appellant, submitted the cause upon the petition.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-7\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellee, referred to the case of <em>Blow </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>2 Leigh 29.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b209-8\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A2B\">delivered the opinion of the Court; and after ruling in favour of the appellant, several points of not much importance, and which involved no principle, proceeded:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">And the Court is further of opinion, that there is error in the decree of the Circuit Court to the prejudice of the appellees in this, that <em>Bryan </em>is credited with the full amount of <em>Scott\u2019s </em>decree, <em>to wit, </em>2054 dollars 7 cents, instead of only 1150 dollars, the sum with which <em>Bryan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>paid it. <em>Bryan </em>owed a balance of purchase money <em>to Salyards </em>under a contract which was confirmed by the Court, and <em>Salyards </em>was entitled to the whole of it, except so much as was requisite for the discharge of the interfering claim of <em>Scott. </em>To that extent, and no further, was <em>Bryan </em>entitled to indemnity from <em>Salyards. </em>The result of the decree of the Circuit Court is to give to <em>Bryan </em>the property he purchased from <em>Salyards, </em>for a much less sum than he contracted to pay for it. It was immaterial to <em>Bryan </em>to whom he paid the purchase money due from him, whether to <em>Scott </em>or <em>Salyards. </em>In effect his payment to <em>Scott </em>was out of <em>Salyard's </em>money, which had been withdrawn from <em>Bryan's </em>harids and paid into Court. The joint appeal of <em>Bryan </em>and <em>Salyards, </em>which enabled <em>Bryan </em>to make this speculation, was taken for the benefit of <em>Salyards, </em>as appears from his agreement with <em>Bryan </em>to pay the whole costs of it out of his own pocket; and it was by thus getting behind the back of <em>Salyards </em>that <em>Bryan </em>effected his compromise with <em>Scott. </em>If <em>Bryan </em>and <em>Salyards </em>had been the joint owners of the fund, the compromise would have enured to the benefit of both, but <em>Salyards </em>being the sole owner thereof as regards <em>Bryan, </em>it ought to enure solely to the benefit of <em>Salyards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that the aforesaid decree of the Circuit Court be reversed and annulled, and the appellees being the parties substantially prevailing, that they recover against the appellant <em>Bryan </em>their costs by them expended in the defence of this appeal. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit Court, to be there further proceeded in according to the principles of the foregoing opinion and decree; and for the decision of priorities amongst the appellees ; and for the proper relief amongst the parties at a final hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
