Whereupon, the defendants\u2019 counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, that the executor\u2019s sureties were no wise bound by the bond, for the proceeds of the real estate sold by their principal, and not accounted for; which instruction the court refused to give; and the defendants filed a bill of exceptions to the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-7\"><em>Johnson </em>for the appellants\u20141.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A02\">The demurrer to the declaration ought to have been sustained. <em>Bruce &amp; Sydnor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>were not proper relators. The statute provides, that an , , , , . , . <em>r </em>executor s bond \u201c may be put in suit, and prosecuted lrom time to time, by and at the costs of <em>any party injured by a breach thereof </em>but the party injured to whom the action is given, must be a party having a legal right to the damages sustained by the breach. The action lay at the relation of S. Davis, but not at the relation of <em>Bruce if Sydnor, </em>to whom she assigned her decree against the executor ; the decree not being, at law, an assignable subject, and the assignment, therefore, passing only an equitable right. <em>Tolson v. Elwes, </em>1 Leigh, 436. <em>Meze </em>v. <em>Howver, Id. 442, Garland v. Jacobs, 2 </em>Leigh, 651. There was no manner of privity between the assignees and the obligors in the bond. The right of the assignees had been ascertained by no judicial proceeding; and no action lies on an executor\u2019s bond, till the right of the party claiming has been judicially established. <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>1 Wash. 31. Besides, the declaration does not allege, that assets sufficient to satisfy the legacy, and the decree for it, came to the executor\u2019s hands, or what amount of assets came to his hands, to be administered ; neither is there any distinct averment, that the amount of the decree was not paid to the assignor. 2. The opinion given by the circuit court at the trial, was clearly erroneous. The sureties of the executor are bound by their bond, for the due administration of the personal assets only. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>2 Rand. 483.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-9\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am6\">did not abandon the last point, as to the liability of the sureties for the proceeds of real estate sold by the executor; but he submitted it without any remark. As to the points made upon the demurrer, he said,\u2014The statute gives the action on the bond <em>to any party injured </em>by the breach; and the assignees of the decree in this case, were <em>parties injured. </em>They were entitled to receive the money, and to give a discharge of the debt; and after the assignment, the assignor had no right to receive the debt. Payment to the assignees would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>saved the obligors from liability on their bond : payment to the assignor, after notice of the assignment, would have left them liable to the assignees. The objection is, that the assignment gave them not a <em>legal </em>but only an <em>equitable </em>right *\u00b0 ^le money ; but the assignor herself had only an <em>equitable </em>right; namely, a right to a legacy. If, for this reason, the action cannot be maintained at the relation of the assignees, so neither can it be maintained at the relation of the assignor ; and then the executor\u2019s bond is no security for a legatee. The others defects imputed to the declaration are merely formal; substantial objections only are to be regarded upon a general demurrer. The declaration avers, in substance, that the executor <em>wasted the assets in not paying the amount of the decree.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-4\">Caer, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ACg\">The circuit court unquestionably erred in refusing to instruct the jury, that the sureties of the executor were not bound to make good the proceeds of land sold by their principal. This court, after the fullest investigation, has settled the law on that subject, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hobson. </em>There was another point argued at the bar; whether <em>Bruce fy Sydnor </em>could as assignees of <em>Mrs. Davis, </em>a legatee, sustain an action, in the character of relators, on the bond of the executor? I have felt some doubt as to this; but, from th\u00e9 reason and analogies of the law, am led to conclude, that they cannot. We have decided in <em>Tolson </em>v. <em>Elwes, </em>that where A. obtains a judgement, and the execution is indorsed for the benefit of B. he cannot make a motion in his own name against the sheriff, for a default, in the service and return of the writ. We have also decided in <em>Meze </em>v. <em>Howver, </em>that where an execution in the name of A. is indorsed for the benefit of B. if the sheriff levy it, and take a forthcoming bond payable to B. such bond is naught and will be quashed. These cases were decided on the particular words of the law ; but the general proposition was also taken, that in no proceeding to carry a judgement or execution into effect, can the name of the transferree be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>substituted for that of the plaintiff on the record. The law requires bond and security of executors for the safety of creditors and legatees alone; but neither of these can sue upon the bond, till they have established their demand against the executor by judgement or decree. To enforce this judgement or decree,the bond may be put in suit; but can it be at the relation of any but the plaintiff on the record ? I think not. The words of the law are broad ; \u201c the bond may be put in suit and prosecuted, by and at the costs of <em>any party injured </em>by the <em>breach thereof:\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>still, as the bond is given for the benefit of creditors and legatees alone, they seem to be the <em>parties </em>meant by the law. A creditor by bond or other assignable paper, may it is true, by assigning it, place his assignee in his shoes ; but a legacy, decree or judgement, is not assignable at law. I do not think, therefore, that the legatee in this case, could by her assignment, enable <em>Bruce if Sydnor to </em>sustain this action on the bond, as relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b117-9\">T\u00fccker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJ0\">The first error assigned in this case by the appellants is, that <em>Bruce if Sydnor, </em>the relators, who claim as assignees of a decree in favour of S. <em>Davis, </em>one of the legatees of <em>John Davis </em>deceased, were not proper relators; that the suit upon the executor\u2019s bond for the amount of the decree, should have been at the relation of the legatee, and not of her assignees. I am of opinion, that this objection is a valid one. The language of the statute is indeed very broad; that \u201c the bond may be put in suit by <em>any party injured </em>by the breach thereof.\u201d But oven this broad provision <em>may be </em>satisfied by conceding to those who have legal claims, a right to put them in suit at law, and to those who have equitable claims, a right to sue in equity. Or, it may be satisfied by conceding, that persons standing in the relation of <em>Bruce if Sydnor </em>to the case, may sue even at law, in the name of the justices, upon the relation of their as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>signor, and for their own use. If, however, this may seem too nice and technical, I am willing to place the matter upon the more liberal ground of the real meaning of the statute, and the mischiefs and embarrassments, which would proceed from lhe adoption of a different construction. The statute then, prescribes that any <em>party injured </em>by a breach of the bond may put it in suit. The question still recurs, who is to be considered <em>a party injured </em>? and how is the fact to be ascertained, that the suitor comes within that description? Now, it is agreed, on all hands, that no suit can be maintained upon the bond until the party sueing has first established his claim against the estate, if he is a creditor, by the judgement of some court of justice, or if he is a legatee, by the decree of a court of chancery, or the judgement of a court of law upon the express <em>assumpsit </em>of the executor. It is believed, that the records of our courts furnish no instance of an attempt to sue on the bond, until the party has established his demand by a previous judicial proceeding. Indeed it cannot be. The action for a <em>devastavit </em>never could be maintained, until there was a previous judgement against the executor establishing the demand, and the action on the bond could only have been sustained, until within a few years past, after a judgement for a <em>devastavit. </em>And even now, the law expressly requires a previous judgement for the demand, and a return of <em>nulla bona, </em>before a suit can be sustained upon the bond. I think, therefore, we may safely affirm, that <em>the party injured </em>must have established his right to sue, and the fact of his falling within the description of the statute, by some previous judicial proceeding, before he can be entitled to be a relator in an action upon an executor\u2019s bond. It may be said, that the demand in this case has been established by a judicial proceeding, and the requisitions of the statute thereby satisfied. But how has the connexion of <em>Bruce </em>fy <em>Sydnor </em>with that demand, been established ? Had <em>S. Davis </em>been the relator, and the action been indorsed for their use, every thing would have been right. She would have had a <em>legal </em>title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to recover, founded upon the actual decree in her favour of a court of record of the highest authority; and the rights of her equitable assignees would have been secured by the indorsement. The defendant upon the service of the process (which is a demand in law) would have seen that that demand was the demand of an ascertained creditor, and might have satisfied it forthwith. But, as the suit is now brought, various principles of the law are set at naught. Persons having equitable interests are found asserting those interests in a legal tribunal, instead of filing their bill in equity upon the foot of the former decree, and seeking to enforce its provisions against principal and sureties, in the mode so familiar to the profession in that court. Invasions of the jurisdiction of courts of law by the courts of equity, about which we are so sensitive, are not more mischievous than many invasions of the jurisdiction of equity would be. This among others would be attended with great inconvenience. If the assignees, <em>Bruce Sydnor, </em>had sued in equity, S'. <em>Davis, </em>their assignor, would have been a necessary party. The question of assignment or no assignment, could there have been definitively settled, in the cause between <em>Bruce &amp;f Sydnor, S. Davis, </em>and the executor. But in the action at law, though the defendants should have pleaded no assignment from <em>S. D. </em>to the relators, no verdict could have been given, which could have protected them against a future claim on <em>her </em>part, if she should be able to negative the authenticity of the assignment, or to shew some subsisting equity or discount against her assignees. Let me add too, that the want of privity between themselves and the defendants, leads, I think, to another consequence, inconsistent with legal principles. In the theory of the law, the writ itself is a demand of the debt from the defendant. Upon the service of the writ, if he knows the demand to be just, he may discharge it forthwith. It is proper, then, that he who sues him should be known as a creditor; but this cannot be where the relator in the cause is an equitable assignee, unknown to himself, and not recognized by a court of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>I am of opinion, therefore,, that this defect in the action is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The next error assigned is, that there is no averment in the declaration, that assets to the value of the debt ever came to the hands of the executor. I think this also a sound objection to the declaration. The question here, it will be observed, does not arise after a verdict. We are considering it upon the general demurrer filed in the court below to the declaration. The statute of <em>jeofails </em>is, therefore, out of the question, except the clause which declares that, upon general demurrer, the court shall only regard such errors as are specially assigned, <em>\u201c </em>unless something so' essential to the action or defence as that judgement according to law and the very right of the cause cannot he given, be omitted.\u201d That there is no averment in the declaration, that assets to the value of the debt, or indeed any assets, came to the hands of the executor, appears from the most rigorous examination. It remains then only to inquire, whether this averment be so essential to the action, as that judgement could not be given according to law and the very right of the cause? I think it was. The matters which go to make up the right of action, in cases of this description, are threefold; 1. an ascertained demand against the estate; <em>2. </em>assets in the hands of the executor; and <em>3. </em>the return of the sheriff, that no such assets can be had to satisfy the execution. It cannot be denied, that upon the trial, these three things must be shewn in order to establish a breach of the condition of the bond. The necessity of proof of assets is obvious, from the consideration, that if no assets were received, there could be no breach by <em>devastavit; </em>and the necessity of establishing by proof the amount of assets,\u2019is also clear, because it has been repeatedly decided, that the jury must find either sufficient assets or the amount of assets. <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Raines, </em>1 Leigh, 481. <em>Gardner\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Vidal, </em>6 Rand. 106. This, then, is obviously one of the most essential ingredients in the action. It may safely be called, indeed, the very gist of the action. And if it be</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the important inquiry before the jury on the trial of the plea of <em>plene administravit, </em>or <em>conditions performed, </em>it is not less important in the case of a demurrer. For it must be remembered, t.hat upon overruling the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, peremptory judgement is pronounced against him for the plaintiff\u2019s demand. If, therefore, the declaration omit what is essential to constitute a right of action, it is impossible to give such judgement without palpable injustice. For, though the demurrer admits what <em>is </em>set forth in the declaration, it does not admit what is not; and hence it is that (sweeping as are the provisions of our statute of jeofails) they reach no case of a demurrer for matter of substance. Much, indeed, may be cured by a verdict; but no errors, except those of mere form, are protected from the effect of a demurrer. A further consideration may illustrate the essential character of an averment of assets, in order to enable the court to pronounce judgement. Even a verdict for the plaintiff for his demand will not justify a judgement of the court, unless that verdict expressly finds a sufficiency of assets, or the amount of the assets, so as to enable the court to graduate thereby its own judgement. How, then, can the court give judgement according to law and the very right of the case, when, so far from knowing the amount or sufficiency of the assets, it does not even know from the plaintiff\u2019s own declaration, that the defendant ever received any assets at all ? I cannot perceive. I therefore conclude, that on this point also, there is error in the judgement of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"AYd\">The third objection relied upon, arises on the bill of exceptions ; the court refusing to instruct the jury, that the securities of the executor were not bound for the proceeds of the land sold under <em>John Davis\u2019s </em>will. This decision is in conflict with the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>and is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Judgement reversed, and judgement entered on the demurrer, for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
