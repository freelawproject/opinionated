There was no schedule of1 the debts annexed to the deed. <em>T. Collins, </em>\u25a0the father, died not long after the execution of the deed. His will was proved and recorded in the county court of <em>King Queen, </em>at August term 1826; and administration with the will annexed, was granted to his widow <em>Virginia Collins.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-3\">Upon a bill exhibited in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>by <em>Virginia, </em>the administratrix with the will annexed, against <em>Janey, </em>the trustee named in the deed of the 26th May 1826, and <em>T. Collins, </em>the <em>cestui que trust, </em>two questions arose; 1. Whether <em>T. Collins, </em>the son, could claim the subject assigned to the trustee for his use by the <em>deed, </em>and at the same time claim under his father\u2019s will, one third of his other estate ? and 2. Whether he was entitled under the deed, to all debts which had been contracted to his father at its date, as well those which had then become payable, as those which were to become payable at a future time, or only such debts as had not only been contracted but had become payable befo\u2019re and at the date of the deed ? in other words, what was the import of the words in the deed, <em>all the debts now due </em>?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4r\">It appeared, by accounts taken- by order of the court, that there were debts which had been contracted and become payable to TV <em>Collins, </em>the father, before and at the date of the deed of the 26th May 1826, to the amount of about 5000 dollars; that there were debts contracted to him before and at that date, but which had not then become payable, to the amount of about 2000 dollars; and that his whole property, real and personal, including debts of both descriptions, was, at the date of his will and of the deed, of the value of about 13500 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The chancellor was of opinion, and accordingly decreed, that <em>T. Collins, </em>the son, could not \u201eclaim both under the <em>deed </em>of the 26th May 1826, <em>and </em>under the <em>will </em>of his father; and that, if he should elect to claim under the <em>deed, </em>he was entitled under it, to <em>all </em>the debts which had been <em>contracted </em>to his father before and at its date, as well such as became <em>payable afterwards, </em>as those which were <em>then </em>payable. From this decree, <em>Mrs. Collins, </em>the administratrix, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-5\"><em>Michie, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b415-6\">Bkooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aph9\">delivered the opinion of the court. The question as to the correctness of this decree, depends on the construction of the words in the deed of the 26th May-1826, describing the subject thereby assigned by <em>Collins </em>to <em>Janey, </em>in trust for his son\u2014\u201c <em>all the debts now due </em>to the said <em>T. </em>Collins\u201d &amp;c. The chancellor thought, that this description in the deed, included all his debts, those then <em>contracted </em>but payable <em>in future, </em>as well as the debts <em>then payable. </em>The words of the sentence are perfectly intelligible. They contain no latent ambiguity, so that a resort to the will, or to any thing else extrinsic of the deed, to explain them, would be improper. If there would be a doubt, whether the words <em>all my debts due </em>would include debts not payable though contracted, <em>debita in present\u00ed solvenda in futuro, </em>the donor has guarded against that doubt, by inserting the word <em>now. </em>All his debts <em>now </em>due, in common parlance, must be understood to mean, <em>debts then payable, </em>not <em>debts payable at a future day. </em>The word <em>now </em>could not have been inserted, to exclude debts that might be afterwards <em>contracted, </em>debts not then in existence, because they would not be subjects of transfer, and could not have been in the mind of the grantor. If he had meant to speak in <em>technical </em>language, he would have omitted the word <em>now. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>And even if he had omitted it, there are many examples in which both judges and legislators have interpreted and used the words <em>debts due, </em>in the limited sense of <em>debts payable, </em>not in the broader technical sense, including all debts <em>contraeted </em>whether payable or not. Without deciding any thing more in the cause, this court reverses the decree, on this point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
