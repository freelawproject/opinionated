Ayres, </em>plaintiff, against <em>G. Bewellin, </em>defendant,\u2014Upon a motion for money paid as surety\u2014This day came the parties by their attorneys ; and, on hearing, it is considered by the court, that the plaintiff recover against the defendant, the sum of .100 dollars, with interest from the 13th April 1817 till paid, also 8 dollars 33 cents, and his costs by him about his motion in this behalf expended, &amp;c.\u201d The caption of each of the other fourjudgements, was in these words\u2014\u201c Same plaintiff against same defendant\u2014upon the same motion;\u201d and then followed the several entries of these four judgements; which were, each and all, of the same tenor with that of the first judgement above recited, being each for the same sums of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>100 dollars and 8 dollars <em>33 </em>cents, and the costs of the motion, with this difference only, that interest was given on the sums of 100 dollars severally adjudged in these four cases, from the 13th April 1818, 1819, 1820 and 1821, respectively. And then the record of the county court proceeded thus : \u201c The following notice was filed on the motion for the \u00cdQregoing judgements, <em>viz. Mr. G. Leivellin; </em>Take notice, that I shall, by my attorney, move the court of <em>Bed-ford </em>county, on the 4th Monday in this present month, for judgements and award of executions against you in five cases wherein I have been compelled to pay <em>Stephen Martin </em>as your surety, (signed) J. <em>Ayres, </em>(dated) December 9. 1823.\u201d Upon this notice was indorsed an <em>affidavit </em>of due service thereof on <em>Lewellin. </em>And this was the whole of the record of the proceedings of the county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">Upon the petition of <em>Lewellin, </em>the circuit court of <em>Bed-ford </em>awarded <em>one supersedeas </em>to the <em>five </em>judgements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-7\">The circuit court held, that the county court erred in rendering <em>five </em>several judgements upon <em>one </em>notice; and in giving'jfoe sets of costs upon <em>one </em>motion, whereas it should have rendered but <em>one </em>judgement for the several debts claimed, and given but <em>one </em>set of costs: therefore, the judgements of the county court were reversed, and one judgement rendered for <em>Ayres </em>against <em>Lewellin, </em>for the several debts, with interest on each respectively, and the costs of his motion in the county court; that is, for only one set of costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-8\">And then <em>Ayres </em>applied to this court, for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement of the circuit court, which was <em>allowed.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b634-9\"><em>Johnson </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVA\">said, that, though the clerk had appended a copy of the notice upon which <em>Ayres </em>made his motions for the judgements in the county court, to the transcript of the entries of the judgements, and certified, that that was the notice on which the motion for the judgements was made; yet this notice was no part of the record. For <em>Lewellin </em>having appeared to the motions, and the judge-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>merits having been rendered upon a hearing of both parties, \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022i _ <em>. </em>t . without any objection taken in respect oi the notice, it was wholly immaterial what was the notice, or whether there was any notice. Neither could the notice have been made part of the record, but by some defence founded on it, and by bill of exceptions to the opinion of the court touching such defence, and thus making the notice part of the record. Then, the record of the proceedings in the county court presented, simply, a transcript of five several judgements rendered for five several sums of money, paid by <em>Ayres </em>as surety for <em>Lewellin. </em>And, as <em>Ayres </em>might have maintained five several actions of <em>assumpsit </em>for the five several debts; so he might well have maintained, as ho did, five several motions to recover the several debts, in a summary way, under the statute, I Rev. Code, ch. 116. \u00a7 <em>1. </em>p. 460. It was true, that after the caption of the first judgement stating the names of the parties, plaintiff and defendant, and that it was \u201c upon a motion for money paid as surety,\u201d the caption of the other four judgements stated that they were \u201c <em>upon the same </em>motion;\u201d but the language of the caption was only the clerical description of the case, and was not, like the judicial language of the court, to be construed strictly; and the captions to the four judgements might well be understood as only describing the <em>nature </em>of the ' motions to be the same with the first, namely, <em>motions for money paid as surety, </em>not as importing that there was only a single motion made for a single judgement for all the debts demanded; and seeing that, in fact, there were five several judgements for the several debts, as upon five several motions, and judgements for the costs of each motion severally, the caption must be so understood. <em>[Tucker, P. </em>The cause was brought up to the circuit court, by <em>one supersedeas </em>to all the <em>five </em>judgements; was not that irregular <em>?]\u2014Johnson </em>said, it certainly was; and that was another palpable error in the proceedings of the circuit court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AoS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>. <em>Leigh, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alrl\">admitted, that a party having paid several sums as surety for another, might maintain several motions for the several debts; but he might also maintain one motion for them all; and if, in fact, he made but one motion, he was entitled to only one judgement for all the debts, and the costs of that single motion; as, if he had counted in one action of <em>assumpsit </em>for several debts so contracted to him, he could only have had a single judgement, and the costs of his action. Here, there was but one notice, and but a single motion. He said, the notice was necessarily part of the record. For the notice of a summary motion of this kind, given by the statute, served the double purpose of process and declaration: it might be waived by consent: it might be admitted by the defendant: but the defendant\u2019s appearance was not a waiver or admission of due notice, any more than the defendant\u2019s appearance to an action, dispensed with a declaration. It was the <em>notice </em>that ascertained the <em>nature </em>of the claim ; it was the <em>notice </em>that gave the court the summary jurisdiction. The first section of the statute giving this summary remedy for sureties (cited by <em>Mr. Johnson) </em>gave the motion; but the 5th section <em>provided, </em>that no judgement shall be obtained by such motion, unless the party against whom the same is prayed, shall have ten days previous notice thereof. Therefore, without a notice of the motion\u2014actual notice given, or notice distinctly waived, or distinctly admitted, by the party entitled to it; without shewing on the record, in one or other of those modes, the <em>nature </em>of the claim; there could be nothing to warrant the exercise of this summary jurisdiction. It behoved the plaintiff to maintain that the notice was part of the record. And if it was, there was but <em>one </em>notice. But suppose the notice not part of the record, and suppose it unnecessary that it should be so; there was but <em>one </em>motion. The caption of the first judgement shewed, that <em>that </em>was rendered <em>upon a motion for money paid as surety ; </em>the captions of the other four shewed, that they were rendered <em>upon the same motion. </em>The circuit court thought, that \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>same </em>motion\u201d meant <em>one and the same, </em>which surely was tho plain, ordinary import of the phrase: <em>Mr. Johnson </em>insisted, that \u201c the <em>same </em>motion\u201d meant the <em>like </em>motion, namely, for money paid as surety. This was a very violent construetion. <em>JVullum simile est idem, </em>said the proverb; e <em>converso, nullum idem est simile tantum. </em>It never occurred to the judge of the circuit court, that <em>idem </em>and <em>simile </em>could not bo regarded as convertible. If the captions were part of the record, then, <em>they </em>sufficiently shewed that there was but <em>one </em>motion; on which there wer <em>efive </em>judgements, and <em>five </em>sets of costs of that one motion awarded. But take it, that these captions were only clerical language, not the judicial language of the court; that they were only the clerk\u2019s description of the cases to which the entries of the judgements applied (and this, he said, was really the true character and function of the captions; for, when a record is made out, the caption of the entry of the judgement on the order book, need not be, and never was, inserted) : then, the caption of the first judgement, as well as the captions of the four others, was only a clerical description of the case, in order to shew to what case the judgement applied; and tho court could pay no more regard to the caption of the first judgement, than to the captions of the others. And, if this were so j if the caption of the first judgement was to he disregarded, as the mere language of tho clerk; how could it be ascertained, that here was a motion, or motions, <em>for money paid, by .Ayres as surety for Lewellin </em>? and how could the jurisdiction of the county court to render judgement in this summary way, be sustained ? Whether it was regular to award <em>one supersedeas </em>to the five judgements or not, depended, obviously, on the question, whether here were five several judgements upon five several motions, or five several judgements on one and the same motion ? Suppose the plaintiff had, in one and the same action of <em>assumpsit, </em>counted in his declaration upon the five several debts due him, and the court, instead of rendering one judgement for all the sums, and for the costs of the single action, had rendered five se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>vera^ judgements for the five several sums, and for the costs' of the action five times: there could be no doubt, that one <em>supersedeas </em>would have lain, to correct the error.. So here, if there was but one motion for these five several debts, and one set of costs only incurred on that motion; a single <em>supersedeas </em>was the proper process to correct the error of severing the judgements into five parts, when it should have been one and intire, and giving five times the costs actually incurred.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b638-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AhJ\">In this case, I am of opinion, that according to general principles and the spirit of our decisions, the notice is no part of the record. \u201c The parties came by their attorneysthe defendant appeared, and having made no objection to the proceeding for want of notice, and having filed no bill of exceptions, we must take it, that there was a due notice proved in each of these several motions. The acts of the court must be presumed to have been right, unless the party has placed upon the record the evidence of its errors. There are several cases that bear on the point: <em>Glascock\u2019s adm\u2019rx </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>1 Munf. 605. <em>Bronaughs </em>v. <em>Freeman\u2019s ex\u2019or, 2 </em>Munf. 266. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>4 Munf. 380. <em>Burke, adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Levy\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>1 Rand. 1. <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>2 Leigh, 545. It would be strange, indeed, if the certificate of the clerk of a county court, where the minutes only are signed by the court, should be taken as ascertaining what papers were read upon a trial, instead of the court itself being called upon to ascertain them by the solemnity of a bill of exceptions. It is an anomaly which cannot be admitted, since the court would find it difficult indeed, to pronounce how far the practice should be extended, and where to fix its limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">If the notice be out of the case, then these five judgements of the county court are utterly independent of each other; and here we have a single <em>supersedeas </em>to all of them. This cannot be right. The <em>supersedeas, </em>where it has the character 'of original process, as it has here, partakes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>character of a writ of error : and a writ of error, it is presrnned, will not lie to several distinct and separate judgements. Such a practice would lead to great difficulty and embarrassment. The <em>supersedeas, </em>therefore, was improvidentiy awarded by the circuit court; and if so, this court, instead of affirming the judgements of the county court, must, in proceeding to render such judgement as the circuit court ought to have given, dismiss the <em>supersedeas, </em>as improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">A party defendant who is harassed by a variety of actions, which might be properly united in one suit, is not without a remedy. l\u00edo may move to consolidate them; and if that motion be overruled, the error may doubtless be corrected by a superiour tribunal; in what manner, it is not necessary for me to say, except that a <em>supersedeas </em>is <em>not </em>the proper remedy, where it does not appear from the record, that such a motion was made or rule applied for. In this case, no such step was taken, and it was not therefore competent to the circuit court to look into the matter. In every point of view, I am of opinion, that the <em>supersedeas </em>was improvidently awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The other judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">After this opinion had been announced, <em>Johnson </em>insisted, that <em>Ayres, </em>the plaintiff in error here, was entitled to judgement for his costs in the circuit court, as well as in this court; and also to damages for retarding the execution of the judgements of the county court, now finally affirmed by this court, under the statutes, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 64. \u00a7 11. ch. 69. \u00a7 61. pp. 192. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The judgement of the court was, that the judgement of the circuit court be reversed, and that the defendant should pay the plaintiff in error, his costs expended in prosecuting his <em>supersedeas </em>here: and this court, proceeding to render such judgement as the circuit court ought to have rendered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ordered, that the <em>supersedeas </em>awarded by the circuit court to the judgement of the county court, at the instance of <em>Lewellin, </em>should be quashed, as having been improvidently awarded, and that he should pay <em>Ayres, </em>the plaintiff in error here, his costs about his defence in the circuit court expended. But the court gave no damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b640-4\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAys\">dissented from so much of the judgement as gave <em>Ayres </em>his costs expended in the circuit court. He said\u2014I have examined a variety of cases in this court, in order to ascertain wh\u00e1t has been the practice; and I am satisfied, that wherever an appeal is dismissed as improvir dently allowed, or a <em>supersedeas </em>quashed as improvidently awarded, the court has always refused to give costs to the party prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The first case was that of <em>Hepburn </em>v. <em>Lewis, 2 </em>Call, 497. in which the judgement of the district court was for less than 100 dollars ; and the appeal was dismissed as improvidently allowed, but there was no judgement for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AKjA\">In <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Conn, </em>1 Munf. 160. the appeal from the court of chancery was dismissed after it had been depending five years, on the ground that it was improvidently granted by the chancellor, after his power over the case had ceased; and no costs allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In <em>Lewis v. Long, 3 </em>Munf. 136. the plaintiff sued on a single bill for more than 100 dollars. The jury found the debt to be discharged by less than that sum. The defendant obtained a <em>supersedeas, </em>and the judgement was reversed ; from which the plaintiff appealed. The appeal was dismissed after a laborious argument by bar and bench; but no costs were allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In <em>Hutchison </em>v. <em>Kellam </em>and <em>Lymbrick </em>v. <em>Seldon, Id. 202. </em>it was after great argument decided, that the jurisdiction of the court of appeals did not attach where the damages were less than 100 dollars, though the right of freehold incidentally came in question; whereupon the appeals were dismissed, but no costs were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Young, </em>5 Munf. 276. the like principle was decided, and the appeal dismissed as improvidently allowed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">In <em>Rootes </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>4 Munf. 323. the appeal allowed by the chancery court upon an appeal bond executed by a surety only, was dismissed, as improvidently allowed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Blannerhassett, </em>5 Munf. 197. there was judgement in the county court against <em>Blannerhassett. </em>A writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by the circuit court of <em>Wood </em>county; whereupon the bond for prosecuting it was executed by a surely, but not by <em>Blannerhassett </em>himself. The circuit court reversed the judgement, and the plaintiff appealed to this court. After argument, it was decided, that the judgement of the circuit court was erroneous, because that court had no cognizance of the cause, the <em>supersedeas </em>having improvidently issued for the cause aforesaid. Reversed, and <em>supersedeas </em>quashed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">In <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>6 Munf. 397. tho appeal was allowed in court, upon the appellant\u2019s entering into bond &amp;c. in the clerk\u2019s office within thirty days: appeal dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">In <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Kiger, </em>3 Rand. 165. an appeal from a decree for costs, was dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">In all the foregoing cases, the principle was invariably adhered to, of refusing costs where the process of <em>supersedeas </em>was quashed, or the appeal dismissed, on the ground that they were improvidently allowed. I have not depended upon the printed reports of the cases in examining this matter : the entries themselves have been carefully examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">I can perceive no essential difference in principle, between these cases and that under consideration. That of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Blannerhassett </em>is very strongly analogous. A case in point is not to be expected; for, as the notice is no part of the record, the case appears to us as a single <em>supersedeas </em>to five judgements. This, l am sure, was not designed by the judge who awarded the <em>supersedeas, </em>and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>probably took the notice to be part of the record. Had it been made so by an exception, the question might, perhaps, have been decided differently.</p>\n<p id=\"Anl\">I am therefore of opinion, that on quashing the <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgement of the county court, the costs of that <em>supersedeas </em>should not be given.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
