Whether the money received by <em>Newton, </em>under the award of the commissioners, belonged to him as assets of <em>Pennocks </em>estate, to be disposed of in due course of administration, or to the trustees, to be applied to the purposes of the trust ? in other words, Whether <em>Pennocks </em>claims against <em>Spain, </em>passed by the deed of trust ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIWd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The chancellor was of opinion, that those claims did not pass by the deed, and therefore dismissed the bill.

C. C. R. 570. but the judgement of the circuit court in that case, had been reversed by the supreme court of the <em>U. States; Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse, </em>1 Peters, 193. The authority of this judgement of the supreme court, and the reasoning on which it was founded, he said, were directly in point to the present' case, and decisive, that the appellants were entitled to the money in question, for the purposes of the trust declared by <em>Pennoclc\u2019s </em>deed of November 1809.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b740-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGGG\">argued, very strenuously, 1. That <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>claims upon <em>Spain, </em>out of which the money in question arose, were not, in their nature, <em>debts </em>due to <em>Pennock, </em>in any sense of the word; they were not claims founded on contract, but claims for losses incurred by illegal seizures made by the Spanish government; <em>by </em>spoliations, in fact, on american commerce. <em>2. </em>That these claims of <em>Pennock, </em>whatever the nature of them might be, did not pass to the trustees, by <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>deed of trust of November 1809, either by the words of that Instrument fairly interpreted, or by the intent of the parties to be Collected from it, upon the most liberal construction. The case of <em>Comegys v. Vasse </em>turned upon the\u2018construction of the bankrupt law of the <em>U. States; </em>this case depends on the construction and effect ;o'f a deed of assignment ; and every SuOh deed 'must operate according to its Own peculiar provisions. He argued, that these claims on <em>Spain </em>did not pass tinder the general description of the subject contained in the deed of trust, <em>all Pennock\u2019s estate, real and personal, whether in Virginia or elsewhere; </em>for the provision, that the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>should <em>sell </em>the <em>said </em>real and personal estate, plainly evinced, that those general words were intended to comprise specific property only; property capable of sale. Neither did these claims pass among the <em>debts </em>which the trustees were to collect, and apply to the purposes of the trust; since it was obvious that the debts which it was intended they should collect, were 'such debts, as that, in case payment thereof should be refused, the trustees might institute <em>suits, in law or equity, </em>for the recovery of them. Now, certainly, <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>claims upon <em>Spain, </em>claims for retribution from a foreign sovereign, for property taken by force, in violation of the laws of nations, could never be asserted in any form of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b741-4\">Cake, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZG-\">The simple question is, Whether the deed of trust conveying all <em>Pennock\u2019s </em>estate, real and personal, in <em>Virginia </em>or elsewhere, comprehended his claim on the government of <em>Spain, </em>for spoliations committed on his property by her vessels, and retained under unjust decisions of her courts ? That the deed does pass this claim, I can have no shadow of doubt. I have no idea of a right or interest vested in a man, which would not pass under a conveyance of all his real and personal estate, more especially when we consider, that this was the deed of an insolvent debtor, conveying and assigning his effects, for the payment of his debts, so far as the fund would go, and obtaining for such conveyance, a complete release from his creditors. This opinion is intirely supported by the decision of the supreme court in <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse. </em>That was a case under the bankrupt law, which conveyed to the assignees, \u201c all the estate real and personal, of every nature and description, to which the bankrupt may be entitled either in law or equity;\u201d words not a whit more comprehensive than those used in this deed. Upon those words of the bankrupt law, judge <em>Story, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, says, they \u201c are very general and comprehensive\u201d\u2014\u201c broad enough to cover every description of right and interest attached to and grow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ing out of property. Under such words, the whole property of a testator would pass to his devisee. Whatever the administrator would take, in case of intestacy, would seem capable of passing by such words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUp\">^ am) therefore, for reversing the decree, and remanding the cause, with a declaration, that <em>PennocWs </em>claims on the Spanish government passed by the deed of trust to the trustee, for the purposes of the trust; that, therefore, the appellee is liable to the appellants, for the money he has received on account of those claims, or for so much thereof as shall be necessary to discharge and satisfy the debts due to the creditors entitled to the benefit of the trust fund, with inter\u00e9st on such debts; and that, if there shall be any residue remaining after those debts shall be fully discharged and satisfied, such residue shall be considered as assets in the hands of the appellee, to be applied in due course of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
