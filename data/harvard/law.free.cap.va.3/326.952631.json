The commissioners were appointed, and they made a report, which, on the motion of <em>Mrs. Trevilian, </em>was quashed by the Court for uncertainty <em>therein; </em>and other commissioners were appointed. The company excepted to the opinion of the Court quashing the report, and applied to the Circuit Superior Court of <em>Hanover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the County Court, which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-4\">When the cause came on in the Circuit Superior Court, the judgment of the County Court was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the County Court, with directions to enter a judgment according to the report. From this judgment of the Circuit Superior Court <em>Mrs. Trevilian </em>applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-13\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-14\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-15\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AkC-\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">It seems to the Court that the Circuit Superior Court Had no jurisdiction to revise the order of the County <em>Court; </em>the same not being final, but interlocutory only. It is therefore considered by the Court that the said judgment of the Circuit Superior Court be reversed and annulled, with costs. And this Court proceeding to give such judgment as the said Circuit Superior Court ought to have rendered, it is further considered by the Court that the <em>supersedeas </em>from the said Circuit Superior Court to the said order of the County Court be dismissed, as having been improvidently awarded, with costs to the defendant in error there: and it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the said Circuit Superior Court, and from thence to the County Court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
