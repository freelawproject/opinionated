Allan, Seymour Scott, Charles A. Jacob </em>and <em>Samuel Mordecai: </em>that <em>Imboden </em>obtained an injunction to prevent the trustee <em>Thomas Taylor, </em>(who was authorised to act alone,) from proceeding under the said trust; which was afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>dissolved. In consequence of this, the said <em>Taylor </em>proceeded to execute the trust created by the said deed, and exposed the said estate for sale, on the 15th day of April, 1818. At the time of this sale, it was not known that there were other incumbrances on the said estate, created before that under which it was proposed to sell. These incumbrances Were, a deed of trust for the benefit of <em>Samuel Blackburn, </em>which, at the date of the sale, had been purchased by <em>James Bell; </em>one, for the benefit of <em>John M\u2019Cue; </em>an incumbrance for a balance duo the executors of- <em>Rhodes, </em>on account of the original purchase money of the said estate, or a part thereof; and a deed of trust for the benefit of <em>William </em>and <em>James Bell. </em>A general estimate of these incumbrances was made, and their aggregate amount rated at <em>$ </em>23,000. This was explained to the persons present, and they were' informed that the purchaser must extinguish these previous incumbrances, whatever they might be, and pay such sum as be should bid, on account of the debts due to the said <em>Ellis \u00a7 </em>Allan, and others. <em>James </em>Bell, being proprietor of the interest of <em>Samuel Blackburn, </em>and part proprietor of the interest secured by the trust deed for the benefit of <em>William </em>and <em>James Bell, </em>and having the control of that interest, bid <em>$ </em>12,000 over and above <em>the </em>said previous incumbrances. The property was struck off to him; and he entered into arrangements to pay the creditors under the deed of the 16th of December, the sum of <em>$ </em>12,000. Since that time, the said <em>James Bell </em>has extinguished the incumbrances of the said <em>John M\u2019Cue; </em>so that it is now understood, that the security in the land is discharged. It is also understood, that <em>William Bell </em>has no longer any interest, having disposed of his to the said <em>James.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">The said <em>Imboden </em>being largely indebted to the complainant, on the 7th of January, 1817, executed to <em>Samuel Clarke, </em>a conveyance in trust, embracing sundry parcels of land, and a variety of personal property, to secure the complainant\u2019s debt. This debt being due and unpaid, and the said <em>Imboden </em>requesting the property to be sold, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>trustee proceeded to sell the property conveyed in the said deed of trust, except the twenty acres of land, mentioned as \u201cadjoining the land of <em>John Guthrie, </em>and the land of the said <em>Imboden, </em>being the residue of 42 acres conveyed to said <em>Imboden </em>by <em>James Hays.\u201d </em>This land, the trustee was forewarned by the said <em>James Bell </em>from selling, he claiming a lien upon it, under the deed of the 14th of August, 1815, for the benefit of <em>William </em>and <em>James Bell. </em>The complainant, not wishing to have a contest, desisted, and it was not sold. Of the personal property, the waggon and teams, with a part of the gears, were not sold, because they were not to be found. Two stills, with the vessels belonging to them, and the moieties' of two carding machines, were not sold, because the said <em>James Bell </em>claimed them under the said deed of the 14th of August, 1815. A large balance remained due to the complainant, after this sale. <em>James Bell </em>directed the trustee under the deed of the 14th of August, 1815, to sell the 20 acres of land above-mentioned;, and the trustee advertised the same for sale. This land was not included in the deed of the 14th of August, 1815, because it was not \u201c <em>in or adjoining the town of Waynesborough,\u201d </em>as other land intervened between it and the said town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-4\">The complainant also alledged, that the purchase of the said <em>Bell </em>was a complete extinguishment of his claim, under the deed of the 14th of August, 1815, because he became liable in equity to the payment of the previous incumbrances. The complainant caused his trustee to advertise the said 20 acre's of land, the stills, vessels, and the moieties of the carding machines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMXm\">The bill prays, that the trustee in the deed for the benefit of <em>William </em>and <em>James Bell </em>may be restrained from proceeding on the said deed of trust, until the further order of the Court; and that the said <em>Bell\u2019s </em>claim to the said 20 acres of land, to the stills, vessels, and carding machines, so far as it conflicts with the rights of the complainant, may be annulled, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">An injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>William </em>and <em>James Bell </em>severally answered, denying that the purchase by <em>James Bell, </em>under the deed of trust in favor of <em>Ellis Allan, </em>was an extinguishment of their claim, under the deed of the 14th of August, 1815: that the <em>20 </em>acres of land, mentioned in the bill, were embraced in that deed; because, at the time of its execution, the said land did adjoin the town of Waynesborough; though it is said, that it became afterwards separated from the town, by <em>hnboden\u2019s </em>selling an intervening piece of land. As to the stills, vessels, and carding machine, they deny that the complainant had any title to them, because they are distinctly embraced in the trust deed of August, 1815; and they are moreover embraced in the trust deed in favor of <em>Ellis </em>\u00bfi\u2019 <em>Allan. </em>The distillery and carding machine were erected and in operation, at the time when the said deed, last mentioned, was made, and were a part of the freehold which passed under that deed; and if so, they were sold to the respondent <em>James, </em>by the trustee in that deed, and passed to him with the rest of the freehold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-4\">The respondent <em>James Bell </em>denied, that he made the purchase aforesaid, upon the terms stated in the bill. The terms of the sale were not, as alledged, that the purchaser should pay off the prior incumbrances. Those terms only required, that the purchaser should pay the sum of money that he bid, and take such right as the trustee could lawfully convey, these prior incumbrances being known, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b601-5\">Depositions were taken; and the Chancellor dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill. <em>Poage </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b601-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A56M\">1. That the Chancellor ought to have directed an issue as to the terms of the sale, as the evidence was contradictory, and a jury were the proper tribunal to decide on its weight. 2. <em>Bell </em>was not entitled to the 20 acres of land, because it did not <em>\u201c </em>adjoin the town of Waynesborough,\u201d as described in the deed for his benefit. 3. The stills, with the vessels belonging to them, and the moiety of two carding machines, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>to be considered as <em>chattels </em>and not as a part of the freehold. To prove this, he referred to 7 <em>Bac. Abr. tit. \u201c </em>Waste,\u201d <em>C. </em>\u00a7 6, <em>p. </em>257, that where a furnace is fixed in the <em>middle </em>and not to the <em>wall </em>of a house, it is a <em>chattel. </em>The case of <em>Elwes </em>v. <em>Maw, </em>3 East. 28, shews the distinction between <em>instruments of trade, </em>and the improve<em>ments of the freehold and inheritance. </em>The first are <em>personal, </em>the latter, <em>real. </em>1 <em>Atk. </em>478, <em>Ex parte Quincy, </em>proves, that between vendor and vendee, such things will not come under the description of <em>appurtenances. </em>4. The waggon and team were pledged to <em>Poage, </em>and <em>Bell </em>had no right to sell them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVtf\">\u25a0 As to the 20 acres of land, they were included in <em>Bell\u2019s </em>deed, and the evidence proves that they were considered as belonging to the tract, which is acknowledged to have been conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aem\">No issue ought to have been directed in this case, as to the terms of sale, because the evidence was not equivocal, but all against <em>Poage\u2019s </em>claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-8\">As to the <em>stills, </em>&amp;c. the English authorities are not applicable to this country.

In the first place, I do not understand the answers of either of the <em>Bells </em>to alledge, that they had their eye, at all, on this piece of land, or that they ever knew that it belonged to <em>Imboden. </em>It had only been conveyed to him by the executor of <em>Hays, </em>a few months before the 14th of August, 1815; and in fact, they might as well claim the part sold to <em>Guthrie, </em>as that was not conveyed until long after, though perhaps, sold before. But, unless they had notice of that, the legal title was in their trustee, and now is; as also the title to tho four acres sold in 1816, to <em>Brown. </em>The most they con - tend for is, that the twenty acres joined an alley of the town of Waynesborough, and, therefore, falls within the description of the deed. The defendant, <em>James Bell, </em>in his answer says, \u201cthe said twenty acres, as this respondent <em>understands </em>and <em>believes,\u201d </em>(not that ho so <em>understood </em>it at the time of the conveyance,) \u201c was then parcel of a tract somewhat larger, which did actually join the town of Waynesborough. Since the making of that deed, this respondent understands and believes, that the said <em>Imboden </em>hath sold part of the said tract adjoining the town, so as to leave the said twenty acres, the residue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>separated a small distance from the town.\u201d And in the preceding clause, he says, <em>\u201c </em>this respondent <em>believes </em>that the twenty acres of land, which the plaintiff alledges not to be within the deed, is distinctly embraced within it, and it was clearly the intention of the parties to embrace it;\u201d that is, as I understand him, if this tract did join the four acres, which did join the town, it was clearly their intention to convey it by the deed; not that they had their eye upon it particularly, for if so, he could easily have stated that fact. Again; when he comes to take testimony in relation to its locality, and under the apprehension that it cannot be united to the four acres, he proves that it joins, on one whole side, the tract of 289 acres, purchased of <em>Estil, </em>which is conveyed in the deed, and that one whole side of the four acres also adjoins that tract, and as this large tract-joined the town, so also, it is contended, did these adjoining tracts. Now, if they were really intended to be conveyed, what better or more appropriate description could have been given .of them, than to specify the quantity, and call for them as adjoining that tract? Or, if the quantity was not known, or the person by whom conveyed, at least to call for them as adjoining that tract?</p>\n<p id=\"AhrN\">But in 1816, <em>Imboden, at a public sale, </em>sells the four acres to <em>Brown, </em>and <em>Bell </em>soon after gets possession of his bond on another transaction between him and <em>Imboden. </em>In addition to this, on the sale by the trustee <em>Taylor, </em>under the deed for the Richmond creditors, <em>Bell\u2019s whole claim </em>is estimated as a prior lien on the other property clearly embraced in both of those deeds. If he had a further lien on other land, the Richmond creditors were entitled to throw him upon that, so far as it would go, in exoneration of the property they were selling. Other bidders went on the ground, that the property sold was chargeable with the <em>whole of Bell\u2019s debt. </em>If he knew that he could resort to this land, he stood on better grounds than they did, and this concealment was a fraud on the Richmond creditors. But his claim of his <em>entire </em>debt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>as a charge on the property then selling, was not only a <em>suppressio veri, </em>but a <em>suggestio falsi, </em>as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">If it be said, that this was a fraud only on them, of which the appellant cannot avail himself, I answer, that he will not be permitted to suggest that he committed a fraud on any one. The truth is, he did not intend any such thing; and a claim to this land is entirely an <em>after thought. </em>The security was abundant, at that time, independent of this land. That sale proved it; for he gave $ 1200 more than the debts of both the <em>Bells, </em>and all the other prior liens; so that, in reality, there was no necessity to encumber it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">But do the twenty acres in fact, join the four acres, so as to be said to join the town ? This seems to me to be very uncertain from the survey. There had been a <em>private </em>alley, not one belonging to the town, dividing them, and which had been established by prior owners; so that, if they do join, it can only be at <em>a point, </em>where that alley comes to the line; and even that is to be eked out by a supposexl mistake of chain carriers, &amp;c. so that I incline to think they do not join, even at <em>that point. \u25a0 </em>If resort is had to the large tract, in order to join these twenty acres to the town, it only serves to shew, as before slated, that if that was the intention, it was a description negligently or designedly too vague to affect a subsequent incumbrancer. But in fact, that is also an <em>after thought.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">But what does the deed itself say? After describing the 289 acre tract, not only by quantity, bounding, &amp;c. but the person from whom purchased, it proceeds to convey also, all the real estate held or in anywise belonging to the said <em>Imboden </em>and wife, in or adjoining the town of Waynesborough, together with the merchant mill, carding machine, distillery, dwelling house and barn, and the <em>lots of land </em>on which the said mill, &amp;c. are severally situated; to have and to hold the said <em>tract </em>of land, mill, distillery, &amp;c. and <em>lots of land herein-before mentioned, to be hereby granted and intended to be conveyed, fyc. </em>shewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>that the tract of 289 acres, and the <em>lots of land </em>on which the mill, houses, &amp;c. were <em>severally situated, </em>were the objects of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">All these circumstances convince me, that these twenty acres never were thought of at the time the deed was exe - cuted; and that even if they do join the four acres, as the party cannot now claim this land as a part of his trust fund, but by charging himself with a fraud on the Richmond creditors, he shall not be permitted to do so. If any person has a right to charge these lands against the appellant, it appears to me it is the Richmond creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On this, and without having fully made up my opinion on the other ground taken in the bill, in relation to this land, I am of opinion to reverse the decree, and perpetuate the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">As to the other matters, the bill ought to be dismissed, but without prejudice to any suit at law which the appellant may be advised to institute, as to any other subject conveyed to his trustee.</p>\n<author id=\"b606-6\">The President,</author>\n<p id=\"ASW\">delivered the opinion of the Court;</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The questions raised as to the waggon and teams, the stills and carding machines, more properly belong to a Court of Law than to a Court of Equity. As to the waggon and teams, whether they were embraced in <em>the </em>deed to <em>Poage, </em>and <em>Bell </em>responsible for their value, were questions proper to be determined in an action at law, by <em>Poage\u2019s </em>trustee against <em>Bell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">As to the carding machines and stills, if the3r were a part of the freehold, <em>Bell </em>purchased them under the sale by <em>Taylor, </em>and is entitled to them. If they were not a part of the freehold, he acquired no title to them by his purchase; and this question was also proper for the decision of a Court of Law, in an action by <em>Poage\u2019s </em>trustee against <em>Bell. </em>As to all these subjects,, the remedy at law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>was clear, adequate and unembarrassed, and a Court of Equity can entertain no jurisdiction of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">As to the land in controversy, whether it was included in the deed for the benefit of the <em>Bells </em>or not, was also a proper question for a Court of Law; yet the plaintiff has an equity as to this subject. He avers, that if it is included in the deed for the benefit of the <em>Bells, </em>they have no lien on it, since their debt was wholly extinguished by <em>Bell\u2019s </em>purchase from <em>Taylor, </em>the trustee of <em>Ellis \u00bfy Allan; </em>and the legal title, standing in the way of his remedy at law, <em>ought to ho removed by </em>a <em>Court of Equity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>As </em>to the question, whether <em>Bell\u2019s </em>purchase from <em>Taylor </em>was an extinguishment of his debt; if that depended on the precise words used by <em>Taylor, </em>in announcing the terms of the sale, there would be some doubt. The witnesses differ in their representations of his expressions; some saying that he exhibited a statement of <em>the </em>amount of all prior incumbrances on the land, including the whole of <em>Bell\u2019s </em>debt, amounting in all to upwards of $23,000, and declared that the purchaser was to pay tho. amount of these liens, and that the sum he bid was to be paid to the Richmond creditors. Others state that he said, after exhibiting the statement of prior incumbrances, that the property was sold subject to those incumbrances. But circumstances occurred, which shew that in whatever terms the sale was announced, it was the clear understanding of all parties, that the biddings were to be made upon the supposition, that the whole of tho prior incumbrances were to be charged upon the property in the hands of the purchaser. <em>Bell </em>himself and his trustee, made a statement of the amount of <em>Bell\u2019s </em>incumbrance, and during the biddings, told <em>Taylor </em>that he had estimated their lien at about <em>$ </em>500 too much; when <em>Taylor </em>observed, that it made no odds, as the purchaser took the property, subject to all the incumbrances, no matter what was their amount. Again: <em>Ellis Sy Allan </em>had (in order to give effect to an injunction, which they had obtained, to prevent <em>Bell\u2019s </em>trustee from selling, as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>had advertised, on the day that <em>Taylor </em>sold) paid to <em>Bell </em>$ 7000, on account of his lien. This $ 7000 was not credited, either in the statement made by <em>Taylor </em>or <em>Bell, </em>of the amount of <em>Bell\u2019s </em>lien on the land, and after the sale, was re-paid by <em>Bell </em>to <em>Ellis </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Mian, </em>together with the $ 13,000, the amount of his bid. These circumstances prove incontestably, that it was understood by the parties, that the sum bid was over and above the whole amount of the liens; and that the purchaser was to take the property, not subject to the legal effect of the liens upon it and other property, but subject to the whole amount-thereof. If not, why was a statement of the whole amount, without crediting the $ 7000, exhibited as a guide to the purchaser ? Why did <em>Bell </em>correct the statement; and especially, why did he re-pay the $ 7000, if the terms really were, that the purchaser was to take the property, subject only to the legal operation of the liens? He was not bound to re-pay the $7000, since that sum was not then a lien on the land. On the contrary, if the purchaser was to take the property, subject to the payment of the aggregate of the liens, on the principles adopted in making the statement, (that is, subject to the correction of errors of calculation) then he was bound to return the $ 7000, as that sum had made no part of the estimate. These facts ascertain the real understanding of the parties, no matter what were the expressions used. Both expressions testified to by the witnesses, were probably used under the impression, that they were equivalent to each other, as they certainly were, if no other property had been included in <em>Bell\u2019s </em>deed, than the property included in the deed under which the sale was made, and there is strong ground to believe, that at the time of the sale, none of the parties, especially <em>Taylor, </em>and <em>Ellis 8? Mian, </em>knew or believed that any property was conveyed by <em>Bell\u2019s </em>deed, which was not embraced in their own; otherwise, some estimate would have been made of the portion of <em>Bell\u2019s </em>debt, that was to remain a lien on that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In another point <em>of view, </em>this transaction necessarily extinguished <em>Bell\u2019s </em>debt <em>in toto. Bell </em>purchased nothing but <em>Imboden\u2019s </em>equity of redemption, subject to all the incumbrances except <em>Ellis $f Allan\u2019s. </em>This was all that the trustee was authorised by the deed to sell. He did not sell, nor did <em>Bell </em>purchase, the rights of <em>Ellis fy Allan. </em>The <em>$ </em>12,000 did not pay the full amount of their debt; and after crediting the proceeds of <em>Imboden\u2019s </em>interest in the property, he remains a debtor to them, and not to <em>Bell, </em>and they have a personal demand against <em>Imboden </em>for that balance. The transaction has the same effect precisely, as if <em>Imboden </em>himself (as ho did through his trustee Taylor) had sold his interest to <em>Bell, </em>subject to all prior liens, and had paid the money received from <em>Bell, </em>to <em>Ellis Sf Allan. </em>In that case, it could not be pretended that <em>Bell </em>could resort to any other property of <em>Imboden, </em>for the payment of any part of his debt; for if he could, for the same reason he would be entitled, and now is entitled, to claim the whole amount of his debt personally against <em>Imboden. </em>The whole is extinguished, or no part of it. The suggestion in <em>Bell\u2019s </em>answer,.that he is willing to submit to a re-sale of the property, is entitled to no weight. If there had been any fraud or mistake in the sale, this might be proper. There was none; and the Court is only called on to carry into effect, a fair and unobjectionable contract, which, if injurious to <em>Ellis fy Allan, they </em>alone have a right to complain. <em>Bell </em>does not stand in their shoes, or succeed to their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The decroo is, therefore, to be reversed, and <em>Samuel Clarke, </em>the trustee in <em>Bell\u2019s </em>deed, and also in <em>Poage\u2019s </em>deed, to be decreed to hold the legal title to the property in question, subject to the trusts in the latter deed. The bill should be dismissed as to other matters, and each party pay his own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
