Richards, </em>payable to his own order, and by him endorsed to <em>Nichols. </em>At the trial upon the general issue, a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-10\">The only question presented by the record is as to the competency of <em>Richards, </em>the drawer of the bill, to testify in behalf of the acceptors. They offered his deposition, which states, that there was an understanding between <em>Ford Sf Snyder </em>and himself, that he might draw on them for his accommodation j and that they would accept. That the bill in question, was placed in the hands of <em>Messrs. Cohen Sp Brothers, </em>to be sent to <em>Ford Sp Snyder </em>for their acceptance, and when accepted by them, to be placed in the hands of <em>Nichols; </em>and that <em>Nichols </em>was to raise money on the bill for <em>Richards\u2019 </em>accommodation <em>; </em>but that the bill was never discounted. It being conceded that <em>Richards, </em>whose deposition was offered, ivas the drawer of the bill on which the action was brought, and that the bill was accepted for his accommodation, the Court, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, excluded his deposition from the <em>jury; </em>whereupon the defendants excepted, and obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-11\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa8\">The idea of the Judge was, that if <em>Richards\u2019 </em>evidence defended <em>Nichols\u2019 </em>action, he <em>{Richards,) </em>would be answerable over to <em>Nichols, </em>in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>action brought by <em>Nichols </em>against him as drawer or as endorser, only for <em>the amount of the bill, </em>and not for the <em>costs </em>incurred by <em>Nichols </em>in the fruitless prosecution of the suit against <em>Ford Snyder, </em>the acceptors. Whereas, if <em>Nichols </em>succeeded in the suit against <em>Ford Snyder, </em>on their acceptance, <em>Ford Sf Snyder </em>could recover over against <em>Richards, </em>not only the amount of the <em>bill </em>paid by compulsion of law, to <em>Nichols, </em>but also the <em>costs </em>which <em>Nichols </em>had recovered of them, they having been subjected to the payment of those <em>costs, </em>(as well as of the debt,) by <em>Richards\u2019 </em>failure to do what he ought to have done, viz: to place funds in their hands in due time to meet their accommodation acceptance in his favour. From which it is apparent, that <em>Richards </em>is interested in the result of this suit, and interested in <em>Ford Snyder\u2019s </em>success, to the amount of <em>the costs involved in this suit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">The Judge decided on the authority of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>4 Taunt. R. 464. And this case and others, do unquestionably sustain the Judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">But on the other hand, this objection to the competency of a witness so situated, by reason of his being liable in one result to pay the <em>debt only, </em>to one party, and liable in the other result, to pay to the other party, not only the debt, but the costs, has been <em>overruled </em>in several English cases. The objection was made and overruled in <em>Ilderton </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>7 T. R. 480. The same objection was made and overruled in <em>Birt </em>v. <em>Kershaw, </em>2 East\u2019s R. <em>458; </em>and in <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Gingell, </em>3 Esp. R. 60, a witness was admitted as competent, who stood precisely in the situation of <em>Richards </em>in this case. There are other cases to the same effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">The two cases preceding the last named, overrule the objection to the competency, on the ground, that the witness (throwing the <em>costs </em>out of view,) stands indifferently between the parties, and that the policy of the law will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>not permit the entire suppression of his evidence on so small an objection as his liability for <em>costs </em>in one Court and not in the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3q\">Such being the unsettled state of the doctrine in <em>En-</em>it is for this Court to decide which set of cases is right, no case under the <em>lex mercatoria </em>having arisen in <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUR\">The counsel for the defendant in error insists that the decision was plainly right and ought to be affirmed. The drawer was interested to defeat the action, since if the holder succeeded against the acceptors, the acceptors would have the right to make the drawer pay not only the money but also all damages the acceptor's tnight sustain by being sued for it: the principle being that the drawer of an accommodation bill is bound to indemnify the acceptors against the consequences of an acceptance made for the accommodation of the drawer. On this ground the Court of Common Pleas held the drawer of an accommodation bill to be an incompetent witness for the acceptor in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>4 Taunt. R. 463. And this case has been since constantly followed. <em>Hardwick </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>5 Eng. C. L. R. 480; Starkie on Ev. part 4, p. 301 and p. 752. The same rule is acted on in other cases where there is an implied undertaking to indemnify, and where consequently the costs, if the plaintiff succeeds, will ultimately fall upon the witness. <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>15 Eng. C. L. R. 250; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Raine, </em>4 Rand. 386; <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>7 Cranch 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">The authority of the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>is recognized by the Supreme Court of <em>New York </em>in <em>Hubbly </em>v. Brown, 16 John. R. 70. And it is also recognized and acted upon in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>9 Watts\u2019 R. 144-5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">In the present case, the evidence offered is not only interdicted by the rule adopted in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the principle which the Court of Appeals laid down in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Raine, </em>but it is also forbid by the decision in <em>Gilliam </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>3 Leigh 590.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A9V_\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqnr\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
