Rittenhouse, </em>who had been indicted, and not tried, for feloniously breaking and entering a storehouse belonging to <em>Samuel Hamilton </em>and <em>James M. Nickle, </em>merchants and partners trading under the firm and style of <em>Hamilton Sf Nickle, </em>and stealing therefrom bank notes to the amount of seven hundred dollars belonging to the said <em>Hamilton Sf Nickle; </em>and who, previous to the said 27th day of August 1845, had been duly and regularly committed to the public jail of <em>Monroe </em>county, and was in the care, charge and custody of the said <em>William Connell, </em>jailor as aforesaid, to have in his possession a razor, and to keep said razor in the room where the said <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>was confined in the said jail; which was an instrument well calculated to enable the said <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>to cut the wooden part of said jail, by which he might make his escape from the said <em>jail; </em>and the said <em>James K. Rittenhouse, </em>on the said 27th day of August 1845, by the use of said razor, did cut the wood at one of the windows of said jail; and was thereby enabled to break the said jail; and did then and there break said jail, and make his escape from said jail, and from the custody of the said <em>William Connell, </em>in consequence of being improperly permitted by the said <em>William Connell </em>to keep a razor in the room where he was confined in said jail. So the jurors aforesaid, upon their oath aforesaid, do say that by the improper conduct of the said <em>William Connell </em>in permitting the said <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>to keep a razor in the room in which he was confined in said jail, and by failing carefully to examine at short intervals the condition of said jail, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>what the prisoner <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>was engaged \u2022 . at in said jail, as was his duty as jailor aforesaid, the said <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>was permitted by the said <em>William Connell </em>to make his escape from the jail of <em>Monroe </em>county, in manner and form aforesaid; to the great hindrance of public justice; to the evil example of all others in like cases offending, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-12\">To this indictment, the defendant, at the succeeding May term of said Court, pleaded not guilty, and a jury which was empanneled and sworn to try the issue, found the defendant guilty, and assessed his fine to seven dollars and fifty cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-13\">At a subsequent day of the term last aforesaid, the said defendant, by his attorney, filed a plea in arrest of judgment. Whereupon, the Court, with the assent of the defendant, adjourned the following questions to the General Court for its decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-14\">1st. Do the facts set out in the indictment constitute an offence, for which a jailor may be indicted ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-15\">2d. If they do, what judgment ought to be rendered ; for the fine, and removal from office of jailor ? Or for the fine only ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-16\">3d. If they do not constitute an indictable offence, is it such a violation of duty as would authorize the Judge to fine, and remove him from office, under the provisions of the 7th section of the act concerning jailors, and for other purposes ?</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b609-17\">Brown, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AE6a\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">If this were an indictment against the defendant as jailor, for negligently permitting a prisoner committed to his custody to escape, there could be no doubt but it would be good; as it is well settled that such an indictment can be sustained. But upon a careful examination of the indictment in the case at bar, the Court is of opinion, that it is not of that character. The facts charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>are, that the defendant as jailor, did suffer and permit <em>James K. Rittenhouse, </em>who was confined in his jail on a charge of felony, <em>\u201c </em>to have in his possession a razor, aQd t0 keep said razor in the room where he was confined and that he failed \u201c carefully to examine at short intervals the condition of said jail, and what the prisoner <em>James K. Rittenhouse </em>was engaged at in said jailand the escape set out in the indictment, is stated merely as a consequence of said act and omission, and not as an independent offence. If the indictment were for a negligent escape, these facts would have been proper evidence before the jury, for the purpose of sustaining that charge. But the Court is of opinion, that they are not of themselves indictable.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">This renders it unnecessary to answer the second <em>queer e.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">As to the third, the Court being of opinion that it does not properly arise in the case, declines responding thereto. All of which is ordered to be certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
