The answers controverted the claims of the plaintiffs to relief, either as creditors or purchasers: and controverted, too, the state of facts upon which the bill imputed fraud in the sale made by the sheriff to <em>Carr. </em>The state of the case, collected from the pleadings and proofs, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\"><em>Joseph Janney, </em>at April term 1820, of the Circuit Court of <em>Fauquier, </em>obtained awards of execution on two forfeited forthcoming bonds, against <em>Henley Boggess, </em>the principal debtor, and <em>Robert Singleton, </em>one of the sureties therein bound, but not against <em>Bailiss Grigsby, </em>another surety; the principal of the two debts amounting to \u00a3 1478. 10. 2., (equal to 4928 dollars 36 cents,) with interest and costs. And thereupon, in January 1821, he sued out two writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>returnable to April 1821, on which the sheriff made return that he had levied the executions <em>on fifteen slaves </em>and some horses, &amp;c., and not sold for want of bidders. Upon the day appointed for the sale of the property under the writs of <em>fi. fa., </em>there had been a treaty between the principal debtor and the creditor, for indulgence as to one half of the debt, but no arrangement was then made. <em>Janney </em>sued out writs of <em>venditioni exponas </em>on the 11th April 1821; under which the sheriff advertised the property for sale on the 15th May following ; when <em>Janney, </em>the creditor, and several persons, (among whom there were some negro traders,) attended, as did also <em>Caldwell Carr, </em>to whom his father, <em>Joseph Carr, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>had lent 2000 dollars, to enable him to effect some arrangement with the creditor, whereby the sale of the property, under the executions, might be prevented or postponed; <em>Joseph Carr </em>being the father, and <em>Caldwell Carr </em>the brother, of the wife of <em>Boggess </em>the debtor. Janney, on this occasion, offered to receive <em>one half </em>of his debt in cash, aud to wait twelve months for the <em>other half </em>but <em>Caldwell Carr </em>said he would have nothing to do with it, but on the terms which had been understood on the former sale day, without the consent of his father : upon which <em>James </em>Edmonds, the deputy sheriff, acting under the executions, asked <em>Janney </em>whether if he, (the deputy sheriff,) would pay him 2000 dollars, and the balance to make up <em>one half </em>of the debt within 60 or 90 days, he would give indulgence for the other half for twelve months; and <em>Janney </em>said he would do so, provided the sureties of <em>Boggess </em>would consent. The sheriff then borrowed of <em>Caldwell Carr </em>the 2000 dollars which his father had advanced him as above mentioned, gave his bond to <em>Joseph Carr </em>for that sum so borrowed of <em>Caldwell </em>Carr, and paid it to <em>Janney. </em>But one of Boggess\u2019 sureties in the forthcoming bond, <em>Bailiss </em>Grigsby, insisting that he was discharged from all liability for the debt, refused to give his consent to the indulgence ; and thereupon, <em>Janney </em>directed the sheriff to proceed upon the executions. The sheriff again advertised the property for sale on (it seems) the 11th June 1821, at which day <em>Janney's </em>attorney and several persons attended; but this sale was stopped by an injunction from the Superior Court of Chancery of <em>Frede</em>ricksburg, obtained by <em>Boggess. </em>Upon this the sheriff asked <em>Janney </em>how he was to get back the 2000 dollars which he had borrowed to pay him, and had paid him on the 15th May; to which <em>Janney </em>replied, that the sheriff might sell under his executions, at any time, enough of Boggess\u2019 property to pay that amount; <em>Boggess </em>consented to that <em>arrangement; Joseph Carr </em>in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>sisted on having his money returned to him; and the sheriff, during the summer, and while the injunction was still pending, sold <em>the fifteen slaves, </em>which had been taken under the executions, to <em>Joseph Can' </em>for the 2000 dollars; which was their full value. This sale was made at Boggess\u2019 own house; <em>Caldwell Carr </em>alone was present, and purchased the property for his <em>father; </em>and the slaves remained in Boggess\u2019 possession till the death of <em>Joseph Carr, </em>the purchaser, which happened in 1828 ; <em>Boggess, </em>however, giving his bonds for the hires thereof from time to time. The sheriff made his return on the writs of <em>fieri facias </em>and <em>venditioni exponas, </em>stating the fact of his sale of the fifteen slaves to <em>Joseph Carr, </em>iri the summer of 1821, on the 27th October 1828. And this is the sale which the bill impeaches as fraudulent and void as against <em>'Boggess'\u2019 </em>creditors. The injunction had been obtained by <em>Boggess </em>upon a bill filed in the name of himself and <em>Joseph Carr </em>against <em>Janney; </em>which was dissolved in May 1822. <em>Janney </em>then brought an action on the injunction bond against <em>Boggess </em>and his sureties therein bound, recovered judgment in April 1823, and sued out execution which was levied, and a forthcoming bond taken and forfeited. In this forthcoming bond, <em>Daniel Glasscock </em>and <em>William Penquite </em>were bound as sureties for <em>Boggess. </em>Execution was awarded thereon in April 1824 ; a <em>jft. fia. </em>was sued out for the debt amounting to \u00a3 919. 10. 1\u00bf., (equal to 3065 dollars 2 cents,) with interest and costs, and the execution was returned satisfied. The debt was paid by <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite, </em>the <em>sureties; </em>and it is on this transaction, (in part,) that the bill alleges that they became the creditors of <em>Boggess </em>entitled to impeach the sheriff\u2019s sale of the fifteen slaves to <em>Joseph Carr.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">There was another ground on which the bill alleges that they were the creditors of <em>Boggess. </em>In September 1821, <em>George Carson Sf Co., </em>recovered a judgment against <em>Boggess </em>in the Circuit Court of <em>Fauquier, </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>1294 dollars 27 cents with interest and costs, and sued out a <em>ji. fa. </em>in February 1822, which was returned levied, and a forthcoming bond taken and forfeited; in which bond <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>were bound as sureties for <em>Boggess. </em>Execution was awarded on this bond in April 1823; and a <em>fi. fa. </em>was shortly after sued out, which has never been returned. The bill alleges that <em>Glasscock </em>and Penquite, the sureties, paid this debt; but no proof of such payment appears in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-4\">In September 1823, <em>Boggess </em>conveyed a tract of 400 acres of land and sundry personal property to <em>Marshall Smith, </em>in trust, to indemnify <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>against their suretyship for <em>Boggess </em>to <em>Janney ; </em>and in July 1824, the whole trust subject was sold by the trustee to <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>for 4000 dollars. The bill alleges that this sale was only nominal; intended to give <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>the control of the property, that they might pledge it to borrow money to pay the debt they were bound for, which they did accordingly ; but the land was under a previous mortgage for more than it was worth, and so the deed of trust did not avail them as an indemnity. The answer insists, that the sale of the trust subject by <em>Smith, </em>the trustee, to <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite, </em>was a <em>real </em>transaction, and that they have thus received 4000 dollars of the money they now claim as due to them from <em>Boggess.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\"><em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>did in fact borrow the money to pay the debt due to <em>Janney </em>(4260 dollars) from <em>Joseph Carr, </em>and mortgaged all the trust subject they had bought from <em>Smith, </em>the trustee, under the deed of September 1823, together with some valuable property of their own, for the repayment of the money borrowed, and that debt has been paid to <em>Carr.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\"><em>Boggess </em>having remained in possession of <em>the ffteen slaves, </em>(with their increase,) which had been sold by the sheriif to <em>Joseph Carr </em>in the summer of 1821, from the time of that sale \u2019till <em>Carr's </em>death, sometime in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>1828, by deed dated 26th July 1828, conveyed all the \u2022 \u2022 slaves to <em>Josicth Tidball </em>and <em>Aquila </em>Glasscock, in trust, to indemnify <em>Daniel Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>for losses they had incurred, or were liable to incur as his sure-^es- But the trustees never executed or accepted the <em>deed; </em>it was made without their privity or assent; and they never took upon them the trust. Under this deed, the bill claims that <em>Glasscock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>were <em>purchasers, </em>and in that character entitled to impeach the validity of the sale of the slaves by the sheriff to <em>Carr </em>in the summer of 1821. But the bill does not allege that they were purchasers under the deed of the 26th July 1828, without notice of the sale under which <em>Carr </em>claimed. This deed was recorded on the 31st July 1828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-8\">On the same 31sf <em>July </em>1828, <em>Caldwell Carr </em>and <em>John Rust, </em>administrators of <em>Joseph Carr, </em>brought an action of <em>detinue </em>against <em>Boggess, </em>in the Circuit Court of <em>Fauquier, </em>for the slaves and their increase, and recovered judgment in September 1831. And having obtained possession of the slaves in question, under this judgment, they proceeded to distribute the same among the ten distributees of their intestate, the administrators themselves being both also distributees, and taking their shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">Afterwards, namely, at April term 1832, of the Circuit Superior Court of <em>Fauquier, Thomas W. GlassQock, </em>administrator of <em>Daniel Glasscock, </em>recovered judgment against <em>Henley Boggess </em>for 2381 dollars 71 cents, with interest from March 4th, 1830, and costs: and at the same term <em>Penquite </em>recovered judgment against <em>Boggess </em>for the same amount, with interest from the same date, and costs. <em>Glasscock\u2019s </em>administrator sued out a <em>j\u00f1. fa. </em>on his judgment, on the 2d May 1832, returnable to July rules ; which was returned <em>No effects ;o </em>and <em>Penquite </em>sued out execution on his judgment in May 1833, returnable to July rules following, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>was returned <em>No effects. </em>And they brought this suit in June 1836.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">The Circuit Superior Court of <em>Fauquier, </em>upon a hearing in October 1839, declared that the sale of the slaves to <em>Joseph Carr, </em>in the summer of 1821, though ostensibly made by <em>James Edmonds, </em>(the deputy sheriff,) was, really a sale made by <em>Henley Boggess; </em>and that the purchaser having permitted the slaves to remain in possession of the vendor, that sale was fraudulent in law and void as to the plaintiffs. Therefore the Court decreed that the defendants, distributees of <em>Joseph Carr, </em>should respectively render accounts of the slaves which they had respectively received in the distribution, and of the increase and profits thereof since the distribution. From this decree, <em>Carr\u2019s </em>adm\u2019rs applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-12\"><em>Leigh </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the appellants, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-13\">I. That there is no ground to impute <em>fraud in fact </em>to <em>Joseph Carr, </em>or any other party, in the purchase of the slaves by <em>Carr </em>from the sheriff in the summer of 1821.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-14\">II. That the plaintiffs cannot claim relief <em>as purchasers </em>under <em>Boggess\u2019 </em>deed of trust of the 26th July <em>1828; </em>because they do not even pretend, in the bill, that they took that deed without notice of the rights of <em>Carr, </em>under his purchase of the slaves in the summer of 1821 ; and it is only a purchaser without notice of <em>such a sale </em>that can be entertained in equity to impeach it as fraudulent against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-15\">III. That the plaintiffs cannot claim relief <em>as creditors </em>of <em>Boggess, </em>directly; because only such creditors whose rights have attached on the subject by judgment and execution sued out thereon against the vendor, before the vendee has got possession under his purchase that can impeach a sale, on the ground that possession did not accompany and follow the sale; and the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tiffs never recovered any judgment against <em>Boggess. </em>much more sued out executions against him, till after <em>Carr\u2019s </em>adm\u2019rs had recovered the slaves in question in their action of <em>detinue </em>against him, and obtained possession thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABR\">IY. That the plaintiffs cannot claim as <em>creditors </em>of <em>Boggess, by subrogation to the rights of Janney, </em>to whom, as <em>Boggess\u2019 </em>sureties, they paid the debt <em>Boggess </em>owed him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuF\">1. Because <em>Janney </em>had received the whole amount of the debt which <em>Boggess </em>owed him on his judgment and executions, and all <em>Janney\u2019s </em>remedies against <em>Boggess </em>had been thereby extinguished; so that he had no rights to which the plaintiffs can be subrogated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-7\">2. Because <em>Janney </em>received 2000 dollars of <em>Carr\u2019s </em>money, which was the full value of the fifteen slaves, and had no equity to insist that those slaves should still be held liable for the balance of the debt due him from <em>Boggess, </em>-as against <em>Carr, </em>who purchased the slaves for the very 2000 dollars of which <em>Janney </em>had got the full benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-8\">3. Because, if any body is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of <em>Janney, </em>it is <em>Carr, </em>and not the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-9\">Y. That .the sale made by the sheriff of the fifteen slaves to <em>Carr, </em>in the summer of 1821, was not a sale by the <em>sheriff ostensibly </em>only, but <em>really </em>by <em>Boggess, </em>as the Circuit Superior Court supposed; it was a sale made by .the sheriff with the assent and by the direction of <em>Janney, </em>and with the assent of <em>Boggess </em>also, to <em>Carr: </em>that is, with the concurrence of all the parties to the injunction suit brought to stay the <em>sale; </em>and so the injunction was no impediment to a sale in which all those parties concurred. That, in truth, <em>Carr\u2019s </em>vendors were the sheriff, <em>Janney </em>and <em>Boggess; </em>and, therefore, this is not a.case in which a <em>vendee </em>has permitted <em>the vendor </em>to remain in possession after.an absolute <em>sale, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>within the doctrine which declares such a transaction fraudulent <em>per se </em>as against the <em>vendor's </em>creditors : on the <em>contrary, it is </em>a case in which possession did, <em>in substance, </em>accompany and follow the sale; and that doctrine has been so modified by recent adjudications, that it is wholly inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-4\">VI. That for aught that appears in the record, <em>Glass-cock </em>and <em>Penquite </em>did receive 4000 dollars of the debt which <em>Boggess </em>owed them in the purchase by them of the trust subject mortgaged by the deed of trust of September 1823, from <em>Smith </em>the trustee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-12\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellees, insisted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-13\">1. That the sale of the fifteen slaves to <em>Joseph Carr </em>was fraudulent in fact; that is, it was intended to delay, hinder, and defraud <em>Janney, </em>the creditor, in the recovery of his debt. For conceding, for the sake of the appellants\u2019 argument, that it was lawful for the deputy sheriff to sell, with the consent of <em>Janney </em>and <em>Boggess, </em>so much of the property which had been levied on as was sufficient to raise the sum of 2000 dollars, and thus indemnify <em>Carr </em>and the deputy sheriff, who had paid so much to <em>Janney, </em>and <em>that </em>notwithstanding the injunction actually in force forbidding the sheriff to make such or any sale ; the sale so made ought to have been advertised and made by public <em>auction </em>(or bid over bid) as the law directs. And <em>this </em>in order to leave as large a quantity of property as possible subject to the payment of <em>Janney's </em>debt. The sale made was made without advertisement; without competition <em>between bidders; only-one </em>person was present who could purchase; consequently no sale by <em>miction, </em>or bid over bid: and it was obviously a sale of <em>studied privacy. </em>It is no sufficient evidence of the fairness of such a sale to prove that in the opinion of witnesses the price given was a fair price. The creditor had a right to the benefit of a competition among bidders, by means of which it is well known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>that property often sells above its estimated value. The law secured him the right, and it was a fraud on him to take away that right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-11\">2. The appellees deny that it is necessary that they, before they can legally impugn the sale, in their character of purchasers, should allege or prove that they were purchasers <em>without notice.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-12\">3. The appellees admit that they cannot impugn the sale as creditors of <em>Boggess, </em>\u201c directly,\u201d but they insist that <em>Janney </em>had a right, as creditor, before <em>Carr's </em>adm\u2019r reclaimed the slaves from <em>Boggess </em>by suit, to impugn that sale, and that they, having satisfied his judgment and execution, as sureties of <em>Boggess, </em>are substituted for him, and are invested by subrogation with all his rights and remedies. They deny altogether the doctrine that the payment, <em>by them, </em>of <em>Janney's </em>claim by judgment and execution, extinguished <em>quoad </em>them the sureties, the remedies to which he was before entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-13\">4. They deny the soundness of the doctrine set forth in the second specification of the fourth error assigned by appellants. <em>Janney </em>had a legal right, after and although he had received the 2000 dollars, and after this injunction was dissolved, to levy his execution (for so much as remained due thereon) on any property in <em>Boggess' </em>possession, which by the law of the land was subject to be levied on by any other creditor of <em>Boggess. </em>To the same right the appellees are entitled by subrogation : <em>i. e. </em>to <em>all his legal rights </em>and remedies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-14\">5. If <em>Carr </em>had a right by subrogation, as appellants allege, to sell <em>Boggess' </em>property, as <em>Janney </em>might have sold it, to the amount of his 2000 dollars, he <em>(Carr) </em>admits and insists that he did exercise that right and was satisfied. It is because he left <em>Boggess </em>in possession of the property, <em>after </em>he had purchased it, that <em>Janney </em>acquired a new right, in common with all other creditors by judgment and execution, to levy on it; and this right, the appellees repeat, they hold by subrogation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>6. The appellees insist that the sale was, as the Judge below decided, a sale by <em>Boggess </em>to <em>Carr, </em>and not a sale by the deputy sheriff to <em>Carr, </em>under the executions,</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaY\">It was not a sheriff\u2019s sale :</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AT7\">I. Because, during the pendency of the injunction, there <em>could be </em>no legal sale by the sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtsR\">II. Because, if it had been legal for the sheriff to sell, it was still essential to the validity of such sale that there should be an advertisement, which there was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-8\">III. There should have been a <em>public </em>sale and by <em>auction, </em>or bid over bid, which there was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-9\">7. The appellees deny that there has been any modification, as the appellees assert, of the doctrine of <em>Harben </em>and <em>Edwards, Hamilton </em>and <em>Russell, </em>&amp;c. &amp;c., which can protect <em>Carr\u2019s </em>claims to these slaves, left as they were by him in <em>Boggess\u2019 </em>possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-10\">8. They do not recognize the correctness of the notion that \u201c the sheriff, <em>Janney </em>and <em>Boggess </em>were the vendors of <em>Carr,\u201d </em>or the correctness of the inferences drawn from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-11\">9. They insist that there is abundant proof in the record of large payments made by the plaintiffs as sureties for <em>Boggess </em>to <em>Janney </em>the creditor by judgments and executions, and no sufficient evidence that those sums were repaid to the said sureties. The Court below was therefore justified in regarding the plaintiffs as creditors to <em>some </em>amount, so as to authorize it to affirm their right, as creditors, to impugn the sale of 1821. As to the amount due, the Court did not pretend to decide it, but merely directed an enquiry.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-12\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASq6\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The Court is of opinion, that the purchase by <em>Joseph Carr </em>of the slaves in controversy, in the summer of the year 1821, has not been successfully impeached on the ground of fraud in fact. It was <em>bona fide </em>and honestly made, for a full and fair price, at a sheriff\u2019s sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>property under an execution against <em>Henly Boggess, </em>for purpose of obtaining reimbursement of the sum of 2000 dollars, which had been advanced by said <em>Carr, </em>and paid over to <em>Joseph Janney </em>the creditor in the execution&gt; ^11 Part satisfaction thereof; and irregularities in the said sale, if any, did not affect the validity thereof; the same having been acquiesced in by both the plaintiff and the defendant in the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">And the Court is further of opinion, that it is unnecessary to decide in the present case, whether as a general rule, where possession does not accompany and follow a sale of personal property, the continued possession of the vendor is, in regard to creditors, to be treated as only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of fraud, and liable to be explained by satisfactory proof that the transaction was fair and <em>bona fide, </em>or is to be treated as conclusively fraudulent in law. If the latter proposition be true, it is not applicable to the present case, inasmuch as the alleged creditors acquired no specific lien upon the property by judgment and execution, before possession thereof was recovered by said <em>Carr\u2019s </em>adm\u2019rs in their action of <em>detinue </em>against said <em>Boggess.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the plaintiffs have no right as creditors to subject the said slaves in the hands of the representatives of said <em>Carr, </em>by subrogation to the alleged lien of said <em>Janney, </em>inasmuch as the said <em>Janney </em>had in truth no lien to which they could be subrogated. The lien which a creditor acquires by a levy of his execution upon personal property is, if not enforced by a sale thereof, only temporary; and expires with the authority to sell under the execution. And the said <em>Janney, </em>at no time after the purchase of said <em>Carr, </em>sought to enforce the levy of his execution, but abandoned the same altogether; and in fact the purchase of said <em>Carr </em>was with his assent, or at least his acquiescence; and the plaintiffs themselves allege that one of them, and the intestate of the other, afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>became the purchasers of the property, by their incumbrance from said <em>Boggess </em>of the 26th of July 1828.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">And the Court is further of opinion, that the plaintiffs have acquired no right as purchasers, by their said incumbrance of the 26th of July 1828, to subject the said property in the hands of the representatives of said <em>Carr, </em>because one of them, and the intestate of the other, had notice of the purchase of said <em>Carr, </em>at the time of taking said incumbrance. It is not pretended in the bill that they had not such notice, and the fact of such notice appears to the satisfaction of the Court from the whole circumstances of the case. But the Court does not mean to express an opinion as to the effect of such a notice in cases of sales fraudulent in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Court, therefore, without deciding whether it has been shewn that the plaintiff <em>Penquite, </em>and the intestate of the plaintiff <em>Glasscock, </em>were fair and <em>bona fide </em>creditors of, or purchasers from, said <em>Boggess, </em>is of opinion that the plaintiffs have not, in either character, established any right to the relief which they seek; and that the decree of the said Circuit Court is erroneous. It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed that the sanie be reversed and annulled, with costs. And the Court proceeding to render such decree as the said Circuit Court ought to have rendered, it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed that the bill of the plaintiffs be dismissed,' with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
