For, 1. though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>one who institutes a prosecution maliciously and without , . . , , . . probable cause, or who conspires with another to institute such prosecution, is liable to an action, in the one case for a conspiracy, in the other for malicious prosecution; yet to advise another to institute such prosecution, is not actionable. And 2. if to advise such a prosecution be actionable, it ought to be distinctly and expressly averred in the declaration, not only that the prosecution was malicious and without probable c\u00e1use, but that the advice to institute it was given without probable cause. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thelman, </em>3 Call, 3. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Gregorie, Id. </em>446. <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>2 Munf. 10. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Bussard, </em>Gilm. 9. Here, the declaration does not allege, that <em>Mowry </em>without probable cause, advised and procured <em>Zirkel </em>to institute the prosecution, but that he advised and procured <em>Zirkel </em>without probable cause, to institute it. The circuit court also erred, in admitting the record of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>acquittal in evidence at the trial. The day of his examination and acquittal was material; and the variance between the record exhibited, and that alleged in the declaration, in this particular, was fatal. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>4 T. R. 590. is directly in point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Leigh, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acy\">He who advises, procures and instigates another to a malicious prosecution, is the author of the injury j and it would be strange if an action will not lie against the real wrong-doer, but only against his instrument, who may perchance be innocent. Upon the general demurrer to the declaration, the court is to ascertain the substantial meaning of it. This declaration may not be drawn with the most perfect logical precision : but, seeing that it charges, that <em>Mowry </em>advised, procured and induced <em>Zirkel, </em>falsely and maliciously, and without any probable or reasonable cause, to institute the prosecution, it is an over nice criticism to say, that it does not mean, that <em>Mowry, </em>maliciously and without probable cause, instigated <em>Zirkel, </em>but only that <em>Mowry </em>(innocently) instigated <em>Zirkel, </em>maliciously and without probable cause, to institute the prosecution. The alie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>gation is distinct, that the prosecution itself was without pro- \u00b0 1 1 bable cause; which is enough. As to the variance between the record of the acquittal adduced, and the allegation of the acquittal; the declaration does not purport to recite the record, or to allege the acquittal with a <em>prout patei per recordwm: </em>the substantial part of the allegation is, that <em>Miller </em>was finally acquitted before this suit was brought. In <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>as I infer from the report, the declaration purported to set out the record of the acquittal, in form; otherwise, it seems strange, that the date of the acquittal, set out under a <em>scilicet, </em>should have been held material, the acquittal being alleged to have been, and having been in fact, before the action brought for the malicious prosecution.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b589-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATE\">The first objection in this case goes to the cause of action. It is said, that in every case for malicious prosecution the defendant is charged with active agency, and that an action for merely advising another to institute a prosecution, is not sustainable. For my part, I can conceive nothing more direct than the charge here. It is, substantially, a charge that the defendant maliciously and without probable cause consulted with, advised and <em>procured </em>one <em>Zir'kel, </em>falsely and maliciously and without probable cause, to prosecute the plaintiff for felony. This <em>procurement </em>is surely actionable. The language of the declaration corresponds with the form of declaring in an action on the case in the nature of an action for a conspiracy; and it was admitted in the argument, that the facts set forth, would be sufficient, if proved, in an action against two or more, to sustain such an action. If so, a charge of such advice and procurement by one, cannot less entitle the plaintiff to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">It is next objected, that from their connexion in the declaration, the words <em>without probable cause, </em>apply only to the act of <em>Zir'kel, </em>not to the advice and procurement of the defendant. The charges of malice, and want of probable cause, are reiterated, and stand in connexion with both. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Yet, in truth, according to my view of the matter, the ob- \u2019 \u2019 <em>\u00b0 J </em>, , . jection could not avad, if true, ihe law requires the plaintjff jn th\u00a1s action, to set forth that the <em>prosecution </em>was with<em>out probable cause. </em>But, as this is merely because no man can maintain an action for a malicious prosecution, where there <em>was </em>probable cause, it is obvious, that those words should be made to refer to the state of fact, as it respects the person prosecuted, and not to the degree of knowledge of that fact in the party prosecuting.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Then, as to the supposed variance. If the declaration had purported to recite the record of the prosecution, the variance might, perhaps, have been fatal. But that is not the case here. It merely alleges the <em>fact </em>that the plaintiff was acquitted on a particular day; it does not profess to recite the record. Now, the material and substantive part of the allegation was, that the acquittal was before action brought. The <em>date </em>was immaterial. The case of <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>which was cited as in point, has been overruled by the case of <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Macnamara, </em>9 East, 157. In this latter case, the action was for a malicious prosecution; the plaintiff alleged in his declaration an acquittal on a particular day, but without a <em>prout patet per recordum; </em>the record, when produced, proved a different day: but it was held, the precise day was not material, the substance of the allegation being that the acquittal was before action brought. This case has been since approved, in <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 435. 5 <em>Id. </em>964. 6 Com. Law Rep. 477. 7 <em>Id. </em>318.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We are, therefore, of opinion to affirm the judgement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
