General <em>Nelson </em>was in possession of the whole tract at the time of this conveyance; but he had purchased a part of it <em>(it did not appear what part) </em>from <em>James Harris, </em>who never made any conveyance thereof to iiirn : in this part, therefore, he had only an equitable title : in the residue, his title was complete. He died in January 1789. Iu December 1789, the trustees, in execution of the trust, sold the whole of <em>Bullfeld, </em>at auction, to <em>John Lyons; </em>and they put him into possession of it, but made him no conveyance, retaining the title (it seemed) as a security for the purchase money. <em>Lyons, </em>after continuing in possession of the land, for some time, sold it to <em>John Hopkins, </em>and put him in possession ; <em>Hopkins </em>undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to pay that part of the purchase money, which yet remained due and unpaid by <em>Lyons to Nelson\u2019s </em>trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aia\">Some years afterwards, <em>Hophins </em>and <em>Lyons </em>brought a suit in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>against <em>jjurwen, </em>now the only survivor of the trustees who had made the sale to <em>Lyons, </em>under general <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>deed of trust of December 1788, and the heirs of <em>Harris, </em>to compel those defendants to convey the legal title of the whole tract to <em>Hophins; </em>and the chancellor, by a decree in that cause, made the 1st September 1808, directed, that <em>Bur-well, </em>the surviving trustee, and the heirs of <em>Harris, </em>should, <em>with the assent of Lyons, </em>execute deeds of conveyance of <em>Bullfield </em>to <em>Hophins, </em>he defraying the expenses of such conveyances. A deed was accordingly prepared, purporting to be a deed between <em>Burwell </em>the surviving trustee and <em>Mrs. Nelson </em>the general\u2019s widow, and <em>Lyons </em>and wife, of the one part, and <em>Hophins </em>of the other, conveying the land in pursuance of the\" decree. This deed was dated, and executed by <em>Burwell </em>and <em>Mrs. Nelson </em>on the 2nd December 1810, and, as to them, was duly recorded in the county court of <em>Hanover </em>in June 1811; but <em>.Lyons </em>and wife, who had been made parties to the deed, in order to signify <em>Lyons\u2019s </em>assent to'the conveyance as required by the decree, never executed it till 1814, <em>Lyons </em>having till then remained exposed to a claim <em>o\u00ed Nelson\u2019s </em>trustees for a balance of the purchase money he had contracted to pay them, and which <em>Hophins </em>had thus long failed to pay. In 1814, the deed was duly executed by <em>Lyons </em>and wife, and recorded in the same court as to them.

As <em>Hopkins </em>had not any <em>legal estate </em>but only an <em>equity </em>in the land, at the time he executed the deed of <em>bargain and sale </em>of May 1808, therefore no legal estate passed by that deed to the trustees therein named; the deed conveyed only the equitable estate and the possession, which the grantor then had, for the security of the debt due to <em>Buchanan. Hopkins\u2019s </em>subsequent acquisition of the legal title did not enure to the trustees, so as to unite the legal to the equitable estate conveyed to them by the deed; for the <em>deed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>could act on the subsequently acquired legal estate the bargainor, and have the effect of vesting the legal estate in the bargainees, only by way of estoppel or rebutter ; but, as there was no covenant of warranty in the deed, there was no estoppel or rebutter. Harg. Co. Litt. \u00a7 446. fo. 265. a. b. note 214. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>14 Johns. Rep. 193. And, if in a suit between <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>trustees and <em>Hopkins, Hopkins </em>would have been estopped by his deed, from claiming the legal estate, yet, iu this case, between those trustees and <em>Doswell </em>(a <em>bona fide </em>alienee of <em>Hopkins </em>for valuable consideration) the deed can have no effect by way of estoppel to vest in them <em>Hopkins\u2019s </em>after purchased legal estate. The <em>only </em>doubt, whether a deed of bargain and sale without warranty can operate by way of estoppel to vest in the bargainee the bargainor\u2019s after acquired estate, has arisen in contests between parties or privies. <em>Rawlins\u2019s </em>case, 4 Co. 53.

If <em>Doswell </em>can be held to have had <em>notice, actual </em>or <em>constructive, </em>of the deed of May 1808, under which <em>Buchanan </em>claimed, before ho received his conveyance, and paid the purchase money to <em>Hopkins, </em>we admit <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>executors must prevail in equity. As to <em>actual </em>notice, we submit, upon the proofs in the cause, that <em>Doswell </em>was a complete purchaser <em>without any actual notice </em>of that deed. And the recording of the deed was not <em>constructive </em>notice to <em>Doswell. </em>Our statute of conveyances requiring the recording of deeds, is, in all essential particulars, like the english register acts concerning conveyances in <em>York </em>and <em>Middlesex, </em>2 and 3 Ann. ch. 4. 5 Ann. ch. 18. 6 Ann. ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>35. 7 Ann. ch. 20. 8 Geo. 2. ch. 6.

Now, under the english statutes, it has been uniformly held, that the registry of a conveyance no\u00bf <em>constructive notice </em>to a subsequent purchaser; for, that, although the statute avoids deeds not registered as against purchasers, it gives no greater efficacy to deeds that are registered, than they had before. <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Backhouse, </em>2 Eq. ca. abr. 615. pl. 12. <em>Le N'eve </em>v. <em>Le Neve, </em>3 Atk. 646. <em>Morecock </em>v. <em>Dickins, </em>Amb. 678. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Sorrell, </em>4 Ves. 389. <em>Bushell </em>v. <em>Bushell, </em>1 Scho. <em>&amp; </em>Lef. 90.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARv\">As to the 1st point, it is material to consider, that though <em>Hopkins </em>had only an equity in the land and the possession, at the time of his conveyance of May 1808, to secure the debt to <em>Buchanan, yet </em>he acquired the legal title from <em>JYelson\u2019s </em>trustees by their deed of December 1810, duly recorded in June 1811, <em>beforethe </em>date of his conveyance to <em>Doswell, </em>and even before that of the articles by which he covenanted to sell the land to him. He could sell <em>Doswell </em>no better right than he himself had; his assignee must stand in his shoes; it is impossible to withhold the legal estate from <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>trustees, in favour of <em>Doswell, </em>upon any principle, which would not equally withhold it from them in favour of <em>Hopkins </em>himself. Now, as between <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>trustees and <em>Hopkins, </em>the legal estate acquired by the latter enured to them : he could never claim the legal estate against his own deed to them, though that deed contained no warranty. Whether the deed might have operated strictly and technically as an estoppel, is immaterial; <em>he </em>was concluded by it. And <em>Doswell, </em>who purchased from him afterwards, was equally concluded. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 Johns. Ca. 90. 91. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>12 Johns.

In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>14 Johns. Rep. 193. tho point was probably very little con-<em>i \u2022&gt; &lt;/ </em>sidered, since it was no wise necessary to the decision of the case. Littleton, \u00a7 446. and <em>Coke\u2019s </em>commentary, fo. 265. a. cited and mainly relied on for the appellant, relates to the case of a disseisin, and a release to the disseisor by the son of tho disseisee, without warranty, in the disseisee\u2019s lifetime, and the right at the disseisee\u2019s death afterwards descending to the releasor; a case, in which the court would be most astute to avoid the effect of the release. The present case is a conveyance for valuable consideration, by <em>one </em>having the possession, with an equitable estate, and (it seems) the right to call for the legal estate. <em>Hopkins, </em>in May 1808, was, in a common law point of view, tho tenant at sufferance of <em>JYelson\u2019s </em>trustees; and by the conveyance in fee to secure the debt to <em>Buchanan, </em>he disseised them ; he assumed the legal estate, and it was his intent to convey it. What <em>Coke </em>says in Co. Litt. 47. b. concludes against the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel\u2014\u201cIf the lease be made <em>by deed indented, </em>then both parties are concluded ; but if it be <em>by deed poll, </em>the lessee is not estopped to say that the lessor had nothing at the time of the lease made. A. lessee for the lifo of B. makes a lease for years by deed indented, and after purchases the reversion in fee; B. dieth; A. shall avoid his own lease, for ho may confess and avoid tho lease, <em>which took effect in point of interest, </em>and determined by the death of B.\u201d <em>(Holt, C. </em>J. explains the reason in <em>Gilman v. Hoare, </em>1 Salk. 275). \u201c But, if A. <em>had nothing in the land, </em>and made a lease for years <em>by deed indented, </em>and <em>after purchased the land, </em>the lessor is as well concluded as the lessee, to say that tho lessor had nothing in the land; and <em>here it worketh only upon the conclusion, </em>and the lessor cannot confess and avoid as in the other case.\u201d \u201c <em>Ht videtur, that by purchase of the land, that is turned, into a lease in interest, tvhich before was purely an estoppel.

Whether his purchase was completed by the of the whole purchase money to Hopkins, before he got notice of <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>mortgage, is a question of fact to be determined by the evidence. Was the recording of <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>mortgage, supposing it to be, in its effect, a mortgage only of the equitable estate which <em>Hopkins </em>then held, <em>constructive notice </em>to <em>Dosioell </em>and all the world? The point is of general consequence, and of the utmost importance. I admit that the general course of decisions in <em>England, </em>upon the register acts, which are the law of only two counties, is, that the registry there is <em>not </em>constructive notice ; though in <em>Hine </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>2 Atk. 275. lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, that the register act \u201cis notice to the parties, <em>and notice to every body </em>; and the. meaning of this statute was, to prevent parol proofs of notice or no notice.\u201d Those decisions seem to me so contrary to the spirit of the statutes, that I cannot but impute them to the inclination of the courts to keep the law of the two register counties, as nearly conformable with the general law of the land, as the statutes would allow. We have not the reasoning on which the leading case of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Backhouse </em>was decided. In <em>Morecock </em>v. <em>Dickins, </em>Amb. 678. lord <em>Camden </em>disapproved the doctrine, and yielded to it only out of regard to the authority of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Backhouse, </em>and the course of decision following that case, and from apprehension of the mischiefs that might result in practice, from changing the rule; good reasons to determine Misjudgement, but not for <em>this </em>court. <em>Cruise </em>disapproves the doctrine, as contrary to the intention of the statutes ; Digest, 4 vol. title 32. <em>Deed. </em>ch. 28. \u00a7 16. p. 544. <em>Sugden, </em>too, doubts the propriety of the decisions; nay more, he thinks lord <em>Camden </em>erred in applying the doctrine of <em>Bedford </em>v. <em>Backhouse </em>to <em>Morecock </em>v. <em>Dickins. </em>.Law of vend. p. 509. In that case, <em>Wilson </em>being indebted to <em>Morecock, </em>and having taken a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>new lease of lands, it was <em>agreed by deed </em>that the lease ^ \u201c should stand as security for the debt due to <em>Morecock; </em>and this deed containing the agreement, was registered: after-wards, <em>Wilson </em>mortgaged the premises to Dic/cins, and delivered him the lease, <em>Dickins </em>having at the time no notice of <em>Morecock's </em>security: <em>Morecock </em>(like <em>Buchanan, </em>in our case) acquired only an <em>equity; </em>and <em>Dickins </em>(like Doswell) had a conveyance of the <em>legal estate. </em>Lord <em>Camden </em>reluctantly gave the preference to <em>Dickins; </em>and <em>Sugden </em>says (with good reason) <em>the case would not, perhaps, be deemed authority. </em>And this reluctant and questionable decision is the only authority directly in point, that has been, or perhaps can be, cited for the appellant. If our legislature had taken the policy of its enactments on the subject, from the english register acts, or copied the language of them, it might be reasonable that our courts should look to the settled and known judicial exposition of the english statutes, as a guide in the construction of our own : but as we did not borrow the policy from <em>England, </em>so we never adopted the language of the english statutes. The <em>first </em>act of the colonial legislature on the subject, was passed in the 14th year of <em>Charles </em>II. and tbe second, in the year 1705, which was the 4th of <em>Anne. 2 </em>Hen. stat. at large, 168. 3 <em>Id. </em>318. The next act, that of 1734, ch. 6. 4 <em>Id. </em>397. which explained the act of 1705, and placed the registry of deeds on the principle on which it now stands, was certainly not all copied after the model of the english register acts. The same remark applies to the act of 1748, ch. 1. 5 <em>Id. </em>408. and to all our subsequent legislation. Let the language of those early statutes, let the language of the revised statute of 1792 (which was the law in force when the mortgage to <em>Buchanan, </em>and the conveyance to <em>Doswell, </em>were executed) be compared with the english register acts; and let both be compared with the register acts of <em>Mew York: </em>it will be seen, that the language of all our statutes, is very different, certainly as different as that of the <em>Mew </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>YorJc </em>statutes, from the words of the english statutes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Now, chancellor <em>Kent, </em>in <em>Parkist v. Alexander, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 389. after quoting the language of the <em>JYew York </em>statute, said\u2014\u201c If it does not mean, that a <em>mortgage duly re-</em>shall be preferred to a <em>subsequent bona fide deed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>without notice, </em>it is senseless and idle, and worse than idle 5 it is delusive, and a snare to the unwary. No decision of the english courts upon the english register acts, <em>in which there is a variation in the language of the provision, </em>could indueo me to change my opinion on the construction of statute. I had occasion, lately, in the caso of <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Beekman, </em>(Id. 288.) to express the same opinion; and with me the point is absolutely at rest.\u201d And in both those cases, ho held that the registry of a mortgage was <em>constructive notice </em>to all the world. The court of errors of <em>Mew </em>York, indeed, had already decided the same point in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Stagg, 2 </em>Johns. Rep. 510. 524. where <em>Kent </em>said, \u201cThe provision in the act that no mortgage, unless duly registered, shall defeat the title of a <em>Iona fide </em>purchaser, shews the intent to be, that subsequent purchasers must take notice, at their peril, of all registered mortgages. This has been the received construction, and probably, the universal understanding on the subject.\u201d It \u201c has been the received construction, and probably, the universal understanding\u201d of the law of <em>Virginia, </em>likewise. It certainly was the understanding of the legislature that enacted the revised statute of conveyances of 1819, as is evinced beyond doubt by the new provision then introduced, that \u201c every title bond, or other written contract, in relation to land may be proved, certified or acknowledged, and recorded, in the same manner as deeds for conveyance of land; and such proof, acknowledgement or certificate, and the delivery of such bond or contract to the clerk of the court to be recorded, <em>shall be taken and held as notice, to subsequent purchasers, </em>of the existence of such bond or contract. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 13. p. 365. When the legislature made the registry of an executory contract to convey land, notice to subsequent purchasers, it surely entertained no doubt, and supposed there could be no doubt, that an actual conveyance or mortgage of the equitable estate of land, duly recorded, was notice to subsequent purchasers. Is no man to be safe in taking the mortgage of an equitable estate, while the naked legal title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>is Outstanding ? What more can a prior purchaser or mortdo, to warn subsequent purchasers, than to record his deed ? How can he give <em>actual </em>notice to every citizen of the state? How can he know who is in treaty with his ven^01. Qr mortgag0r, for the purchase of the subject? On the other hand, it is the business of every purchaser to search the records. In the present case, <em>Doswell </em>had only to look into the order books and deed books of the courts in which a conveyance of this land might be recorded, under the name of <em>Hopkins, </em>and the incumbrance would have appeared.

With respect to this, I shall only remark, that this technicality is met and neutralized by another, namely, that the deed contains no clause of warranty, and therefore works no estoppel. A deed of bargain and sale, like a release, passes no title which the bargainor had not at the time, yet if there be a warranty annexed, it will bar. \u201cFor albeit (as <em>Coke </em>says, Co. Litt. 265. b.) the release cannot bar the right. &amp;c. yet the warranty may rebut, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>bar him and his heirs of a future right that was not in him at the time; and the reason wherefore a warranty, which is a covenant real, should bar a future right is, for avoiding a circuity of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">Let us next inquire, whether <em>Boswell </em>is a purchaser with notice of <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>equitable lien, and the legal estate in his hands subject to the satisfaction of the debt due to <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>executors? Is the recording of a deed of trust, which gives a lien on the equitable title, such notice to a subsequent purchaser of the legal title, as will bind him ? 1 think not. The enrolment and registry acts of <em>England, </em>and our recording acts, are expressly declared to be made for the benefit of subsequent purchasers; to protect them from secret conveyances. These acts, then, ought not to be turned to the injury of those, for whose benefit they were made, unless it be in obedience to some express provision contained in them. But there is none such. They declare, that all deeds Stc. shall be <em>void </em>as to subsequent purchasers, unless duly recorded 5 but they no where declare, that such recording shall charge the subsequent purchaser with notice of the deed. If not recorded, the deed is <em>void </em>as to him; if recorded, it is only so far valid, that it passes to the bargainee the title it purports to convey, provided the bargainor had that title; if he had it not, the deed cannot pass it, though recorded 5 nor will the putting it on record affect the conscience of a subsequent purchaser of the legal title, nor, of course, charge that title with the equity which the deed raised between the bargainor and bargainee. The laws had no such intention, nor will their words bear such construction. That this is settled doctrine in <em>England, </em>there are many cases to shew. <em>Ld. Forbes </em>v. <em>Deniston, </em>4 Bro. P. C. 189. <em>Cheval </em>v. <em>Nichols, 2 </em>Eq. ca. abr. 63, 4. pl. 7. 1 Stra. 664. S.

In <em>Wrightson </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>sir <em>J. Jekyll </em>had decided, that the register act did not create constructive notice by the registry; jt avoided only prior charges not registered; and that though <em>Wrightson </em>might have searched the registry, he was not bound to do so. Upon this lord <em>Redesdale </em>remarks, \u201c Sir J. <em>JekylVs </em>opinion that the act did not create constructive notice by the^registry, appears to be sound. I know of nothing that compels a man to search the registry, more than to search the records of a court of any description.\u201d And he concludes his review by saying, \u201cThe effect of all these decisions is, that the registry cannot be considered as notice, with all the consequences that would attach upon it as notice; and if it were so considered, it would lead to very mischievous consequences.\u201d If we say, that the recording of a deed is constructive notice, it is on the sole ground that it is the duty of every purchaser to <em>search the records, </em>and that if he did so, he must see the deed. Now, suppose a deed put upon the record, without the proof and authentication required by law ? We know that this court has, in several cases, declared such deed to be, to all intents and purposes an unrecorded deed; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Stith, </em>1 Wash. 319. <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Donald, </em>2 Wash. 59. 64. Yet it is <em>upon the record, </em>and if the purchaser <em>searched, he would see it, </em>just as certainly as if it had been recorded upon the fullest proof; and- to be consistent, we must say, that he purchases with notice of such deed, and therefore is as much bound by it as the parties, between whom we know it is good though not recorded, because this deed, in violation of law, was put upon record. Thus, we dispense at once with a positive provision of the law, pronouncing such deed <em>void </em>as to the subsequent purchaser. This idea is clearly expressed by lord <em>Redesdale, </em>in <em>Latouche </em>v. <em>Dunsany, </em>1 Scho. &amp; Lef. 157. Speaking of the registry act, he says, \u201c If it be notice, it must be notice, whether the deed be duly registered or not; it maybe unduly registered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and if it be so, the act does not give it a preference; and . , . . thus this construction would avoid all the provisions m the act for complying with its requisites.\u201d Again in <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Ld. Courtown, 2 </em>Scho. &amp; Lef. 64. he says, \u201c It seems to me, that nothing could be more mischievous than to hold, that putting any thing on the registry, is notice, within the meaning of the word <em>notice </em>as applied to courts of equity in such cases.\u201d In the next page, he says, \u201c There is an important difference between <em>actual </em>notice and the operation of the register act. Actual notice might bind the <em>conscience </em>of the parties ; the operation of the act may bind their <em>title, </em>but not their conscience.\u201d From these cases, it appears that, for more than a century past, it has been settled law in <em>England, </em>that the mere putting a deed upon the registry, is not notice. Nor has the doubt (it is a mere <em>doubt) </em>thrown out by lord <em>Camden, </em>in <em>Morecock </em>v. <em>Dickins </em>in 1768, nor the distinction attempted by <em>Sugden, </em>p. 509. tended at all to shake this doctrine. It is admitted, that where the construction of an english statute has been settled by a series of decisions, and our legislature enacts that statute <em>in totidem verbis, </em>the construction must be considered as adopted along with the statute. To me it seems that this principle applies strongly to the case before us. Our statute is not a <em>literal </em>copy, but surely it must bo admitted to have been <em>substantially </em>taken from the english statute <em>2 </em>Ann. ch. 4. commonly called the register act; whiPh after describing the kind of conveyances to which it extends, and saying that memorials of them shall be registered in the manner directed, adds, \u201c <em>that every such deed or conveyance Sfc. shall be adjudged fraudulent and void, against, any subsequent purchaser </em>or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, unless such memorial thereof be registered, as by this act is directed, before the registering of the subsequent deed or conveyance.\u201d Our statute of conveyances, after directing the mode of recording &amp;c. provided, that <em>\u201c </em>all deeds of bargain and sale and other conveyances whatsoever of lands &amp;c. and all deeds of trust and mortgages, which shall here-? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>after be made and executed, <em>shall be void as to all credit\u00b0rs ledged or proved, and recorded, according to the directions \u00b0f this act.\u201d </em>It is impossible to look at these acts, without see\u00a1ng their exact similarity, as to recording and registering deeds. Our legislature (we must, in decency, suppose) knew that under the english law, the registering a deed had been settled <em>not to create notice: </em>if it had meant, that under our law it <em>should, </em>how easy to have added, that <em>the recording of every such deed, according to the directions of this act, shall be full notice to all subsequent purchasers. </em>It was insisted, however, that the legislature of 1819 believed, that the recording a deed did give notice to all the world; and this was said to be evinced by the 13th section of the revised statute of conveyances, which was added to our law at the late revisal. It directs title bonds and contracts in relation to land, to be recorded; and adds, <em>that such recording shall be taken and held as notice to all subsequent purchasers, of the existence of such bond or contract. </em>If this section proves any thing, it seems to me to prove, that the legislature did not suppose that bare recording (at least of bonds and' contracts) would operate a notice; else why add, that such recording should be <em>taken </em>and <em>held </em>as <em>noticed </em>It must have thought these words necessary to give to recording that effect; and if necessary as to bonds and contracts, equally so, assuredly, as to <em>deeds, </em>for there can be nothing in the nature of the instrument, to make a difference. <em>Why </em>it chose to leave the law with respect to recording deeds &amp;e. just as they found it in the former statutes, and to add, in the new section, that recording should be notice as to bonds and <em>contracts, </em>it is not for me to say. <em>We </em>must construe each section according to its actual words. From this review of the statutes, and the cases settling the construction of them, it is clear to me, that there is nothing in them, that imposes on the purchaser the <em>duty </em>of searching the records. Let us look at analogous cases. A private act of parliament, is not notice to a purchaser; Sudg. <em>and subsequent purchasers, unless they shall be acknow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>law vend. 535. 2 Ves. sr. 480. 3 Bos. 8i Pul. 57 8. t t . Decrees of courts of equity are not notice to a purchaser; Sudg. 538. Judgements are not notice, nor is the docketing of judgements of itself notice, to a purchaser; <em>Id. </em>539.</p>\n<p id=\"ACHl\">But, even if it were admitted to have been the duty of <em>well </em>to search the records, how far ought that search to be carried ? Assuredly, not beyond the period at which the legal title vested in the vendor. Suppose him to take the advice of counsel; he would call for the chain of title; he would examine the decree of September 1808, directing the title to be made to <em>Hopkins, </em>and the deed made in virtue of this decree of the 2nd December 1810 ; and seeing that the title of <em>JVelson </em>was by this deed conveyed to <em>Hopkins, </em>he would look from this date down to tho time of consultation, to see whether there were any incumbrances. This is all that could, with any shew of reason, be required of him : but this would never lead him to the deed of trust of May 1808, made by <em>Hopkins </em>to <em>Buchanan, </em>and purporting to convey the <em>legal estate, </em>when <em>Hopkins </em>had no such estate in him ; and to impute to him a notice of this, because it was put on record, seems to me wholly inconsistent with equitable principles <em>generally, </em>or the particular ground of favour, on which a fair purchaser stands in that <em>forum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">But though we should decide, that the recording the deed of trust, was no notice, it still remains to inquire, whether <em>Doswell </em>has shewn himself a <em>complete </em>purchaser for value before notice. To constitute him such, J consider that the deed must be executed, and the <em>money all </em>paid, before notice. Sugden, p. 530, lays it down broadly, that \u201c notice before actual payment of <em>all </em>the <em>money, </em>although it be secured, and the conveyance actually executed, or before the execution of the conveyance, notwithstanding that the money be paid, is equivalent to notice before the contract.\u201d And these positions seem fully supported by the cases (which I have carefully examined). <em>Tourville </em>v. <em>Naish, </em>3 P. Wms. 307. <em>Story </em>v. <em>Ld. Windsor, </em>2 Atk. 630. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mayhow, </em>2 Freem. 175. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>3 Eq. ca. abr. 685. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>pl. 9. <em>Wigg </em>v. <em>Wigg, </em>1 Atk. 384. We know, that the plea of purchaser for value without notice, if sustained, is a perfect defence; and that against such purchaser, equity will not take the slightest step, not even to perpetuate evi\u00bf[ence against him, or to take from him any advantage the law gives him ; <em>Jerrard </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>2 Ves. jr. 454. But it is equally clear, that this plea is a complete defence, or no defence at all. \u201c It must aver a <em>conveyance, </em>and not articles merely\u2014it must aver the consideration, and actual payment of it; a consideration secured to be paid, is not sufficient.\u201d Mitf. plead. 215,16. It must also deny notice of the plaintiff\u2019s title to a claim, previous to the execution of the deeds, and payment of the consideration. <em>Hardingham </em>v. <em>Nicholls, </em>3 Atk. 304. A plea averring <em>that the money was paid or bona fide secured to be paid, </em>was overruled. In 2 Newland\u2019s equity, 145, and also in Beame\u2019s pleas in equity, 347, we have forms of the plea of purchaser without notice, at full length; and they set out the purchase, the sum to be given, the estate purchased &amp;c. and positively aver, that the deed was executed, and the whole sum paid, before notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. If they fail to do this, the plea is overruled as insufficient; for in pleading, there is the same strictness in equity as at law. If the plea is found to be good in law, issue is taken on its truth, and the defendant must prove the facts, which he has been held to allege; which if he does, the plea is a complete bar; but if he does not, he loses all benefit of the plea. Under this view of the case, I cannot see how a defendant can, in the character of purchaser without notice, avail himself of payment of a <em>part </em>of the purchase money, though paid before notice, and have a decree of the court, that such payment should constitute a lien on the land: it is not at all within the issue : it does not make him a <em>purchaser without notice: </em>and without this, he cannot interfere with the prior lien. Suppose, instead of <em>part, </em>he had paid the <em>whole </em>of the purchase money, but got notice before he had a deed; he would, surely, have as much right to have the <em>whole, </em>as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number><em>part, </em>made a lien on tho land ; and this being the full value of the land, would wholly disappoint the prior incumbrancer. I am clearly of opinion, therefore, that <em>Doswell </em>must shew, that he had paid the <em>whole </em>consideration before notice, in order to protect his purchase. This I do not think has been so clearly proved as to authorize a dismission of the bill. And I am finally of opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and the cause sent back to be referred to a commissioner or a jury, to inquire, whether <em>Doswell </em>had paid <em>all the purchase money, </em>before notice of <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>mortgage; the final decree to be governed by the principles laid down.</p>\n<author id=\"b407-4\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AafX\">If the defence made by <em>Doswell, </em>that he was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from <em>Hopkins, </em>without notice of <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>lien, and that he had fully paid the purchase money before he received actual notice of that lien, had been supported by clear proof, I should have thought the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed. In that case, it is not necessary to prove that the purchaser has actually procured a <em>perfect legal title, </em>in order to protect himself against any relief against him in a court of equity, whose maxim is, that it will act in no way against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice, to expose even his want or defect of title, and, in short, will not permit any inquiry to be there prosecuted in respect to the particulars or lawfulness of his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I think it clear, that a recorded deed is no notice to a subsequent purchaser, which can affect his conscience in a court of equity, both upon the authorities cited, and the plain import of our statute. For it adds nothing to the strength of any deed, that it is recorded; but it only takes away the force which a deed would have had, but for the provision of the statute requiring deeds to be recorded, if they be not recorded as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">If <em>Boswell\u2019s </em>defence had been fully supported by proof, it would have protected him completely against the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of a court of equity, until the trustees for <em>Buchanan </em>had actually recovered the land conveyed by <em>Hopkins </em>to them, in an action at law; in which case, the .impediment to the sale by the decree of the court of equity, would be removed, jjut the evidence leaves it in some degree of doubt, whether <em>Boswell </em>had paid the <em>full </em>amount of his purchase money, before he received notice of <em>Buchanan's </em>claim. My impression is that he had ; but the proofs are not sufficient to justify a judicial decision that he had. And this fact, I think, should be inquired into by a reference to a commissioner before a final decree, and if found to be as alleged by <em>Doswell, </em>the bill dismissed; if not, relief given to the plaintiffs, according to the result of that inquiry.</p>\n<author id=\"b408-4\">Cabell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">I shall not inquire, whether the deed from <em>Hopkins </em>to <em>Boswell, </em>passed the legal estate of the whole of <em>Bullfield </em>to him; I shall proceed upon the admission that it did so. And, then, this case presents the question, never before directly submitted to this court, Whether, as the law was before the late Tevis'al, a person purchasing without notice, and obtaining the legal title, shall be prejudiced by a prior deed of trust or mortgage of the equitable estate, which was duly recorded previously to his purchase ? It is admitted, on all hands, that <em>actual </em>notice of a prior deed of trust or mortgage, will bind a subsequent purchaser; and there is, certainly, no difference between <em>actual </em>and <em>constructive </em>notice, -in its consequences; Sugd. law vend. <em>532. </em>The question, therefore, is narrowed down to this: Is the due recording of an equitable deed of trust or mortgage, of itself, <em>constructive </em>notice of that deed, to a subsequent purchaser ? After much reflection, I have come to the opinion that it is. Constructive notice, or (as it is sometimes called) notice by construction of law, is defined to be, <em>\u201c </em>no more than evidence of notice, the presumptions of which are so violent, that the court will not even allow of its being controverted; <em>per Byre </em>C. B. in <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Fluitt, 2 </em>Anstr. 438. Sugd. 533. Thus, notice to an agent, is notice to <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>principal. But there is one kind of constructive notice, which has a very extensive operation : it is, \u201c where the law imputes that notice, which, from the nature of the transaction, every person of ordinary prudence must necessarily liave;\u201d and the reason of it is forcibly expressed, \u201c the titles of other men ought not to be shaken, by creating a title vested in a third person through his own <em>follyper </em>lord <em>Erslcine, </em>in <em>Hiern </em>v. <em>Mill, </em>13 Ves. 120. 121. This principle has been repeatedly recognized, and acted upon. I refer to <em>Ferrars </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>2 Vern. 384. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Stibbert, </em>2 Ves. jr. 437. <em>Hill v. Simpson, </em>7 Ves. 152. [ think this principle applies to our statute requiring deeds of trust and mortgages to be recorded, and should guide us in the construction of it. The great object of the statute, is the benefit of creditors and subsequent purchasers, by enabling them to know whom to trust, and from whom to purchase. Every man is presumed to know the law; particularly a law made for his special benefit. <em>\u201c </em>Every man of ordinary prudence,\u201d about to purchase from another, searches the record, to see whether the property has been previously conveyed or incumbered. It is gross negligence not to do so. He who fails to do it, wilfully shuts his eyes against the truth, and ought not to be permitted to avail himself of his ignorance. So far from having equal equity, with a former <em>bona fde </em>incumbrancer, whose deed is duly recorded, he has no equity at all. In the language of lord <em>Erskine, \u201c </em>the titles of other men ought not to be shaken by creating a title vested in him, through his own folly.\u201d I shall only add, that a contrary decision would tend greatly to encourage perjury; for a man may actually have searched the register, and then deny it, without danger of its being proved upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">I am well aware, that this principle has not been applied to the register acts in <em>England, </em>and that the registry of a deed <em>there </em>is not held to be constructive notice. I admit also, that I do not perceive any substantial difference between the english register acts and our statute requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>deeds of trust and mortgages to be recorded; though it is v manifest, their phraseology is widely different. Neither the english statute nor our\u2019s says any thing, in express terms, as to the effect of registering or recording deeds, while they (jecjare} \u00a1n express terms, what shall be the effect of a <em>failure </em>or <em>omission </em>to register or to record. But the question necessarily arises, what is, on general principles, the effect of putting a deed on the register in <em>England, </em>or on the record here ? It has been decided in <em>England, </em>as I have just said, that it does not operate as constructive notice. Does it follow, that we must give the same construction to our statute? I humbly think not. We have, it is true, adopted the common law of <em>England, </em>as the law of this country; and there is nothing which I should consider more authoritative evidence of what that law is, than the decisions of the english judges, upright and eminently learned as they unquestionably are. I should also pay the highest respect to their construction of english statutes, which were in force prior to the 4th year of James I. and which were adopted by the convention of 1776, along with the common law. I will go farther, and say, that, when english statutes of a subsequent date, having been expounded by the english judges, in a long course of uniform opinion and adjudication, have afterwards been adopted into our code, in the very words in which they were originally enacted, I should think it wrong in our courts, to give them a different interpretation ; because it ought to be inferred, that the legislature, in adopting the very words of an english statute, intended to adopt the interpretation that had been given to them in the country from which it was copied. But that is not the case in the present instance. These statutes are of modern date; they have not been copied by our legislature; and the correctness of the interpretation given, in <em>England, </em>to the english statutes, has been more than doubted by some of their profoundest judges, and ablest writers. We find that lord <em>Camden, </em>in <em>Morecock </em>v. <em>Dickins, </em>adhered to the former interpretation, in opposition to his own opinion, merely be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cause it <em>had leen </em>so decided, and because it would be mis- . . cinevous to disturb it, since it had given occasion to a thousand neglects to search the register. It is clear that, in his opinion, the registry of a deed, ought, on general principles of equity, to be constructive notice, notwithstanding the statutes had not, in terms, said so. The reasons assigned by him, were abundantly sufficient to justify, and even to require him, to disregard his own opinions, and to adhere to the interpretation given by preceding decisions. But no such reasons exist here : no former decisions on our statute, have produced neglect in purchasers: no former decisions trammel us in the exercise of our judgements. We may, without injury to any body, pursue general principles to whatever just result they may conduct us. For, the construction of our statute is now directly submitted, for the first time. My opinion upon it, has been stated. 1 cannot say what has been the general understanding, in <em>Virginia, </em>upon this subject. But I think it manifest, that the legislature at the late revisal, entertained the same opinion that I have expressed, as to the effect of recording deeds of trust and mortgages, under the former law upon that subject: for it adopted the former law as to the recording of <em>such </em>deeds, without saying any thing as to what should be the effect of their being recorded : but, when it introduced the <em>new </em>provision, declaring \u201c that <em>title bonds </em>or other written <em>contracts </em>in relation to land may be proved, certified or acknowledged, and recorded, in the same manner as deeds for the conveyance of landit went on to add, that \u201c such proof, acknowledgement or certificate, and the delivery of such bond or contract to the clerk of the proper court to be recorded, <em>shall be taken and held as notice to all subsequent purchasers, of the existence of such bond or contract.\u201d </em>Now, it is obvious, that this section was not intended by the legislature to embrace the case of mortgages and deeds of trust, for they had been acted on in the former parts of the act: it related to <em>contracts, </em>not to <em>conveyances, </em>such as mortgages and deeds of trust. This section shews, and indeed ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>pressly declares, that the recording of a <em>mere contract </em>concerning land, shall be notice of its existence. Yet, when we advert to the sections concerning the recording of mortgages and deeds of trust, we find no provision as to what shall the effect of their being recorded. Whence this omission ? Surely, not because their being recorded ought not to be notice, equally with'the recording a mere contract, but solely because the legislature entertained no doubt, that the law was always so, in relation to deeds of trust and mortgages. If it had entertained doubt about it, it would, when speaking of recording mortgages and deeds of trust, have taken care to remove that doubt by declaring in express terms, (as it did in relation to <em>title bonds </em>and <em>contracts), </em>that their being admitted to record, should be notice of their existence, to all subsequent purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">I am of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AnU\">If, however, I had concurred with the other judges, as to . the effect of recording the deed of trust, I should then have been of opinion, that <em>Doswell </em>ought to be protected, not only in casp of his having paid the whole of the purchase money, before he received actual notice of the existence of the deed, but, in case he had made only partial payments before such notice, that he should be protected to the extent of such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">I have only to add, that I regret that a case involving a principle of such vast importance, should have come before a bare court, and that the division of the court should leave the community in doubt, as 'to what the law is on this interesting subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
