But the decree did not direct <em>John Ruff </em>to give security for the return of the slaves upon the termination of the life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">In December 1839, the administratrix of <em>Starke </em>filed her bill in the Superior Court of <em>Augusta </em>county, to review the decrees of the 10th of June and the 22d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>November 1833, for error on the face of the decrees. And she insisted that the true construction of the agreement of January 1833, was, that only her interest in her individual right in the slaves was conveyed to <em>Ruff, </em>and that she did not execute the agreement as administratrix of <em>Starke. </em>She alleged that <em>Ruff </em>had received a large sum from the hires of the slaves in the lifetime of <em>Mrs. Varner, </em>above what was necessary to satisfy the claim of <em>Morris; </em>and making <em>John Ruff </em>a party defendant, she prayed that said decrees might be reversed, and that <em>Ruff </em>might be compelled to render an account of the hires of the slaves received by him up to the time of <em>Mrs. Varner\u2019s </em>death; aud that after satisfying the amount due on <em>Morris\u2019 </em>claim, he might be compelled to pay over to her as the administratrix of <em>Wyatt Starke </em>the balance of said hires; after deducting therefrom the portion which would have been coming to herself; which she admitted passed by said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-11\"><em>Ruff </em>demurred to the bill, but the Court overruled his -demurrer. He then filed his answer, in which he controverted the construction of the agreement insisted on by the plaintiff; and relied upon the former decrees in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and also upon the statute limiting the time for filing bills of review to three years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-12\">The cause came on to be heard finally in November 1840, when the Court being of opinion that <em>Ruff, </em>as the agent of the Court to hire out the slaves, stood in a fiduciary relation to the subject of the contract, and therefore the principles which forbid the purchase of a trust subject by the trustee, applied to his contract with <em>Mrs. Starke, </em>annulled the decree of the 10th of June 1833, so far as it related to that contract, and made a decree against <em>Ruff </em>for the sum of 460 dollars 24 cents, with interest on 366 dollars 34 cents, from the 18th of March 1836, and on 93 dollars 90 cents, from the date of the decree, that being the amount received by him for the hires of the slaves in the lifetime of <em>Mrs. Var</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ner, after fully satisfying the claim of <em>Mori'is. </em>From this decree, <em>Ruff </em>applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-5\">Cooke, for the appellant, aud</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-6\"><em>Stuart, </em>for the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-7\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amde\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">This Court is of opinion, that the decrees of June 10th, 1833, and November 22d, 1833, disposed of the subject of controversy, so far as the representatives of <em>Wyatt Starke </em>aud <em>Levi Morris </em>were concerned; aud uo further action of the Court was necessary or contemplated iu relation to their interests involved in the suit. The only subject left undisposed of by said decrees was the prayer of the plaintiffs in the original bill, for security that the slaves should be surrendered to them by the then holders thereof, on the death of the tenant for life. Aud as by the agreements between <em>John Ruff, </em>and the administratrix of <em>Wyatt Starke </em>and <em>Levi Morris, </em>and the effect of said decrees, their interests respectively, in said slaves, and the accruing hires, were transferred lo, and vested in said <em>Ruff; </em>and he had taken possession of said slaves, the original plaintiffs, <em>Jacob Ruff\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, would have been entitled to security from said <em>John Ruff </em>for the surrender of the slaves on the death of the tenant for life. But as the slaves had been removed from the county of <em>Kancmha </em>to the county of <em>Rockbridge, </em>where the executors resided, and from which latter county the female slave had been originally removed, and the said <em>John Ruff </em>was one of those entitled in remainder, these circumstances may have been deemed a sufficient reason for dispensing with the security prayed for in the original bill from strangers to the family, residing in a distant county and asserting an adverse claim to the slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The omission of the decrees to give such relief as the original bill prayed for, was therefore no doubt owing to the facts aforesaid. No such security was provided for or contemplated when said decrees were rendered, and the omission to give such relief did not the less render said decrees final. The error, if it existed, was one of which the said executors could alone complain, and they have acquiesced.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">The Court is further of opinion, that as the bill of review in this case was not filed until the 1st December 1839, more than five years after the decree of 22d November 1833, the same should not then have been received ; and the objections to the filing thereof taken by way of demurrer to the bill, plea of the former decree, and statute of limitations, should have been sustained. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the Court below erred in entertaining the bill of review ; and in proceeding to review and reverse the decrees made on the 22d November 1833, or the 10th of June 1833, or either of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Decree reversed with costs, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
