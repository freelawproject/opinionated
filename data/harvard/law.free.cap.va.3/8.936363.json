I wish the said <em>James Gilbert </em>to enjoy the benefit of his labour, but always to be under the control and direction of my executors and trustees.\u201d That, in a subsequent part of the will, the testator directed all his personal estate and lands to be divided among his children, <em>excepting said James Gilbert, </em>and all his slaves to be valued, <em>excepting said James Gilbert, </em>of whom he made no other or further disposition than as above mentioned. And that the plaintiff was the same person mentioned in the will by the name of <em>James Gilbert. </em>And the jury referred the question to the court, Whether, upon this state of the case, <em>Gilbert </em>was entitled to his freedom ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">The county court gave judgement that he was. <em>Rucker\u2019s </em>administrator appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the judgement; and then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-6\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant, cited</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AE\"><em>Walthall\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Robertson and others, </em>2 Leigh, 189.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-7\"><em>JYicholas, </em>assigned counsel for the pauper,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV\">said, that the judgement, in a doubtful case ought to be <em>in famrem liber</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>tatis ; </em>and he endeavored to maintain, that the main intent the testator in regard to this man, to be collected from the whole will, was to emancipate him, and that the other provisions respecting him, ought to be held subservient or subor\u00bf\u00a1nate t0 the ma\u00a1n \u00a1ntent. He insisted, that the court ought to look to the main intent, and give it effect if consistent with the law. He said, the words <em>willing and </em>desiring, in a will, have always been held to create a trust for the person in whose favour the <em>will and desire </em>are expressed. <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Glyn, </em>1 Atk. 470. Sanders\u2019 Edi. note 1. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Amey, </em>1 Leigh, 467. This testator expressed \u201chis will and desire that his man <em>Gilbert </em>should be freeand throughout the will, there was no disposition made of <em>Gilbert, </em>as <em>property. </em>The emancipation of the man was the testator\u2019s main object, as well as his wish: but -finding that there was a difficulty in his remaining in <em>Virginia, </em>he proceeded to make a provision for his subsistence and comfort, supposing he should remain here; and, as this provision was perfectly consistent with, and indeed auxiliary to, the main object, the court ought not to allow it such an effect as to defeat the main intent. That provision was a devise of land to the man he had before <em>willed and desired </em>should be free; a devise of land, which he could not hold unless he was made free: therefore, this very provision of itself implied an emancipation, instead of operating to defeat the <em>will and desire </em>to emancipate before expressed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b34-4\">\"Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AsW\">The question of freedom or slavery in <em>this </em>case, depends on the construction of <em>the </em>two clauses in <em>Ruc'ker\u2019s </em>will, set out in the special verdict. No doubt the intention of testators must always be carried into effect, if consistent with the rules of law. But the question is, Whether this testator did intend, that at his death <em>Gilbert </em>should be a free man ? If he did, the provisions in the will are very inconsistent. He says, \u201c it is my will and desire that my mulatto man <em>James Gilbert should </em>be free if he had stopped here, there would have been no doubt, that <em>James </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Gilbert </em>would have been free; and here he <em>would </em>have stopped, if he had simply intended to emancipate him: <em>\u201c </em>but finding\u201d fas he says) <em>\u201c </em>there would be some difficulty \u00b0 ' / . . for it to be so, and for him to remain here, that is, as a <em>freeman, </em>he does not desire his executors to remove that difficulty, by sending him out of the state, but desires them to lay off three acres of land, which he is to have <em>on good behaviour; </em>certainly not as a freeman, because as such he could impose no such condition upon him; nor could he, as he has done in the last member of the clause, subject him to the control and direction of his executors, in the character of a freeman. However much the testator desired that <em>Gilbert </em>should be free, it was very clear, that he was deterred by the difficulties which the law presented with respect to residence here; and, under the circumstances, determined to do what he considered next best for him; to settle him for life on a piece of land, there to enjoy the fruits of his own labour.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Both judgements are to he reversed, and judgement entered for the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
