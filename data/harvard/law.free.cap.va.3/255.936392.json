Verdict and judgement for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-8\">At the trial, the defendant filed a bill of exceptions to a direction given by the court to the jury, from which it appeared, That before the marriage of the plaintiffs\u2019 testator, <em>Jacob Faulkner, </em>with the defendant <em>Sarah, </em>in August 1811, marriage articles were entered into between them, whereby it was agreed, that during their joint lives, they should enjoy the estates of each other jointly, but their estates should be kept separate and distinct from each other, and that the property then belonging to each should be under the management and control of the party it belonged <em>to; </em>and, in case the husband should survive, he should not have or claim any part of the wife\u2019s estate, real or personal, by virtue of the marriage or otherwise; and, in case the wife should survive, she should not have or claim any part of the husband\u2019s estate, real or personal, as his widow or otherwise, nor be entitled to administration of his estate. That, among the property of the wife before the marriage, secured to her by the articles, was a sum of money, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>after the marriage, came into the hands of the husband; and . <em>9 </em>part of this money was laid out in the purchase of the chattels demanded in the declaration. That the husband, in his lifetime, admitted and declared, that these chattels so purceased with the wife\u2019s money, were her property; but he held possession of them during his life, and died in possession thereof; his wife took possession after his death. That, after the purchase of this property, there was still a balance of the wife\u2019s money in the husband\u2019s hands, which he held till his death; and by his last will and testament, besides giving her some property of his own, he bequeathed as follows\u2014\u201c I give to my wife <em>Sally </em>every species of property with the <em>increase </em>thereof which I received with her, also my negro girl <em>Celia </em>in lieu of 300 dollars of her money, which I have made use of.\u201d And proof of these facts having been laid before the jury, the court, on the motion of the plaintiffs, instructed the jury, that if it should find from the evidence, that the chattels demanded in the declaration, were not the property of the defendant at the time of her marriage with their testator, nor the increase of any property that then belonged to her, nor acquired by her since the testator\u2019s death, the plaintiffs, his executors, were entitled to recover the chattels in question, notwithstanding that the testator in his lifetime, admitted and declared them to be the property of his wife, the defendant, and that they were purchased after the marriage, with the money belonging to the wife before the marriage, and secured to her separate use by the marriage articles. The defendant excepted to this opinion, and appealed from the judgement to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-6\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-8\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"A4z\">The judgement of the circuit court in this case, was doubtless founded upon the well established distinctions between the principles of <em>law </em>and <em>equity, </em>in re\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tion to contracts between husband and wife, and to the at- ,. \u201e , , ri-r taclnng of the marital rights upon the property o\u00ed the wife. Had a trustee been appointed by the marriage contract in this case, and the property been conveyed to him, a court of law, looking only to the legal title, would have pronounced that <em>Faulkner's </em>executors could not recover the property, thus conveyed by the wife before marriage with the husband\u2019s assent. And a court of equity would have sustained the rights of the wife, because that court recognizes the validity of these antenuptial contracts. But, as no trustee is interposed, the legal title was left in the wife ; and, in the eye of the law the marital rights attached immediately upon the marriage. In equity, indeed, the interposition of a trustee, is no longer considered necessary for the wife\u2019s protection from the operation of the marital rights; and hence it is very possible that the appellant\u2019s title may prove best before another <em>forum. </em>These distinctions, however technical, must be preserved in order to prevent uncertainty and confusion. They have always been rigidly maintained; nor do I find a single case in which, <em>at law, </em>a marriage settlement has availed to secure the property of the wife, without the intervention of a trustee. Nor can the contract, however worded, operate a release <em>at law, </em>though it would be a good release in equity; for it is a first principle as to releases, that they cannot operate upon a right not yet acquired; they always suppose a right in being. 10 Co. 48. a. The judgement of the circuit court must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
