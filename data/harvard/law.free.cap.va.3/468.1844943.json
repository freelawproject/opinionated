[N. B. The charge of a deficiency, being denied by the answer, and not supported by evidence, it is unnecessary to make any further mention of it] The plaintiff charges, that the wife of the said <em>Joshua </em>did not sign the deed, before the said bond became due, nor at any time since: that, nevertheless, the said <em>Joshua </em>had brought suit on the said bond, obtained judgment, issued execution, upon which a forthcoming bond was taken, and judgment was given on the forthcoming bond. He therefore, prayed an injunction, to stay further proceedings on the said bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">The Chancellor granted the injunction as to $200, on the ground of the failure of the wife to relinquish her dower.- But upon a petition filed by the plaintiff, supported by affidavits, (stating that an injunction for only $ 200 would be inadequate to the purposes.intended, as the land is worth, by his improvements, four or five times as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>much as it was originally worth,) the Chancellor extended the injunction to the whole of the judgment at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWaj\"><em>Pickering </em>answered, referring to the written agreement f\u00b0r the terms of the contract. He admits, that at the time of the execution of the agreement, and when the @400 were paid, he did give the plaintiff assurances that his wife\u2019s dower should be relinquished, but that the plaintiff himself was to come up to the place of residence of the defendant, and have the business done himself, to his qwn satisfaction: that both he and his wife have been always ready to complete the conveyance by the relinquishment of dower; and as evidence of it, he filed a deed purporting to be executed by him and his wife, and her dower relinquished and certified according to law, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkTT\">The deed above-mentioned, purports to be executed by <em>Pickering </em>and his wife, and to be executed in the presence of two witnesses. There is also a certificate by two justices of the peace of Bedford county, in the State of Pennsylvania, that <em>Joshua Pickering, </em>and <em>Sophia, </em>his wife, acknowledged, before them, that the said instrument was their act and deed, and desired that it might be recorded; and that the said <em>Sophia </em>was examined privily and apart from her husband, and that she willingly signed and sealed the same, and consented that it might be recorded. To this is added, a certificate-of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, for the same county, stating that the persons who signed the foregoing certificates, were justices of the peace for the said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">The injunction was afterwards, on motion, dissolved, when the defendant should file with the clerk of the Court, bond with good security, in the penalty of @500, conditioned to abide by and perform the orders and decree, which may be made against him in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">From this order, <em>Sexton </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-9\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACW\">contended, that the deed was not' proved according to law, and, therefore, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>d\u00edtion had not been performed, on which only-the bond was to have been paid. He referred to 1 <em>Rev. </em>Code, 157, 357, (Pleasants\u2019 edit.) <em>Ib. </em>363; 1 <em>Rev. </em>Code, 365, (1819.)

It was stipulated in the articles of agreement, that upon the first payment being made, <em>Pickering </em>was to convey the land with warranty against himself, and all persons, claiming by, through, or under, him. The first payment was made; and it appears, both from the bill and answer, and also from the testimony of two witnesses, that <em>Pickering </em>executed a deed conveying his interest in the lands. It is highly probable that this deed was duly proved and recorded, as to <em>Pickering; </em>for <em>Sexton, </em>in his bill, makes no complaint of the want of a conveyance from <em>Pickering* </em>but complains that Mrs. <em>Pickering </em>had not relinquished her right of dower; and it is evident, both from the bill and answer, that although <em>Sexton </em>received the deed from Pickering, it was received in the perfect understanding between the parties, that Mrs. <em>Pickering </em>was to relinquish her dower, before the second payment. This, however, was not done before that payment, became due. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>mean time, <em>Sexton </em>had made valuable improvements on the land. <em>Pickering </em>brought suit and recovered a judgment for the balance of the purchase money; and <em>Sexton </em>obtained an injunction on two grounds; first, that there had been, a misrepresentation as to the quantity of the land; and secondly, that the dower had not been relinquished. The fact of misrepresention as to quantity, being denied by the answer, and unsupported by testimony, may be regarded as out of the case. It is very clear, however, that it was right t'b award the injunction, on the ground that Mrs. <em>Pickering\u2019s </em>right of dower had not been relinquished. But it is contended, that the dower has been relinquished since, and the deed which <em>Pickering </em>filed with, and made a part of, his answer, is referred to as evidence of the fact. That deed appears to have been duly executed by the wife; and it would be completely effectual for the purposes for which it was intended, if it appeared that the husband also had executed it. The certificate of magistrates of other States, has been sufficient evidence of the execution of a deed by a <em>feme </em>covert, since the act of 1814; but it was not until the law of 1819, that the certificate of such magistrates was made evidence of the execution.of deeds, by other persons than <em>feme coverts. Pickering, </em>in his answer, refers to the deed, as having been executed by his wife; but he does not say that <em>he </em>had executed it; nor is there any proof whatever of its execution by him, except the certificate of magistrates, which, as before observed, could not be received to that effect. Whatever the fact, therefore, may haye been, we can regard this deed as one executed by Mrs. <em>Pickering </em>only. But the deed of a <em>feme covert, </em>to be valid, must be executed by the husband also. We cannot, therefore, say, that Mrs. <em>Pickering </em>has relinquished her dower in this land; and if it was right to award the injunction, on this ground, it was equally proper that it should be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The requisition of bond and security from Pickering, was not sufficient for the purposes of justice, in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The land had been greatly improved in value; two witnesses deposing, that Mrs. <em>Pickering\u2019s </em>dower is now worth the price originally contracted to be given for the whole <em>LldLl'</em></p>\n<p id=\"Asn\"><em>b </em>It may not be improper to observe, that as it appears by sufficient evidence, that the deed was executed by Mrs. Pickering, it would be completely valid as to her, if it had appeared by the testimony of even a single witness, that it had been executed by her husband also.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The order of the Chancellor, dissolving the injunction, is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded, &amp;c.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\"> Fine Phesibent, ami Judge Carr. aliseci; the latter of whom decided (he eause in the Court Wmr,'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
