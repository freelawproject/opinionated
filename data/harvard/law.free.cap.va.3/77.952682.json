Turner </em>as executor of <em>Frances Turner, </em>and the said <em>John R. </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>his wife in their own right, and the administrator of <em>Shelton Ragland, </em>in which they charged: that <em>Richard Turner </em>deceased, the father of said <em>Sally, William W. </em>and <em>Elizabeth, </em>executed to the late <em>Shelton Ragland </em>a deed which was on its face absolute, for sundry slaves, but that this deed was upon the express condition of a confidential trust, that <em>Richard Turner </em>should have the use of these slaves during his life, and after his death <em>Ragland </em>should hold them for the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Richard\u2019s </em>widow and their children. That <em>Frances </em>the widow of <em>Richard </em>Turner, who survived him several years, was permitted by <em>Ragland </em>during his life, to hold said slaves; and his administrator permitted her to them till her death. That said <em>Frances </em>having been thus permitted to hold said slaves, she by her will undertook to dispose of them as of her own <em>property; </em>and her executor <em>John R. Turner </em>having gotten possession of them, refuses to deliver them up for a division among the children of <em>Richard Turner. </em>The bill then prays that the trust may be established; and that the slaves with their increase may be equally divided among the <em>cestuis que trust.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\"><em>John R. Turner </em>in his answer, after giving the names of the negroes which had come into his hands as executor of <em>Frances </em>Turner, says, that <em>Lucy </em>one of these slaves, and from whom all the others descended, was conveyed by <em>Richard Turner </em>to <em>Shelton Ragland </em>by an absolute bill of sale in 1806, prior to the birth of any of her children which came into his possession. That he had never heard of any secret and confidential trust being attached to this bill of sale; and he leaves the plaintiffs to prove it. That he has been informed and believes that <em>Richard Turner </em>was, at the date of the bill of sale, indebted to insolvency, and so continued until his death in 1807. That he could not therefore have conveyed his property to <em>Ragland </em>clothed with a secret confidential trust for the benefit of his family without being guilty of a gross fraud upon his <em>creditors; </em>and defendant therefore submits whether a Court of Equity will aid the <em>cestuis que trust </em>to enforce a trust founded in fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">The answer further states, that though the defendant has no personal knowledge of the fact, he has reason to believe and does believe that his testatrix acquired title to the negro woman <em>Lucy </em>and her children then born, from <em>Shelton </em>Ragland, some twelve or thirteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>before his death; and that her possession of said negroes was uninterrupted and uncontroverted from that time until 1834, when she died; a period of not less than eighteen or twenty years. The defendant relies upon this long and uninterrupted possession of his testatrix in bar of the claim of the plaintiffs; and also pleads the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">The administrator of <em>Shelton Ragland </em>answers, that he knows nothing on the subject, and can neither admit nor deny the allegations of the bill; but submits his rights to the consideration and judgment of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">Prom the evidence in the cause it appeared to the satisfaction of the Court, that in 1806, <em>Richard Turner </em>made an absolute bill of sale of the slave <em>Lucy </em>to <em>Shelton Ragland; </em>and that the other slaves mentioned in the bill and the answer of <em>John R. Turner </em>were descendants of <em>Lucy, </em>born since the execution of this conveyance. That the object of the conveyance was to protect the property from the creditors of <em>Richard Turner; </em>and that at the time of its execution it was agreed between <em>Richard Turner </em>and <em>Ragland, </em>that <em>Ragland </em>should hold the said slave and her increase for the benefit of <em>Turner\u2019s </em>wife during her life, and after her death for the children. <em>Richard Turner </em>died in 1807, and a short time thereafter the slaves went into the possession of <em>Mrs. Turner, </em>who held them until her death in 1834. By her will she gave some of these slaves to her son <em>William W. Turner, </em>and the others she gave to her daughter <em>Elizabeth,, </em>the wife of <em>John R. Turner.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court made a decree establishing the trust, and directing <em>John R. Turner </em>to surrender the slaves to commissioners who were appointed to divide them equally among the three children of <em>Richard Turner. </em>Prom this decree <em>John R. Turner </em>and wife applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Leigh </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATj\">referred to <em>James </em>v. <em>Bird\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>8 Leigh <em>510; Terrell </em>v. <em>Imboden, </em>10 Leigh 310; <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>12 Leigh 427; to shew that a Court of Equity would not set up a ^raudulent secret trust at the suit of a party to the fraudulent act. And they insisted that though the children of <em>Richard Turner </em>did not actually participate in the fraud, they were parties to the fraudulent trust, and therefore could not be heard in a Court of Equity to set it up.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>Bouldin </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellees, insisted that this was not the case of a fraudulent grantor asking the aid of a Court of Equity to set up a fraudulent secret trust against his grantee ; but it was a suit between beneficiaries under the same trust, where the grantee had executed the trust in favour of the life tenant; and made no objection to the execution of it in favour of those in remainder.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-7\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ayv\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AaT\">The Court is of opinion, that the appellants, claiming under the will of <em>Frances Turner </em>deceased, have not shewn- any title in her to the slaves in controversy derived by purchase from <em>Shelton Ragland, </em>to whom they were conveyed by the bill of sale in the proceedings mentioned, executed by <em>Richard Turner </em>in his <em>lifetime to </em>said <em>Ragland; </em>and that it appears from the evidence the said <em>Ragland. </em>did not claim title for his own benefit under the said bill of sale, but only as trustee for the use- and benefit of the said <em>Frances Turner </em>during her life, and,, after her death, for the use \u00e1nd benefit of the children of said <em>Frances; </em>which trust was partly executed during the life of said <em>Frances, </em>by her possession, use and enjoyment of the property. The Court is therefore of opinion that it is not competent for the appellants to rely upon the legal title conveyed as aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to said <em>Ragland, </em>nor upon the possession; use and enjoyment of the said <em>Frances, </em>as aforesaid, in order to defeat the full and perfect execution of said trust, by an equal division of the property amongst the children of said <em>Frances </em>and their representatives. And the Court is further of opinion, that though, if the said <em>Ragland </em>had claimed title for his own benefit under the said bill of sale, it would not have been competent, if the same was made to defraud creditors of the grantor, for the said <em>Frances </em>and her children to have set up against the absolute title thereby conveyed a secret trust attending the same in their favour: yet, inasmuch as the said <em>Ragland </em>disclaimed all title for his own benefit to said slaves, and permitted the said <em>Frances </em>to enjoy the same as <em>cestui que trust </em>thereof for her life, with remainder to her children, the appellants, who shew no title except as <em>co-cestuis que trust </em>in remainder, cannot now defeat the full execution of the trust, nor appropriate the exclusive benefit thereof to themselves, by relying upon the fraudulent intent with which said bill of sale may have been executed, nor avail themselves, under the circumstances, of the statute of limitations. The Court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in said decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
