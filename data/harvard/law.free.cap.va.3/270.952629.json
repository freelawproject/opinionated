The substance of that special verdict was: That on the 14th of February 1821, an act passed the General Assembly authorizing <em>Philip R. Thompson </em>and <em>Stephen Teays </em>to build a tollbridge across <em>Cole </em>river, from the lands of <em>Thompson </em>near the mouth of the said river, to the lands of <em>Teays </em>on the opposite side thereof; and provided that the benefits of the act should be forfeited, if the bridge was not commenced within two years, and completed within four years thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">That up to the 17th of January 1828, no step was taken by <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>to erect said bridge.

For this purpose, the principal engineer of the State was directed to lay out the road, to indicate the sites of the bridges and culverts, which he might deem necessary; to describe the number, kind and situation of the bridges; and to deliver to the clerks of the County Courts of <em>Cabell </em>and <em>Kanawha </em>plats or maps of so much of the said road as might be within their respective counties, to be by them respectively recorded.

This remedy is to be pursued within one year from the time when the maps or plats are recorded by the clerks of the respective County Courts, and if not commenced within that time the said owners of land are to be deemed to have relinquished to the Commonwealth all claim to damages arising from the execution of the act. And the damages ascertained to be sustained by the land owners are to be paid by the president and directors of the <em>James River Company, </em>out of any unexpended funds in their hands.

This road to the ford left the line which passed the point at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the site for the bridge was located, a short distance on one side of the river, and came into it again a short distance on the other side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3L\">That at the time of the passage of the act of the 14th of February 1821, and for many years previous thereto, the old State road ran near the <em>Kanawha </em>river, crossing <em>Cole </em>river at its mouth, some distance below the point located as the site for the bridge.

N. Johnson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-18\">When the acts of February 1821, and 1828, were passed, the public road ran near the <em>Kanawha </em>river, and there was a ferry at the mouth of <em>Cole </em>river: and it was the intention, in authorizing the building of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>bridge provided for in these acts, to accommodate the travel on that road. For nine years <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>neglected to build their bridge; nor did they take the first step towards it, until the <em>James River Company </em>had, in pursuance of the act of 1829, proceeded to locate their turnpike along the <em>Kanawha, </em>fix the site of their bridge over <em>Cole </em>river,- and then <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>placed theirs precisely on the site located by the company. I submit that the acts of 1821 and 1828 do not authorize <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>to build their bridge at the place they have put it. The first act says they shall build their bridge <em>near the mouth </em>of <em>Cole </em>river. The last says at or near the mouth of <em>Cole </em>river. And this bridge is built neither at, or in the sense of the statute, near the mouth of the river.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">The act of January 1829, makes it the duty of the <em>James River Company </em>to locate the turnpike road to the mouth of <em>Big Bandy </em>river. This duty the company was bound to <em>perform; </em>and in so doing, to locate the site for a bridge across <em>Cole </em>river. This act vests the land in the Commonwealth, on the recording of the plat by the clerk of the County Court; and prescribes the mode of ascertaining the damages and compensating the owners. If, then, <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>had fixed the site of their bridge before the location by the engineer, this act would have vested the land in the Commonwealth ; and their right would have been, not to the land, but to such damages as the land as a site for a bridge, was worth. <em>Tuckahoe Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Tuckahoe Railroad Co., </em>11 Leigh 42. This case shews clearly, that there is no limit to the power to take private property, whether that of a person or a corporation, for public uses, except to make just compensation for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">If we look to the terms of the act, there can be no doubt that the land was vested in the Commonwealth, when the survey was made and recorded. The act does not say the road or the fight of way, but the land shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>be vested. The only question, therefore, that can arise, is, as to the estate which vests. But the damages are to be assessed for the whole land, and the land is vested ; and therefore it must be the whole fee. If, however, the whole fee is not vested in the Commonwealth, and through the Commonwealth in the <em>James Rivet' and </em>. , , <em>Kanawha </em>Company, succeeding as it does to her rights in this road, still any estate which gives the right of possession, will sustain this action; and if this be a base fee, determinable by the going down of the road, it is sufficient to entitle the company to recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-8\"><em>Michie </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-9\">The act of 1829, extending the turnpike to the mouth of <em>Big Sandy </em>river, is unconstitutional; because it does not provide for a just compensation to the owners of the land to be taken for the road. <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Slate River Co., </em>6 Rand. 245; <em>James River and Kanawha Co. </em>v. Turner, 9 Leigh 313; <em>Van Horne </em>v. Dorrance, 2 Dali. R. 304. The act divests the owner of his land; and the only compensation it provides for him is a suit. A suit, in which a judgment is forbidden to be rendered, but he is to receive a certificate which is to be paid out of the unappropriated funds of the <em>James River Company : </em>funds which never existed. And thus the just compensation secured by the constitution, is a claim which may not be enforced against a company which cannot pay it. It is true, this law was enacted when the Commonwealth was the company; but she made no provision for the payment of the damages: and she has kept up the separate organization of the company; and has most carefully avoided making herself responsible for its debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">It is certainly true, that the Commonwealth has a right of passage over the land within her borders; and may confer upon any citizen the right to construct the way, upon making compensation to the owner. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>when she has once done this, and obtained the passage, she cannot take away the right she has conferred, and give it to another. <em>Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., </em>4 Gill &amp; John. 1. case a^so decides, that when from the nature of the case the line of way is not defined in the act, it is the right of the party to lay down the line as he may think best; and this line cannot be interfered with. In 1828 the General Assembly gave to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>the right to build a bridge over <em>Cole </em>river; and they had a right to build it at any place within the restrictions of the act. The act says near the mouth of <em>Cole </em>river. It is within that restriction. It says on the land of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays, </em>and it is within that. Having then built their bridge according to the provisions of the statute, how is it that they are to be deprived of their franchise by the action of \u00e1 company, which derives all its authority from the act of 1829 ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">When it is proposed to divest the property of the citizen, a compliance with the statute which authorizes it must be shewn. This act authorizes the location of one road, not of several; and as it is shewn that the engineer located the road to the ford or ferry; and that the company have been in the habit of using that road ; and as the map and survey does not extend the road to the bridge on either side, the owners could have no reason to suppose that their right to their own property was thereby divested. If, indeed, their right is divested, then, though the plat does not shew the location of the road to the bridge, and though <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>have built their bridge with the apparent acquiescence of the <em>James River Company, </em>they are deprived of their franchise, and their property; and under the provisions of the act of 1829, they are deprived of all compensation for their loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">It must have been contemplated by the Commonwealth, that <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>would erect their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>bridge along the line of travel on the road; and she must therefore have intended that they should hold their franchise; and that the <em>James River Company </em>should take in subordination to their rights. And this is confirmed by the act of 1832, passed after the bridge had been located and nearly completed at its present position.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-11\">The act of 1829, by virtue of which the <em>James River and Kanawha, Company </em>claims in this action, says that the land shall be vested in the Commonwealth for the use of the road. Upon this act the question arises, what is thereby vested in the Commonwealth ? The law does not say the fee shall be vested: and when we look to the purpose and object of the statute, we see that the right of way is all that is necessary. We must presume, therefore, that this alone was intended, because it is to be presumed that the General Assembly has not interfered further with individual rights and property than was necessary for the public convenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-12\">Almost every act passed by the General Assembly for the making of turnpike roads, provides for the condemnation of land for the purpose. And yet this Court in <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Mayor of </em>Petersburg, 3 Rand. 563, alluding to the principle that in <em>England </em>the public has a mere right of way, over the land, draws the same conclusion from our own legislation on the subject. Where then is the plain language of the statute which takes the fee in the land ? What is the public necessity which requires that the land and not the right of way over the land shall be vested in the Commonwealth ? And without which necessity it has been held that there was no right to take the soil. <em>Peck </em>v. Smith, 1 Conn. R. 103; Smith\u2019s Leading Cas. 44 Law Libr. 144.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-14\">The <em>Attorney </em>General, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-15\">The right of property in the land in controversy depends upon the true construction of the act of 1829. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Sup. Rev. Code 463. We say that by this act the land. was vested in the. Commonwealth, and by the act of March 1832, was transferred to the appellants. The act saYs the lan(3 shall be vested in the Commonwealth for tpe llse 0f qie r0ad. The land is vested. Take either the popular or legal signification of this term, and it includes every thing in and upon it. 1 Thom. Coke Litt. 230, 4 a. It also conveys an estate equal to a fee simple. At common law it is true words of inheritance were necessary to pass a fee, but by our statute these words are dispensed with. <em>Prima facie, </em>therefore, we have a fee simple estate in the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">But it is said the words \u201c for the use of the road,\u201d limited the grant both in its duration and character. The Court will not give this effect to these words, if the use of them may be accounted for: and this will be done by looking to the fact that the Commonwealth conducts her proceedings in relation to various objects by distinct bodies. Thus there is the <em>Literary fund, </em>the <em>Board of public works, </em>the <em>Southwestern road, </em>and the <em>Kanawha road: </em>and the words in question were intended to shew that the land was to be vested in the. Commonwealth for the use of this last road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-10\">It is true that in <em>England </em>the public are considered as having only the right of way, whilst the land still belongs to the coterminous owner. But the right of eminent domain entitles the Commonwealth to take either the whole land, or the easement; and how much shall be taken must therefore depend upon the judgment and discretion of the General Assembly. This power to take private property for public uses, is a power to be exercised both in peace and in war, in relation to both real and personal property, and the only limitation upon it is, that just compensation be made to the owner for it. We must therefore in every case look to the statute to see what the Legislature has in its discretion deemed it proper to take.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>It is said the act is unconstitutional because just compensation has not been provided for the persons whose land is taken. This provision of the Constitution has never been construed to require that the compensation shall be made before the property is taken; nor has it been so considered in <em>Massachusetts, </em>where they have a similar provision. <em>Boston and Roxb. Milldam Corp. </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>12 Pick. R. 467. And it is obvious that in many cases which might be mentioned, and which are of frequent occurrence, it would be wholly impracticable. On this point the Court is referred to <em>James River and Kanawha Company </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>12 Leigh 278; <em>Tuckahoe Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Tuckahoe Railroad Co., </em>11 Leigh 42; <em>Case </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>6 Wend. R. 634; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>20 John. R. 735; <em>Jerome </em>v. <em>Ross, 7 </em>John. Ch. R. 315; <em>Wheelock v. Pratt, </em>4 Wend. R. 647; <em>Bloodgood </em>v. <em>Mohawk and Hudson R. R. Co., </em>18 Wend. R. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">But it is said this act gives not money but a suit. The <em>James River Company </em>was the mere agent of the Commonwealth, and any demands against the company was a demand against the Commonwealth. It is true the damages were to be paid out of the unexpended balance on hand; but as the right to payment for the damages vested immediately, even before the execution of the work, the owners of land entitled to damages, were given priority of payment: and if the fund provided for their satisfaction was not sufficient, the faith of the State was pledged for their indemnity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-9\">It is insisted, for the appellees, that the General Assembly have not, and have not intended to deprive <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>of their right to the ground on which their bridge is located. The cases of <em>Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>Warren Bridge, 7 </em>Pick. R. 344, of <em>The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Co. </em>v. <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co. </em>4 Gill &amp; John. 1; and of the <em>Tuckahoe Canal Co. </em>v. <em>The Tuckahoe Rail</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>road Co. </em>shew that a grant is not a monopoly, unless expressly so provided. It cannot then be pretended with any show of reason, that the grant to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>to build a bridge over <em>Cole </em>river, restrained ^ie \u00aeeneral Assembly from making a road from <em>Charleston </em>to the mouth of <em>Big Sandy </em>river. This is what has been done; and after the road and the site of the bridge over <em>Cole </em>river had been located, <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>placed their bridge precisely upon the ground located for a bridge by the <em>James River Company. </em>To suppose that the General Assembly intended that this should be done by <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays; </em>and thus that double tolls should be collected on the road, is in opposition to the principles of <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Upper Appomattox Co. </em>3 Leigh 318.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-4\">It is said that the act of 1832 confirms the act of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Teays </em>in building their bridge on its present site. But grants by the public are to be taken <em>strictly; </em>and only <em>to </em>be intended for the purpose expressed in them. 2 Black. Comm. 347-8; 6 Bac. Abr. Prerogative 518, 614. The correct principle is, that the grantee knows everything about the matter of the grant, and the Legislature does not; and therefore the facts must be fairly represented to the Legislature or the grant will be void. That the General Assembly was not informed of the facts in this case, the act of March 1832 abundantly proves.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> The map is made a part of the special verdict; and the jury refer to the stations and lines marked upon it to designate the site of the bridge, and the roads located by the engineer, as well as the old road; but the map is not in the possession of the reporter, and he is therefore obliged to describe the localities as well as he can without it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b302-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AqP\">The Court is of opinion, that the matters of law arising upon the facts found in the special verdict, and the facts agreed by the parties, is for the plaintiff: therefore that the said judgment is erroneous ; that the said judgment be reversed and annulled ; and that the plaintiff recover against the defendants his costs here expended.
