Fulton </em>purchased the interest of several of her children in this lot j and among others of them, that of <em>Hogue </em>and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\"><em>Betty Havely </em>survived her husband, but the lot was not conveyed to her by the trustees; and in November 1835, she died, having made her will in October of that year, by which she gave all that she then had, or might have at her death, to her daughter <em>Betsy IricJc, </em>wife of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Conrad Irick, </em>and her heirs, \u201con condition that she live where she now lives near my residence, during my life.\u201d But if <em>Betsy Irick </em>moved away, then the property was given to the testatrix\u2019s three children, <em>Isaac, Charles </em>and <em>Hannah.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqUG\">After the death of <em>Betty Havely, Irick </em>and wife sold their interest in the lot.to <em>John H. Fulton; </em>and he dying before a conveyance, they by deed dated the 1st of May 1837, conveyed it to his executors. At this time both parties believed that <em>Mrs. Irick </em>only took an equal share of the lot with her brothers and sisters. <em>Fulton's </em>ex\u2019ors sold and conveyed the lot to <em>George V. Litchfield.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">After the conveyance to <em>Litchfield, Irick </em>and wife filed their bill in the Superior Court of the county of <em>Washington, </em>against <em>Fulton's </em>ex\u2019ors, <em>Litchfield, </em>and the other children of <em>Betty Havely, </em>in which, after setting - out the deed of the 10th of August 1813, and the will of <em>Betty Havely, </em>they insisted that under the first, <em>Betty Havely </em>had the fee simple interest in the lot; and that she had, by her will, given it to the female plaintiff, upon a condition which had been complied with. They alleged that the sale to <em>Fulton, </em>and the conveyance to his executors were made under a total ignorance of the extent of their interest in the lot. They therefore ask that their deed to <em>Fulton's </em>ex\u2019ors may be cancelled, upon the repayment of the purchase money; and that the executors may be required to account for the rents and profits from the time they took possession of the lot. That the trustees may be compelled to convey the lot to the female plaintiff; and they ask for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\"><em>F'ulton's </em>ex\u2019ors answered, admitting the deed of the 10th of August 1813, and the will of <em>Betty Havely. </em>But they insisted that the deed gave to her but a life estate in the- lot, with remainder to her children. That this was the construction which had always been put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>upon it by the parties. That their testator had purchased the, interest of several of the children of <em>Betty Havely </em>in her lifetime; and as they believe with her knowledge and consent. That the plaintiffs, as the respondents believed, were fully aware of the extent of their rights and interest in the property at the time they made the conveyance; and they refer to the deed of the complainants, in which they recite, <em>\u201c </em>that the property was conveyed to the said <em>Betty Havely </em>for life, with remainder to her children,\u201d in confirmation of the construction which the respondents gave to the deed of the 10th of August 1813.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">The cause came on to be heard in October 1841, when the Court dismissed the bill with costs. From this decree the plaintiffs applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court'.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-13\"><em>B. R.

Fulton </em>deceased, made under the belief of the parties, that the said <em>Elizabeth Irick </em>was entitled only to an undivided interest or share in said property, as one of the children and heirs of said <em>Betty Havely, </em>the parties only sold and purchased, and only intended to sell and purchase, such undivided interest: and consequently neither said <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, nor the purchasers under them have acquired the said <em>Elizabeth Trick\u2019s </em>right to a greater extent than such undivided interest ; nor are there any circumstances in the case to preclude the appellants from asserting and recovering so much of their right to said property as was not embraced in their said sale to said <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Such recovery by the appellants would leave to the purchasers under <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors an inconsiderable undivided interest in said property, and ought to lead to a rescission of the said contract between the appellants and said <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, the same having been made by the parties thereto under the mutual mistake that the other children and heirs of said <em>Betty Havely </em>were entitled to undivided interests in said property, and that the same had been acquired by said <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>purchases from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The appellants ought to recover the whole of said property, and a deed of conveyance of the legal title' thereto be made by said trustees to the female appellant. And the purchase money paid by <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors to the appellants ought to be refunded with interest thereupon from the filing of the bill. The appellants ought moreover to recover the rents and profits of said property from the parties who received the same, but only from the time of filing their bill, there not appearing to have been any previous demand for the surrender of said property, and the possession thereof having been held by said <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors, and the purchasers under them, with the assent of the appellants, until the discovery by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>them of <em>the true state of the </em>title. And the appellants t . _ . ought to be required to account to the proper person or persons for any permanent improvements made upon the property, during the existence of the mistake in regard to the title: provided the amount thereof shall not exceed the rents and profits which shall be ascertained to be doe to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"AU8F\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said decree of the said Circuit Court, dismissing the bill of the appellants is erroneous: it is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the same be reversed and annulled, with costs to the appellants. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit Court, to be there further proceeded in according to the principles above declared, and in the further proceedings the proper accounts are to be taken between the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
