M\u2019Farland, </em>a justice of the peace for the county, of <em>Kanawha, </em>by <em>Thomas Dulaney </em>as principal, and <em>Henry B. Saunders jr., </em>as his security, each in the penalty of 500 dollars. The <em>scire facias </em>being served on <em>Saunders, </em>he appeared, and craved <em>oyer </em>of the recognizance, which recited that <em>Dulaney </em>had been tried by an Examining Court of the county of <em>Kanawha, </em>on a charge of offering to pass counterfeit money, which Court was of opinion that he ought to be tried in the Circuit Court; and that he was by law bailable for the same, as appeared to the justice of record. But the recognizance did not shew that the Court had fixed the amount for which the bail should be taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-10\"><em>Saunders </em>demurred to the <em>scire facias, </em>but the Court overruled the demurrer, and gave judgment for the <em>Com</em>monwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>After the judgment was rendered <em>Saunders </em>died; and his administrator applied to this Court for an appeal, which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AnW\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellant, referred to <em>Hamlett &amp; als. v.

Therefore the judgment of the Court below is reversed, and this Court proceeding, &amp;c., it seems to the Court that the matters and things in said <em>scire facias </em>alleged, are not sufficient in law for the <em>Commonwealth </em>to have and maintain her said action against the defendant; therefore it is considered that the <em>Commonwealth </em>take nothing by her <em>scire facias, </em>and that the defendant be hence dismissed, &amp;c.: which is ordered to be certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
