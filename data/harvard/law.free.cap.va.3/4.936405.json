The writ being duly executed on <em>Powell, </em>and <em>Coleman </em>taken as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>his appearance bail, was returned to the August rules; at which <em>Watson </em>filed his declaration; and thereupon, the clerk entered the common order, that unless the defendant should appear at the next rule day, and plead to issue, judgement should be entered for the debt &amp;c. against him and <em>Coleman </em>his appearance bail. At the September rules, <em>Powell </em>appeared, filed a recognizance of special bail entered into by <em>Coleman, </em>and craved oyer of the writ and the bond, of which an entry was made; but he put in no plea to the action; and, therefore, <em>Watson\u2019s </em>attorney insisted, that the clerk should enter a rule confirming the common order, so as to put the cause upon the list of office judgements at the next term of the court; which the clerk refused to do. At the next term, <em>Watson, </em>insisting that the clerk ought to have entered an office judgement at the September rules, upon the failure of <em>Powell </em>to plead according to the rule given him at the August rules, moved the court to order the cause to be put upon the list of office judgements of that term: <em>Powell </em>objected, that if the clerk had erred, the court could only remand the cause to the rules, with directions to the clerk to correct the error there: but the court disregarded the objection, and ordered the cause to be put on the list of office judgements of that term. <em>Powell </em>filed exceptions to this proceeding. And then, (special bail having been filed in the office as above mentioned) he pleaded <em>payment; </em>upon which the office judgement was set aside, and the cause continued for the trial of the issue made up upon the plea, until the next term; at which there was a trial, verdict and judgement for <em>Watson. Powell </em>applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the proceedings and judgement, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-5\"><em>Taylor, for </em>the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMx\">Supposing the clerk erred in not entering an office judgement at the September rules, upon the failure of <em>Powell </em>to plead according to the rule given him at the August rules, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 72, 73. p. 507. yet that error of the clerk was nowise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>imputable as a fault to <em>Powell, </em>nor ought he to be at all prejudiced thereby. The statute, <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 77. p. 508. provides, that \u201c the court shall have control over all proceedings in the office during the preceding vacation, may correct any mistakes or errors which, may have happened therein, and may, for good cause shewn, set aside any of the rules or proceedings, and make such order concerning the same as may be just and right.\u201d Here, there was no rule or proceeding to be set aside; the error complained of, was an omission of the clerk to enter an office judgement at the September rules in the office, which could only be entered there; the effect of that omission was, that the cause remained at the rules; and the court in term could correct this error of omission, only by directing the clerk to enter the office judgement at the rules. The <em>court </em>could not enter an office <em>judgement; </em>it could not order a cause in which no office judgement had been entered, to stand upon the list of office judgements.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6\"><em>Watson </em>being clearly entitled to demand an office judgement at the September rules, it was a palpable mistake or error in the clerk not to enter it. The court at the ensuing term, was certainly authorized to correct this mistake or error, and to make such order as was just and right; and the only effectual mode of correcting the error, the order which justice required, was to enter the office judgement <em>nunc pro tunc; </em>or, which is the same thing, to consider the office judgement as having been entered at the rules, as it ought to have been, and to put the cause on the list of office judgements of the term. The effect of the clerk\u2019s error was, that <em>Powell </em>gained the delay of a term; the error could only be corrected by taking away that advantage from him. The method of correction adopted by the court, placed <em>Watson </em>in the situation in which he would have stood, if the clerk had not committed the error, and took from <em>Powell, </em>the advantage which that error gave him : the mode of correction which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Powell </em>proposed, would have left him all the advantage arising from the error, and left all the injustice done to <em>Watson </em>unredressed. But this point is now wholly immaterial: for, supposing the court erred in the method by which it intended to correct the proceedings at the rules, <em>Powell </em>himself cured that error, by pleading to the action in open court; the effect of which was to set aside all the proceedings at the rules, and to put an end to all enquiry as to the regularity of those proceedings, and as to the proper method of correcting them if irregular. His defence was admitted, and fairly tried; he does not complain of any injustice in the trial and judgement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>Taylor. </em>The court, by ordering the cause to be put upon the list of office judgements, imposed upon him the alternative of pleading to the action, or of suffering judgement by default. He was compelled to plead; and if it was irregular to compel him to plead, his pleading ought not to preclude him from complaining of this irregular compulsion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-6\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">The substance of the opinion and direction of the court, excepted to by <em>Potoell, </em>was, that <em>Watson </em>was entitled to a confirmation of the common order at the rule day preceding the then term of the court, and that what had been done in the office should be corrected accordingly, so as to put the cause on the list of office judgements of that term. If this had been done; if the office judgement had been entered on the docket, and not set aside during the term, it would have been final: and if the court erred in correcting the rules so as to produce that result, it might have been reversed for that error, which in that case would have been the foundation of the judgement. But the judgement appealed from, was not the consequence of, or in any degree affected by, that opinion and direction of the court: they were not in fact carried into effect. But if they had been, the voluntary plea of the defendant upon the merits, would have authorized and bound the court to set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>aside the office judgement, and no question could after-wards be entertained as to the validity of the judgement so set aside. But no office judgement having in fact been entered on the docket, there was none to set aside. The interposition of the defendant\u2019s plea obviated the necessity of entering any office judgement, and was a waiver of all objections on his part to the former proceedings and order. The judgement appealed from, being clearly right in itself, must be affirmed, whether the opinion and direction of the court below in respect to the proceedings at rules, were right or <em>wrong; </em>a question of which the court, therefore, waives the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Judgement affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
