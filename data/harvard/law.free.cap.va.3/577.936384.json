Therefore, he got a <em>Mr. Hunter, </em>to go first to <em>Baltimore, </em>to procure indulgence from his creditors, if possible, and if he should fail in that effort, then to proceed to <em>Alexandria, </em>and to obtain a loan from some of the banks there, or of any of the banks in the district of <em>Columbia; </em>and he sent a letter by <em>Hunter </em>to <em>Jacob Morgan </em>of <em>Alexandria, </em>requesting him to assist <em>Hunter </em>in negotiating tho loan. <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>efforts to procure indulgence from the creditors, hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ing proved abortive, he proceeded to <em>Alexandria, </em>delivered <em>Selby's </em>letter to <em>Morgan, </em>and explained to him the necessity <em>Selby </em>was under to raise money. <em>Morgan </em>lent his aid to <em>Hunter, </em>to negotiate a loan for <em>Selby, </em>at the banks in <em>Alexandria, </em>and at a bank in <em>Georgetown; </em>but no loan could be ohtained.

But, on or </em>about the 24th March 1825, he went again to <em>Alexandria; </em>and on this second visit, the arrangement was concluded. <em>Morgan </em>sold <em>Selby seventeen </em>shares of stock of the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>of 200 dollars each, and <em>sixteen </em>shares of the bank of <em>Potowmac </em>of 100 dollars each, at par, amounting to 5000 dollars, which Selby was to pay in two instalments, half within two years, and the other half within three years, and to pay him the interest on the whole, half yearly; and en the 26th March, upon Selby giving <em>Morgan </em>his bonds for the instalments, and a <em>deed of </em>trust of two parcels of valuable land in <em>Jefferson </em>to secure the payment, the stock was transferred to <em>Selby. </em>And on the same 26th March, a loan of 4000 dollars, for twelve months, was made by the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>to <em>Selby, </em>upon his own note indorsed by <em>Morgan </em>for his accommodation, <em>and </em>upon a pledge of the whole of the stock purchased of <em>Morgan.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\"><em>At the time of </em>this sale by <em>Morgan </em>to <em>Selby, </em>of this bank stock <em>at par, </em>the market price of the stock was, at the least, <em>twenty per </em>cent. <em>below par; </em>and this was known to both parties.

Judge <em>Carr </em>held the negative, and that, therefore, there was no pretense for <em>Selby\u2019s </em>complaint, that the transaction for the sale and purchase of the stock, was usurious : judge <em>Brooke </em>was of opinion that the transaction was not usurious, in any view of the case; and judges <em>Cabell </em>and <em>Green </em>held the affirmative on the above question of fact, \u25a0and thence inferred, that the transaction was usurious. By this decision of this court, the chancellor\u2019s order dissolving the injunction was affirmed; and the cause remanded to the court of chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-3\">After the cause was returned to the court of chancery, it was clearly proved, that on the 7th March 1825 (whether or no <em>Selby </em>was then at <em>Alexandria </em>upon his <em>first </em>visit, did not certainly appear) <em>Morgan </em>requested the president of the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>to ascertain from the directors, whether they would lend <em>Selby </em>4000 dollars, upon the hypothecation of <em>seventeen </em>shares of stock of the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>and <em>sixteen </em>shares of the bank of <em>Potowmac; </em>and they refused to lend the money on <em>that </em>security, but came to the resolution to make the loan to <em>Selby, </em>upon the security of a pledge of the <em>stock,-and </em>of <em>Selby\u2019s </em>note indorsed by <em>Morgan: that Morgan </em>was immediately informed of this resolution, <em>by </em>the president of the bank: that <em>Selby </em>had no share in the negotiation with the bank for the loan, and never was apprised of it, till informed by <em>Morgan: </em>and that the delivery of <em>Selby\u2019s </em>bonds and mortgage to <em>Morgan, </em>to secure the purchase money of the stock, the transfer of the stock by <em>Morgan </em>to <em>Selby, </em>the hypothecation and transfer of the stock by <em>Selby to </em>the bank, the execution and delivery to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the hank of <em>Selby\u2019s </em>note indorsed by <em>Morgan, </em>and the payment by the bank to <em>Selby </em>of the 4000 dollars lent him, were contemporary acts. And it was also proved, that in December 1824, <em>Morgan </em>held only <em>ten </em>shares, and in February 1825, only <em>thirteen </em>shares, of the stock of the bank of <em>Alexandria; </em>so that he must have purchased part of the stock he sold <em>Selby, </em>after the treaty with him commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-3\">Upon this new evidence, <em>Selby </em>moved the court of chancery to reinstate the injunction.

And that this was his real design, was the more apparent from the fact, that he did not, at the time, hold as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>much stock as he proposed to sell; that he had to buy part of the stock he sold <em>Selby. </em>It was then the scheme of <em>Margan </em>to get <em>usury on his money; </em>he bought at <em>twenty Ver cent, below par, </em>for the purpose of selling to <em>Selby, </em>on a credit, <em>at'par </em>(though the purchase money was to bear legal interest, and so was made equal to cash, and to be perfectly secured by a deed of trust of real estate) in order, that <em>Selby </em>might raise money on the stock, to the amount of its <em>real </em>value. Then, in the consummation <em>of </em>the transaction, the money that <em>Selby </em>got of the bank, was not, in truth, lent to <em>Selby, </em>at <em>his </em>request, upon the credit of <em>his </em>note and an hypothecation of <em>his </em>stock, but was lent at <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>solicitation, upon the credit of <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>indorsement, <em>and </em>of an hypothecation of stock furnished by <em>Morgan </em>for the purpose; which, in substance and effect, was the same thing, as if <em>Morgan </em>had borrowed the money of the bank upon his own note indorsed by <em>Selby, </em>and an hypothecation of his own stock, and then lent the money to <em>Selby, </em>And the effort of the counsel was, to liken this case to those of <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>2 Doug. 736. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Lowen, </em>1 Camp. 177. <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dey, </em>13 Johns.

Coming to the. conclusion, that the promise to indorse formed no part of the contract, there was no necessity for my invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>gating the law of the case. I think the impression on my mind was, that, if the promise to indorse formed a part of the contract, the transaction was usurious; but it was an impression taken up without examination. The new evidence has changed my view of the facts. When it was found that <em>Selby </em>could not effect a loan of the banks, and the treaty for <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>stock commenced, the idea seems to have been, that by depositing the stock with the bank, it would lend the money, on the note of <em>Selby </em>without an indorser. But on the 7th March, 1825, (when <em>Selby </em>was, probably, at <em>Alexandria, </em>and the treaty on foot) the president of the bank, at the request of <em>Morgan, </em>applied to the directors, to know whether they would lend <em>Selby 4000 </em>dollars on his depositing as a security stock of the banks of <em>Alexandria </em>and <em>Potowmac, </em>to the amount of 5000 dollars ? The board refused the loan on the stock, unless <em>Selby\u2019s </em>note should be indorsed by <em>Morgan. </em>An entry to this effect was made on its journal, and of this, the president says, he gave <em>Morgan </em>information. From this time, I. cannot but suppose, that the treaty for the stock, proceeded upon the ground, that it was to be hypothecated, <em>Selby\u2019s </em>note given to the bank, and <em>Morgan </em>to indorse it. <em>Selby </em>bought the stock <em>ai par, </em>executed his bonds to <em>Morgan </em>for 5000 dollars, payable with interest, in two and three years, and secured by deeds of trust; he gave about <em>twenty per cent, </em>above the cash price in the market; <em>Selby </em>then deposited the stock with the bank, with a power of sale; executed his note, which <em>Morgan </em>indorsed; and the bank paid <em>Selby </em>the money lent, it is contended, that the transaction, though in appearance a sale of stock, was, in truth, a loan of money at exorbitant usury. This is the question for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">In all such cases, lord <em>Mansfield </em>tells us, \u201c The view of the parties must be ascertained, to satisfy the court, that there is a loan and borrowing, and that the substance was, to borrow on the one part, and to lend on the other.\u201d We have decided often, that the sale of stock, or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>property, at whatever price, does not of itself constitute usury. In <em>Greenhow v. Harris, </em>judge <em>Roane </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>I distinctly admit the right of a party to sell property, such as bank shares, at whatever price is agreed on. The transaction becomes usurious, only, when the object is to borrow money, and not to purchase stock, and the price of the stock is graduated as a device to effect the purpose; or where there is a combination between the seller of the stock on a credit, and the purchaser for cash.\u201d Does the case before us fall within the definitions here given? Was the substance, to borrow on the one part, and to lend on the other, and not to purchase stock ? I can have no doubt,, that <em>Selby </em>meant to buy <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>stock, and <em>Morgan </em>to sell it. It is equally clear, that <em>Selby </em>was in distress for money, and wanted the stock as a means to raise it $ and that <em>Morgan </em>knew this. Indeed, their first communications on the subject, grew out of a request of <em>Selby </em>that <em>Morgan </em>would assist his agent <em>Hunter, </em>in an attempt to negotiate a loan with the banks. The attempt failed, and then <em>Morgan </em>wrote to <em>Selby </em>telling him that he had stock, which he would sell him <em>at par, </em>giving him such time as would enable him to make collections; pointing out the facilities which the stock would afford in raising money, especially by giving a stock note to the banks, or an individual one, by which he tells him he could command the <em>money </em>at once. The whole aspect of the case exhibits <em>Morgan </em>as the seller of stock, not the lender of money. And the difficulty with me has <em>been to </em>bring this within any of the cases which have been cited. In <em>Stribling </em>v. <em>Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. 132. we decided, that the sale of stock at <em>twenty per </em>cent\u201e above the market price was usury, because <em>(solely </em>because) there was indissolubly linked to that sale, a loan of money <em>by the seller </em>to the buyer. Here that distinctive feature is wanting. <em>Morgan </em>sells <em>his </em>stock, the bank lend its money, not to <em>Morgan </em>but to <em>Selby ; </em>not on <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>credit, but on the credit of <em>Selby, the stock </em>and <em>Morgan: </em>a loan not influenced by the purchase and rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>of the stock, but made by the bank, in the course of its \u2022 every day business; a loan agreed on all hands to be free from usury. I cannot well imagine, how a loan thus distinct, thus fair in itself, where no combination, no community of interest or profit can he detected, between the seller of the stock and the lender of the money, should make the sale of the stock usurious, which without it all admit would be untainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">This case was likened to <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller. </em>There, <em>Waller </em>wanted to raise <em>\u00a3 </em>200. on a bill of exchange. <em>Stratton fy Harris </em>hearing of it, sent their broker to let him know, that they would lend him <em>\u00a3 </em>100. <em>in money, </em>and <em>\u00a3 </em>100. in <em>goods, </em>but that the goods should be choice sorts <em>\u2022, </em>he should have them at the warehouse price, and should not lose by them. When <em>Waller </em>went to see them, they pretended that they had no money then, but goods only, and desired that the business might lay over. Thus, they lured him on for about three weeks, knowing his extreme distress for money. At length, they sent him word, if he would come the next day, he should have <em>\u00a3 </em>50. in <em>money, </em>and the rest in goods. He attended. One of the partners went out, and soon returned, saying he could get no money, but if <em>Waller </em>would take the whole in goods he should have them directly. <em>Waller </em>agreed : a broker who was present, sorted out the goods: they were immediately taken by him to an auctioneer, who sold them for \u00a3 117. a sacrifice of nearly <em>fifty per cent.. </em>Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, it was impossible to wink so hard, as not to see, that there was no idea between the parties, of any thing but a loan of money ; and that the only purpose of <em>Stratton fy Harris </em>was to contrive to get more than legal interest. The device was, to give the transaction the colour of the sale of goods. Stripping oft' this covering, the court considered the goods sent to auction, as still the goods of <em>Stratton Harris; </em>the money raised by the sale, as <em>their </em>money; and this money advanced by them to <em>Waller, </em>at a premium of near <em>fifty per cent. </em>And this has always been, and I trust always will be, considered a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>fectly sound decision. But does our case fall within it? I cannot think so. There seem to me some strong distinctions between them : from first to last, the treaty between <em>Selby </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>was for a <em>sale of stock. Morgan </em>never offered to <em>lend Selby money. </em>It was, <em>in truth, </em>a sale of stock. If you connect it with the bank transaction, it was still a sale of stock, which <em>Morgan </em>knew <em>Selby </em>meant to hypothecate with the bank for a loan of money, and to enable him to effect which, <em>Morgan </em>agreed to indorse bis note. Still there was no borrowing and lending between <em>Selby </em>and <em>Morgan; </em>no sale of the-stock to the bank to raise the money; nor any sale or sacrifice of it contemplated. The 5000 dollars in stock were pledged, as a collateral security for the 4000 dollars borrowed by <em>Selby of the </em>bank, not of <em>Morgan; </em>and it was understood, that the loan was for twelve months. Thus <em>Selby </em>would have twelve months to return the loan, and redeem his stock; and within this time, he seemed very confident that he could make his collections. In truth, eighteen months were given him: if within that time he had paid off his note, the stock would not have been sacrificed: he would have held it. In <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Baylors, </em>6 Munf. 433. it is strongly laid down, that a penalty from which a party may deliver himself, by complying with his contract, does not make such contract usurious. While <em>Selby </em>kept the stock, the dividends represented its par value in money; and, in the mutations of the market, the stock might have risen far above its par value. We have known this the case with more than one bank. This case, therefore, does not fall within the' principle of <em>Lowe v. Waller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZZq\">The case of <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Lowen </em>was also relied on. There, Lowen made a promissory note to <em>Coales &amp; Co. </em>for \u00a3153. 15. 0. payable at <em>ninety </em>days; it was indorsed to the plaintiff, who brought <em>assumpsit </em>on it; the defence was usury: the facts were these : <em>Coates fy Co. </em>accommodated <em>Lowen </em>with their acceptance at three months, in consideration of which <em>Loteen </em>executed his note to them at ninety days for the same sum, with the addition of <em>hoo and a half per cent. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>commission. The device attempted there, was to cover the usury by that usage, under which country bankers have been allowed to take a certain commission, besides legal interest, for their trouble and expense; but <em>that </em>was for <em>discounting </em>bills: here (lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said) there was no colour for a commission, <em>Coates Co. </em>being the acceptors, and not the discounters of the bill; and the <em>commission </em>was a mere cloak for usury. 1 consider that just as plain a case of usury, as if <em>Coates fy Co. </em>had advanced money to <em>Lowen to </em>receive <em>two and a half per cent, </em>above legal interest. Their acceptance bound them to pay the money unconditionally, and it was <em>their </em>money on which they took the usury. But our case is not like that. <em>Morgan </em>sold stock to <em>Selby, </em>and indorsed <em>Selby\u2019s </em>noto to the bank : but this did not make <em>him </em>the <em>lender of </em>the money : the <em>bank </em>was the lender: he was a mere surety for the borrower, lending his name to him. The difference of his position from that of <em>Coates 8/ Co. </em>is strikingly illustrated by the fact, that indorsers are allowed to take a commission for the loan of their credit and responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The case of <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dey </em>was cited. It turns on precisely the same point with <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Lowen; </em>and admits of the same answer. I beg leave to refer, though, to what justice <em>Spencer </em>says, upon the subject of indorsers : \u201c It has been said (he observes) that it is the usage for indorsers of bills of exchange, and sureties on custom house bonds, to take a per centage, for advancing their responsibilities. I see nothing improper in this; <em>there is no loan of money directly, </em>or <em>indirectly, </em>in either of these cases; they come neither within the terms nor the mischiefs of the statute; and they are innocent transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Thus the case before us seems to me essentially different from those cited in its support. The sale of the stock being by <em>Morgan, </em>and the loan of the money by the bank, without the slightest proof of collusion or combination between them, I cannot so connect the transactions, as to taint the sale of the stock with usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>I think the chancellor was right in refusing to reinstate the injunction.</p>\n<author id=\"b614-3\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKro\">Upon a careful re-examination of this case, I am now of opinion, that the transaction was not usurious ; and, therefore, that the order of the chancellor overruling the motion to reinstate the injunction, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>I am clearly of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
