That the same <em>W. T. Alexander, </em>by another deed executed in December 1804, conveyed about <em>twenty-two </em>other slaves <em>inter alia </em>to the same trustee, upon trust, that he should pay the profits of the whole trust subject, to <em>Mrs. Alexander </em>during her life, and in case she should die before her husband, then to him during his life, and, after the death of both, convey the slaves and their increase, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>such person or persons as <em>Mrs. Alexander </em>should by last will and testament appoint, and in default of appointment, to such persons as would have been entitled thereto if she had never married <em>Alexander. </em>That the same <em>W. T. Alexander </em>and <em>Lucy </em>his wife and <em>Taliaferro </em>the trustee, joined in a deed executed in April 1808, conveying to the defendant <em>James Taliaferro, </em>who was also a brother of <em>Mrs. Alexander, </em>the reversion in fee of all the slaves settled upon her by the two first mentioned deeds, reserving to her a life estate therein; (this deed contained a general warranty of title to <em>Taliaferro). </em>That <em>W. T. Alexander </em>died in August 1816, his wife <em>Lucy </em>surviving him; and that she executed a deed and agreement with <em>James Taliaferro </em>in September 1816, whereby she released to him her life estate in all the slaves and their increase, except thirty-seven, whereof she retained the life estate to herself. That, shortly after the execution of the deed of September 1816, the plaintiff married <em>Mrs. Alexander, </em>and thereby acquired the possession of the <em>thirty-seven </em>slaves reserved to her for life by that deed. That then an agreement was made between <em>Foote </em>now the owner of his wife\u2019s life estate in these <em>thirty-seven </em>slaves, and <em>James Taliaferro </em>the owner of the reversion, whereby <em>Taliaferro </em>agreed to release to <em>Foote </em>his reversion in <em>twelve </em>of them, and <em>Foote to </em>release to <em>Taliaferro </em>the life estate in the residue; in pursuance of which agreement, <em>Taliaferro </em>executed a deed to <em>Foote, conveying the twelve slaves to him in absolute property, with a general warranty of title. </em>That this deed was put into the hands of <em>John Taliaferro, </em>who promised to have it recorded in the county court of <em>King George, </em>in which county the deed was executed; it never was recorded or deposited there, and if it was not still in <em>John Taliaferro\u2019s </em>possession, the plaintiffs knew not where it was to be found; but the bill did not state that <em>the </em>paper was lost, or that any inquiry or search had been made for it. That not long after this transaction, Mrs. <em>Foote </em>died. That recently, in a suit in chancery prosecuted by the creditors of <em>William T&gt; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Alexander, </em>against the parties claiming under his two deeds of October 1802 and December 1804, those deeds had been declared void as to his creditors, and the subject held liable to his debts. That an execution sued out <em>by </em>some of the creditors, had been levied, at the particular instance of the defendant <em>Taliaferro, </em>on the <em>twelve </em>slaves and their increase held by the plaintiff <em>Foote, </em>which had been conveyed to him by the defendant <em>Taliaferro </em>in absolute property with general warranty, and those slaves had been all sold under the execution, for about 1800 dollars. And the prayer of the bill was in <em>tlm </em>alternative\u2014either a decree against <em>Taliaferro, </em>for the value of <em>the twelve </em>slaves, upon the strength of his alleged warranty of the title thereof; or, at the least, a decree for such proportion of the value thereof, as the value of the <em>twenty-five </em>slaves of which <em>Foote </em>released the life estate to <em>Taliaferro, </em>bore to the value of the <em>twelve </em>slaves which <em>Taliaferro </em>conveyed and warranted to <em>Foote. </em>(The bill represented the two deeds of April 1808 and September 1816, as perfectly voluntary on <em>Mrs. Alexander\u2019s </em>part, and flowing from her bounty to her brother; but it did not impute any fraud to him in those transactions, or seek to impugn the validity of the deeds upon any ground: it seemed, that the plaintiff set forth the deeds of October 1802, December 1804, April 1808, and September 1816, by way of inducement to the allegations touching the agreement made between him and the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s conveyance of the twelve slaves to him, to corroborate his assertion that this conveyance contained a general warranty of title, and to shew the reasonableness of the relief he prayed).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\"><em>James Taliaferro, </em>in his answer, detailed at great length, the history of the transactions between him and his sister <em>Mrs. Alexander, </em>afterwards <em>Mrs. Foote; </em>and exhibited some other contracts between them, besides the deeds of April 1808 and September 1816 mentioned in the bill, connected with and explanatory of those conveyances. He asserted, that the conveyances of April 1808 and Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ber 1816, instead of being voluntary\u00ab j\u00ed tbo part of his sister, were founded on valuable and pA-'jr!.te consideration paid and performed by him; which b the reason why the deed of April 1808 contained a ryin \u2022\u00ab\u00bb! warranty of the title to him. And as to the contract b j\u00edv/ecn him and <em>Foote, </em>which was the foundation of the cpib i sot up in the bill, he <em>denied, </em>that his deed to <em>Foote </em>o\u00ed b&lt; 1 <em>twelve </em>slaves, contained any warranty of title; it was a simple conveyance of <em>his interest; </em>the contract consisted in mutual releases; a release by him to <em>Foote, </em>of his reversion in those slaves, and a release by <em>Foote </em>to him of his life estate in the residue of the <em>thirty-seven </em>slaves. He acknowledged, that he had procured the execution sued out by <em>W. T. Alexander\u2019s </em>creditors, to be levied on the slaves held <em>bj Foote; </em>and justified it, on the ground, that the slaves held by him had been purchased for valuable consideration, and conveyed to him with general warranty, so that the slaves held by <em>Foote </em>ought to have been subjected to the creditors of <em>Alexander, </em>before those held by him; and that he had reason to apprehend that <em>Foote </em>intended to remove the slaves he held beyond the reach of process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">The depositions of <em>Aaron Grigsby </em>and <em>John Taliaferro, </em>who were <em>both </em>present when the contract was executed between the <em>plaintiff </em>and defendant, confirmed the account given in the answer, of its nature, purpose and terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">The deponent <em>Taliaferro </em>was the person to whom (as the bill alleged) this instrument was confided, that he might have it recorded; yet the plaintiff made no inquiry of him concerning the disposition he had made of it. No affidavit that it was lost or destroyed, was annexed to the bill; nor was there any evidence, that it was in fact lost or destroyed, or otherwise not within the power of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">The chancellor decreed that <em>Taliaferro </em>should pay <em>Foote </em>the value of the twelve slaves, as ascertained by the sale of them under the execution levied on them, whereby he was evicted of the title and possession. <em>Taliaferro </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The cause was argued here, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant and <em>Harrison </em>and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellee, upon its general merits, in the discussion of which, the several contracts between <em>Taliaferro </em>and <em>Mrs. Alexander, </em>and the character and effect of them, were minutely scanned, and the question as to the probable terms of the contract between <em>Taliaferro </em>and <em>Foote, </em>and consequently the effect of that contract, examined. But <em>Johnson </em>took an objection to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery to relieve in such a case, which was held fatal.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b82-11\">He was nearly related to the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b86-4\">Care, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZF\">delivered the opinion of the court, That the case made by the bill was not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"AsM\">A good deal is said in the bill, about the deed of <em>1802, </em>the deed of 1804, the deed of 1808 and of 1816\u2014but these make no' part of the case on which relief is asked; nothing is charged with respect to them, or put in issue. If the bill had charged what has been advanced in the argument here, that the execution of the deed of 1808 was procured by <em>Taliaferro </em>from his sister <em>Mrs. Alexander, </em>by fraud, deception, or imposition, that would have given jurisdiction; but, as the case stands, that deed evidences a sale by her of a reversion, for a valuable consideration, with warranty. The bill should have stated such facts, in such a way, as would give the court jurisdiction. But the case on which the plaintiff asks relief is, in substance, this: that he became the purchaser of a parcel of slaves from the defendant, the title of which afterwards failed, and that the defendant is liable on his warranty of title, to make good to the plaintiff the damages he has sustained. <em>Prima facie, </em>this is surely a case for a court of law. The bill alleges, that the defendant gave him a deed or bill of sale of the slaves with warranty; but it does not allege, that this deed is lost or destroyed. It alleges, indeed, that it was confided to <em>John Taliaferro, </em>who promised to have it recorded; that it was not recorded or deposited in the clerk\u2019s office; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>if it was not in <em>John Taliaferro\u2019s </em>possession, the plaintiff did not know where it was to be found : but <em>John Taliaferro </em>was not made a party; no inquiry was made of him; no step taken to ascertain the loss, or to set up the instrument, if lost. And no affidavit that the instrument was lost, accompanied the bill; which is indispensible, where'a party comes into equity to set up a lost deed. In the case of the <em>East India Company </em>v. <em>Boddam, </em>9 Ves. 465. lord <em>Eldon </em>says, the course upon a lost bond, was to file the bill stating the loss, and \u201c accompanying it with an affidavit, that it was lost, not as evidence of the loss, but as a security for the propriety of jurisdictionand it is laid down in all the books which treat on the subject, that the want of this affidavit is cause of demurrer. This bill then makes no case for a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">But if it did, the case is not supported. The bill states, that the defendant gave a deed with general warranty. The defendant answering this charge directly, \u201c denies that he ever made the conveyance for slaves to the plaintiff, in the manner stated in the bill; the conveyance was for the claim of this defendant to the reversion, <em>without warranty.\u201d </em>And this assertion derives aid from the depositions of <em>John Taliaferro </em>and <em>Grigsby: but it </em>needs no such aid, being a direct and positive denial of the statement in the bill. We must take it, then, that this was a sale of the defendant\u2019s claim merely, and a deed conveying that without warranty. It was said, that every sale implied a warranty of title; and this is true, where it rests simply on the sale; but where there is a sale of a party\u2019s <em>interest </em>merely, and the deed is given without warranty, will not that rebut the implication ? At any rate, when the warranty is contended to be implied by the sale only, there can bo no propriety in coming into equity to set up a deed which contains no warranty: the resort should clearly have been to a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Decree reversed with costs, and bill dimissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
