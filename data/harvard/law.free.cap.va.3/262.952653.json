A merchant in <em>Philadelphia </em>writes to his debtor in <em>Clarksburg, </em>reminding him that his debt has been due for some time; and saying: \u201cWe must request you to remit the amount.\u201d Heed. This did not authorize the admission of evidence of a local usage or understanding, to give a meaning to the terms of the letter different from that which they obviously bore.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b282-9\">8. Whether a remittance of money by mail is the usual mode, when a creditor directs his debtor to remit money to him generally, without prescribing the mode, is a question of fact to be ascertained by a jury, and not to be decided by the Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b282-10\">3. A general direction by a creditor to his debtor to remit money to him, without prescribing the mode, does not authorize the debtor to remit by mail at the risk of the creditor. But such directions must be specific, both as to the mode of remittance, and the subject to be remitted, before it can be made at the risk of the creditor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-11\">This was an action of debt brought in the Circuit Superior Court of <em>Harrison </em>county, by <em>Gross, Myers 8f </em>Moore, merchants of <em>Philadelphia, </em>against <em>Aaron Criss,' </em>a merchant in the county of <em>Harrison. </em>The action was founded on a promissory note, dated the 9th of July 1839, and payable at six months, for 347 dollars 53 cents, given by the defendant to the plaintiffs in <em>Philadelphia, </em>for goods there purchased of them. The defendant pleaded payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-12\">On the trial, after the plaintiffs had introduced their proofs, the defendant introduced as evidence a letter from the plaintiffs to him, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-13\"><em>Philadelphia, </em>June 29th, 1840.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-14\">\n<em>Mr. Aaron Criss.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-15\">Sir,\u2014Allow us to call your attention to your note due to us the 9th of January last. We are willing to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>every allowance for the times, but as we sold the goods on six months, and the bill has now been really twelve months, we must request you to remit the amount. If we really did not want the money we should not trouble you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">Yours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-10\">\n<em>Gross, Myers if Moore.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">He farther proved, that on the 24th of July 1840, he deposited in the postoilice at <em>Clarksburg, </em>the residence of the defendant, a sealed letter addressed to the plaintiffs in <em>Philadelphia, </em>containing 96 dollars in bank notes current in <em>Clarksburg, </em>and which were usually at that time received by merchants in <em>Philadelphia </em>for goods, and in discharge of debts. And he also proved, that said letter had been duly forwarded by mail from <em>Clarksburg, to </em>be applied towards the payment of the debt sued on in that case. And he farther offered proof, that it was the usage and custom of merchants in <em>Philadelphia </em>and <em>Clarksburg, </em>when a creditor merchant of <em>Philadelphia </em>instructed his debtor merchant of <em>Clarksburg </em>to remit to him on account of the indebtedness of the latter to the former, that such instruction implied that the remittance might be by the usual way of the public mail, and that the remittance umuld be at the risk of the creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">To the introduction of this evidence of usage, the plaintiffs objected, but the Court overruled the objection; and suffered the evidence to go to the jury: and instructed the jury, that where a creditor directs his debtor to remit to him money generally, without prescribing the mode of remittance, that a remittance by mail, being the usual mode, will be at the risk of the creditor. To the opinion of the Court admitting the evidence, and to the instruction given to the jury, the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of 262 dollars 83 cents, with interest from the 24th of July 1840, till paid; on which the Court gave judgment, and then the plaintiffs applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">The cause was argued in this Court by <em>Lee, </em>for the appellants, and <em>William A. Harrison, </em>for the appellee.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AOD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u25a0 It seems to the Court that the letter from the plaintiffs in error made part of the bill of exceptions, was not intended to make any change in the legal obligations of the parties; that the request to remit the amount without specifying the mode of remittance, or the subject to be remitted, did not authorize the debtor to transmit the amount to the creditor through the mail at the risk of the creditor; that the meaning of the terms used is plain and unequivocal, importing a demand of payment of a debt which had beeu due for some time, and nothing more ; and it was not proper to admit evidence of a local usage or understanding, to give a different meaning to the terms of the letter. It therefore seems to the Court here, that the said Circuit Court erred in permitting evidence of such usage and custom between the merchants of <em>Philadelphia </em>and <em>Clarksburg, </em>in the bill of exceptions set forth, to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">It also seems to the Court, that the instruction given to the jury, \u201c that where a creditor directs his debtor to remit to him money generally, without prescribing the mode, of remittance, that a remittance by mail, being the usual mode, will be-at the risk of the creditor,\u201d was erroneous, because first, the Court has assumed to decide the question of fact that a remittance by mail is the usual mode, instead of leaving it to the jury upon the proof, if the evidence had been proper; and secondly, in deciding as a question of law, that a remittance by mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>in pursuance of such general directions could properly be made at the risk of the creditor: this Court being of opinion that such directions should be specific both as to the mode of remittance and- the subject to be remitted, before it can be made at the risk of the creditor: and that in the absence of such specific directions, the request to remit generally imported no more than a demand of payment according to the legal obligation of the contract. Therefore reversed with costs ; verdict set aside, and cause remanded for a new trial, upon which the evidence set forth in the first bill of exceptions as to proof of usage and custom as therein mentioned, is not to be received, and the instructions to the jury if asked for, are not to be given.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
