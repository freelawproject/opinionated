From this judgment <em>Newby </em>applied to this Court for a supersedeas, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-4\">The cause was argued in writing by <em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant, and <em>Price, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Leigh.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axqq\">I. The first objection to the judgment is, that the writing obligatory set out on <em>oyer </em>is wholly variant from that set out in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">The declaration counts on, and makes <em>profert </em>of a writing obligatory, whereby <em>Newby \u201c </em>acknowledged himself indebted to <em>Foi-syth, </em>in the sum of 675 dollars, for so much money by <em>Forsyth </em>theretofore paid for and on behalf of <em>Newby, </em>and to be paid by the said <em>Newby </em>to the said <em>Forsyth, </em>in twelve months from the date of the said writing obligatory.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">The deed set out on <em>oyer </em>is endorsed on a title bond given by <em>M. W. Chaplin </em>and others, reciting that <em>Newby </em>had purchased four lots, numbers 9, 17, 18 and 19, in <em>South Wheeling, </em>of which sum he had paid 675 dollars, and given his four bonds to the vendors for 675 dollars each, payable, with legal interest, on the 14th October 1836-\u201937-\u201938 and \u201939; in consideration of which, the vendors bound themselves to convey the premises to him on payment of the purchase money. On this paper is endorsed the writing obligatory on which the suit is brought, dated the 8th December 1836, and it imports, that \u201c <em>Forsyth </em>having made, for and on behalf of <em>Newby, </em>the first payment mentioned in the title bond, of 675 dollars to <em>M. Wilson </em>for himself and as attorney in fact, and the said <em>Forsyth </em>being willing to extend the time of payment for twelve months from the date ; now, to secure the said <em>Forsyth </em>the sum of 675 dollars as aforesaid, also the sum of 25 dollars paid to the said <em>Newby </em>by <em>Marcus Wilson, </em>making 700 dollars;\u201d <em>New-by </em>\u201c gave and granted to the said <em>Forsyth </em>a lien on the lots 9, 17, 18 and 19, named in the title bond, as secix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ritv for the payment to the said <em>Forsyth </em>of the 700 dollari aforesaid.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAl\">_ Now, it is obvious, that the only part of this deed, which can by possibility be regarded as an <em>acknowledgment of indebtedness, </em>and the only part of it set out as such acknowledgment in the declaration, is the <em>recital </em>in the instrument; and the <em>recital </em>states a debt of 700 dollars, instead of a debt of 675 dollars claimed in the declaration. It may be said, that this is to the prejudice of the plaintiff below, and the counsel for the appellant admits that it is so ; but, still there is a variance in respect to the sum demanded, which is fatal. <em>Rann </em>v. <em>Green, </em>1 Cowp. 474; <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Doug. 664, and the note at the end of the last case. <em>Bennet </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>6 Leigh 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-6\">But there is a more substantial variance in this case. The declaration separates the <em>recital </em>of the instrument from the <em>positive contract </em>which it contains, and treats the <em>recital, </em>not the <em>positive contract, </em>as the obligation. The purpose of the contract was, that <em>Newby </em>thereby gave a mortgage, or a covenant to give a mortgage of real estate, to secure the debt recited to have been incurred by <em>Newby, </em>not to give a bond for the debt; but the declaration treats this paper as <em>Newby's </em>bond for the money which <em>Forsyth </em>had paid for him. But it is not a bond for the debt\u2014it contains no covenant, no promise to pay the debt, and no formal acknowledgment of the debt: the debt remained a <em>simple contract, </em>notwithstanding this instrument. <em>Ancaster </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>1 Bro. C. R. 454; <em>Powell's ex'or </em>v. <em>White, </em>11 Leigh 309. The declaration disregards the <em>positive contract </em>imported by the instrument, and takes no notice of it <em>whatever, </em>but counts on the <em>recital </em>as an obligation. This is a <em>fatal variance </em>between the declaration and the instrument declared on, and set out on <em>oyer.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-10\">In this case, the declaration made <em>profer\u00ed </em>of the writing <em>obligatory; Newby </em>craved <em>oyer </em>of it, and it was <em>set </em>out at large, and then he demurred generally. And this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>was the proper, and indeed the only mode, by which advantage could be taken of the variance. 1 Rob. Pr. 159 ; <em>Macon </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>1 Call <em>500; Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>1 Leigh 491; <em>Bennet\u2019s ex'or </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>6 Leigh 316.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">II. Supposing the objection to the variance out of the. way, <em>debt </em>does not lie on this instrument, which is either a mortgage of real property to secure a debt, or a covenant to give such mortgage. If it was a mortgage, the remedy was a bill in equity to foreclose the mortgage. If it Avas a covenant to mortgage property to secure the debt, an action of covenant lay on the instrument, but no action of debt lay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">III. When <em>Forsyth </em>paid the 675 dollars for Newby, <em>Newby </em>thereby became indebted to him by <em>simple contract </em>for the money ; and I have already shewn that the <em>mere recital </em>of such indebtedness in a deed binding <em>Newby </em>to give a mortgage of real estate, and purporting to mortgage real estate, to secure payment of the debt, did not change the nature of the <em>simple contract debt, </em>and make it a <em>specialty debt, </em>but that it remained still a <em>simple contract debt, </em>and was liable to be barred as such by the statute of limitations, and to all the other consequences of its <em>simple contract </em>character. But in the manner in which the declaration treats this instrument, by separating the <em>recital </em>from the <em>positive contract, </em>and regarding the <em>recital </em>as a deed acknowledging a debt, the' instrument is perverted from its <em>object; </em>that which was intended to be its only object, is wholly concealed from view, and it is made to be a simple obligation to pay money, which the parties never intended it to be. A party, in pleading a deed, may represent it according to its legal effect, but he cannot plead it as having an effect directly contrary to its intent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALd\">\n<em>Price.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEI\">The only question made in this case is, that the Court erred in overruling the demurrer to the declaration. after the bond had been set out upon <em>oyer. </em>And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>three propositions are urged in support of this point. First. If the suit could be maintained at all, it ought to have been brought for 700 dollars instead of 675 dollars; and that there was a variance between the bond and declaration, in not describing it as a bond for that amount. This, however, appears to me to be a misapprehension. The sum of 675 dollars was all that was due to <em>Mr. Forsyth; </em>the additional sum of 25 dollars was due to <em>Marcus Wilson ; </em>the property was therefore mortgaged to <em>Mr. Forsyth </em>to secure himself the sum of 675 dollars, and <em>Mr. Wilson </em>the sum of 25 dollars due him. A suit for 700 dollars could not have been maintained in the name of <em>Forsyth. </em>This is the obvious import of the instrument. Secondly. Was the obligation otherwise misdescribed ? The plaintiff need not set out the whole instrument in his declaration. He should only set out the legal effect of it: and this may be done without using one word used in the deed. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 353-4; <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Borough, </em>2 Salk. R. 658; Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, in <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Doug. R. 667, that <em>\u201c </em>in an action founded on a deed, the plaintiff need not state more than that part which is necessary to entitle him to recover.\u201d 1 Chitty p. 299, 302, 303. In an action of 'debt upon an award, it has been often decided that the plaintiff need not shew any more of the award than makes for him. <em>Hodsden </em>v. <em>Harridge, </em>2 Saund. R. 62, note 5; <em>M\u2019Kinstry </em>v. <em>Solomons, </em>2 John. R. 57; <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Malcom, 8 </em>Leigh 608. In the case of <em>Rann </em>v. <em>Green, </em>2 Cowp. R. 474, cited by <em>Mr. Leigh, </em>the declaration misdescribed the statute upon which the action was founded; and Lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, <em>\u201c </em>the Court will always incline to lean against niceties in matters of variance, but where it is the description of a <em>statute </em>or <em>record </em>it is fatal.\u201d I think there was no material variance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">Can debt be sustained upon the instrument ? The rule, as I understand it, is that any acknowledgment of a debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>in a written instrument is sufficient to maintain the action. As \u201cif'a man by deed acknowledge that he hath so much money of <em>J. S.\u2019s, </em>due to him, in his hands, though here is no contract of borrowing between them, yet <em>j </em>may have an action of debt against him.\u201d 2 Bac. Abr. 279, Debt A, note a, citing 11 H. VI., 39; Com. Dig. Debt A, 4; 7 Vin. Abr. Debt K, pi. 12, p. 343. The case of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Rouse, </em>15 Wend. R. 218, is very similar to this, and the general doctrine is there laid down and commented on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-4\">It may not be amiss to examine the instrument a little, which was set out upon <em>oyer. </em>I understand it to say that <em>Newby </em>acknowledges that <em>Forsyth </em>had paid for him 675 dollars (and this appears to me to be an acknowledgment of a debt). \u201c <em>Forsyth </em>is willing to extend the time of payment twelve months.\u201d (It is plain then, that the money was to be repaid.) \u201cNow, to secure <em>Forsyth, </em>I give to him a lien on the lots as security for the payment,\u201d &amp;c. The essence of the contract was that <em>Newby </em>owed <em>Forsyth </em>675 dollars for money paid for him: and to <em>secure </em>the repayment he gave <em>Forsyth </em>a mortgage upon the lots. Is there then any essential difference between this case and the case cited of <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Rouse, </em>15 Wend. R. 218 ? And is it not almost exactly similar to the case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>commented on by Judge <em>Tucker, </em>in 11 Leigh 318, citing Dyer 22 b? <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Fawcett </em>was so plain that the Court would not allow an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">The case of <em>Powell </em>v. <em>White, </em>11 Leigh 309, cited by <em>Mr. Leigh, </em>is not a case in point. There the deed was given to secure an endorser against a contingent liability. There was no acknowledgment of a debt, for there was no debt, and there might never be any.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b334-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ASa\">Affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
