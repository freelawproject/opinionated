On the trial of the issue, the plaintiffs proved that a certain <em>Obadiah Smith </em>died in the year 1765, seised in fee of the land in the declaration mentioned, leaving three sons, William, (his eldest and heir at law,) <em>Samuel </em>and <em>John; </em>and they produced the will of William, the heir at law, made and proved in North Carolina, and thence certified to the County Court of Henrico, where it was duly admitted to probate, and recorded; whereby the laud was devised to the plaintiffs. The defendants, on their part, produced the certificate of the probate of the last will and testament of the same <em>Obadiah </em>Smith, in Henrico Comity Court, in October, 1765. This certificate ivas duly authenticated, and it states that the will was proved by the oath of the <em>witnesses </em>thereto. It %vas admitted that the Henrico <em>will-book </em>of the year 1765, and for some time before and after, along with sundry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>other papers and records, were destroyed by the public enemy during the war of the revolution. And then the defendants offered parol evidence to prove the contents of <em>Obadiah Smith\u2019s </em>will, mentioned in the certificate of probate, so far as the same respected the lands in controversy; and that that will contained a devise thereof to that testator\u2019s son <em>John, </em>in fee simple, under whom the defendants claimed title. To the introduction of this parol evidence, the plaintiffs objected; but the Court over-ruled the objection, and admitted the evidence; and the plaintiffs excepted to the opinion. A verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-4\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellants, took three objections:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-5\">1. That parol evidence of a will of lands, is not admissible. The will in question, if destroyed, could only be supplied in the mode pointed out in the act of Assembly, relative to records that have been destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arb\">2. That, in this case, the defendants did not offer proof of possession under an alledged will, but attempted to set up the will itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">3. That at least it was the duty of the defendants to attempt to set up the will in Chancery, by an issue of <em>devisavit vel non. Brent v. Doe, </em>Gilm. 211.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-9\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACm\">said that <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>was the case of a suppressed will, which had never been admitted to record. But the question is, whether after a will has been recorded, parol evidence can be admitted to prove its contents, in' case of its destruction. The fact of its having been recorded is established by the certificate. A will is, in this respect, on the same footing as a deed, in which case, parol evidence would undoubtedly be admitted. The act of Assembly, 1 <em>Rev. Code, </em>515, 516, does not repeal the general rule of evidence. The remedy there given is <em>cumulative. </em>If it had the effect contended for, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>repeal the <em>equitable, </em>as well as the <em>common law, </em>jurisdiction. The case of <em>Bagwell </em>v. <em>Elliott, 2 </em>Rand. 190, is unlike this case, because here there was a probate. Copies of records may be read in evidence. 1 <em>Phill. Evid. </em>309, 310; <em>Ib. 398.</em></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b181-4\"><em>February </em>17.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ae7\">Judges Coalter and Cabell, were of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b181-5\">The President:</author>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">This is not the case of setting up a will by proving ii before a jury. In this case, the will was regularly proved in the Court of probate, as appears by the record, and afterwards destroyed by the enemy; as was also, the book In which it was recorded. The only question is, whether its loss can be supplied by parol proof of its contents before a jury. The rule is, that the best evidence that the nature of the ease will admit of, is to be received. On this principle, I think the evidence was admissible. Though parol proof of the contents of aninstrument must be generally very defective, (it being seldom possible, after a lapse of time, that the witness can recollect the precise expressions in it, or their collocation, on which its meaning often depends;) yet in aid of a long and continued possession in the defendants, and those under whom they claim, such testimony may be resorted to. It is the best evidence the nature of ihe case will admit of. The provision in the 3d section of the act for the relief of persons who may be injured by ?he destruction of records, might have been resorted to, but the remedy in that provision is only cumulative, and does not deprive the party of any pre-existing remedy, by changing the rules of evidence at the common law. I hm.!,:, therefore, that the judgment ought to be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\"> Judges Carr, and Green, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
