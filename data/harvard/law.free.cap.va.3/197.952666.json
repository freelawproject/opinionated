Hendricks </em>gave a notice to <em>Isaac 'Fuller </em>and <em>Benjamin Shoemaker, </em>sureties of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>David Serjeant, </em>late a constable of <em>Russell </em>county, that would on the 27th day of January 1844, move <em>Thomas Dickinson, </em>a justice of said county, for judgments agajnst them upon a number of claims, of which the notice contained a list, which had been placed' in the hands of Serjeant, then a constable of the county of <em>Russell; </em>and which claims the notice alleged <em>Serjeant </em>had collected, and failed to pay as the law directs-..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\">When the case came on before the justice, he gave a separate judgment upon each claim, against the sureties <em>; </em>the aggregate amount of which judgments was above 600 dollars. <em>Shoemaker </em>then applied to the Judge of the Superior Court of <em>Russell </em>county for a writ of prohibition, forbidding <em>Hendricks </em>and all others, from proceeding on these judgments. The ground on which the prohibition was asked is, that the justice had not jurisdiction to give these judgments, amounting to six or seven hundred dollars, on one notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\">The writ of prohibition was granted; and when the case came on to be heard before the Superior Court, the writ was made absolute. Prom this judgment <em>Hendricks, </em>having had the facts spread upon the record, applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-11\">B. <em>R. Johnston, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-12\">The first act authorizing a motion against a constable, was the act of 1803, Old Rev. Code, vol. 2, p. 4. This authorizes a motion before a justice of the peace. The act of December 23d, 1806, Id. p. 14, gives the motion against a constable\u2019s sureties ,\u2022 but it was to be made to the County Court, which was to decide it without limitation or appeal, though there might be cases amounting to more than 50 dollars, the sum, then sufficient, to authorize an appeal from that Court. The act of 1819, 1 Rev. Code, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 31, p. 253, transfers the jurisdiction to the justice. On the plain terms of this law, the jurisdiction is exclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>In this case, although there is but one writing, there is a notice in several cases, each of which was to be heard separately, and depended upon distinct proof; and in which there was necessarily a separate judgment. And the aggregate amount of all the judgments cannot have any effect upon the jurisdiction of the justice, unless the Court is prepared to say that no man shall have two claims in the hands of a constable at the same time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-5\">The <em>Attorney General, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">The responsibility of the sureties of a constable is by bond. If this responsibility is enforced by a suit upon the bond, the first judgment is for the penalty, and the proceeding to enforce any subsequent liability is by <em>scire facias: </em>and when an amount equal to the penalty is reached, the sureties are no farther responsible. - But if these sureties are to be subjected to the payment of hundreds or thousands of dollars, on such a receipt as that given in this case, by motion before a justice of the peace, whose Court is not a Court of Record, they must be exposed to great inconvenience and loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">The general rule is, that if there are several causes of action which may be united, they shall be united; and the action shall be brought in a Court of Record, where the parties may have counsel and an enduring record of the case. See <em>Hutson </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>2 Va. Cas. 42; Bac. Abr. Prohibition, letter K; 1 Ventr. R. 65, 73; 2 Keeble\u2019s R. 617. But this act giving jurisdiction to the justice to hear the motion on notice, is violative of this principle of the common law, and should therefore be construed to apply to cases where the sum is under 20 dollars, which is the general limitation of the jurisdiction of a justice, 1 Rev. Code, \u00a7 20, p. 151, leaving the party to proceed in other cases in the proper Court.

Code, p. 253-4, the party injured by the failure' of a constable to pay over money received by him on an execution issued by a justice of the peace, may recover the same, with interest and costs, by motion against the constable and his securities; and any justice of the peace of the county in the Court of which such constable\u2019s official bond is deposited, is empowered to hear such motion, and render judgment thereon. The jurisdiction thus conferred upon the justice does not in any wise depend upon the value of the execution or of the judgment upon which it has been issued; nor can it be at all affected by the circumstance that the party prosecutiug such motion is at the same time entitled to and actually prosecuting other motions against the same constable and his securities, before the same or any other justice, founded upon the failure of such constable to pay over other moneys received by him upon other like executions. The remedy being given for each separate default of the officer, the jurisdiction of the justice cannot in any instance be ousted by the number or' aggregate pecuniary amount of the several defaults. And the Court is further of opinion, that in the present case the motions before the justice, and his judgments thereupon in the proceedings mentioned, having been separate and distinct, it is no objection to the jurisdiction .which lie exercised, that said motions were prosecuted under one joint notice. The Court is therefore of opinion, that the Circuit Court ought not to have awarded the prohibition sought by the defendant in error, which opinion renders it unnecessary to consider the other alleged grounds of error in the judgment of the Circuit Court. Wherefore it is considered by the Court, that the said judgment of the Circuit Court be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>reversed and annulled, and that the plaintiff in error recover against the defendant in error his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>here. And this Court proceeding to render such judgment as the Circuit Court ought to have rendered, it is further considered, that the rule upon which said prohibition was founded be discharged, and the petition therefor <em>dismissed; </em>and that the defendant therein recover against the plaintiff therein his costs expended in the defence thereof. Which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
