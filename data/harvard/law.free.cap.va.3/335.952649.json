Fon</em>taine, the parties executed a deed, by which <em>Mrs. Fon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>taine </em>conveyed certain property of her own to a trustee, uP\u00b0n trust that Perkins, during the joint lives of himself and his wife, should take and enjoy all the interest an(l profits thereby conveyed, to and for his own use an(^ benefit: but that neither the property conveyed, whether real or personal, nor the profits nor interest arising from the same, should in any manner be liable to be taken by process of law to pay any debt of <em>Perkins\u2019 </em>due, or thereafter to become due, either previous to or after the said marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">The deed further provided that if <em>Mrs. Perkins </em>survived, the property should be conveyed to her; if Per<em>kins </em>survived, he should enjoy it for his life, exempt from the payment of his debts. And <em>Mrs. Perkins </em>was authorized to dispose of the property, notwithstanding the coverture, either by deed or will, to take effect on the death of <em>Perkins.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">The bill charged that <em>Perkins </em>concealed the profits of the property, so that they could not be taken to satisfy his creditors; and the plaintiffs therefore asked the interposition of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQX\"><em>William Perkins </em>answered, saying, that at the time of his marriage he was greatly embarrassed, and unable to pay his debts: that <em>Mrs. Perkins </em>was then fully apprised of this fact; and it was her purpose to protect her estate for her own use, against his debts, by the deed which she then executed: and he insists, that by the true construction of the deed, the property is protected. He further answered, that he was a discharged bankrupt, and exhibited an attested copy of his discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">When the cause came on to be heard, the Court made a decree placing the trust property in the hands of a receiver ; and directing him out of the issues and profits thereof, to pay off the plaintiffs\u2019 debt; and then to restore the property to the trustee. From this decree, <em>Mrs. Perkins\u2019 </em>trustee applied to this Court for an appeal, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-3\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APqG\">delivered the c opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A6uB\">The Court is of opinion, that the deed of settlement r ^ 7 4 in the proceedings mentioned, having been made in contemplation of marriage between a single woman, and her intended husband, who was, as is alleged in the bill, at that time insolvent, and embracing the property of the intended wife alone, and providing that neither the property or the profits or interest arising th\u00e9refrom should be liable for the debts of the intended husband then due or thereafter to be contracted or become due, should in a Court of Equity receive such construction, consistent with the terms of the deed, as will effectuate the leading intent of the parties. The leading intent of the deed was to secure the enjoyment of the property to the intended wife and her family, including the husband, free from the claim of his creditors; and therefore all idea of a property in the intended husband, in and to the settled subject, during the coverture, is excluded by the express terms of the deed. Consequently no right was acquired, nor is any pretended, to seize or sell the subject itself, by virtue of the judgment and execution in the proceedings mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The Court is further of opinion, that taking all the provisions of the deed together, the clause that the intended husband should take and enjoy the interest and profits to and for his own use and benefit during the joint lives of himself and wife, controlled as it is by the provision exempting such profits and interest from all liability for his debts, and the other considerations before adverted to, is equivalent to a provision that they should enjoy the interest and profits of the property settled, jointly during their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">The admitted insolvency of the intended husband, the fact that the property settled was the sole property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of the wife, and the express provision exempting the \u00bb profits as well as the property from the debts of the intended husband, shew clearly that it was intended to secure the enjoyment of the profits during the coverture, for the maintainance of the wife and her family, including the husband, and not merely to secure the property itself in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The Court is further of opinion, that even if the terms of the deed, owing to want of skill, or mistake in the draftsman, should have failed to carry out the clear intent of the parties, as manifested on the face of the deed, coupled with the admitted insolvency of the intended husband, those circumstances furnish a sufficient reason for the refusal of a Court of Equity to interfere and defeat the clear intent of the parties by sequestrating the profits; and for leaving the creditor to his legal remedies, if he has any, to pursue such profits after they shall have been actually received by the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">On these grounds, and without noticing the objection arising out of the bankrupt law, the Court is of opinion to reverse the decree with costs ; and proceeding to render such decree \u00e1s the Court below should have done, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the bill be dismissed, but without costs, and without prejudice to any proceedings the appellees may at any time institute, for the purpose of charging any contingent interest of the said <em>William Perkins sen\u2019r, </em>arising under the deed aforesaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
