Robertson, </em>instituted a suit for the balance of the account due from the plaintiff to the said firm, and recovered a judgment for upwards of 900/.: that the plaintiff' being prevented, at law, from going into the state of the transactions with the preceding partnership, though the said <em>Robertson </em>holds in his hands their funds, being not only executor of <em>Brown, </em>but agent and receiver of <em>Boyd Miller, </em>the surviving partner, as it is said, of <em>William Brown 8? Co. </em>and who resides in Great Britain: that the changes in the designation of the concerns were but nominal, and there was the same succession of interest, and the same parties were concerned, though not named, when the firm of <em>Brown 8? Robertson </em>commenced. The bill, therefore, prayed, that the said <em>Robertson </em>might be compelled to exhibit the books of the various concerns in his possession: that an account might be taken before a master, relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>all the plaintiff\u2019s dealings, and just and proper allowances made for his produce, and for interest on the balances: and that the said <em>Robertson </em>might be injoined from proceeding on the said judgment, it being in reality for the benefit of <em>William Brown </em>4\u2019 <em>Co. </em>&amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">An injunction was awarded until the further order of the Court, upon the plaintiff\u2019s releasing errors, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\"><em>Robertson </em>answered, admitting that the plaintiff commenced dealings, many years before, with a firm of which <em>William Brown </em>was a partner, and continued those dealings with the various successions of firms, which the accounts exhibited indicate; but he denied, that the several changes in the names of those firms, were changes in names only, and not in partners. Ho admitted, however, that as it regarded the plaintiff\u2019s accounts, all the various firms, from the commencement to the firm of <em>William Brown </em>4\u2019 <em>Co. </em>might be considered as one, because the accounts of each preceding firm were regularly transferred to the succeeding. In all these firms, the respondent had no interest whatever. The firm of <em>Brown </em>4\u2019 <em>Robertson </em>was a dis tinct firm. In that, the respondent had an <em>actual, </em>not a <em>nominal, </em>interest. He had no knowledge of the contract between the plaintiff and <em>Broivn, </em>as set forth in iho bill, by which the former was to be put on the footing of the most favored customer. The accounts between the plaintiff and the firm of <em>William Brown </em>4* <em>Co. </em>and the preceding firms, were, as the respondent believed, frequently settled between them; as the accounts exhibited by the plaintiff, would shew. No injustice was done to the plaintiff, by allowing him credits for his tobacco, at smaller prices than he was entitled to. The respondent protested against the propriety of opening the accounts between the plaintiff and <em>William Brown </em>4\u2019 <em>Co. </em>after this great lapso of time, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">The accounts were referred to a commissioner,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-7\">The other defendants answered</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The commissioner imported a balance due to Irvine, and thg defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK4-\">The Court dissolved the injunction; and on a hearing, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill, on the ground that, admitting the allegation of the bill, \u201c no settlement ever took place;\u201d yet as it is thereby admitted, that the accounts referred to were rendered from time to time, to the plaintiff, and that he held the possession of them, until they were filed as a part of the present bill, without making any objection, he should not, at this distance of time, be allowed, under all the circumstances of this case, to complain; but should be regarded as having consented to the accounts, as correct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b564-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj9\">contested the principle on which the Chancellor decided this cause, and cited <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ruffin, 2 Atk. </em>113; <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Vowdrey, </em>Ib. 119; <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Brownell, 2 </em>Bro.

The accounts were altogether kept by the several firms with which the plaintiff had dealings; but they were rendered to the plaintiff from year to year, from the year 17.93 to the year 1807, the balances struck, and additional credits given for short credits in the price of produce delivered by the plaintiff, interest, &amp;c.; within which period, in 1806, he, in anger, left off his dealings; and in August, 1807, paid <em>$ </em>700, which was nearly the balance of the account exhibited; from all which, it is strongly to be inferred, that the parties consented to them. However that might be, it was his duty to examine them; and if he had objections, to make them; the more especially, at the times when the firm with which he dealt was changed, and the balance carried to the books of the new firm, except in the last instance. These accounts, therefore, ought to be considered in the nature of mutual accounts, kept by the parties, and settled; and subject to the settled rule in such cases, that such accounts, after an unreasonable lapse of time, unexplained by circumstances, (which ought to be very strong,) are a bar to any future <em>settlements. To keep them </em>up, some of them for more than twenty years, and all of them for more than ten years, was an acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff, which ought not to be retracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Without agreeing, therefore, with the Chancellor, that the rendition of accounts by the merchant, from year to year, was a settlement of accounts, the Court is of opinion to affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
