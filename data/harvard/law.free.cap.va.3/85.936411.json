Crawford </em>agent for <em>D. </em>Shrader,\u201d\u2014delivered the execution so indorsed to the sheriff, who proceeded to levy it on <em>Richeson\u2019s </em>property, which he had advertised for sale to satisfy the execution. The bill prayed an injunction to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>hibit the sale, and all future proceedings upon the iudge- <em>. . . 1 </em>,. , <em>* </em>, <em>\u00b0 </em>, ment; and the injunction was accordingly awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXq\"><em>Crawford, </em>in his answer, said, that the bond of <em>Thurmond </em>and <em>Richeson, </em>on which the j'udgement was recovered, had been placed by <em>Shrader </em>in his hands as an <em>agent to </em>collect the debt; and that while the bond was in suit, he had advanced and paid to one <em>Frazer, </em>who was duly authorized by <em>Shrader </em>to receive the money for him, 550 dollars, which he was to reimburse to himself out of the proceeds of the bond when collected; and <em>Shrader </em>was apprised of this advance, and agreed, that <em>Crawford </em>should retain out of the proceeds of the bond, the money so by him advanced with interest: that thus, the j'udgement on the bond, when recovered, was, by <em>Shrader\u2019s </em>agreement, a j'udgement for the benefit of <em>Crawford, to </em>the <em>extent </em>of his advances for <em>Shrader: </em>and that <em>Thurmond </em>was well informed of the transaction between <em>Shrader </em>and <em>Crawford, </em>and of the right of the latter to retain the 550 dollars with interest, out of the debt due upon the j'udgement when collected, at the time he made the contract with <em>Shrader </em>mentioned in the bill, and was tempted by an exorbitantly high price for his slaves, to combine with <em>Shrader </em>to defraud and disappoint <em>Crawford </em>of the portion of the debt due on the judgement, to which he was justly entitled; and <em>Shrader </em>immediately after receiving the property he had purchased of <em>Thurmond, </em>absconded, and carried the property with him, from <em>Virginia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>Shrader </em>did not put in an answer; and the <em>bill </em>was taken for confessed as to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">The controversy, upon the merits, turned intirely, on questions of fact, 1. as to the fairness of <em>Thurmond\u2019s </em>conduct in procuring a discharge of the judgement from <em>Shrader; </em>and 2. as to the justice of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>claim, even as between him and <em>Shrader, </em>to the money he alleged he had advanced and paid to <em>Frazer </em>for <em>Shrader, </em>and (by consequence) as to the equitable right of <em>Crawford </em>to the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>of any part of the judgement. And upon these points, there was a good deal of evidence filed by both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4yg\"><em>Crawford </em>moved the county court to dissolve the injunction; which motion being overruled, he carried the cause by appeal to the superiour court of chancery of Lynchburg, which approved the opinion of the county court, but retained the cause, and gave both parties commissions to take additional evidence; and upon the final hearing, perpetuated the injunction, with costs. From this decree <em>Crawford </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-6\">Johnson, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqT\">and <em>Leigh </em>for <em>the </em>appellees, argued the cause, chiefly, upon the merits, which depended on the questions of fact before mentioned, and the evidence relating to them. But <em>Johnson took </em>an objection to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery to relieve the appellees upon their own shewing in their bill; for, he said, supposing the facts of the case truly stated in the bill, the appellees had a complete and summary remedy at law, by motion to the county court to quash the execution. And this objection presented the only point of law in the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-7\">Cake., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">After discussing the cause upon the evidence, and determining it upon the merits for the appellees, said\u2014It was objected, that the appellees, instead of filing this bill, might have moved the county court to quash the execution; and that having this complete remedy at law, equity ought not to entertain them. It is true, that every court has a right to watch over its process, and where it has been irregularly or fraudulently executed, to quash it, as being the best and speediest mode of doing justice. But this was not a question of fraud or irregularity, in the execution of process; no officer of the court had acted improperly. The execution was taken out by Crawford, who had acted as the agent of the plaintiff <em>Shrader, </em>and was indorsed by <em>Crawford </em>for his own benefit, except as to 480 dollars; and at a date subsequent <em>to this </em>indorsement, <em>Thurmond </em>had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>obtained a complete discharge of the execution from Shra<em>der: </em>a state of things which presented several questions complicated of law and fact; as 1. the genuineness of <em>Shrader\u2019s </em>receipt and discharge to <em>Thurmond; 2. its effect </em>in law; 3. the fairness of that transaction; 4. the effect of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>indorsement, involving the question whether his agency was not destroyed by the presence and acting of the principal; 5. the equity of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>pretensions in fact and in law. Now I do not say, that the county court, sitting as a court of law, <em>could </em>not upon <em>motion, </em>in a <em>summary </em>way, try these questions: but I do say, that in that mode, it would not have afforded as saf\u00e9 or as convenient a tribunal for the trial of them, as a court 'of equity upon regular pleadings and proofs. And this consideration, it will be recollected, forms <em>one </em>of the grounds in equity for assuming jurisdictions But there is another, perhaps a stronger ground. The indorsement of the execution for <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>benefit, gave him nothing but an equitable right, which could have no weight in a court of law, belonged exclusively to equity, and must finally have brought the cause there for decision. This consideration, it will be seen, had a good deal of weight with a majority of the court, in <em>Ambler </em>v. <em>Warwick, </em>1 Leigh, 195. Taking all these things into view, I do not feel disposed to disturb the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The other judges concurred, and the decree was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
