On the trial the plaintiffs introduced the following paper with the endorsements upon it:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\"><em>Mr. William Craig </em>and <em>Matthew Blair </em>will pay to <em>Thomas Bagby </em>the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, on account of brick work done on the Institution for the education of the deaf, dumb and blind; and oblige yours, respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">October 12, 1840. <em>Wm.

Pitman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-15\">The plaintiffs then proved that they had taken the draft from <em>Pitman </em>for goods sold him. That in a few days after it was assigned to them it was presented to <em>Craig </em>the drawee, who said he had no doubt it would be perfectly good, and when money came to his hands applicable to it, which he expected in a short time, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>would pay it. That several unsuccessful applications f*ad been made to <em>Craig </em>for the money. That the draft had been presented to <em>Craig </em>by the defendant before ^ assjgnment \u00a3o the plaintiffs, when he received the same answer given to the plaintiffs. That <em>Craig Blair </em>owed <em>Donoho </em>nothing, but were agents of <em>Donoho </em>and his trustees to receive money from the visitors of the deaf, dumb and blind asylum for erecting the buildings; and to disburse it upon the orders of <em>Donoho </em>to the trustees. That <em>Craig </em>afterwards received funds, but was directed by the trustees to apply them to other more pressing claims. And before the trial it was ascertained that no funds would come to the hands of <em>Craig Blair </em>by which the draft might be discharged. This being all the evidence in the cause, the defendant, by his counsel, moved the Court to instruct the jury:\u2014 That unless they were satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiffs had, within a reasonable time after said draft had been assigned by the defendant, presented the same to <em>Craig Blair </em>for acceptance and payment ; and if neither paid or accepted, then that the plaintiffs had within a reasonable time thereafter given the defendant notice of said nonacceptance or nonpayment, that then the jury should find for the defendant. But the counsel for the defendant admitting that the object was, that the Court should instruct the jury that this was such an instrument as required demand and notice of dishonour, as bills of exchange and such like negotiable instruments, the Court refused to give the instruction ; and instructed the jury, that this was not such an instrument. And that although the plaintiffs had given no notice but by bringing their suit, unless the defendant had been injured by the delay, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, if they had in the mean tim\u00e9, used due diligence to recover the money; and had failed. To this opinion of the Court the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>The cause was then argued before the jury, and they having retired for a minute, returned into Court and asked the Court to instruct them, whether there had been unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiffs. And thereupon, the Court instructed the jury that there had not been unreasonable delay on the part of the plaintiffs. To the giving this instruction the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">The jury having found a verdict for the plaintiffs for 125 dollars, with interest from the 14th of September 1841, till paid, the Court gave judgment thereon, and the defendant applied to this Court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-6\"><em>Fultz, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-7\"><em>Michie, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b149-8\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Azr\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The Court is of opinion, that the bill or order upon which this action is founded not being negotiable under tho law merchant, the responsibility of the plaintiff in error to the defendants in error was not as endorser of a bill of exchange, but as assignor of a <em>chose in action; </em>and consequently that it was not incumbent upon the defendants in error to give notice to the plaintiff in error of the nonacceptance or nonpayment by the drawees of the said bill or order. And that the drawees in said bill or order not being personally liable for the payment thereof, the plaintiff in error had no means of coercing such payment from them, and could only obtain the same by the voluntary act of the drawees; and therefore, that their recourse against the plaintiff in error, as assignor, could not be lost but by their neglect to obtain such voluntary payment when it was in their power to do so. The Court is therefore of opinion that there was no error to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error, in the refusal of the Circuit Court to give the instruction asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>for by the plaintiff in error, or in the instruction actually given to the jury, as stated in the first bill of exceptions. And the Court is further of opinion, that the instruction given to the jury, stated in the second bill of exceptions, aPPears t0 kave been founded upon the facts set forth, and the instruction stated in the first bill of exceptions, and imports that there had been no unreasonable delay on the part of the defendants in error in giving notice to the plaintiff in error of the nonacceptance or nonpayment by the drawees of the said bill or order; and therefore, inasmuch as no such notice was incumbent on the defendants in error, there, was no error to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error in the instruction stated in the second bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
