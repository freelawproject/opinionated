The bill states, that the said street runs by the complainant\u2019s house and lot; and that the ground which the defendant is digging, under pretense of levelling the said street, will weaken and injure the foundation of his said house, and greatly lessen the value of his property, and make it necessary, in order to get from the complainant\u2019s house into the street, to have divers steps made, to descend the hank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">The injunction Was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">The answer of <em>Beveridge </em>states, that the defendant, as early as the year 1814, did cause to be cut down one side of the street, on which the house of the complainant is situated, that is, the side next the defendant\u2019s property, with the free consent of the complainant, who then undertook to cut down and graduate the other side, so as to suit his own views; but in a way to give regularity and uniformity to the street, which, as then left, was in an unsafe and unseemly state; that, after waiting so long a time for the complainant to comply with his undertaking, the defendant proceeded, at his own expense, to take down the other side of the said street, at which the complainant expressed much anger, pretending that he was fearful that his property would be injured by the manner in which the work would be done; that to relieve him from that apprehension, the defendant directed his labourers not to approach nearer to the building of the complainant, than ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>feet, leaving the slope to be made of so much on that side 0f the street, by the complainant, in .any manner he might choose; and in this way, the work was going on, until stopped by the injunction of the complainant; that the house of the complainant is situate on a lot at the intersection of the main and a cross street; and the main street having been previously cut down, the defendant, was bringing the cross street nearly to its level, so as to form a gentle slope down the cross street over the main one, or down it, corresponding with the face of the circumjacent grounds; that the defendant was greatly incommoded by the abruptness of the street, in his business, which was mercantile; and the digging contributed to remove this inconvenience, without injuring the complainant; that the complainant himself assisted the defendant in cutting down the bank, after he had commenced the work; and he prays-that the injunction may be dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">A motion was made to dissolve the injunction, and denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">Depositions were taken, which established that the distance from the place where <em>Beveridge </em>was digging, to the property of <em>Lacey, </em>was ten feet and a half, and that <em>Beveridge </em>gave positive orders to his servant, not to dig nearer to <em>Lacey\u2019s </em>property, than the distance above mentioned; that the said digging would be a benefit to the street and the public at large, as it was dangerous, on account of \u25a0the high bank, for carriages and waggons to passs; that the main street had been cut down before by the road company, which had left a high bank to be ascended, in getting into the cross street, between <em>Lacey\u2019s </em>and <em>Beveridge\u2019s </em>property; that the cutting would not have diminished the value of <em>Lacey\u2019s </em>property, but, on the contrary, would enhance it; that <em>Lacey </em>consented, that <em>Beveridge </em>might dig to a certain mark, which he has not encroached upon, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">The .Court decreed, on a final hearing, that the injunction be perpetuated, and that each party should pay his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>own costs; from which decision, the defendant <em>Beveridge </em>appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-4\">Leigh, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">The nuisance complained of is a <em>public </em>nuisance, and the party complaining, must shew a specific injury to <em>himself, </em>or he cannot support his application to a Court of Equity. <em>Hind\u2019s Ch. Prac. </em>591 The evidence proves, that so far from an <em>injury, </em>it is a <em>benefit </em>to <em>Lacey. </em>No individual has a right to obstruct improvements, which are to produce a public benefit. This work is not a nuisance, because nothing deserves that name, which renders a street more commodious. 3 <em>Bac. Abr. tit. \u201c </em>Highways,\u201d letter E. p. 497. Besides, wherever there are trustees appointed, the Court of Chancery never interposes; and here there were trustees. <em>Atto. Gen. </em>v. Found<em>ling Hospital, 4 </em>Bro. Ch.

It interferes on the ground of private injury only. There is, in the present case, no such injury, either actually sustained, or justly apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The decree is therefore reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b77-10\"> Judges Brooke and Carr, absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
