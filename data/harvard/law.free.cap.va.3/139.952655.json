Moore </em>as the administrator of <em>Isaac Moore </em>deceased, and the other heirs and distributees of <em>Isaac </em>Moore, in which <em>he </em>charged, that <em>Jacob Moore </em>was indebted to him in four several sums of money; and (hat he had removed from the State of <em>Virginia. </em>That his father <em>Isaac Moore </em>had departed this life intestate, leaving a large real and personal estate, <em>of </em>which the said <em>Jacob </em>was entitled <em>to </em>a part as heir and distributee. He therefore prayed that <em>James J. Moore </em>the administrator of <em>Isaac </em>Moore, might be compelled to settle his accounts as administrator of <em>Isaac Moore, </em>and that his debts might be satisfied out of <em>Jacob Moore\u2019s portion of the estate.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">The administrator and heirs answered the bill, and insisted that <em>Jacob Moore </em>had received from his father in his lifetime his full share of his father\u2019s estate ; and they relied upon a receipt given by the said <em>Jacob </em>to <em>Isaac Moore. </em>This receipt bears date December 30th, 1330, and says, <em>\u201c </em>Settled and received this day in full of my father <em>Isaac Moore, </em>the full amount of my porlion of legacy from him, including all former receipts and settlements.

The Court therefore, referred the cause to a commissioner of the Court, to settle the administration account of <em>James J. Moore, </em>and also state au account of the advancements made by <em>Isaac Moore </em>to all or any of his children, and heirs at law, and the distributive share of each in the personal estate, and the share of each in the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">The commissioner made a report which, upon the supposition that the receipt of <em>Jacob Moore </em>was not evidence of full advancement to him by his father, charged him with 400 dollars, proved to have been received by <em>him; </em>and shewed him entitled from both the real and personal estate to 1545 dollars 42|- cents, with interest on 1344 dollars 12\u00bf- cents, from the 9th of January 1838, until paid; and shewed him indebted to <em>Matthew White </em>in the sum of 914 dollars 3| cents, with interest on 560 dollars 97f- cents, from the same date. The evidence taken before the commissioner proved that there had been other advancements to <em>Jacob Moore, </em>but as no amount could be specified, they were omitted by the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>On the 8th of February 1838, the cause came on again to be heard, when the Court confirmed the report, and made a decree in favour of <em>White </em>against <em>Jacob Moore </em>. - for the amount reported by the commissioner. And, upon the seeming admission that the proceeds of the whole estate, real and personal, were in the hands of the administrator <em>Jaw.es J. Moore, </em>the decree directed that he should pay to <em>White </em>the amount due to him from <em>Jacob Moore. </em>And <em>the </em>cause was retained for a settlement of accounts between the administrator and the distributees of <em>Isaac Moore; </em>with liberty to them, to prove if they could, that <em>Jacob Moore </em>had received farther advancements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">Under this decree the causo was again referred to the commissioner to settle the accounts between the administrator aud distributees: and it was proved that <em>Jacob Moore </em>had received additional advancements from his father lo the amount of 1600 dollars. It also appeared, that by an agreement between the other heirs and distributees of <em>Isaac Moore, </em>the land and slaves of the estate had been sold by <em>Archibald Stuart; </em>and the proceeds thereof, which had been collected, had gone directly into the hands of these parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">In June 1839, <em>.lames J. Moore, </em>the administrator of <em>Isaac Moore, </em>filed a bill of review, to set aside the decree of the 8th of February 1838, on the ground that the receipt of <em>Jacob Moore </em>excluded him from any share of the estate of his father, and therefore the decree was erroneous on its face; and also on the ground, that since that decree evidence had been discovered which proved that <em>Jacob Moore </em>had received additional advancements to the amount of 1600 dollars, which would be more than his whole share of the estate: and that the administrator had been directed to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim, when in fact the proceeds of the lands and slaves had never come to his <em>hands; </em>and the distributive share of <em>Jacob Moore </em>in the personal estate in the hands of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>administrator, was far less than the amount decreed to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\"><em>White </em>answered the bill, not admitting there was error in the decree, and denying that the facts relied on for a review and reversal thereof, came to the knowledge of the plaintiff after the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">The cause came on to be heard again on the 24th of June 1840, when the Court was of opinion that there was no error in the principles of the decree of the 8th of February 1838, except so far as it directed that the administrator <em>James J. Moore </em>should pay to the plaintiff <em>White </em>the amount of his claim against <em>Jacob Moore. </em>The Court therefore, rescinding so much of the decree as directed the administrator <em>James J. Moore </em>to pay to the plaintiff <em>White </em>the amount of his decree, overruled the application to review and reverse said decree in other respects; and dismissed the bill at the costs of the administrator. And then with the consent of the plaintiff and the defendants, the decree of the 8th of February 1838, was set aside as improvidently made;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-12\">In November 1842 the report of. the commissioner was recommitted; and he made another report stating the accounts of the heirs and distributees of <em>Isaac Moore. </em>In this account he charged <em>Jacob Moore </em>with the sum of 400 dollars as advanced to him, but omitted the sum of 1600 dollars. And he stated the amount due him from the personal estate in the hands of the administrator at 339 dollars 4\u00a7 cents, on the 24th of June 1843; and the amount due him from the land and slaves at 1387 dollars 2f- cents, making together the sum of 1726 dollars 7\u00a3 cents, with interest thereon, from the 24th of June 1843, till paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">On the 15th of June 1843, the cause came on to be finally heard, when the Court made a decree confirming the commissioner\u2019s report, and directing the several persons having in their hands the proceeds of the estate, to pay the amount due from them respectively, to <em>Nicho</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>las O.

And directing him. to pay to the plaintiff <em>White, </em>out of the distributive share of <em>Jacob Moore, </em>the amount of his debt, principal and interest, as ascertained by the first report of the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">From this decree the administrator <em>James J.
