Arthur, George F. Hupp </em>and <em>Philip A. Machir, </em>filed their bill in the Superior Court for the county of <em>Shenandoah, </em>in which they charged, that <em>Arthur, </em>on the 6th of February 1840, had executed a deed by which he conveyed sundry tracts of land and other property in trust to secure certain debts due to <em>Hupp, Machir </em>and others. That <em>Arthur </em>had, in March 1839, executed a deed by which he conveyed the same property in trust to secure a debt of 40,000 dollars, due by bond to <em>John B. Stcenbergen, </em>who had assigned the same to the <em>Bank of Washington. </em>That this bond was given on <em>k </em>usurious consideration: and they set out the usury. That the plaintiffs had abundant testimony to establish the usury, and disclaimed all benefit of discovery which the defendants might make; but that the security being in the form of a deed of trust, the trustees might offer the property for sale, as they had advertised they would do, without giving the complainants an opportunity to have an enquiry into the character of the transaction. They, therefore, prayed that <em>John B. Steenbergen, The Bank of Washington, </em>and the trustees in the deed, might be made defendants to the bill, and answer thereto on oath: the benefit of which answers, as to the usury charged in the bill, they disclaimed. That the Court would enjoin the defendants from all proceedings on the deed of trust, until the plaintiff <em>Arthur </em>could have a day in Court to prove the usury. That the testimony might be taken and perpetuated ; and that the Court would direct a suit to be brought in which the question of usury might be tried. And they prayed for all proper relief, not inconsistent with the purpose of the bill, which was to procure a fair trial of the usury charged. The injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\"><em>Steenbergen </em>and the <em>Bank of Washington </em>answered the bill. <em>Steenbergen </em>denied that he intended or expected to receive more than the legal rate of interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>The bank denied all knowledge of usury in the transaction, if there was such ; and insisted that if the bond was usurious, <em>Arthur </em>could not avail himself of the objection to the deed in the hands of the bank: because after the bond and deed of trust had been transferred to the bank, <em>Arthur </em>had given to its officers every assuranee that the said security was valid for the full amount named in it; and expressly promised to pay the full amount of the same to the bank. And that in consequence of those assurances and promises, the bank had relied upon the bond and deed of trust as covering 40,000 dollars of <em>Steenbergen\u2019\u2019s </em>indebtedness, and had made no effort to obtain any further or other security for said portion of its claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\">Upon the proofs in the cause, it appears that previous to the <em>12th </em>of March 1839, <em>Arthur </em>was indebted to <em>Steenbergen </em>about 8000 <em>dollars; </em>and being embarrassed in <em>his </em>circumstances, though in possession of a large property, he desired to obtain a loan of money. Under this state of things, an agreement was entered into between <em>Arthur </em>and Steenbergen, by which the latter agreed to lend to <em>Arthur, </em>the sum of 40,000 dollars, to be made up by the debt <em>Arthur </em>owed <em>Steenbergen, </em>by certain debts which <em>Steenbergen </em>was to pay for <em>Arthur, </em>and by stock of the <em>Citizens Bank </em>and <em>Western Bank of Baltimore, </em>and of the <em>Winchester and Potomac Railroad Company. </em>And <em>Arthur </em>was to execute his bond for 40,000 dollars, payable in six annual instalments, commencing on <em>the 1st of </em>April 1840, the five first of 6000 dollars each, and the last of 10,000 dollars, the interest to be paid semi-annually ; and to execute a deed conveying his property to trustees to secure the payment of the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">In pursuance of this agreement, <em>Arthur, </em>on the 12th day of March 1839, executed his bond to <em>Steenbergen, </em>payable as aforesaid; and on the same day, he executed a deed, by which he conveyed to <em>Philip Williams jr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and <em>Mark Bird, </em>sundry tracts of land and other property in trust, to secure the payment of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aav\">The stocks transferred by <em>Steenbergen </em>to <em>Arthur </em>were sixty-five shares of the stock of the <em>Winchester and Potomac Railroad Company, </em>at 21 dollars per share, when the market value thereof was from seven to eleven dollars; stock of the <em>Citizens, </em>and <em>Western Bank of </em>Baltimore, to the amount of 15,000 dollars at par value. The par value of the <em>Western Bank </em>stock was 25 dollars, and its value in the market, about the time of the transfer, was 22 dollars 25 cents. The par-value of the stock of the <em>Citizens Bank </em>was 10 dollars ; and its market value, when transferred, was about 7 dollars 76 cents. These stocks, as <em>Steenbergen </em>alleged, were transferred to <em>Arthur </em>at the prices which he gave for them; and the banks were making dividends of six per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">Some time in the summer of 1839, <em>Steenbergen </em>deposited <em>Arthur\u2019s </em>bond with the <em>Bank of Washington, </em>as a collateral security for the discounts afforded him by the <em>bank; </em>and on the 30th of December 1839, he regularly assigned to the bank the said bond, and the deed of trust given by <em>Arthur </em>to secure it, as collateral security for his liabilities, which at that time amounted to 75,000 dollars. These liabilities were upon bills or notes which had been discounted for him, and which had then come to maturity, and had been protested; and on all of which there were endorsers. About this time, <em>Steenbergen </em>failed in business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-8\">About the last of January 1840, the bank gave notice to <em>Arthur </em>of the assignment of his bond to the <em>bank; </em>and at the same time, at an interview which took place between some of the officers of the bank and <em>Arthur, </em>he stated that there was no objection to his payment of the bond; that the security was ample; and that he would make the payment at any of the banks in <em>Baltimore </em>that the officers of the <em>Bank of Washington </em>might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>designate. These assurances having satisfied the bank that <em>Arthur\u2019s </em>bond was a good security for <em>Steenbergen\u2019s </em>liabilities, to the amount of the bond, and <em>Steenbergen </em>having transferred to the bank a certificate of stock of the State of Virginia, to the amount of 20,000 dollars, and placed them in another deed of trust which he executed, as creditor to the amount of 23,000 dollars, the bank took no farther steps to obtain any additional security; which they alleged they would have done, if <em>Arthur </em>had advised them that his debt was on a usurious consideration: though, as <em>Steenbergcn </em>had then failed, and was insolvent, the probability of his giving other security was at least very doubtful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-4\">On the 5th of April 1843, the cause came on to be heard, when the Court made a decree that the injunction awarded the plaintiffs should be continued in force until the question of usury should be decided by a Court of Law, in some regular proceeding upon said bond or deed, instituted by the defendants or any of them, and until the farther order of the Court on certificate of such decision. From this decree the <em>Bank of Washington </em>applied for and obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-5\">The cause was most elaborately argued here, by <em>G. N. Johnson </em>and Robinson, for the appellant, and <em>Patton, Cooke, Stuart </em>and <em>Samuels, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">For the appellant, it was argued, that there was no evidence of usury. But if the usury was proved, then that the relief afforded by the decree was improper. On this point a reference was made to the principles of the English Courts of Equity; and it was insisted the rule was universal, that the plaintiff who comes into equity to set aside a usurious security must pay what is <em>bona fide </em>due. And for this, was cited, <em>Lamplugh </em>v. Smith, 2 Vern. R. <em>77: Witley </em>v. Price, Id. 78; <em>Smith </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Loader, </em>Prec. in Ch. 80; Kelly on Usury 95; <em>Taylor v. Bell, </em>2 Vern.

These principles, it was farther insisted, were acted on in <em>New York; Rogers </em>v. <em>Rathbun, </em>1 John. Ch. R. 367; <em>Tupper, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Powell, &amp;c. </em>Id. 439; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dey, </em>15 John.

Dialogue, </em>2 Peters\u2019 R. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">The counsel then examined the case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Munf. 407, and insisted, that it was inconsistent not only with the well established principles of the English Courts, but opposed to the principle often recognized in our Courts, that he who asks equity must do equity: and they referred to, <em>Payne's ex'or </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>1 Wash. 196; <em>Lipscomb's adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Littlepage's adm\u2019r, </em>l H. &amp; M. 454; <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Strother, &amp;c. </em>3 Rand. 214; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Jefferey, </em>2 Leigh 410. They farther insisted, that <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris </em>should not be considered a binding authority by any Judge who considers it to have been decided on unsound principles; because it had never been acquiesced in by either the bench or the bar: and to shew this, they cited and commented on the cases of <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>6 Munf. 541; <em>M'Pherrin </em>v. <em>King, </em>1 Rand. 172; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lindsay's adm'rs, </em>1 Leigh 499; <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>2 Leigh 626; <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Povall, &amp;c. 8 </em>Leigh 93; <em>Campbells </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>11 Leigh 113; <em>Gilliam </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>3 Leigh 590; and <em>Thorton </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>2 Rob. R. 719. And as cases directly opposed to <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Moms, </em>they referred to <em>Eagleson </em>v. <em>Shotwell, </em>1 John. Ch. R. 536; <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>5 John. Ch. R. 122; <em>Fulton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Bank </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>1 Paige\u2019s R. 429; 3 Wend.

In <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>if the contract to secure the performance whereof, the deed of trust was made, was vacated, the creditor could have recovered nothing either at law or in equity. In the present case, though the bond and deed of trust to secure the 40,000 dollars be adjudged void at law for usury, the pre-existing valid debts are no wise impaired by the subsequent usurious contract, but remain in full force even in a Court of Law. <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Scholy, </em>Cro.

On this point, they referred to <em>Marks v. Morris, </em>2 Munf. 407, upon the principle of which case, the decree in the present case was founded. This decision, made in 1812, they urged, did not stand alone; hut though it had been frequently assailed, it was reaffirmed in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lindsay\u2019s adm\u2019rs, </em>1 Leigh 499; had been acted on again in <em>Fitzhugh </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>2 Leigh 626; and approved in <em>Turpin </em>v. <em>Povall, &amp;c. </em>8 Leigh 93. Having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>thus been recognized and acted on as law, for thirty-four years, and acquiesced in during all that time by the Legislature, they insisted that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>must apply with conclusive force, and the question could no longer be considered open for discussion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aub\"><em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris </em>being taken to be law, the counsel then took up the question, whether the doctrine of that case was applicable <em>to the </em>case <em>of an </em>assignee from the usurious creditor. On this point, assuming what was conceded by the other side, that the assignee takes the obligation subject to all the equities of the obligor; and that the statute avoids all usurious securities; it was argued upon principle, that the securities must be void as against the assignee, if void as against the obligee: and that this was so upon authority. Orde on Usury 105-6; <em>Ex parte Skipp, </em>2 Ves. sen. R. 489; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>Doug. R. 736; <em>Ex parte </em>Thompson, 1 Atk.

As to fraud, the evidence shewed no ground for the imputation, or for the supposition that <em>Arthur </em>did not state precisely what he then believed. As to the promise, the interview between <em>Arthur </em>and the officers of the bank took place <em>after the </em>assignment by <em>Steenbergen </em>to the bank ; and after his insolvency. It is not pretended the bank was induced to take the assignment by <em>Arthur. </em>There is no proof that they have sustained any injury by his statements; and certainly no consideration moved to him for any promise which he made to the bank. Such promise was therefore <em>nudum pactum, </em>and is not obligatory. Comyn on Cont. p. 13, in note; 2 Saund.

The Court is therefore of opinion, that the said contract between <em>Arthur- </em>and <em>Steenbergen, </em>and the said bond and deed of trust executed by <em>Arthur </em>in pursuance thereof, were usurious and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>And it further appears to the Court, that after the execution of said bond and deed of trust by Arthur, <em>Steenbergen </em>assigned the same absolutely to the <em>Bank of </em>Washington, but in order that the same should enure as collateral security to the bank for certain debts due from Steenbergen, and without notice on the part of the bank that said bond and deed' of trust were in any wise tainted with usury; of which absolute assignment notice was shortly thereafter, but when it was publicly known that <em>Steenbergen </em>had become insolvent in his circumstances, given by the bank to <em>Arthur; </em>who thereupon, without disclosing the usurious character of said contract, made no objection thereto, and consented to the performance thereof on his part. But the. opinion that this conduct of <em>Arthur </em>cannc a new contract between him and the banllj ment of the money secured by the said ,tion therefor moving from the bank, nor any chang\\in \u00edlfP\u00edelda&amp;X.. of the contract between <em>Arthur </em>and <em>Steenh </em>any agreement of the bank to do or forbear to do any act in regard either to <em>Arthur </em>or <em>Steenbergen. </em>Nor can the said conduct of Arthur, in regard to the bank, nor his subsequent conduct in impeaching said securities in the hands of the bank as usurious and void, be treated as fraudulent; the former not appearing to have proceeded from any fraudulent intent, and the latter not appearing to have occasioned any substantial loss to the bank ; inasmuch as the loss to the bank has been merely of the chance to obtain from its insolvent debtor the substitution of other collateral security, in lieu of the usurious and void securities aforesaid, for a debt already secured to the bank by bills accepted and endorsed; and there being no proof, or even allegation, on the part of the bank, that the acceptors and endorsers are not perfectly solvent and responsible therefor, or that from any cause the bank has been or will be prevented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>obtaining payment of the said debt, or any part thereof. The Court is therefore of opinion, that <em>Arthur, </em>and those claiming under him, are in no wise estopped from impeaching the said bond and deed of trust as usurious and void in the hands of the bank, and obtaining all proper relief against the same.</p>\n<p id=\"A0D\">And the Court is further of opinion, that it is unnecessary to decide whether the doctrine held in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Munf. 407, ought to prevail in cases of the same character with that, inasmuch as in the opinion of the Court the doctrine of that case is not properly applicable to this. In the case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>the usury alleged having been proved by the evidence, the trustee in the deed of trust given by the borrower to secure the usurious debt was enjoined from selling the property thereby conveyed, until by some proceeding, to be instituted by the lender, he should establish the validity of his contract. The principles of that decision were that the usurious contract being avoided by the statute, no part of the debt could be recovered at law, and the proceeding of the lender under the deed of trust to enforce payment being <em>in pais, </em>the borrower had no day in Court for the purpose of making his defence, and was entitled to the aid of a Court of Equity to enable a Court of Law to avoid the usurious contract altogether, and so prevent the borrower from being subjected to the loss of the principal money. But in that case, the whole debt was created by the usurious contract, which embraced no pre-existing <em>bona fide debt; </em>whereas in the present case, the usurious contract did embrace a preexisting <em>bona fide </em>debt, which might have been recovered in an action at law, to which its having been embraced in the subsequent usurious contract would have been no defence. The tendency of the decision in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>was, by an abrogation of the usurious security, to defeat a recovery of the usurious debt, there being no remedy at law upon the usurious con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tract, which contract created the entire debt. The ap<em>3 </em>plication of that authority to the present case would be to defeat the recovery of the pre-existing <em>bona fide </em>debt, by abrogating entirely the usurious security, and leaving the creditor to an unproductive remedy at law upon the pre-existing valid contract. The Court in <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>thought it proper that a Court of Equity should give its aid to defeat indirectly the recovery of the usurious principal, as well as the usurious interest; but its decision does not indicate an opinion that it would be proper for a Court of Equity to give its aid in any form to defeat, by rendering unavailing, the recovery of a preexisting <em>bona fide </em>debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The Court is further of opinion that though the bill in the present case is founded upon the doctrine of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>and looks entirely to the measure of relief thereby indicated, yet inasmuch as it presents a case which upon the facts disclosed entitles the debtor and those claiming under him to relief against the usurious contract and securities, upon equitable terms; it is proper, instead of dismissing the bill to decree such relief as the general principles which govern Courts of Equity indicate and require.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that the Circuit Court erred in decreeing the injunction which had been awarded in the cause, to restrain the sale under said deed of trust, to be continued in force until the question of usury should be decided by a Court of Law, upon some regular proceeding upon said bond or deed, to be instituted by the defendants or any of them, and until the further order of the said Circuit Court, upon a certificate of such decision; instead of proceeding to ascertain the amount justly due from <em>Arthur </em>to Steenbergen, by debiting the former with all <em>bona fide </em>debts due from him to the latter prior to the execution of said bond and deed of trust, and with all advances made by <em>Steenbergen </em>to <em>Arthur, </em>or made for him in payment of debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>due by the latter, and with lawful interest from the proper periods on such pre-existing debts and on such advanees; and where such advances were made by the transfer of stocks charging only the market value of such stocks at the time of the <em>transfer; </em>and by allowing <em>Arthur </em>all proper credits to which he is entitled against such debits; and after so ascertaining the amount of the principal and the interest thereon so due from <em>Arthur </em>to <em>Steenbergen, </em>or to the <em>Bank of Washington </em>as his assignee, decreeing the said bond and deed of trust to stand as securities for that amount of principal and the interest thereon, and for no more, and payment thereof to be enforced, if necessary, by a sale under the direction of the Court of the property conveyed by the said deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that the decree of the Circuit Court be reversed and annulled, and that the appellant recover against the appellees <em>Arthur </em>and <em>Hupp, </em>the costs expended by the appellant in the prosecution of this appeal: and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court to be further proceeded in according to the principles of the foregoing opinion and decree.</p>\n<author id=\"b206-5\">Brooke, ./.</author>\n<p id=\"A2C\">I am sorry to differ with my brother Judges, in this case. I think the decree of the Court below entirely correct, on the principle of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>which was explained by myself in delivering the opinion of the whole Court in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Lindsay\u2019s adtn\u2019rs, </em>1 Leigh 499. As a compromise, I was willing in this case to reverse the decree, dissolve the injunction as to the good debt, and direct the trustees to sell as much of the property as would pay that debt; leaving the balance of the decree to remain; and sending the supposed usurious debt to the Court of Law on the principle of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris: </em>though I cannot see why the general principles of a Court of Equity should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>contravene the provisions of a statute, or disregard the rules of law, which would subject the good and usurious debt to the same fate, when included in the same bond and deed of trust, as in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">The case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris </em>has been understood as the law in cases similar, for more than twenty-five years, by bar and bench; and by many members of the Legislature; and never objected to, that I know of; and if overruled, would repeal the act against usury, in all cases of deeds of trust: to subject which to a trial at law, was the object of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">If by blending a good with a usurious debt, in a bond and deed of trust, as in the case before us, the good debt is to protect that which is usurious from a trial at law, then the act against usury is repealed as to such deeds of trust; and all such cases are brought within the principles of a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The plaintiff <em>Arthur </em>did not come into a Court of Equity for relief on the merits; but to get his relief in a Court of Law; according to the principle of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris. </em>So the Court below understood his bill, and sent the case to a Court of Law. Hence, the principle that he who comes into equity for relief must do equity does not apply. The plaintiff comes with a different intent. His bill is not framed for relief on the merits, but on the principles of the case of <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Morris; </em>and ought to be so treated by this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
