Afterwards, upon a suit brought by <em>B.\u2019s </em>children for a settlement of the adm\u2019n accounts, it appears that when the account of <em>W. </em>is properly stated, instead of being a creditor he is a large debtor of <em>B.\u2019s </em>estate.

And whatever deficiency, the proceeds of the above named property when sold leaves unpaid, I direct that my executors sell as much of my land and any part thereof, as will he sufficient to pay the whole of my debts.\u201d The testator then gave to his widow for life one third of his slaves and all his real estate not sold for the payment of debts ; and he gave the remainder in the property given to the widow, and all the rest of his estate to his two infant children <em>; </em>the eldest of whom was then but two years old.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-12\">In September 1816, the executors proceeded to sell the personal estate directed to <em>be </em>sold by <em>the will, </em>and nearly the whole proceeds thereof went into the hands of Wilson; the balance was received by <em>Taylor ; Af\u2019Clanahan </em>taking no part in the administration. In 1818, the personal fund was exhausted, and Wilson, who was the acting executor, was in advance to the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>upwards of 1200 dollars. The executors then proceeded to sell a part of the real estate, consisting of lots in and adjoining the town of <em>Buchanan. </em>These were sold for one fourth of the purchase money in hand, and the balance in one, two, and three years: and the executors united in conveying them to the purchasers. The proceeds of the sales of these lots amounted to 3315 dollars, of which <em>Wilson, </em>who was a man of good character, and apparently ample fortune, received 2796 dollars, and the balance was received by <em>Taylor. </em>At the time of this sale, beside the amount due to <em>Wilson </em>for his advances, there was a debt due to <em>Douglas, </em>and one due to <em>Smith. </em>To neither of these debts was any part of the proceeds of the lots sold, applied; but <em>Douglas </em>having recovered a judgment against the executors, issued an execution thereon, which was levied on three slaves belonging to the estate; and they were sold by the officer who levied the execution, with the assent of <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>at the town of <em>Buchanan, </em>and not at the courthouse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-11\">In 1826, the executor <em>Wilson </em>died, and an <em>ex parte </em>settlement of his administration account on <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>estate was made by his executor in 1828, before a commissioner acting under an order of the County Court of <em>Botetourt. </em>By this settlement, after charging him with the proceeds of the real estate which he received, he was found indebted to <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>estate 1201 dollars 35 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-12\">In the lifetime of <em>Wilson </em>a judgment was recovered against him as the executor of <em>Boyd, </em>by <em>Smith, </em>which after his death, was paid off by his <em>executor; </em>and he, after crediting that judgment with the amount found by the said <em>ex parte </em>statement to be due from his testator to <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>estate, brought a suit against the surviving executors <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2019Clanahan, </em>for the balance, and in 1829 recovered a judgment against them for 777 dollars 81 cents. Upon this judgment an execution was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>issued and was levied on slaves of <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>estate, who were sold to satisfy it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AX8\">When the infant children of <em>James Boyd </em>came of age they filed their bill in the Superior Court of <em>Botetourt, </em>against <em>M \u2019 Clanahan, </em>the surviving executor of <em>James Boyd, </em>and the representatives of <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>in which they charged, that the <em>ex parte </em>account settled by <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or, was grossly erroneous ; that <em>Wilson </em>had failed to apply the proceeds of the real estate in his hands to the payment of the debts of the estate; that in consequence of this, the slaves which their father by his will had expressly reserved for the benefit of his family, had been taken and sold under execution ; that the other executors had been guilty of gross and culpable negligence in permitting the moneys of the estate to go into the hands of <em>Wilson </em>alone, and in not compelling him to apply these moneys to the payment of the debts: that the sale of the slaves under <em>Douglas\u2019 </em>execution was improperly made at <em>Buchanan, </em>and that the slaves had been sold much under their value,- that they had submitted to a judgment in favour of <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or, when if <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>account of administration had been properly settled, he would have been found to be a debtor to more than the whole amount which he recovered; and that it was gross neglect in the other executors not to have that account properly settled. They therefore asked for a settlement of the administration accounts of the executors, including <em>Wilson\u2019s, </em>and that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>estate and <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>should he held responsible for any waste of the estate committed by <em>Wilson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\"><em>My Clanahan </em>and the executors of <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>answered the bill; and the accounts were referred to a commissioner, who made a report thereon, to which both plaintiffs and defendants excepted.

Whether <em>Taylor </em>having consented to a sale of the slaves taken under <em>Douglas\u2019 </em>execution at <em>Buchanan, </em>and they having sold for but 800 dollars, when, according to the estimate of the witnesses examined, they were worth from twelve to fourteen hundred dollars, he was liable for the difference. 3d. Whether the executors were entitled to a credit for the amount paid <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or. 4th. Whether the administration account should be closed with the year 1822, when the last payments for the lots sold had fallen due, or whether it should be brought down to the time when <em>Smith\u2019s </em>debt was paid. 5th. Whether the executors, not having settled their accounts within two years from the passage of the act of February 16th, 1825, were entitled' to commissions. On all these points the Court below decided in favour of the plaintiffs, and the commissioner having reformed his report accordingly, and the cause coming on to be finally heard, the Court made a decree by which the estate of Taylor-alone was subjected to satisfy the plaintiffs for the amount found due from <em>Wilson. </em>From this decree <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors obtained an appeal to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Michie, </em>and <em>John T.

The general principle is, that one trustee is not liable for the acts of his cotrustee, unless he has been guilty of fraud, or such gross neglect as to amount to fraud. 2 Story\u2019s Equ. 516-17, 520-21, 525; <em>Monell v. Monell, </em>5 John. Ch. R. 283 ; 8 Bac. Abr. Ex\u2019ors &amp; Adm\u2019rs, letter D 2, p. 454; 2 Fonb. Equ. 78, 181-185; <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>2 John. Ch. R. 1; 14 John. R. 527. This case cannot be brought within the exception to the general rule. <em>Wilson </em>was a man of character, and property. He had faithfully administered the personal estate in his hands ; was a large creditor; and as the fund could not be in the hands of the three executors at the same time, he was the most proper person to receive it. But if either of the co-executors is responsible for the acts of <em>Wilson, </em>then they certainly are equally so, and the decree should have been against <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>as well as <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>ex\u2019ors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">The levy of <em>Douglas\u2019 </em>execution upon the slaves of <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>estate was the right of <em>Douglas; </em>and it will be for the appellees\u2019 counsel to shew by what means <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>could compel <em>Wilson </em>to apply the moneys in his hands to the discharge of that execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">2. There is no evidence to shew that the slaves sold for less at <em>Buchanan </em>than they would have done at the courthouse; or that the sale was not properly conducted. And surely the fact that they sold at a forced sale for less than the estimated value of such slaves, and that estimate made twenty years afterwards, is not a suflieient ground for the conclusion that the change of the place of sale was injurious to the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-10\">3. The amount paid to <em>Wilson's </em>ex\u2019or was paid under a judgment recovered by him against <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>as surviving executors of <em>Boyd. </em>There is no evidence, and not even a charge of collusion in the procuring of that judgment. <em>Wilson's </em>account had been regularly settled by a commissioner of the Court of Pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>bat; and the items of that account are proved by that taken in this case to be correct. It is the mode of stating the account and the charge of interest which produces the difference in the result. And we would be S^id to know what authority <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>had to control the commissioner of the Court of Probat in settling the principles on which the account was to be taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-4\">4. The Court below directed the administration accounts to be closed in 1822, because the last payment for the lots sold fell due in that year. But the claim of <em>Smith </em>was then outstanding, and we submit the administration account should not have been closed until that was paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">5. As to the real estate the act of February 16th, 1825, in relation to the commissions of executors and administrators, does not apply to it; and commissions thereon should have been allowed. Moreover <em>Wilson </em>died within two years after the passage of the act; and <em>actus dei nemeni facit injuriam.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\"><em>Brockenbrough, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">1. To shew the principle on which cotrustees will be held liable for each other, I refer to <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Minchin, 7 </em>Vez. R. 186; <em>Shipbrook </em>v. <em>Hinchinbrook, </em>11 Vez. R. 252; <em>Hinchinbrook </em>v. <em>Shipbrook, </em>16 Id. 480; <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>1 Meriv. R. 712; <em>Brice </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>11 Vez. R. 318; <em>Bone </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>24 Law Lib. 142; 2 Story\u2019s Equ. 718; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Court &amp; als., </em>8 Price\u2019s Exch. R. 127; <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Monell, 5 </em>John. Ch. R. 283. From these cases it will be seen that where by an act or agreement of a co-executor or trustee money gets into the hands of the other they are both liable. Here, the executors unite in the sale and the conveyance, and then by agreement among them, <em>Wilson </em>receives the whole proceeds of sale ; and therefore upon the principle above stated, they are all liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>But upon the principle admitted on the other side <em>Taylor </em>is liable; for there has been gross negligence on his part in the management of this estate. In a trust which he undertook, in which infants were interested, he puts the whole fund into the hands of his cotrustee. He permits that cotrustee to retain it for years, without an attempt to have it applied to the purposes of its creation ; but stands by, and sees the slaves which had been set apart by his testator for his infant children, subjected to the discharge of those very debts for which the fund in the hands of <em>Wilson </em>was provided. And not yet aroused to attend to the duties of the office he had assumed, he permits the executor of <em>Wilson </em>to recover a judgment against him, and sees the slaves of these infants applied to its discharge, whilst the account settled by <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or shewed upon its face, that instead of being a creditor, <em>Wilson </em>was a large debtor to the estate of Boyd,</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-10\">2. It was proper to close the administration account in 1822. There were two debts paid after that time, but they were not paid out of the fund in the hands of the executor, but by the sale of slaves in the hands of the widow of <em>Boyd; </em>and these debts therefore afford no reason for postponing the close of the administration account. <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>3 Leigh 407; <em>Handly </em>v. <em>Snodgrass, </em>9 Leigh 484.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-11\">3. The question of the commissions is settled by the act, Sup. Rev. Code, ch. 158, &amp; 8, p. 217; and <em>Wood\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>6 Leigh 271. But it is said these parties are trustees and that the act does not apply to them. Trustees <em>stricti juris </em>are not entitled to commissions, and their conduct in the management of the trust confided to them forbids that they should receive them.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Note <em>by the </em>reporter.&amp;emdash;During the <em>J </em>uly and October terms of the Court, there were never more than four Judges on the bench.

And where, as in this case, the sale was made, and was necessary, to accomplish the purposes of the trust, the proof of such fraud should be distinct and conclusive to charge one trustee for the receipts of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The Court is further of opinion, that in this case there is no ground for the imputation of any fraud to either of the trustees, <em>Taylor </em>or <em>M </em>\u2019 <em>Clanahan, </em>in acquiescing in the payment of the proceeds arising from the sale of the land to their cotrustee, <em>Thomas Wilson; </em>and much less in their omission to call upon him to pay over such funds to them; if indeed it be competent for one trustee, upon a suggestion of the misapplication of funds by a cotrustee, which were properly in the hands of such cotrustee, to assert any such claim ; a point not necessary to decide in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">So far from being chargeable with fraud, it was under the circumstances peculiarly proper in the trustees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2019Clanahan, </em>to leave the receipt and disbursement of the proceeds of the land to their cotrustee, <em>Thomas Wilson. </em>He had been the principal acting executor, and as such had promptly disbursed all the personal assets which came to his hands, and was largely in advance to the estate. He was personally interested as a creditor of the estate in the collection of the money arising from the sale of the lands; and from the previous course of administration best acquainted with the condition of the estate. His character was fair, and his fortune apparently ample; and there is nothing to shew that either <em>Taylor </em>or <em>M\u2019Clanahan </em>knew or had cause to suspect that he had not faithfully applied the funds which came to his hands, except the balance ascertained to be due from his estate, upon the settlement made by his executor with the commissioner of the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The Court is therefore of opinion, that so much of said decree as charges the representatives of <em>Taylor </em>with any moneys received by <em>Wilson </em>on account of the lands sold was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The Court is further of opinion, that so much of said decree as charges the executors, <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>with a <em>devastavit, </em>on account of the supposed sacrifice of the slaves at the sale made by the deputy marshal or sheriff in Buchanan, is also erroneous. As to <em>Taylor, </em>because if his cotrustee <em>Wilson, </em>then had funds arising from the sales of the land in his hands, his failure to apply them to the discharge of the execution, was no default in <em>Taylor ; </em>nor could it prevent a creditor from levying upon and selling the assets of the estate; and erroneous as to <em>Wilson </em>because the securities in his executorial bond were not responsible for his acts as trustee. They were bound for the application of the assets to the payment of the debts, and they were so applied. The failure of the trustee to relieve the assets by the application of the funds in his hands, was a breach of duty as trustee, but not a <em>devastavit </em>as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"AOn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The Court is further of opinion, that there was nothing in the circumstances attending the sale which would justify a speculative charge against the defendants, either as executors or trustees; as the property seems t0 bave been publicly and fairly sold, under an execution properly levied thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The Court is further of opinion, there was error in so much of said decree as charges the said <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>representatives with the sum of 792 dollars, with interest from 14th August 1832, till paid, on account of the sale of slaves, to satisfy the judgment rendered in favour of <em>Thomas Wilson\u2019s </em>ex\u2019or against the surviving executors of said <em>Boyd. </em>There is no suggestion that said judgment was collusively obtained, or that the surviving executors knew or suspected that they were' entitled to a greater credit than the balance appearing to be due from said <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>estate, upon the settlement made by his executor, of the transactions of said <em>Thomas Wilson, </em>as executor of said <em>James \u25a0 Boyd. </em>And although upon a restatement of the accounts, upon different principles from those adopted by the commissioner of the County Court, it appears the said <em>Thomas Wilson </em>would have been in arrear as trustee, and should have applied the true balance in his hands, to the payment of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>judgment, his failure so to do was a breach of trust for which he was personally responsible, hut not responsible as executor, so as to render his securities, including his coexecutors, liable on the official bond as for a <em>devastavit. </em>So that in no aspect could such charge be made against said <em>Taylor </em>solely, as by the decree was done, or jointly with the other obligors in the official bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The Court is further of opinion, that there is error in so much of said decree as disallows the executor of <em>Thomas Wilson </em>commissions on the assets of the personal estate administered by said <em>Thomas Wilson; </em>although no actual settlement was returned within two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>years and six months after the passage of the act of February 16, 1825. As it appears the executor died within less than two years after the passage of the law, the omission of his representative to procure a settlement within the time limited, should not deprive his estate of a valid claim, according to the principles established in the case of <em>Turner </em>v. Turner, 1 Gratt. 11. But commission was properly disallowed to said <em>Wilson </em>upon the trust fund, as he was guilty of a gross breach of trust in not applying the funds in his hands to the payment of the debts, and so subjecting the estate to great loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The Court is further of opinion, that there was error in disallowing to the representatives of <em>Taylor </em>his commission on the money received and disbursed by him as trustee; the case of a trustee not being embraced by the terms of the law, and there being no such violation of his duty as trustee in the application of the funds received from the sales of the land, as should be visited with the loss of commissions. But commissions on the personal assets administered by him were properly disallowed, as he failed to have a settlement of his executorial accounts made out and returned within the time prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Court is further of opinion, there was error in so much of said decree as directed the administration account to be closed, and the account settled on the principles of ordinary debtor and creditor, before the debts outstanding had been ascertained to be due from the estate : and that the period at which the judgment was rendered in favour of <em>Smith </em>against the executors, was the proper period at which the administration account should have been closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The Court is further of opinion, there is no error in so much of said decree as overrules or sustains other exceptions not conflicting with the principles hereinbefore declared.</p>\n<p id=\"ABC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, that so much of said decree as is hereinbefore declared to be erroneous, be reversed and annulled, and that the appellants recover of the appellees their costs by them exPen&lt;^e&lt;^ m the prosecution of their appeal here,</p>\n<p id=\"AdF\">And this cause is remanded, with instructions to recommit the accounts to a commissioner, to restate, audit, and settle them according to the principles aforesaid; and with directions to settle the accounts of the executors separately, so far as respects their administration of the personal estate, excluding therefrom all items of charge growing out of the land fund. So that, if upon such settlement of their accounts of their administration of the personal assets any balance should be ascertained to be due from them, or either of them, in their character of executors, a decree may be pronounced against th\u00e9m or their representatives, and their coexecutors and securities in the joint official bond. And also that he state an account with each executor as trustee, in respect to the proceeds arising from the sale of the land; so that if upon such settlement, a balance should be ascertained to be in the hands of either of the said trustees, a decree may be pronounced against such trustee or the representatives of such as are dead, for the amount so ascertained to be due by such trustee individually.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
