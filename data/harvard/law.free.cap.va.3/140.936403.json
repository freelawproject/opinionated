Code, ch. 124. \u00a7 4. 5. p. 481. The county court gave them the permission, and assigned them counsel. And then their counsel offered for <em>prohat, </em>a paper containing, as they alleged, the <em>written </em>or the <em>nuncupative </em>will of the decedent, in the following words:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">\u00bb <em>\u201c </em>In the name of God, Amen. I <em>J. A. Schwartz </em>of the county of <em>Nottoway, </em>being in my perfect senses, do make and declare this my last will and testament. 1. My will and desire is, that all my real estate shall be disposed of at public auction, and the proceeds of the same appropriated to the payment of my debts. 2. My will and desire is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>my servants, <em>Bob, Frank, Polly </em>and her children, be eman- \u2022 , , , i i,, .., , , , cipated, and entitled to all the privileges ot tree persons ot colour forever, also <em>Bob\u2019s </em>wife <em>Betty </em>and her children. 3. It is my will and desire, that one half of the remaining part of my estate be given to <em>Juliana Malvina </em>Winn\u201d-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-7\"><em>A. B. Winn, </em>husband of one of the distributees of the deceased, appeared in court and contested the probat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-8\">The county court, upon a full hearing, was of opinion that the paper did not contain the will of the decedent, and refused to record it. The counsel for the paupers took an appeal for them to the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-9\">At the hearing in the circuit court, the evidence was stated at large and made part of the record. There were four witnesses, whose testimony was not materially variant, and was in substance, this: About three hours before the decedent\u2019s death, which happened at his own house, one of the witnesses, <em>Dr. Worsham, </em>his attending physician, suggested to him the propriety of making his will; he said, he could not think it then necessary, as he was so much better; upon which <em>Dr. W. </em>desisted from farther conversation on the subject, until <em>Mrs. Winn, </em>the sister of the deceased, came into the room, to whom <em>Dr. W. </em>mentioned what had passed, and she earnestly desired him to renew the subject, saying she had often heard her brother say he intended to make a will, and to liberate some of his slaves. At her instance, <em>Dr. W. </em>repeated the suggestion to the decedent, who again said he thought it unnecessary, but <em>if it was his sister\u2019s wish </em>or <em>if it was thought best, </em>he had no objection. There were present in the room, besides <em>Mrs. Winn </em>and <em>Dr. Worsham, </em>the other three witnesses, <em>Pollard, Fanes </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>and the appellees <em>Bob, Frank </em>and <em>Polly. Dr. W. </em>handed <em>Morgan, </em>pen, ink and paper, telling him that <em>Mr. Schwartz </em>wished his will written: <em>Morgan </em>seated himself at a table, in a distant part of the room, some twelve feet from the sick man\u2019s bed. Then <em>Dr. W. </em>returned to the bed side, and <em>Schwartz commenced </em>by saying \u201che wished his real estate to be disposed of, and the proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>appropriated to the payment of his just debts.\u201d <em>Dr. W. </em>went to <em>Morgan, </em>and reported this disposition to him, and <em>he </em>committed it to paper. <em>Dr. W. </em>again returned to <em>Schwarts, </em>and he then asked his servant <em>Bob, </em>whether he wjsj]e(j t0 ]3e freed; <em>Bob </em>said he was very willing to serve <em>him, </em>but he had rather be freed than have another master: <em>Schwartz </em>said \u201c he should be freed.\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>then asked <em>Frank, </em>whether <em>he </em>wished to be freed; a conversation ensued similar to that with <em>Bob, </em>which ended in <em>Schwartz\u2019s </em>saying \u201c he should be freed.\u201d <em>Polly </em>then said to her master \u201c what are you going to do for poor me ?\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>said, \u201c <em>Polly </em>and her children should be freed.\u201d <em>Bob </em>then asked, \u201c as he had freed <em>him, </em>would he not also free his wife,\u201d <em>Betty\"} Schwartz </em>said, <em>\u201cBetty </em>and her children should be freed.\u201d These dispositions being thus declared by <em>Schwartz, Dr. W. </em>went to <em>Morgan, </em>and reported them to him, and he reduced them to writing. <em>Schwartz </em>then said, \u201c he desired that one half of the remainder of his property should be given to his niece <em>Juliana Malvina </em>Winn\u201d (which was in like manner communicated to <em>Morgan, </em>and by him written) \u201c and the other half to his niece <em>Virginia;\u201d </em>upon which <em>Mrs. Winn </em>asked him, if he did not intend to leave her sister <em>Mary </em>something ? and his answer was understood to be, that <em>Mary </em>was to share equally with <em>Virginia; </em>but this was said so indistinctly, that it was not communicated to <em>Morgan </em>and written down, and being connected with the gift to <em>Virginia, </em>neither was that, though distinctly uttered, written down. At the time the dispositions which were written down, were uttered by <em>Schwartz, </em>he was perfectly in his senses: as he spoke the last indistinct words, he was taken with a strangling, and it was soon perceived he was dying. He did not desire that <em>Morgan, </em>or any one else, should write his will; he was not expressly told, that <em>Morgan </em>was to write it; it was doubtful, whether he knew that <em>Morgan </em>was engaged in writing it; it was probable he did not know it; it was doubtful, whether he could have seen, and probable he did not see, <em>Morgan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>writing at the table, from the bed where he was lying. He did not call upon any person present, to take notice, that the words he spoke were his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXj\">The circuit court reversed the sentence of the county court, and admitted the contents of the paper to probat and record, as a <em>nuncupative </em>will. And from this sentence, <em>Winn </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-7\">In the argument of the cause here, by <em>Spooner </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Macfarland </em>and <em>heigh, </em>assigned by the court counsel for the appellees, three points, made by the counsel for the appellant, were discussed :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-8\">1. Whether it was competent to the appellees, being in fact held in slavery, to prosecute such a suit as this <em>in forma pauperis </em>? A suit not to recover their freedom by reason of an emancipation by a will duly recorded, but to have the will under which they claimed freedom, recorded in a court of probat. The question turned upon the construction of the statute concerning pauper suits, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 124. \u00a7 4. 5. p. 481. and the statute authorizing the emancipation of slaves, <em>Id. </em>ch. 111. \u00a7 53. p. 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-9\">2. Whether an emancipation of slaves could be made by a <em>nuncupative </em>will ? Which depended on the construction of the statute last cited, which provides, that \u201c it shall be lawful for any person, by his or her last will and testament, or by <em>any other instrument in writing, under Ms or her hand and seal, </em>attested and proved in the county or corporation court, by two witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of the county where he or she resides, to emancipate and sot free his or her slaves, or any of them\u201d &amp;\u00a3C.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-11\">3. Whether this was a good <em>nuncupative </em>will? The counsel for the <em>appellant </em>referred to the provision of the statute of wills concerning <em>nuncupative </em>wills, <em>Id. </em>ch. 104. \u00a7 7. p. 377. which is taken (with some variation not affecting this question) from the english statute 29 Car. 2. ch. 3. \u00a7 19. And they said, it was impossible a man could make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>a <em>nuncupative </em>will, without intending <em>to do so, </em>and without knowing that he was doing it. Here, if the deceased intended to make any will, and with that intention, uttered the supposed testamentary words, he intended to make a <em>written </em>w\u00a1j]a an(j Was prevented from completing his purpose by the approach of death. But the words were not themselves testamentary at all; they were, at the most, only declarations of what would be his dispositions when he should make his will. <em>Weeden v. Bartlett &amp; al. 6 </em>Munf. 123. He did not know, that his words were reported to <em>Morgan, </em>and that he was committing them to writing: he did not know, that <em>Morgan </em>was writing down his words. He did not, and could not} see him at the <em>table. He did not call </em>upon any person present \u201c to take notice or bear testimony that such was his will, or words of the like importwhich the statute expressly required to make a good <em>nuncupative </em>will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-4\">The appellees\u2019 counsel cited <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Dunman, 1 Munf. </em>456. to shew, that <em>notes </em>taken by the bed side of a dying man, may be a good <em>nuncupative </em>will, provided it appeared that the words noted were uttered with a testamentary intent, though it appeared that the testator intended to make a <em>written </em>will, and that he did not call upon persons present \u201cto take notice or bear testimony that such was his will:\u201d any circumstance <em>tantamount to that, </em>would suffice. That the words spoken by <em>Schwartz, were spoken with testamentar y </em>intent, appeared from the evidence. He agreed to make his will;\" and after the preparation for writing it had been made, though he was not expressly told that such preparation was made, he commenced (of his own accord, as they understood the evidence) with the direction for the sale of his land, which, was plainly a testamentary disposition. He commenced, likewise, the conversation with <em>Bob </em>and <em>Fra-nlc, </em>which ended in the declaration that they should be free. The emancipation, indeed, of <em>Polly </em>and her children was suggested by her, and that of <em>Letty </em>and her children, by her husband: but the gift of one half of the residue of his estate to his niece <em>J. M. Winn, </em>uttered of his <em>own accord, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>distinctly evinced, that he was, and had been from the beginning, speaking with a present testamentary intent. They thought it the fair inference from the evidence, that he did know, that <em>Morgan </em>was writing down his dispositions as he uttered them to <em>Dr. Worsham, </em>and that he could and did see <em>Morgan </em>writing.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-4\">Cabe, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJk\">In this case, three points were made in the argument: 1. Can the petitioners appear as parties in this controversy ? 2. Can slaves be emancipated by a <em>nuncupative </em>will ? 3. Is this a good <em>nuncupative </em>will ? I shall consider this last point only. The doctrine of <em>nuncupative </em>wills, was taken from the civil law, and is of very ancient date. The abuses and <em>frauds, </em>which were practised under it, gave rise to the provision of the statute 29 Car. 2. ch. 3. \u00a7 19. from which our act is, with some variations, taken. The intention of the statute was not to give a new principle, but to correct a mischief; and it should be so construed as to advance the remedy. It is said, in a note on <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>4 Ves. 196. that the case of <em>Cole. </em>v. <em>Mordaunt, </em>before lord chancellor <em>Nottingham, </em>in the 28th year of Charles II. was the principal case which gave rise to the english statute of frauds. That was a case in which nine witnesses swore to a <em>nuncupative </em>will; and <em>yet, on </em>a trial at bar in the court of king\u2019s bench, it appeared that most of them were perjured, and <em>Mrs. Cole </em>guilty of subornation. In the case before us, there is not the slightest imputation upon the witnesses; but that must not influence our decision upon the law. The deceased was truly <em>in extremis; </em>for before the business was finished, his mind began to wander ; he was taken with a strangling ; they found he was dying. He seems to have been indisposed to make a will, if capable : he desired no one to write it; he did not know that <em>Morgan </em>was writing; <em>Morgan </em>sat in a distant part of the room, and did not pretend to take the words from the sick man, but they were reported to him by another; and, if the reporter misunderstood the speaker, or <em>Morgan </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>reporter, the paper would not contain his will. The statute <em>.. </em>.... is imperative in requiring that it be proved by two witnesses, \u201c that the testator called on some person present, to take notice or bear testimony that such is his will, or words of tjje ]\u00a1[\u00ede imp0rt.\u201d Here we have neither the words, nor any of like import; no expression, indeed, or act of the sick man, to shew that he thought himself making his <em>will; </em>or whether he intended it to be by parol, or in writing; or that he wished any person to bear testimony to what was doing. To establish such a will as this, would, I think, be of the most dangerous tendency. I am clear, then, that the very foundation of the claim of the appellees fails here. It is not necessary, therefore, for the decision of this case, to consider the other points; and, as they are of great importance, and perfectly new, I had rather leave them open for future consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b170-6\">Brooke, <em>J. </em>and Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AoA\">said, they concurred in the opinion of <em>Carr, </em>J. that this was not a good <em>nuncupative </em>will. And they intimated, that <em>they </em>thought, slaves could not be emancipated by a <em>nuncupative </em>will, and had intended to give that opinion on that point; but they yielded to the suggestion of <em>Carr, </em>J. that the point should be left open for consideration when it shpuld be necessary to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Sentence reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
