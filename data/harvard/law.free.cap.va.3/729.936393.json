After his death, and before administration was taken of <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>estate, the possession of the slaves was transferred <em>to Waller, </em>whether as his own property, or as the hirer of them from his sister, was, upon the proofs in this cause, somewhat doubtful. <em>Waller </em>held the possession till his own death which happened early in 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-4\"><em>Robert Anderson, </em>a creditor of <em>Byrd, </em>took administration of his estate; and, in 1811, he brought an action of <em>detinue </em>against <em>Waller </em>to recover the two slaves, claiming them as part of the estate <em>of his </em>testator; in which action, there was a verdict and judgement for <em>Waller, </em>who after-wards died, with the slaves in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-5\">After <em>Waller\u2019s </em>death, <em>Mrs. Byrd </em>brought an action of <em>detinue </em>for the slaves, against <em>Gawin Corbin </em>the administrator of <em>Waller, </em>claiming them as-having been given and delivered by <em>Waller </em>to her, and having been hired by her to him during his lifetime; and she recovered a verdict and judgement for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b754-6\">In 1818, <em>Anderson </em>exhibited a bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg, </em>against <em>Mrs. Byrd, </em>and <em>Cor-bin, </em>the administrator of <em>Waller, </em>shewing, that he was a creditor of <em>Byrd, </em>and had therefore taken administration of his estate, the whole of which sufficed to satisfy only a small part of the debt due to him; and alleging, that <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>of sale of slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom </em>to <em>Walle?-, </em>of September 1805, was covinous in fact, <em>Waller </em>having (as the bill charged) redeemed the slaves from <em>Bright\u2019s </em>mortgage, not with money of his own, but with money furnished him by <em>Byrd </em>for the purpose : that, if the transaction was not thus covinous in fact, yet that <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>bill of sale to <em>Bright </em>was fraudulent in law and void as against <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>creditors, whether considered as a mortgage, or as an absolute sale; if as a mortgage, because it was never recorded ; if as an absolute sale, because possession did not accompany and follow the deed, but remained uninterruptedly with the vendor: that <em>B?jrd\u2019s </em>bill of sale to <em>Waller </em>of September 1805, was also fraudulent in law and void as against <em>B?j?-d\u2019s </em>creditors, because, notwithstanding that deed, <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>possession continued without interruption: and that, even supposing <em>Waller </em>had given the slaves to his sister <em>Mrs. Byrd </em>(which he denied) she had taken this gift with full notice of every fact which rendered <em>Waller\u2019s </em>title to them nugatory as against <em>B?jrd\u2019s </em>creditors. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the slaves should be held subject to the debt <em>Byrd </em>owed the plaintiff, and that <em>Waller\u2019s </em>administrator should render an account of the profits while <em>Waller </em>held them, and <em>Mrs. Byrd </em>an account of the profits since they had been in her possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b755-5\"><em>Mrs. Byrd, </em>in her answer, denied all the circumstances of actual fraud imputed by the bill; but she did not deny the fact of her husband having continued in uninterrupted possession of the slaves, until his death, notwithstanding the bills of sale to <em>Bright </em>and to <em>Waller. </em>She said, that <em>Waller </em>had bought the slaves with a view to give them to her, and had suffered them to remain in the possession of her husband, for her use and maintenance , that after <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>death, <em>Waller </em>took possession of them, and gave them to her according to his original design, and that she hired them to him; and upon these grounds, she had brought a suit for them against his administrator after his death, and recovered them.

The other evidence related to the profits of the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-5\">The court of chancery declared, that both the bills of sale were fraudulent in law and void as against <em>Anderson, </em>a creditor of the vendor <em>Byrd, </em>because he had been permitted to retain uninterrupted possession of the property; that <em>Anderson, </em>as a creditor of <em>Byrd, </em>had a right to impugn these bills of sale for the fraud; and that the statute of limitations was not a bar to the claim asserted in the bill, because the frauds complained of appeared not to have come to the plaintiff\u2019s'knowledge, till within five years next before his hill was exhibited. And the court ordered accounts to be taken, of the debt due by <em>Byrd </em>to <em>Anderson ; </em>of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>estate; of the profits of the slaves since they had been in <em>Mrs. Byrd\u2019s </em>possession ; of the profits while they remained in <em>Waller\u2019s </em>possession, and in that, of his administrator <em>Corbin; </em>and of <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b756-7\">The accounts reported by the commissioner, ascertained, that there was a balance of debt contracted by <em>Byrd </em>in his lifetime to <em>Anderson, </em>of 1542 dollars, with interest from the 18th March 1807\u2014that the profits of the slaves, while they were in <em>Waller\u2019s </em>possession amounted 909 dollars\u2014that the profits thereof, while in possession of <em>Corbin </em>administrator of <em>Waller </em>amounted to 299 dollars\u2014and that the profits thereof since they had been in <em>Mrs. Byrd\u2019s </em>possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>amounted to 541 dollars. The account of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Byrd\u2019s estate, </em>shewed that <em>Byrd </em>was insolvent, and <em>the </em>small amount of assets that came to <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>hands was applied to the credit of the debt due to <em>Anderson. </em>No account of <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Woller\u2019s </em>estate was reported; for,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-4\">About the time these accounts were taken, <em>Corbin </em>died; and the suit was revived against <em>Richard, Corbin </em>his administrator, and <em>John Shields </em>sheriff of <em>Yorlc, </em>to whom administration <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate was committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-5\">Upon the coming in of the commissioner\u2019s report, the court of chancery, with the consent of the plaintiff and the defendant <em>Mrs. Byrd, </em>decreed that she should deliver the slaves, <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom, </em>to the plaintiff, and should pay him the amount of the profits reported to have accrued while they were in her hands; and that <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>administrator should pay the plaintiff, the sum of 299 dollars, the amount of the profits of the slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom, </em>while he held them as administrator of <em>Waller, </em>with interest from the 18th September 1821, the date of the commissioner\u2019s report\u2014&gt; to be applied by the plaintiff in due course of administration of <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-6\">There being still a large balance due to the plaintiff, he obtained leave to amend his bill, and make new parties; and, by an amended bill, he shewed, that all <em>Waller\u2019s </em>personal estate except certain slaves which had been delivered by his administrators to his distributees, had been exhausted in the payment of specialty debts, which bound his lands in the hands of his heirs; and, therefore, he made <em>Waller\u2019s </em>children, who were his heirs and distributees, and <em>Shields, </em>his administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>parties defendants; and prayed that the slaves of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, which had been distributed, might be held subject to his claim against <em>Waller, </em>for the profits of the two slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom, </em>while in his possession; and that the court, if necessary, should marshal the assets of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, and substitute and subject <em>Waller\u2019s </em>lands, to the extent to which his personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>assets had been applied to the payment of specialty debts, to the satisfaction of this claim of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3-\">The administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>and the heirs and distributees of <em>Waller, </em>having put in their answers, wherein <em>they </em>contested the justice of the former report of the commissioners as to the amount of profits received by <em>Waller; </em>the court of chancery opened that account, and referred it to a commissioner to be stated, as between the present parties to the controversy; and ordered an account to be taken of <em>Corbin's </em>administration of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-4\">The account of <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate shewed a very trivial balance in his hands. New evidence was exhibited as to the profits of the two slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom, </em>while in <em>Waller\u2019s </em>possession; and an account thereof, founded on this new evidence, reduced the amounts of profits received by <em>Waller, </em>from 909 dollar's, appearing by the former report, to 444 dollars; which sum (though these were estimated profits, not actual hires received) the commissioner charged to <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, <em>with interest </em>from the 18th September 1821, the date of the first report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-5\">Upon this, the court of chancery decreed, that <em>Shields </em>the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Waller </em>should pay the plaintiff the sum of 444 dollars with interest from the <em>18th </em>September 1821, out of the assets of his intestate, if so much thereof be had, and in default of any assets in his hands, directed that the slaves which had been distributed, and which were in the hands of <em>Waller\u2019s </em>distributees, should be sold to pay the debt and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b758-6\">The \u201c <em>defendants\u201d </em>prayed an appeal to this court; the court of chancery allowed the appeal, without requiring any appeal bond, and no appeal bond was given. <em>Anderson </em>also, thinking \u25a0 the estimated amount of profits charged by the last report, and decreed, against <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, too low, appealed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b758-7\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Scott </em>for the parties who were defendants below, and by <em>Stanard </em>for <em>Anderson.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Cake, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ANN\">When the amended bill was filed in this case, and <em>Waller\u2019s </em>heirs were thereby made parties, in order to charge the lands in their hands, they were not bound by any previous order in the cause, but were at full liberty to contest every thing, which might bear upon <em>Waller\u2019s </em>liability for the hire of the slaves in question, and the amount of that liability. They were at liberty, then, to shew, if they could, that the bill of sale of <em>Bright, </em>and the purchase from him by Waller, were fair transactions; for, if fair, <em>Waller </em>was not at all liable for hires. This liberty, however, has not availed them much; for I agree with the chancellor, that we must take both the bills of sale from <em>Byrd </em>to <em>Waller, </em>and from <em>Byrd </em>to <em>Bright, </em>to have been fraudulent and void as to creditors, though as between the parties and those claiming under them, they were valid 5 that from <em>Byrd </em>to <em>Bright </em>being taken as a mortgage. I agree too with the chancellor, that the bill of <em>Anderson </em>is not touched by the statute of limitations, both for the reason he assigned, and for the further reason, that the statute was not pleaded on behalf of <em>Waller </em>the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In the argument of the case, the counsel discussed this question: A. purchases slaves of B. the possession not accompanying and following the deed; but A. gets possession under his purchase, before the right of a creditor of B. to come upon the slaves, vests; will such purchase and possession make good the title of A. against the creditor ? The question is a grave one; but it does not arise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Upon the question, whether the chaucellor estimated the hires correctly ? I cannot find in the record sufficient evidence to satisfy me, that the decree is erroneous. The estimates of hires, when taken, as in this case, after the parties to the transaction are dead, and you can make no deductions for physicians\u2019 bills, and the various other drawbacks which may have existed, are nine times out of ten, I think, fixed by commissioners too high. We must remember too, that the last account was taken expressly to give the heirs (who were then first sought to be charged) an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>of contesting as well <em>the true amount of the hires, </em>as their liability to them : as to them the question was to be taken up <em>ah integro. </em>It was decided in <em>Mason\u2019s devisees </em>v. <em>Peter\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>1 Munf. 437. that a judgement against <em>executors, </em>is no proof against <em>devisees of land, </em>because there is no privity between them : I presume, there is as little between the <em>executor </em>and the <em>heir. </em>Again, we know that depositions cannot be read against a party who has had no notice of the taking them; and still less against those who, at the time they were taken, were not parties to the suit. Now we see, that all the evidence on which the first report was founded, was taken before the heirs were parties ; and this appearing upon the face of the record, need not be presented in the form of an exception to the account. Upon this new evidence, adduced after <em>Waller\u2019s </em>heirs were made parties, the chancellor was clearly right in his estimate of the hires. But I should not feel authorized to say he was wrong upon the whole evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">I do not think we can touch that part of the interlocutory decree, which directs that <em>Mrs. Byrd </em>shall deliver the slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom </em>to the plaintiff) instead of directing a sale of <em>them; </em>1. because that was a <em>consent </em>decree; and <em>2. </em>because it is not before us as to that point, there being no appeal by <em>Mrs. Byrd. </em>Nor does it seem to me, that such sale is necessary, in order to a final decree as to the hires: for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim exceeds the sum total of the profits of the slaves and of the value (upon any possible estimate) of the slaves themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">The only error I see in the decree, is the allowance of interest on the estimated hires of the slaves from the date of the first report: interest should be allowed only from the time of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Cabell, J. concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b760-12\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqbd\">In whatever light we consider <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>bill of sale to <em>Bright, </em>the result, in this case, must be, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>transaction was void as to <em>bona fide </em>creditors of <em>Byrd. </em>If it was a mortgage, it was void, not only because the taking a bill of sale in form, where the real transaction is a mortgage, tends to deceive and injure others, and is therefore fraudulent and void, (6 Johns. C. R. 432. 2 Johns. C. R. 191.) but also for the conclusive reason, that it was not recorded. If it was really an absolute sale, then possession not having accompanied the deed, it was void for that reason. That <em>Byrd </em>remained during life in the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the slaves notwithstanding the alleged successive sales to <em>Bright </em>and to Waller, the evidence very clearly establishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">But it was said that <em>Waller </em>took the possession before the claim of the creditor intervened, and this will protect him against the application of the doctrine of <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Harben, </em>2 T. R. 587. And the cases of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Pickering, 288. and <em>Robinson &amp;fc. </em>v. <em>M\u2019Bonnell &amp;fc. </em>2 Barn. Aid. 134. were cited. Whether the presumption of fraud would have been removed even if possession had been obtained at a period during <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>life, subsequent to the sale, but anteriour to an execution against him, seems by no means settled with us. The affirmative is very strongly contested by judge <em>Green </em>in <em>Claytor </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>6 Rand. 285. 305. and, in the same case, judge <em>Carr </em>waives the expression of any opinion upon the subject. The point cannot be decided here. The possession was not taken till after <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>death. Now, although the delivery of possession in his lifetime, before execution, should prevent the application of the rule, the same effect would not necessarily follow here. According to the class of cases of which <em>Temple v. Chamberlayne, </em>2 Rand. 384. is one, the creditor has no rights until he has issued his execution. To construe, therefore, a delivery of possession subsequent to the sale, as operating to give validity to the transaction,\u2014 as amounting even to a new transaction, to the surrender of the former right, and to a resale with immediate delivery, would not interfere with vested rights. But not so here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>According to <em>Blow </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>2 Leigh, 29. there was a vested right in the creditor at the death of <em>Byrd, to </em>charge these slaves in equity. This vested right cannot be impaired ^ any act 0f party, who, in the eye of the law, is a fraudulent donee. In the case of <em>Robinson Src. </em>v. <em>M\u2019Don- </em># <em>J </em># <em>nell fyc. Bailey, </em>J. expressly confines his opinion to cases in which there is no intervening right in a third person. See his opinion in <em>Mair </em>v. <em>Glennie, </em>4 Mau. &amp;; Selw. 248. The plaintiff, therefore, as creditor of <em>Byrd, </em>had a right to institute this suit against the holders of the slaves as executors <em>de son tort, </em>and to render them and their profits liable to the discharge of his debt. In doing this, he cannot be turned over by one to another, upon the allegation, that, though one received the profits, he has paid them over to the other. All are equally without right, and it can <em>be no </em>exemption to one who has received my money, to shew, that he paid it over to another, who claimed it, but who had no right to it. <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate was, therefore, liable for the hires received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">I incline to think, that the estimate of the hires charged to <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, which was approved and allowed by the court of chancery, was too low: but as the other judges are of a different opinion, I readily yield my objection to the decree on this score.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">There is a formal error also in the decretal order directing the slaves <em>Sam </em>and <em>Tom, </em>to be delivered up to the complainant, instead of providing for the sale of them. But for the reasons given by judge <em>Carr, </em>I think the error immaterial as it respects the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">The statute of limitations was relied on in the argument; but it was not pleaded by <em>Shields </em>as a defence for <em>Waller\u2019s </em>estate, even if it had not been explicitly answered by the remarks of the chancellor in the first decree. <em>Shields </em>is, in effect, the only party appellant here : though the appeal was allowed to all, yet as no appeal bond was,given, or indeed required, it can only be considered as the appeal of that party (namely, <em>Shields, </em>the administrator) of whom fin appeal bond could not be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>It was contended, that <em>Waller </em>should be considered as a creditor for the amount of his advances, and be paid <em>pro rata. </em>I do not think so. Though I am not of opinion, . that the transaction was actually covinous, yet the law avoids the sale as fraudulent, and treats the holder as executor <em>de son tort. </em>Now an executor <em>de son tort </em>can never retain. Moreover, the contracts of sale as between <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Bright, </em>or <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Waller, </em>are valid as between them. They are not avoided. Of course <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>estate is not debtor for the advances, because those advances were made as the price of property, which <em>Waller </em>has received, and not as a loan, or as money paid for his use. If <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>estate could be liable, it would only be because of the loss of those slaves. But they were not lost for any defect of title in him; and, therefore, his estate is not responsible. Whether the estate could be made liable on the ground of money paid for its use, provided there were funds to repay it, it is not necessary to decide. The question here relates only to the application of these funds. And considering it in this light, it is obvious, that if the payment of the debt to <em>Anderson, </em>out of the proceeds of this property, which <em>Waller </em>claims, is to be the ground of reclamation, then just in proportion as <em>Waller </em>becomes debtor of the estate, is the fund reduced out of which he expects payment. The proposition of course is inconsistent and not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The decree is however deemed to be erroneous in this, that the chancellor has given interest upon the estimated conjectural hires of the slaves from the date of the first report, instead of hires from the date of the decree. According to the case of <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>5 Munf. 492. interest is not to be allowed upon <em>conjectural </em>and <em>unliquidated </em>hires; for until they are ascertained, the party is in no default for not paying. Now, this reason applies in full force to the allowance of interest from the date of the report; since until it be confirmed by the decree of the court, the hires are still uncertain, conjectural and unliquidated. This emphatically appears in this case, in which the court has re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>duced the estimate to less than one half of that made by the first report. The sum thus ascertained to be due, was, therefore never known, until the decree; and yet the chancellor has given back interest for many years on this unknown sura. This cannot be right upon the principles of <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Bland. </em>The decree must be reversed for this error, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
