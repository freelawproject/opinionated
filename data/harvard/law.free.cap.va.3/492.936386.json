Britain, </em>came to <em>Virginia </em>in 1805, and, either personally or through the agency of <em>Daniel Brodie, </em>contracted with <em>W. M. Cary, </em>for the purchase of a parcel of land called <em>Celeys </em>in <em>Elizabeth City </em>county, <em>for </em>8000 dollars. <em>Philips </em>paid the whole of the purchase money, or advanced it to <em>Brodie </em>to be paid, to <em>Cary; </em>but, in order to prevent the land from escheating to the commonwealth, and therefore to conceal <em>Philips\u2019s </em>interest in it, the conveyance from <em>Cary </em>was taken, not to <em>Philips, </em>the alien, but to <em>Brodie </em>who was a citizen. <em>Philips </em>took possession of the land, resided upon it, and took the profits to his own use, so long as he lived. He had a daughter named <em>Sarah, </em>the wife of <em>John Goodwin, </em>and she had an infant son, <em>Thomas Fretwell Goodwin: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the daughter, her husband, and her son, were all aliens: they came to <em>Virginia </em>during <em>Philips\u2019s </em>lifetime, and lived with him till his death, which happened in 1808. He died intestate. After his death, <em>John Goodwin </em>and his wife occupied <em>Celeys, </em>and took the profits, till 1809, when <em>Goodwin </em>died; and then <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>continued to occupy and take tho profits of the laud, till 1811, when she married the same <em>Daniel Brodie </em>to whom <em>Celeys </em>had been conveyed by <em>Cary </em>in 1805. From the time of <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin, </em>they resided at <em>Celeys, </em>and <em>Brodie </em>took the profits, until 1815, when his wife died, without having had any child by him ; and thenceforth, <em>Brodie </em>continued to hold and enjoy the profits of the land, till his death in 1819. Meantime, <em>Brodie </em>sent his step son, <em>T. F. Goodwin, </em>to <em>England, </em>where he remained for several years, and until he attained to full age, under the care of <em>John Goodwin, </em>his paternal grandfather, and his other relations there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\"><em>Philips, </em>it seemed, died in possession of personal estate, consisting of slaves, stock and furniture, at <em>Celeys, </em>besides money.

All </em>the property he held in his own right, he devised and bequeathed to the same two nieces and a nephew. And he appointed <em>E. Kennedy </em>and <em>W. JYimmo </em>his executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-4\">The executors proved the will, and took upon them the execution thereof. They continued to hold <em>Celeys, </em>till the end of the year 1821, about which time the executor <em>JYimmo </em>died; and then <em>Kennedy, </em>in execution of his testator\u2019s will, exposed it to sale, at public auction, and he himself became the purchaser, at the price of 4800 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">After this sale was made, <em>William Sharp </em>the english guardian (or who acted as the guardian) of <em>T. F. Goodwin, </em>by letter of attorney, appointed <em>William Gray </em>of <em>JYorfoTk, </em>his agent to attend to the interests of his ward in <em>Virginia. </em>And in 1823, <em>Gray </em>caused a bill to be exhibited, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg, </em>in the name of <em>T. F. Goodwin, </em>still an infant, against <em>Kennedy, </em>now the surviving executor, and <em>Mary JYimmo </em>administratrix of <em>W. JYimmo, </em>now dead, who had been the other executor, of <em>Brodie: </em>wherein <em>Goodwin, </em>claiming as a legatee under <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>will, impeached the sale which had been made of <em>Celeys </em>by the executor <em>Kennedy, </em>on the ground that it had been unfairly sold, and purchased by the executor himself, at an under value; and prayed, that the sale should be set aside, and a resale of the subject, and an account of <em>Bro-die\u2019s </em>estate, and of the executors\u2019 administration thereof. <em>Kennedy, </em>in his answer to this bill, denied that there had been any actual fraud in his purchase of <em>Celeys, </em>but declared he was perfectly willing that the sale should be set aside, and the land sold again for the best price that could be got. And, in September 1823, he wrote a letter to <em>R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number><em>B. Taylor </em>(the counsel retained to prosecute the suit for <em>T. V. Goodwin) </em>offering to make sale of <em>Celeys, </em>upon such terms as he should approve, for the benefit of the parties concerned; to which <em>Taylor, </em>after consulting <em>Gray </em>the agent, wrote an answer, acceding to the proposition, and adding\u2014\u201c We think it would be proper to offer the property for sale, on credit, with good security, but that it should be set up so as not to sell for less than 6000 dollars. It would, perhaps, be better to endeavour to make a private contract, as the sum to be obtained would then be known beforehand; but if a public sale be made, it should be so conducted as not to sacrifice the property at less than 6000 dollars, which <em>Hubbard </em>would have given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-4\">Accordingly, in May J 824, <em>Kennedy </em>sold <em>Celeys </em>to <em>Thomas Barker, </em>for 6000 dollars, payable in instalments, and conveyed it to him. Of this sale, and of its terms, <em>Gray </em>and <em>Taylor </em>were apprised, and they approved it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">And in October 1824, <em>Barker </em>sold and conveyed <em>Celeys </em>to <em>Matthew Hubbard, </em>upon the same terms on which he had purchased it; <em>Hubbard </em>undertaking to pay the purchase money to <em>Kennedy, </em>which <em>Barker </em>had contracted to pay, as the instalments thereof should fall due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-6\"><em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>suit against <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>executors, in the court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg, </em>was heard in June 1824; and the chancellor ordered accounts of <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>estate, and of the executors\u2019 administration thereof. But while these accounts were in progress before the commissioner, <em>Goodivin </em>having attained to full age, came to <em>Virginia: </em>he arrived in September 1825. And the legislature, at the session of 1825-G, passed an act, granting and releasing to him all the right, title and interest, which had accrued, or might accrue, to the commonwealth, or to the president and directors of the literary fund, in the land called <em>Celeys ; </em>and authorizing him to sue for the same, in any court of law or equity, and to hold it when recovered, in the same manner, in all respects, as if ho were a native born citizen; upon condition that he should become a citizen of the <em>U. States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>within two years from the time of passing the act; saving to all persons, other than the commonwealth, or the president and directors of the literary fund, any right which they had or might have in the land if the act had never been passed. And, by another act passed at the session of 1826-7, so much of the former act as imposed the condition that <em>Goodwin </em>should become a citizen of the <em>U. States </em>within two years, was repealed, and that condition dispensed with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\">In June 1827, <em>Goodwin </em>exhibited his bill in the court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg, </em>against <em>Kennedy </em>in his own right and as surviving executor of <em>Brodie, Mrs. JYimmo </em>the administratrix of <em>W. JYimmo </em>the deceased executor of <em>Bro-die, </em>and <em>Parker </em>and <em>Hubbard, </em>the purchasers under <em>Kennedy </em>at his second sale of <em>Celeys : </em>wherein he set forth the facts above detailed, as to the purchase of <em>Celeys </em>in 1805, by or for <em>Philips; Philips\u2019s </em>paying, or advancing to be paid, the whole purchase money to Cary; the conveyance taken to <em>Brodie, </em>in order to avoid the escheat; the successive occupation of the land by <em>Philips </em>during his life, by <em>John Goodwin </em>and wife during <em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>life, by <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>till her marriage with <em>Brodie, </em>and then by <em>Brodie </em>till his death in 1819; the will of <em>Brodie; </em>and the sale of <em>Celeys </em>by <em>Kennedy </em>to <em>Parker, </em>and by <em>Parker </em>to <em>Hubbard. </em>And he alleged, that upon the purchase of <em>Celeys </em>from <em>Cary, </em>and the conveyance thereof taken from <em>Cary </em>to <em>Bro-die, Brodie </em>executed a bond or some other instrument to <em>Philips, </em>whereby he acknowledged that the land was <em>Philips\u2019s </em>property, and that he was only a trustee for <em>Philips, </em>and agreed to hold the legal title, and to convey the same, according to his directions; which instrument came into <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>own possession upon his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>in 1810, and had either been destroyed by him, or was now in the.hands of his executors. That <em>Brodie </em>being only a trustee for <em>Philips, </em>and <em>Philips </em>the <em>cestui que trust </em>being an alien, the trust estate was escheatable to the commonwealth, and the comnionwealth having by the acts of 1825-6 and 1826-7, granted and released all her rights in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the subject to the plaintiff, he was now entitled to demand the land itself. And that <em>Kennedy, </em>when he sold the land in question to <em>Parker, </em>and <em>Parker </em>when ho bought it, and <em>Hubbard </em>when he purchased it of <em>Parker, </em>had full notice of the trust upon which <em>Brodie </em>had held the legal estate. Therefore, the bill prayed a decree for the land, and for a conveyance and release of the legal estate of the same to the plaintiff; accounts of the profits received by <em>Brodie, </em>from the date of his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>till her death, and thenceforth till his own death; of the profits received by <em>Brodi\u00e9\u2019s </em>executors from his death till the first sale to <em>Kennedy; </em>of the profits received by <em>Kennedy, </em>from his purchase till his sale to <em>Parker; </em>and of the profits received by <em>Parker </em>and by <em>Hubbard, </em>successively, during their occupation of the land; and a decree for such profits against the parties respectively, as well as compensation for any damages that had been done to the property, by cutting timber, or other waste.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\"><em>Kennedy, </em>in his answer to this bill, averred, that he had no knowledge whatever of the secret trust for <em>Philips, </em>on which it was alleged <em>Brodie </em>held the legal estate of <em>Celeys, </em>or of the facts alleged, from which such trust was inferred ; and that he had not found among <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>papers, any instrument of writing declaring such trust. He had acted under the conviction, that the estate belonged absolutely to his testator, <em>Brodie; </em>he had, in execution of his testator\u2019s will, sold the land to <em>Parker, </em>upon terms approved by persons representing (as he thought) the interests of the plaintiff in <em>Virginia; </em>he had received from <em>Hubbard, </em>who had purchased from <em>Parker, </em>a considerable part of the purchase money, which he had applied, in due course of administration, to the payment of his testator\u2019s debts; and he was ready to render an account of his transactions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\"><em>.Mrs. JVimmo, </em>administratrix of <em>JYimmo, </em>the deceased executor of <em>Brodie, </em>in her answer, said, that as her intestate had had no part in making either of the sales of <em>Celeys, </em>so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>neither had he ever received any part of the profits of that estate; he died in 1821.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuL\"><em>Hubbard, </em>in his answer, said he was not informed and had no particular knowledge of any of the matters alleged 'n ^ hiHj respecting the secret trust upon which <em>Brodie </em>held the legal title of <em>Celeys </em>for <em>Philips. </em>He had heard, that the plaintiff was prosecuting a suit to recover his, share of the proceeds of the sale of <em>Celeys, </em>or to have the first sale set aside, and the estate resold ; but he never heard it questioned, that <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>executors had full power to sell. Before he purchased the land of <em>Parker, </em>he ascertained that it had been sold by <em>Kennedy </em>to <em>Parker, </em>with the assent of the plaintiff\u2019s then agent and counsel in <em>Virginia, </em>and upon terms which they approved: his purchase, in truth, promoted the objects which the plaintiff\u2019s agents, at the time, were seeking to accomplish : and he had paid <em>Kennedy, </em>the executor, about 4000 dollars of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">There was the fullest proof, that <em>Celeys </em>was purchased of <em>Cary </em>for <em>Philips ; </em>that <em>Brodie </em>was only <em>Philips\u2019s </em>agent in making the purchase; that the whole of the purchase money was paid by <em>Philips, </em>or furnished by him to <em>Brodie </em>to be paid, to Cary; that the conveyance was taken to Brodie, instead of <em>Philips, </em>only because the one was an'alien incapable to hold real estate, and the other a citizen ; that the land was occupied by <em>Philips, </em>and by <em>Goodwin </em>and wife, and by <em>Mrs. Goodwin, </em>successively, till her marriage with <em>Bro-die </em>in 1811; that <em>Brodie, </em>repeatedly, during <em>Philips\u2019s </em>life, at the time of his death, during <em>John Goodwin\u2019s </em>life, and after <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>own marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin, </em>during her life, and after her death, acknowledged that <em>Celeys </em>was the property of <em>Philips </em>and his heirs, having been bought for him and paid for with his money, and that he <em>Brodie </em>claimed no interest in it, but only held the title as <em>Philips\u2019s </em>friend, and for his benefit; that, soon after <em>Philips\u2019s </em>death, <em>John Goodwin </em>his son in law, requested <em>Brodie </em>to convey <em>Celeys </em>to him, which <em>Brodie </em>refused to do, because he was an alien, but said, that whenever <em>Philips\u2019s </em>heir at law should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>become a citizen, and capable to hold the estate, a convey-4 <em>t </em>anee thereof to such heir should be immediately executed,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">In a letter written by <em>Brodie </em>to <em>John Goodwin, </em>the grandfather of the plaintiff, in 1818, and in another written to the plaintiff himself in 1819, <em>Brodie </em>spoke of <em>Celeys </em>as the property of tho plaintiff. And it was proved, that shortly after the purchase from <em>Cary, Philips </em>desired a neighbour, <em>Robert Lively, </em>to apply to <em>C. K. Mallory, </em>a lawyer (since dead) to prepare an instrument of writing to secure the title of <em>Celeys </em>and some debts due from <em>Brodie </em>to him ; that <em>Lively </em>accordingly desired <em>Mallory </em>to write such an instrument ; that <em>Mallory </em>did so, and <em>Lively </em>carried the draft to <em>Philips; </em>and that this paper was afterwards executed by <em>Brodie; Philips </em>remarking, at the time, that if they were all to live, there would be no necessity for such an instrument, to which <em>Brodie </em>answered, that it was perfectly right. But only the general purpose of this instrument, was proved; its precise contents were not proved, nor was it ascertained what had become of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\">There was no proof, and no reason to suspect, that <em>Kennedy, </em>when he made the sale of <em>Celeys, </em>or indeed, until this bill was filed, had any notice, that <em>Brodie </em>held the legal title of <em>Celeys, </em>in trust for <em>Philips </em>and his heirs, or otherwise than simply and absolutely as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-9\">But there was proof, that <em>Parker </em>and <em>Hubbard, </em>both, had been <em>informed </em>before any part of the purchase money was paid, and before <em>Parker's </em>sale of the land to <em>Hubbard, </em>that <em>Brodie </em>had purchased it for the benefit and in trust for <em>Philips ; </em>and that they had both <em>heard, </em>that <em>Brodie </em>had executed a bond to <em>Philips </em>to convey the title to him or his assigns ; which bond, it was suspected, had come into <em>Bro-die's </em>hands after his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin, </em>and had been destroyed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-10\">The chancellor, declaring that <em>Brodie </em>had held the legal estate of <em>Celeys </em>in trust for <em>Philips </em>and his heirs, and that <em>Philips </em>being an alien, that trust was, in effect, a trust for the commonwealth, which, by the acts of assembly of 1825-6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and of 1826-7, was now vested in the plaintiff; therefore, decreed, that <em>Hubbard </em>should surrender the possession to him, and that the defendants should make him conveyances an(f releases of the estate. And he ordered accounts to ta^en&gt; Pr\u00b0fits \u00b0f the estate, received by <em>Brodie </em>from the time of his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>in 1811, till his death in 1819; by <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>executors or either of them, from the time of their testator\u2019s death till the sale made by <em>Kennedy </em>to <em>Parker; </em>by <em>Parker </em>from the time of bis purchase till his sale to <em>Hubbard; </em>and by <em>Hubbard </em>since; and an account of all damages done to the land by <em>Hubbard, </em>since he had been in the occupation of it; and accounts of the estate of <em>Brodie, </em>and of the transactions of his executors, <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>JYimmo, </em>in the administration of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">From this decree, <em>Hubbard </em>and <em>Parker, </em>immediately, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">The commissioner, notwithstanding the appeal, proceeded to take <em>all </em>the accounts ordered by the decree. And he reported, that the profits of <em>Celeys, </em>received by <em>Brodie </em>from his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin </em>till <em>her </em>death, amounted to 625 dollars; that the estimated profits received by <em>Bro-die, </em>from his wife\u2019s death till his own, amounted to 600 dollars; that, after <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>death, <em>Celeys </em>was rented out, and that the rents from that time till the sale'to <em>Parker, </em>were received by <em>Kennedy, </em>and amounted, principal and interest, to 1184 dollars, chargeable to <em>Kennedy; </em>that the estimated profits during <em>Parker\u2019s </em>occupation,.were 88 dollars; and during <em>Plubbard\u2019s, </em>989 dollars. The commissioner also reported accounts of the administration of <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>estate by his executors; by which it appeared, that (excluding what had been received by <em>Kennedy, </em>from <em>Hubbard, </em>on account of the purchase money of <em>Celeys, </em>as not being a just credit to the estate) there was a balance due from the estate to <em>Kennedy </em>of 2508 dollars; and that upon <em>JYimmo\u2019s </em>account of administration, there was a balance -due from <em>his </em>estate to <em>Brodie\u2019s, </em>of 2154 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Upon this report coming in, the chancellor decreed, that <em>Mrs. Nimmo, </em>the administratrix of <em>W\u25a0 Nimmo </em>the deceased executor of <em>Brodie, </em>should, out of the assets of <em>Nimmo\u2019s </em>estate in her hands, pay the plaintiff the sum of COO dollars (being the estimated amount of profits received by <em>Brodie </em>himself after the death of his wife) with interest from the date of the decree till paid; and that <em>Kennedy </em>should pay the plaintiff the sum of 1184 dollars, with interest on 851 dollars, part thereof, from the 1st September 1829 ; (the date of the commissioner\u2019s report) this last sum being the nett balance of rents received by <em>Kennedy </em>from the time of <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>death till the sale to <em>Parker. </em>But <em>Parker </em>being now dead, and the cause pending in the court of appeals as to <em>Hubbard, </em>the chancellor, forbore to make any decree against either of them, in respect of the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\">And from this decree <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Mrs. Nimmo </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-12\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellant <em>Hubbard, </em>and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellants <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Nimmo.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnT\">The appellee can only claim under the act of assembly of 1825-6, such interest as the commonwealth had in <em>Celeys; </em>and the commonwealth\u2019s rights thus granted to the plaintiff, are placed on the ground, that <em>Brodie </em>held the <em>legal </em>estate, in <em>trust </em>for <em>Philips, </em>an alien, and that <em>Philips\u2019s trust estate </em>was escheatable in equity. Suppose <em>Brodie </em>took and held the legal estate, upon a simple trust expressly declared by deed for <em>Philips </em>and his heirs and assigns; was such a trust estate of an alien, in its nature, an escbeatable interest? Such a <em>trust </em>estate is no wise different from a <em>use </em>in lands before the statute of uses; and we know from the best authority, that one of the reasons for passing the statute of uses, to transfer uses into possession, was, that the practice of conveying lands to uses defrauded the lord of his <em>escheat; 2 </em>Black. Coram. 231,2. Hence, it appears that a <em>use </em>in lands was not an escbeatable interest. If A. enfeoff B. to the use of C. and B. the feoffee to uses, is attainted of treason, the king shall have the land discharged of the use; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Harg. Co. Litt. 13. a. note 7. <em>Pimb\u2019s case, </em>Mo. 196. In the case of a devise of lands <em>to </em>an alien, upon trust <em>to </em>sell, the <em>legal </em>estate in the alien, though only a trustee, is escheatable to the crown; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>1 Meriv. 431. It \u2019s then, the legal estate that escheats, in consequence of the incapacity of the feoffee to uses, or of the trustee, to hold it, or of his attainder, not the <em>use </em>or <em>trust estate, </em>by reason of the incapacity or attainder of the <em>cestui que use </em>or <em>cestui que trust. </em>For, so long as there is a person holding the <em>legal </em>estate, capable to hold it, there is no want of a tenant owing allegiance and service to the state in respect of the land held, no matter to whose use, or upon what trust, he holds. Thus, if there be lord and tenant, and the tenant enfeoffs <em>J. S. </em>and declares no use; the <em>cestui que use </em>[that is, the feoffor himself] does felony and is attainted; the lord shall not have a <em>subpoena </em>to have the land; and it seems the heir of the feoffor shall not have it, for there is corruption of blood; and, therefore, it seems, the <em>feoffee </em>shall retain it to his own use; 10 Vin. Abr. <em>Escheat. </em>A. pl. 16. p. 140. And upon the like principles was decided, in modern times, the case of <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate, </em>1 W. Blac. 123. 1 Eden, 177. S. C. In <em>Holland\u2019s case, </em>1 Roll\u2019s Abr. 194. 534. Alleyn, 14. S. C. it was held, that, if an alien purchase a copyhold in fee in the name of <em>J. S. </em>in trust for him and his heirs, upon office found that <em>J. S. </em>had the legal estate in trust for the alien, neither the copyhold nor the trust was escheatable at law, but the king must sue in chancery to have the trust executed for his benefit. And in <em>Attorney General v. Sands, </em>Hardr. 488. 495. where the question was whether a trust estate of a person attainted for felony, was forfeited to the crown, <em>Hale, </em>chief baron, said <em>\u201c </em>I hold that such a trust in an <em>alien </em>is forfeitable, and will belong to the king, as was held in <em>Holland\u2019s case\u201d &amp;lc. </em>It is obvious, that this remark of <em>Hale, </em>was extrajudicial, and founded wholly on <em>Holland\u2019s case; </em>and that, as to <em>Holland\u2019s case, </em>the <em>point adjudged </em>was that the trust estate in a copy-hold was not escheatable at law, and that the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and had no jurisdiction to <em>adjudge, </em>but only said <em>obiter, </em>that the king should sue in chancery to have the trust executed for his benefit. And these are the authorities upon which the elementary writers have repeated the opinion, that, though a <em>trust estate </em>in an alien be not escheatable at law, it is in effect escheatable in equity; that the crown may, in chancery, compel the execution of the trust for its own benefit. But all those opinions have reference to cases of <em>express trusts. </em>Here, <em>Brodie </em>did not take and hold <em>Celeys </em>upon any trust for <em>Philips </em>the alien, expressly declared ; at least, we think, there is no proof of any such <em>express trust. </em>It appears, indeed, that an instrument of writing was drawn by <em>Mr. Mallory, </em>and executed by <em>Brodie </em>to <em>Philips </em>in his lifetime, for the purpose <em>of </em>securing the title of <em>Celeys </em>to <em>Philips; </em>but the contents of that instrument, in other words, the scheme devised by <em>Mr. Mallory </em>to effect the object, has not been ascertained. It is surmised, that <em>Brodie </em>got possession of this paper, after his marriage with <em>Mrs. Goodwin, </em>and destroyed it: but this is only surmise and suspicion : and the evidence of his repeated admissions, after his marriage and even after his wife\u2019s death, that he had purchased the land as <em>Philips\u2019s </em>friend and for his benefit, that it had been paid for with <em>Philips\u2019s </em>money, and that it was not his own property, ought to relieve his memory from this suspicion; for, if <em>he </em>destroyed the paper, he could have had no other view in destroying it, but to conceal its contents ; that is, to conceal what his subsequent repeated admissions evince he had no care to conceal. If the court will found any decree upon the supposed contents of this lost paper, and make an effort to ascertain them by inference from the circumstances of the case; what, probably, were the contents of it ? Was it a simple express declaration that <em>Brodie </em>held, and should hold, the estate in trust for <em>Philips, </em>his heirs and assigns ? <em>Mr. Mallory </em>would hardly have hit upon such a device as <em>that, </em>of all others the most likely to endanger and defeat the object, which it was the design of the instrument to accomplish. It was, most probably, a co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>venant, or bond with condition, that <em>Brodie </em>should convey the legal title to <em>Philips </em>or his heirs, whenever he or they should become citizens of the ' <em>U. States. </em>The answer which <em>Brodie </em>made to <em>John Goodwin, </em>when <em>he </em>demanded a conveyance, was exactly conformable with such an obligation: he refused to conveyto <em>Goodwin, </em>because he was an alien, but said, that whenever <em>Philips\u2019s </em>heir at law should become a citizen, a conveyance to such heir should be immediately executed. And if this was the purport of the lost instrument, it was only an executory contract entered into by a citizen with an alien, to convey lands to him when he should become a citizen. And then the question will be, whether such an executory contract gives to the alien covenantee, such an interest in land, as is escheatable, in law or equity, to the commonwealth ? Surely, the commonwealth cannot demand specific execution of such a contract, and that in anticipation of the event on which the covenantor stipulated to execute it, in order to have the benefit of the escheat. Throwing the lost instrument out of the case, the plaintiff can only rest the claim of the commonwealth, in whose place he stands and whose rights alone he is intitled to demand, on the resulting trust to <em>Philips, </em>implied by law, from the fact that the estate conveyed to <em>Brodie, </em>was purchased and paid for with <em>Philips\u2019s </em>money. In <em>Sanders\u2019s </em>note upon <em>Lloyd v. Spillet, </em>2 Atk. 150. note 2. it is said, that <em>\u201c </em>if the^consideration money is <em>expressed in the deed </em>to be paid by the person in whose name the conveyance is taken, and nothing appears in such conveyance, to create a presumption that the purchase money belonged to another, then parol evidence cannot be admitted, <em>after the death of the nominal purchaser, </em>to prove a resulting trust, for that would be contrary to the statute of frauds\u2014but if the nominal purchaser, in his lifetime, gives a declaration of or confesses the trust, this takes it out of the statuteand the authorities are cited for both branches of the proposition. Whether the declarations made by <em>Brodie </em>in his lifetime, on the subject of the estate in question, were such as takes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>this case out of the statute of frauds, is submitted to the court. Taking it that they were so, can there be such a resulting trust for an <em>alien, </em>so as that it shall escheat as <em>his </em>property to the commonwealth ? Where land is purchased and paid for with the money of one person, and the conveyance taken to another, a trust results for the person who pays the purchase money; but this resulting trust is the mere creature of the law; it is the act of the law that creates or implies the trust estate. Now, an alien may take by purchase, though he cannot hold ; but by <em>act of law </em>he cannot take, as by descent, curtesy, dower, guardianship. 7 Co. 25. 1 Bac. Abr. <em>Alien. </em>C. p. 132. And since equity is only part of the law, no trust estate can be implied for an alien, in <em>equity. </em>In this view of the case, therefore, <em>Philips </em>had no interest in <em>Celeys, </em>legal or equitable, escheatable to the commonwealth, at law or in equity; and, consequently, the plaintiff has no right to the land. But, supposing that the trust estate was in <em>Philips ; </em>and such a trust estate as equity, following the law in respect to the escheat of legal estates purchased by an alien, would seize for the commonwealth; and supposing that <em>Parker </em>and <em>Hubbard </em>purchased with notice of the trust; they cannot be charged with any fraud; for they purchased with the knowledge and assent of the plaintiff\u2019s agents at the time, and to promote the plaintiff\u2019s interest; and it would be hard and inequitable, that they should suffer loss, because he thinks proper to relinquish his claim under <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>will, and make his appeal to <em>the </em>liberality of the legislature. At any rate, equity in such a case, will not go beyond the law in cases of escheats; and therefore, this decree is certainly erroneous in giving the plaintiffs the <em>profits; </em>since, in cases of escheats at law, the commonwealth never recovers profits accrued before office found. 3 Wheat. 589. There is no process or remedy provided for the recovery of profits of lands escheated, previously accrued, and no instance of an account or recovery of such profits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AM8r\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Johnson </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac6\">The question is, Whether <em>Philips </em>took such an equitable estate in <em>Celeys, </em>as that, if he had been a citizen, he could, in equity, have compelled the execution of the trust by <em>Brodie </em>? and if so, Whether, as <em>Philips </em>was an alien, the commonwealth could, in equity, compel the execution of the trust for her own benefit? <em>L </em>There is no necessity, to maintain, that, if lands be purchased and paid for with an alien\u2019s money, and the conveyance of the legal estate be made to a citizen, admitting that this is only a trust implied by law and resulting to the alien, it is such a trust estate as is, in equity, escheatable to the commonwealth. If there were any occasion to maintain the proposition, it might, I should think, be maintained without difficulty. For an alien <em>may purchase and take </em>real estate, as well as a citizen; the law permits him to do so; but he cannot <em>hold: </em>he may purchase, but he purchases for the benefit of the commonwealth. Neither is the disability of an alien to hold freeholds, or chattels real, for his own benefit, considered as a penalty or forfeiture, but it arises merely from the policy of the law, and therefore it has been held, in equity, that he cannot demur to a discovery of any circumstance necessary to establish the fact of alienage. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Duplessis, </em>2 Ves. sen. 286. 1 Bro. P. C. 415. But here, there was an <em>express </em>trust. There was a bond or covenant executed by <em>Brodie </em>to <em>Philips, </em>to secure <em>Celeys </em>to him; an instrument, which <em>Brodie </em>probably suppressed, since he had the opportunity, and was the only person that had any interest, to suppress it; and <em>the </em>contents of this instrument are sufficiently ascertained to have been a declaration of the trust, by the fact, that <em>Brodie </em>did hold the <em>legal </em>estate, upon a simple trust for the use of <em>Philips; </em>that <em>Philips </em>held the possession during his whole life, and his heir at law held it afterwards, and enjoyed the whole profits. But, throwing the lost instrument out of the case, <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>letters, admitting that <em>Celeys </em>belonged to <em>T. F. Goodwin, </em>the grandson of <em>Philips, </em>and heir at law of his daughter, contain a sufficient written acknowledgement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the trust on which ho held the legal estate. Nay, his parol admissions and declarations of the trust, would suffice to estahlish it: the case, in its very nature, is not within the statute of frauds : like the case of a deed absolute on its face, but intended and delivered as a mortgage, the trust may be established by parol proof.

From the facts of the case, it is very clear, there could be no escheat, technically speaking; for the legal estate was vested in a citizen. But it is equally clear that this citizen was a mere trustee, holding the estate for the benefit of <em>Philips </em>the alien. It was a good deal discussed at the bar, whether this trust resulted, by operation of law, solely from the facts that the purchase money was paid by one, and the deed made to another, or was an express trust, raised by the agreement of the parties? Upon my mind, the evidence has left no doubt, that it was an express trust. The statute of frauds has no application to the case, even supposing the proof of the trust rests on parol evidence; as I think is clearly shewn by chancellor <em>Kent, </em>upon a full and very able review of the cases, in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>M'Lean, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 586. The declarations of <em>Brodie, </em>made at various times and on some solemn occasions, are full to prove, that he purchased and held this land for his friend <em>Philips, </em>and never.paid a cent or laid the slightest claim to it,.and that.he. said he would make the right, whenever any of the family could receive it. But I do not think it necessary to resort to parol evidence, to shew that there was an express agreement between the parties as to the trust. It is in clear proof, that there was a writing executed by <em>Brodie </em>to <em>Philips, to secure Celeys. </em>We are not, to be sure, made acquainted with the particular terms of this writing; nor. ought we (I apprehend) to be too strict in requiring this, when we reflect, how this paper has pro-v bably disappeared. <em>Brodie </em>was the representative of <em>Philips, </em>and the husband of his daughter, and in these characters, had a right to all his papers and documents. But, though the paper be lost,, the acts of the parties throw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>strong light upon its probable contents. <em>Brodie </em>held the legal title to guard it from escheat; <em>Philips, </em>and after him his son in law and daughter, enjoyed the full and free use and possession of the estate. The letters, too, of <em>Brodie </em>to old <em>Mr. Goodwin </em>and the appellee, shew, beyond a question to my mind, that he. considered himself holding <em>Celeys </em>for the appellee. I conclude on this point, that here was a clear express trust In <em>Brodie </em>for the benefit of <em>Philips.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Now, we know that, in equity, the trust is the land ; the trustee, the mere instrument of conveyance, in no event to take a benefit. In <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate, </em>1 W. Black. 161. lord <em>Mansfield </em>uses this strong language: \u201cTwenty years ago, I imbibed this principle, that the <em>trust </em>is the estate at law <em>in this court, </em>and governed by the same rules in general, as all real property is, by imitation. Every thing 1 have heard, read or thought of since, has confirmed that principle in my mind.\u201d It is, and has long been, I believe, the policy of most nations, to exclude from all participation in the soil, those who owe allegiance to a foreign government. It is a principle deeply rooted in the common law of <em>England, </em>which as to this, is our law. By it, an alien cannot <em>hold </em>land: he may <em>take </em>indeed by <em>purchase, </em>but it is only for the benefit of the king, and so soon as there is an office found, it is seized into the king\u2019s hands; or if he die, the king is seized without office, for otherwise the freehold would be in abeyance, as an alien cannot have any inheritable blood; by <em>act of law </em>he can take nothing in land, for the law (which, as lord <em>Hale </em>says, <em>nihil frustra facit) </em>will not give him an inheritance or freehold, for he cannot keep it. The law, therefore, will not give an alien the benefit.of <em>descent, curtesy, dower </em>or <em>guardianship. </em>These positions are too well settled to need a reference to authorities. Would it not seem a strange inconsistency in the law, if principles so vital, so carefully guarded, might be rendered a dead letter by a mere change in the form of conveyances ? And yet this would be very much the case, if by making a citizen the trustee, the beneficial interest of the alien, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>land, would be placed beyond the reach of the sovereign. Our country might be filled, our farms occupied, by strangers, owing no allegiance, feeling no attachment, to our go-vernment, and adding no strength to our resources; for both Persons&gt; and ^ie wealth they might amass, would be withdrawn in the hour of danger. But the law is not justly chargeable with such inconsistency. In some of our oldest books, we find it laid down, that if an alien purchase land, and take a deed to <em>J. S. </em>in trust for himself and his heirs, the king shall have the land; not, indeed, by an inquest of office, but by a suit in equity. The first case we find on this subject, is that of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Holland </em>reported in several books. The case, as I gather it from the several reports of it, was thus : an alien purchased a <em>coyyhold </em>in fee, in the name of <em>J. S. </em>for himself and his heirs; and this being found by an office, the copyhold was seized into the hands of the king; <em>J. S. </em>came and traversed the trust, which was found for the king; yet the court decided, upon the peculiarity of the <em>copyhold, </em>being a base tenure, that the king could not recover the <em>land itself, </em>for that would make him tenant to the lord, to do service at his court, which the king could not be, but that he must sue in equity to have the trust executed. Lord <em>Hale </em>w'as of counsel in this case, and we see the account he gives of it, in the case of <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>also reported by several hands. In <em>Hardness, </em>495. he says, \u201c I hold that such a trust in an alien is forfeitable, and will belong to the king, as it was held in <em>23 </em>Car. 1. in <em>Holland's </em>case: <em>and </em>the reason is, because, an alien has no capacity to purchase for the benefit of any other but the king. And it would otherwise be inconvenient, that aliens should receive the profits of lands to their own use; and the mischief would be the same as if aliens purchased the lands themselves.\u201d Again, in a report of the same case, 3 Ch. Rep. 130. 133. it is said, that an alien, who is <em>cestui que trust </em>of any estate, such estate belongs to the king. And the chief baron said, that it was the opinion of the judges in <em>Holland's </em>case, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>which he was of counsel, that an alien hath no capacity to purchase, but for the king\u2019s use. The same law is laid down in 2 Vin. Abr. 258. and in Bac. Abr. and Com. Dig. under the head of alien. In Gilbert on Uses and Trusts, 43. 243. it is also said, \u201c a trust in an alien, is forfeited to the king.\u201d It is not necessary to cite more authorities; these are enough. I, at least, am well satisfied both with the authority and the reason of the cases. I conclude then, that the commonwealth had a right to recover this estate by bill in equity, resembling the escheat at law; and that having transferred this right to the appellee, the decree is correct in decreeing him the land; unless there be something in the case of the purchasers, which should protect them from the interference of equity. It was relied on that they were purchasers without notice; but the record contradicts this; it shews that both <em>Parlcer </em>and <em>Hubbard </em>had notice of the trust, before they were purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">But I think no rents and profits ought to be given. Such is the settled doctrine in cases of escheat at law; and the reason given there, which I think a very good one, holds equally here.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b535-7\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">This case brings into question the rights and capacities of aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">An alien may take lands by purchase, but he cannot hold them, except for the benefit of the state. But although he can take by purchase, he cannot take by act of law, as by descent or curtesy; in other words, he cannot take by act of the law, but only by his own act; for the law will not cast the freehold upon him, merely that it may be forfeited. There is, moreover, no distinction herein, whether the purchase be by feoffment, bargain and sale, or other deed, or by devise. In all those cases, as the act of the party, and not the mere act of the law, casts the freehold on the alien, he can take; though he can only hold the estate he ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>quires, subject to the right of the state to seize it, at pleasure* This can only be done, however, by office found, or something equivalent thereto. For, it is one of the principies of the common law, that the crown can only take by matter 'of record; a principle established for the security of private property from the grasp of power. And until office found, or some equivalent proceeding, he may hold against all the world, not excepting the state, and is not account\u00e1ble for rents and profits previously received. 3 Wheat. 589. 11 Wheat. 332. These principles are so elementary in their character, that it is scarcely necessary to cite authority to prove them. I will refer, however, to 7 Cranch, 613. 618. where all the authorities have been diligently collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">But though there seems to be no ground for difference of opinion, where the alien takes by purchase the <em>legal </em>title to \u2022lands, yet there does not appear to be the same unity of sentiment, in relation to an equitable interest in lands acquired \u00a1by an alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">That there are cases, in which the equitable interests of an alien in real property, are vested in the state, it will not be difficult to shew from reason and authority. But that wherever, in the case of a citizen, an equitable interest would be raised, it will be raised in favour of an alien, in order to forfeit it to the state, may, I think, well be questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">1. I am of opinion, that equity will never raise a resulting trust in favour of an alien. A resulting trust is the creature of equity. It is raised for the benefit of the party, who, upon principles of justice and the circumstances of the case, is entitled to the subject. Being raised for his benefit, there can be no motive for raising it, when that will pervert it to his prejudice. That which is designed as a boon, will not be changed into a forfeiture. To raise the trust, and thereby forfeit the estate, would be to commit the offence, and make the alien bear the penalty. Accordingly, although there is no case, perhaps, exactly like this; no case, where the court refused to raise a resulting trust for the alien, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>he had paid the purchase money; yet there are cases strongly analogous, in which the court has disclaimed the exercise of a like power, when it could only work a prejudice to the party. Thus in <em>Redington </em>v. <em>Redington, </em>3 Ridg. P. C. 106. 184. where a father who was a papist, had purchased lands in the name of his son, and the question was, whether it should be considered as a trust for the father, or an advancement for the son, it was resolved to be the latter; and a principal ground taken by the chancellor was, that to imply a trust would forfeit the lands, at the very instant the trust should be raised. So in <em>Commonwealth v. Martin\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>in this court, where lands were devised to be sold, and the money paid over to aliens, it was argued, that, upon principles of equity, the devisees had a right to elect to take the land; but it was strongly said, \u201c Why shall equity do so vain a thing, as to convert an useful principle of equity as to <em>cestuis que trust </em>generally, into an engine of destruction as to <em>alien cestuis que trusts, </em>by supposing an election in them, which they are not permitted to exercise ?\u201d \u201c The election given to a citizen, is adopted on the principle of extending a substantial benefit to him. Why will equity suppose this power in an alien, not as a benefit to him, but merely for the purpose of forfeiting bis estate.\u201d 5 Munf. <em>127. See </em>also <em>Craig v. Leslie, </em>3 Wheat. 563. So too lord <em>Mansfield, </em>speaking of this right of election in the case of a papist, says, \u201c No: a roman catholic shall not make his election, because there is a law which says, that being a <em>papist </em>he <em>shall not </em>take land.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>In common cases, where money is given to <em>be </em>laid out in land or securities, a common person may elect to take the land, a charity cannot; because it is unlawful; and, therefore, though the election be given, yet one alternative being lawful and the other not, a court of equity says you shall do that which is lawful.\u201d <em>Foone </em>v. <em>Blount, 2 </em>Cowp. 467, 8. Pursuing these principles, and a like course of reasoning, I conclude that equity will never raise a mere resulting trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>for an alien, that it may be forfeited to the state : it will mot profess to benefit, when it designs to destroy.</p>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">2. I am of opinion, that, in the case of a mere executory contract for a purchase of land, while it yet remains <em>in fieri, </em>n0 forfeiture accrues. For until the purchase is complete by the execution of a conveyance, there is a <em>locus penitentice, </em>of which the parties may avail themselves. The act is not yet consummate, which the law has forbidden. If it should never be consummated, there would be no offence against this policy of the law. If the parties, by mutual consent, should rescind their contract, there could be no doubt of their right to do so, and then no forfeiture could ever accrue. If it were otherwise, then upon a contract to sell to an alien, <em>even </em>before a cent of the purchase money was paid, the land of the citizen would be forfeited, while no penalty would fall upon the alien.' But,</p>\n<p id=\"AuGB\">3. I am very clearly of opinion, that where for the purpose of evading the law, which prohibits an alien to hold lands, he purchases real estate in the name of a trustee, upon an express or secret trust to be permitted to take and receive the rents and profits, this is such a trust as in reason and upon the well received principles of equity, as well as upon authority, will pass to the state and be enforced at its instance and in its favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In reason, indeed, there can be no doubt. The inhibition of the law would be vain and nugatory, if it could be evaded by such a trust. The policy of that rule which denies to an alien the capacity to hold lands for'his own benefit, rests upon the ground, that it is unwise to permit <em>the </em>soil of the country to be in the hands of the subjects of a foreign power, and its revenues to be enjoyed by them; since the state must be impoverished by transporting the revenues of the land into foreign countries, and weakened by putting a part of its territory under subjection to a foreign prince. Now, in a trust of this description, every evil that can flow from the conveyance of the legal title, equally exists; and hence we shall find, that, for centuries past, it has been <em>held </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that the <em>use </em>of an alien shall go to the king. Had not this w principle been adopted, the courts must either have permitted the alien to enforce the trust, which would have been a direct infraction of the policy of the law; or they must have held the trustee entitled to the property for his own use, which would have been to hold out to him the wages of treachery.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The well received principles of equity concur in sustaining this position. Trusts are considered as the legal ownership, governed by the same rules, and liable to the same charges. The trustee is considered as merely the instrument of conveyance. He is treated as a mere machine used to effect a transfer to the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and is called a <em>conduit, </em>because without deriving any benefit himself, he serves merely to <em>conduct </em>the beneficial interest to another. The <em>cestui que trust, </em>on the other hand, is regarded as the real owner of the estate, and the declaration of the use or trust as the essential part of the instrument. Though courts of law look upon the clause, which binds the feoffee to permit the <em>cestui que use </em>to enjoy the land, as nothing, courts of equity look upon it, as every thing. How, then, is the policy of the law sustained, if the alien may be permitted to become the actual owner, the real beneficiary of the land? if, by this arrangement, he is permitted actually to hold and enjoy it as the ordinary landholder; to receive its rents, to use its resources, to spend them if he resides among us, in the acquisition of an influence which is deprecated by law, or if he resides abroad, to withdraw them to foreign lands, and, so far, to sap the foundations of our strength and diminish the wealth and prosperity of our people, by this worst of all kinds of <em>absenteeism. </em>I cannot think that such practices can be endured ;' for by such means, foreigners by selecting confidential friends as trustees, might ensure the actual enjoyment of the lands for a very long series of years, if not forever, in direct contravention of the policy of the law; (5 Munf. 140.) and that space in the land would be filled up by persons alien to our institutions, and the subjects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of foreign powers, which ought to be occupied by a faithful yeomanry devoted to the land of their birth or the country of their adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"AMRp\">Authority, upon this subject, is, I conceive, equally emphatical. I shall not stop to examine minutely, whether opinions, which have received the sanction of every luminary of the law, from the time of <em>Coke </em>and <em>Roll </em>to our own, were or were not expressed extrajudicial!y. To the opinion of the venerable sages of the law of ancient times, we are told that great veneration and respect are to be paid, \u201c as evidence that cases <em>have </em>formerly happened, in which such and such points were determined, which are now become settled and first principles.\u201d They are among the fountains, from which we draw the common law; and when <em>Coke </em>or <em>Roll </em>or <em>Hale </em>lays down a principle as received, <em>we may safely </em>receive it as an adjudicated principle. If we consider only as <em>dicta, </em>and disregard accordingly, doctrines for which an express adjudication cannot be produced, the most unquestioned principles would be most in danger; for these are most apt to have their sources hidden, in the recesses of a remote antiquity. Confiding then, as I do, in the <em>weight </em>of the authorities, there can be no question, that they concur in establishing that a trust for an alien enures to the crown. Besides the short annunciation of this doctrine in the successive abridgements and elementary writers, to which reference has been made in the argument, I shall content myself with the mention particularly of the well reflected declaration of this opinion on the part of lord <em>Hale </em>as chief baron of the exchequer. In the case of <em>The Duke of York </em>v. <em>Sir John Marsham, </em>Hardr. 432. 436. he cites the case of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>in which he had been counsel. There, an alien had purchased a <em>copyhold, </em>which was conveyed to another in trust for him : and in assigning the reasons upon which, as he says, the right of the crown was declared not to be forfeited, there is no intimation of an idea, that it arose from the interest in the alien being merely <em>equitable. </em>On the contrary, the reasons assigned go as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to deny the right of the king to a forfeiture of the copyhold itself, even if the alien had taken the <em>legal </em>title. In the following year but one, the case of <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>which had been long under consideration was decided by lord <em>Hale. </em>Hardr. 495. Upon that occasion, the doctrine respecting a trust for an alien, was distinctly pressed upon the court in the argument; and his lordship, in delivering his opinion <em>against </em>the forfeiture in that case, distinctly admits, \u201c that the trust of an inheritance in an alien, is forfeitable, and will belong to the king; as, says he, it was held in <em>Holland\u2019s </em>case; and the reason is, because an alien has no capacity to purchase for the benefit of any other but of the king. And it would be otherwise inconvenient, that aliens should receive the profits of lands to their own use, <em>and, the mischief would he the same as if aliens purchased the lands themselves; </em>but in that case the king is entitled to the profits only; the land itself is not forfeited to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Here then, we have an explict opinion of lord <em>Hale </em>upon this point, not resting solely upon that in <em>Holland\u2019s </em>case, but sustained by reasons suggested by his own accurate mind. We also have an explicit statement of the fact that such was the decision in <em>Holland\u2019s </em>case. This statement was doubtless correct, for <em>Hale </em>was of counsel in the case, and his account of the judgement is far more satisfactory than the report in <em>Stiles, </em>in which there appears to me to be some omission, as the resolution of the court no where clearly appears. These decisions, more than 150 years ago, transmitted from generation to generation by the learned, as settled principles of the common law, cannot now with propriety be considered as mere <em>dicta, </em>which should have no influence with the court. As such this court did not consider them in <em>The commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin\u2019s ex\u2019ors; </em>for there, the only debateable question was, whether the aliens were to be considered as having a trust in the lands; for it seems to have been agreed, on all hands, that, if they had, the right of the commonwealth was not debateable.</p>\n<p id=\"Auhf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The case of <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate </em>has been cited. Of this case, I think, it may be truly said, that it is of very doubtful authority. It was decided by lord <em>JVorihington </em>and sir <em>Thomas Clarke </em>against lord <em>Mansfield\u2019, </em>decided as lord <em>Thurlow </em>says, 1 Bro. C. C. 204. upon divided opinions, and opinions, which continue to be divided, of very learned men.\u201d And when we find lord <em>Thurlow </em>himself pronouncing, that it was decided <em>\" </em>upon the <em>scanty </em>ground of the defect of a tenant,\u201d and declaring an executor trustee of personalty for the crown for want of next of kin, we cannot err very far in placing him on the side of lord <em>Mansfield </em>in this matter. If we do so, the scales are balanced, and the opinions of other learned men will make that of lord <em>Mansfield </em>decidedly preponderate. See 2 Kent\u2019s Comm. 54. citing Sugden\u2019s Gilbert on uses, 86.404. That learned judge there delivers it as received doctrine, that the crown takes the trust of an alien. There, certainly, can be nothing more unreasonable, I think, than this decision of <em>Burgess v. Wheate, </em>if we consider it in any other light than as a mere question of tenure. That the trustee should be permitted, upon the death of the beneficial owner without heirs, to hold the estate to his own use, is utterly at variance, not only with the principles of equity, which consider him as a mere machine, an instrument, a conduit; which depjare-that trusts and legal estates shall be governed by the same <em>rules, </em>and that the trust shall descend and pass as the legal estate would descend and pass; but, it seems to me, at variance with the natural justice of the case. It is right and proper, that when the owner of property dies without giving it away, and without leaving any object having natural claims to his bounty, such as heirs or next of kin, his property should go to the community of which he is a member. But, in truth, <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate </em>was decided on the ground of tenure. It was a question of <em>escheat for want of heirs, </em>not of right in the crown because of alienage. And it was decided, that there could be no <em>escheat </em>upon the death of the <em>cestui que trust </em>without heirs, because the trustee was in existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to do tho services. It is to me very obvious, that this principle has no application to the case of an alien. That is not (though it is often inaccurately so spoken of as) a case of escheat. The devolving of the rights of the alien on the crown, is arranged by the most distinguished commentator under the head of forfeiture; though, in a case of more recent date than his work, it is said that it is not to be considered as a penalty or forfeiture, but as arising merely from the policy of law; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Duplessis. </em>Be this as it may, it is confessedly altogether distinct from es-cheat, of which no further evidence need be required, than that, in case of escheat, the property in <em>England </em>goes to the <em>lord </em>of whom the tenant held, whereas in case of alienation, to an alien, it <em>always </em>goes to the crown, even though the land be holden of a mesne lord. Now, though it be true, as decided in <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate, </em>that the interest of <em>cestui que trust </em>shall not escheat (that is, devolve upon the lord for want of a tenant) because the lord has in fact a tenant in the trustee ; yet it surely does not follow, that the trust estate of an alien, shall not devolve on the crown, for the same reason; since the want of a tenant is not the reason upon which it ever devolves on the crown. The case of <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Wheate </em>has, therefore, I conceive, no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">After the preceding view of the state of the law which bears upon this case, I proceed to remark, very succinctly, upon the facts as they appear to me. J am clearly of opinion, that the doctrine of resulting trusts does not apply to the case. There is no room for a resulting trust where there is an express trust; and here, I think, there was an express trust, in writing, to permit the alien to take and enjoy the rents and profits to him and his heirs. That the land was purchased with <em>Philips\u2019s </em>money is admitted : that <em>Brodie </em>always acknowledged that the property was not his but <em>Philips\u2019s </em>is certain. From these circumstances, I should infer that, <em>ah ovo, </em>there was an understanding between <em>Bro-die </em>and <em>Philips, </em>that tho former was to purchase the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>in his own name, and hold it for the latter. Such an understanding was an express trust though verbal.</p>\n<p id=\"AAh\">But it was not a mere verbal trust. It was a trust in writing. That there was a writing executed by the parties, is Perfec% clear; and this fact of itself puts the statute of frauds out of the question ; for, if the trust or bargain whatever it was, was reduced to writing, the statute cannot apply, even though the contract or writing be lost. What was the precise nature of that writing, we are not informed by the witnesses. They state, however, that it was a writing <em>to secure the title of Celeys. </em>It was executed in <em>Philips\u2019s </em>lifetime, and the conduct of the parties amply supplies the defect of the testimony of the witnesses. Was it a bond to make a title ? <em>Philips </em>was an alien, and could not take one j else, the deed might have been made to him in the first instance. Was it a bond to make him a title <em>when </em>he should become a citizen ? If so, we should probably have heard of his taking some steps towards it. Nothing of that sort appears : no attempt at naturalization appears to have been made, though the facilities to admission had been, before 1805, the date of this transaction, very much increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">These considerations shew, negatively, what was not the character of the written instrument. The acts of the parties shew pretty clearly, what was the character of the arrangement between the parties; and it would seem natural to suppose, that the writing contained the arrangement, whatever it might be. What was the arrangement ? I answer, that <em>Brodie </em>should continue to hold the estate in his own name, but should permit <em>Philips </em>to enter upon the estate, receive the rents and profits, enjoy it as his own, and have it completely under his control. .That <em>this </em>was the arrangement is to be <em>presumed, </em>because <em>this was actually done. Philips </em>did take possession; did enjoy, did receive rents and profits, did have complete control of the estate, and died in possession. After his death <em>Goodwin </em>and wife, both aliens, entered, in right of the wife, and held until his death, in the same manner. After <em>Goodwin\u2019s </em>death, <em>Mrs. Good</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>win, </em>still an alien, continued to bold in the same manne<em>r, </em>until she married <em>Brodic </em>in lbll ; and alter tue marriage, <em>Jirodie </em>and herself resided on the property until 183 5, when she died. What are we to infer from these facts, but that, although the land was held in <em>Brodie\u2019s </em>name, it was arranged between him and his friend, that that friend, though an alien, should be permitted to hold, enjoy, and control the estate as his own, under the shadow and protection of the deed from <em>Cary </em>to <em>Brodie. </em>A more complete trust cannot, 1 think, be conceived, and the right of the commonwealth is a necessary consequence. This right might properly have been asserted in the court of chancery, even in <em>Philips\u2019s </em>lifetime ; but since, by his death, the title was devolved on the state, without an office found, there can no longer be a question as to that matter. Moreover, the right of the commonwealth is transferred to the appellee, and be is empowered to assert it in any court of law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Having thus arrived at the conclusion, that the commonwealth bad the right, and that the plaintiff is invested with that right, we next proceed to the defences.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Neither <em>Parker </em>nor <em>Hubbard </em>were purchasers without notice of the trust. If they had so purchased, they would not have been affected by the trust. Yet they must have shewn payment of purchase money, and the receipt of the conveyance to protect them. But, in truth, it is clearly proved they had both sufficient notice, not only before one cent of the money was ever paid, but before <em>Hubbard </em>even became the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">It was said, this sale was authorized by the guardian and counsel of the appellee. No such authority could have been given by him, for he was an infaut; and it was not, therefore, possessed by the parties who exerted it. in fact, at that time, the commonwealth, and not <em>Goodwin, </em>was the party interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">As to the profits : The commonwealth (or <em>Goodwin </em>who stands in her stead) can come into equity only upon the principle, <em>equitas sequitur legem. </em>They rely that trusts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>must be treated as legal estates, and upon that ground assert ^le r\u2018gl-lts of the state. If so, then the principle must be followed up to its consequences. We cannot blow both h\u00b0t and cold. If equity follows the law, it must follow it throughout. Now? at law, until office found, the alien may receive the rents and profits and shall never be accountable for them. 3 Wheat. 563. 589. And this is the consequence, I take, it, of the fact, that there is no remedy for such profits. In <em>Wheaton, </em>no case is cited in support of the position ; but it seems sufficiently obvious upon this ground simply. The office found merely ascertained title of the crown, whereupon it <em>entered </em>by its officers. But no damages were provided for, nor were damages ever found by the inquest, nor is any remedy devised for the recovery of them. And this was equally the case, whether the alien himself or any other took the profits. Upon office found, they could not be recovered. Now, equity in <em>following </em>the law, <em>cannot go further </em>than the law. Equity, therefore, cannot decree rents and profits. The alien or any other person may take them without accountability, until office found or until some \u00e9quivalent proceeding. What is the equivalent proceeding in this court ? The decree. The office found ascertains the title of the crown, and vests the possession. That is the effect here of a decree, and until the decree there is no such effect. Therefore, I am of opinion, that so much of the decree of the court of chancery as decrees a title to be made to the appellant be affirmed, and, as to all other matters, that it be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">I am clearly of opinion, that the court ought not in this cause to undertake to adjust the transactions between <em>Hub-hard </em>and <em>Kennedy. </em>None of the cases in which the court has decreed between defendants, have gone so far. I think it has been done in no case where the plaintiff was not entitled to a decree against both or either. The practice should not be extended further. The contest, if any, between defendants can never come <em>fairly </em>before the court. There is no issue made up, nor any provision for taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>their testimony in reference to the peculiar matters in dif<em>J . </em>ference between them. Indeed, it does not follow, that in answer to a plaintiff\u2019s bill, the defendant should go on to state his own case in reference to his difference with his co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">However, as the appellants were both properly made parties in the court of chancery, in reference to the question of title, they must pay the costs of that court. They must have their costs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Both decrees reversed, so far as they directed an account of profits, and decreed the payment of the profits by <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>JYimmo\u2019s </em>administratrix, and the first decree, for the land itself, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
