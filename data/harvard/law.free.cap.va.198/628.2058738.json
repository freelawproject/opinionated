Supp., Code of 1950, and appealed to the circuit court. In his petition for an appeal, he alleged that the order of the Commissioner was \u201cin violation of the Constitution, in excess of the statutory authority of the Commissioner, and was made upon unlawful procedure; and was arbitrary, capricious and in abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Commissioner answered the petition, and filed, as required by \u00a7 46-424 (b), transcript of the former proceedings of September 21st, 1955. He denied that the action taken by him was unlawful, and asserted that the evidence was ample to support his order suspending the license for thirty days. He also alleged that since the hearing on September 21, 1955, he had been informed that Rubin had been convicted of four other violations of the motor vehicles laws not listed in the notice of September 14, 1955, and not a subject of the hearing on September 21st, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">\u201cConvictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A40\">Date Court Offense</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACG\">April 20,1948 Trial Justice Court of Elizabeth City Speeding 65 miles per hour in 50 zone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">December 10,1948 Traffic Court of the City of Newport News Speeding 45 miles per hour in 15 zone</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZF\">June 25,1949 Trial Justice Court of Hampton, Virginia Speeding</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7H\">March 13,1950 Recorder\u2019s Court of Dunn, North Carolina Speeding 70 miles per hour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">Copies of the abstracts of the additional convictions were attached to the answer as exhibits. In addition the Commissioner attached a photostatic copy of the application of Rubin for a driver\u2019s license, dated October 16, 1953, wherein Rubin had answered in the negative the following questions: (1) Whether he had ever been convicted in this State or elsewhere of any offense resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, and, (2) Whether his privilege to drive had been suspended or revoked in this or any other State.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The Commissioner prayed the lower court to consider the additional evidence, affirm the order of the Commissioner suspending the license and lengthen the period of suspension to the extent deemed necessary and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The trial court refused to receive or consider the evidence of the additional convictions, mentioned in the Commissioner\u2019s answer, and Rubin\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license. Rubin did not testify. Upon consideration of the evidence as to the convictions charged in the notice of June 14, 1955, the court modified the order of the Commissioner and ordered the suspension of Rubin\u2019s driving license for a period of ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The Commissioner assigns error to the action of the court in reducing the period of the suspension, to the refusal of the court to receive and consider the additional evidence, and to its failure to increase the period of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Summarized the evidence offered before the Commissioner at the September hearing was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">On March 1, 1955, at 11:30 a. m., Rubin drove his automobile through a stop sign and stoplight, in plain view, at the intersection of Main Street and Route 58 in the Town of Holland, Virginia, during a period of heavy traffic. Rubin, when arrested, told the officer that he did not see the stop signals. He testified before the Commissioner\u2019s representative that \u201cI recall there was no traffic on either side. T don\u2019t drive through traffic I don\u2019t care what the light is. Traffic coming or going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">On May 8, 1955, Rubin drove his automobile through a red light at the intersection of 28th Street and Washington Avenue, in Newport News, Virginia. He told the arresting officer that he did not see the traffic light as it changed from green to red. His conviction resulted on May 17th.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">There was no question of the validity of the above two convictions nor any denial of the convictions in Essex County on June 22, 1955; in Nansemond County on January 13, 1951; and in North Carolina on April 18, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Rubin admitted to the Commissioner\u2019s representative with reference to the conviction in North Carolina, for speeding at 80 miles per hour, that he had driven his car at that unlawful rate of speed, because he was trying out a new car and there was no traffic on the highway. He further admitted that his operator\u2019s license in North Carolina was suspended as a result of that offense. He said, however, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>never been convicted of reckless driving and that he had never been involved in an accident except on an occasion when he backed into a man at a golf course.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Code, \u00a7 46-420, on which this proceeding is based, provides that \u201cwhenever\u201d any one of the seven listed charges against a licensee has been \u201csatisfactorily proved at the hearing conducted by the Commissioner\u201d or his representative, the Commissioner may order a suspension or revocation of the license. Such suspension or revocation may be ordered under Item 5 of the section, if there is satisfactory proof of a single \u201cserious violation;\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Va. 18, 23, 82 S. E. 2d 473, or under Item 4 for habitually reckless and negligent driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In applying \u00a7 46-420, the Commissioner is permitted to exercise discretion. He may suspend a license for a period as long as a year and as short as one day, as he may deem proper under the facts and circumstances of the particular offense. The suspension is designed to protect the public in the use of the highways, and to deny their use to \u201cpersons who are shown to have been so reckless in their customary operation of motor vehicles that a repetition of the same or similar conduct may be expected, and if it occurs, it will constitute a menace to the safety of others.\u201d <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 294, 301, 56 S. E. 2d 222; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 411, 423, 53 S. E. 2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Rubin was shown to have been convicted of five violations of the traffic laws between January 13, 1951 and June 22, 1955, two of them in this State within one year. Additional evidence tendered in the trial court showed four other convictions between April 20, 1948 and March 13, 1950. Seven of the above nine convictions were on account of excessive speed and two for failure to observe traffic signals. Rubin does not deny his guilt in any instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Excessive speed upon the highway is not a trifling matter. It is generally attended with danger, likely to cause injury and damage. It may be that, by a momentary lapse of attention, or by means of certain attendant physical or surrounding circumstances, the driver of an automobile may fail to observe a traffic sign or light, and thus offer a reasonable excuse for the non-observance; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Taylor, ante </em>page 621, decided this day; but no such explanation or excuse is made here. Nor is any explanation or excuse offered for the excessive speed convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Was it the duty of the trial court to hear and consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>additional evidence of the convictions prior to 1951? We think it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The introduction of such evidence is expressly authorized by Item (d) of \u00a7 46-424, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cThe court, sitting without a jury, shall hear the appeal on the record transmitted by the Commissioner and such additional evidence as may be necessary to resolve any controversy as to the correctness of the record, and the court <em>shall receive such other evidence as the ends of justice </em>require.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The additional evidence tendered by the Commissioner was offered, of course, as additional proof of the charge that Rubin was an habitually negligent and reckless driver, and as affecting his veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Item (e) of the same section empowers the trial court to reverse or modify the decision of the Commissioner, or remand the case for further proceedings if the decision is, (1) in violation of constitutional provisions or (2) in excess of statutory authority or jurisdiction.of the Commissioner; or (3) made upon unlawful procedure; or (4) affected by other error of law; or (5) unsupported by the evidence on the record considered as a whole; or (6) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or (7) <em>if such other evidence is heard may affirm, reverse or modify the decision as the ends of justice may required </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Item (d) and subsection (7) of Item (e) were enacted in the interest of justice. Their application may operate for the benefit of the licensee in some instances, <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra) </em>and in some cases against him <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Mozingo, </em>198 Va. 432, 438, 94 S. E. 2d 457). At any rate, competent probative evidence of facts and circumstances connected with the driving habits of a licensee, and of certain conditions attending a driving offense charged against him is helpful both to the Commissioner and to trial courts in arriving at a decision and applying the penalty, when a penalty is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">\u201cThough the trial court be vested with broad discretionary power under \u00a7 46-424, yet the Commissioner\u2019s order should not be vacated and annulled if his findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and he has applied correct principles of law to the proved facts.\u201d <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Mozingo, supra, </em>198 Va. at 438).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">It should also be remembered that \u00a7 46-388 of the \u201cMotor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">\u201cIt is the legislative intent that this chapter be liberally construed so as to effectuate as far as legally and practically possible and feasible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>its primary objective to promote and further greater safety in the operation of automotive vehicles in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We find no merit in the contention that the order of the Commissioner was \u201cin violation of the provisions of the Constitution.\u201d In several cases we have held that Code, \u00a7 46-416.1, 1956 Cum. Supp., Code of 1950, conferring power upon the Commissioner to mandatorily revoke licenses upon conviction of two or more violations of traffic regulations and law is constitutional. <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>195 Va. 1005, 81 S. E. 2d 743; <em>Badalson </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>195 Va. 1018, 81 S. E. 2d 750; <em>Ladd </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>195 Va. 1031, 81 S. E. 2d 756; <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Lanzarone, </em>195 Va. 1038, 81 S. E. 2d 760. The reasons stated in those cases apply with equal force to the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-420.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The suspension ordered by the Commissioner was clearly not in excess of the authority vested in him. The procedure he followed was in accordance with the statute, and not affected by any error of law; and we find nothing whatever to indicate that his order was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The evidence before him was sufficient to warrant the entry of his order upon either of the grounds charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The case of <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>is different factually and on principle from the instant case. In the cited case, Taylor had been convicted only of one momentary violation of the traffic laws. Upon appeal material evidence of probative value, relative to the circumstances attending that violation, not before the Commissioner, was presented to the circuit court. Here, it is needless to again recite the numerous convictions of Rubin. The additional evidence offered by the Commissioner at the trial of his case in the circuit court supported and sustained the discretion exercised by the Commissioner in suspending Rubin\u2019s license. The whole evidence showed that Rubin was a potentially dangerous driver with a bad driving record.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The present case presents a picture quite similar to that in the case of <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Mozingo, supra. </em>In that case the trial court annulled the Commissioner\u2019s order suspending Mozingo\u2019s permit. Upon the trial in the circuit court, additional evidence was produced by both Mozingo and the Commissioner. The evidence in the entire proceedings showed that Mozingo had been convicted of the four specific charges considered by the Commissioner, and had also been convicted of five violations of the traffic law other than those introduced in evidence before him. In consideration of all the facts and circumstances, we reversed the judgment of the trial court, and reinstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the Commissioner\u2019s order of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In conclusion, we are of opinion that the evidence in the present case warranted the Commissioner\u2019s order suspending Rubin\u2019s license for thirty days, and that in the interest of justice and law observance, it should have been affirmed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the order of the Commissioner suspending appellee\u2019s operator\u2019s license for a period of thirty days from the date of its surrender to the Division of Motor Vehicles is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
