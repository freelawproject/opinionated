Hailman made written application to the Fairfax County Police Pension Board for pension and retirement from active duty as a county policeman. He asserted that he was suffering from an occupationally induced disability that rendered him incapable of performing his duties and asked for retirement from service and pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>benefits under the provisions of Chapter 303, Acts 1944,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hereinafter called the Pension Act, the pertinent parts of which are copied below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Hailman was examined by several physicians and upon their reports and other evidence, the board concluded that he was \u201cable to perform some duty in the Police Department and that he be denied any retirement at this time.\u201d Claimant appealed from the board\u2019s decision and filed his petition in the circuit court against the pension board. He asserted that he had been a member of the county police force for twelve years and contributed to its retirement and pension system for eleven years; that he was suffering from chronic glaucoma in both eyes induced by occupational duties, and that he was unable to perform his work as a police officer because of the malady. He prayed that the court decree him retirement \u201con account of disabilities resulting from activities in discharge of official duties\u201d allowed by \u00a7 8 of the Pension Act, or in the alternative, decree that he \u201cbe retired for disability from natural causes not originating in performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of official duties\u201d allowed by \u00a7 7 of the act, and that he be awarded pension benefits accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In its answer the board neither admitted nor denied that Hailman was suffering from chronic glaucoma, but it did deny that claimant\u2019s condition was induced by his occupation or service as a police officer, and it also denied that he was \u201cincapable of continuing active duty as a police officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The trial court heard and considered all evidence offered by claimant and the pension board, but the evidence was not transcribed or made a part of the record and none of it is before us for consideration. The final order discloses that the trial court held that chronic glaucoma of the eyes was not the type of injury or disability that would entitle claimant to retirement for disability incurred as a result of activities in the discharge of his official duties, and that petitioner had failed to prove \u201cthat he was in fact disabled.\u201d After that finding of fact, the order, by way of recital, also states that the action and judgment of the pension board denying retirement and compensation were not \u201carbitrary, unreasonable and capricious, which would be necessary for this Court to grant the relief prayed for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Claimant contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">(a) That the court erred in holding that chronic glaucoma of the eyes was not a type of disease and disability that would entitle him to retirement for disability incurred in the line of duty, and</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">(b) That the recital in the final order that the board\u2019s action was not arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious shows that the court did not hear the appeal <em>de novo, </em>but acted as a court of review and erroneously imposed upon claimant the duty and burden of proving that the board had acted arbitrarily, unreasonably and capriciously in denying his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">We are reminded that the pension act is beneficent in purpose and should be liberally construed so as to effect the legislative purpose and intent. <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Key, 192 </em>Va. 694, 66 S. E. 2d 479; 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 386, p. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">It is then argued that chronic glaucoma can be and was in this instance a disability incurred in the line of duty and retirement and pension should be granted under \u00a7 8 of the pension act. However, we need not decide whether or not disability brought about by chronic glaucoma is or can be a disability incurred in line of duty or whether the appeal of right given from the board\u2019s decision by \u00a7 13 of the act must be heard <em>de novo </em>by the court. The record and final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>show that the court considered all testimony and evidence offered by both parties and thus did in fact hear the appeal <em>de </em>novo, and upon such trial found from the evidence that claimant had failed to prove \u201cthat he was in fact disabled.\u201d Clearly upon that finding of fact, no retirement or pension under either \u00a77 or \u00a7 8 could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Without having the evidence before us for consideration, the further recital in the final order that the denial of Hailman\u2019s claim by the board \u201cwas not arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious, which would be necessary for this court to grant the relief prayed for,\u201d does not justify rejection of the court\u2019s finding from the evidence that claimant had failed to show that he was in fact disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judgment was entered upon the evidence heard, and it is presumed to be correct, and the burden is upon claimant to show that- it is erroneous. Without the evidence it cannot be said that the factual finding that claimant had not proved that he was disabled was erroneous. It necessarily follows that the judgment of the trial court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\"> Chapter 303, page 437, Acts 1944, is a special act that does not appear in the Code of 1950.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> Section 2.
