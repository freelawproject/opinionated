From this we granted petitioner an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">While four assignments of error were filed, in our view the sole question for decision is whether the title of the chapter fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52 of the Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">It is conceded that the two places of manufacture operated at different locations by Kingan, Incorporated within the City of Richmond fully met the requirements for the benefit afforded by Chapter 303 of the Acts of 1948 (Code, \u00a7 58-317.1) and the company is entitled to the relief prayed for provided the act is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">It will be noted that the object of the act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is to make the term \u201cplace of manufacture\u201d mean not only the actual site of manufacture but also to include another manufacturing site in the same city or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>county operated by the same manufacturer as to goods transferred to the other plant so long as the value of the goods manufactured at the latter plant equals one-third of the value of the goods transferred thereto..</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The city contends (as held by the trial court) that Chapter 303 of the Acts of 1948 does not <em>define </em>the words \u201cplace of manufacture\u201d which the title states was the purpose of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"AdF\">With this we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">.It is true that the chapter does not write a definition of the term \u201cplace of manufacture\u201d in concise words. It does, however, fix and establish the limits of the term as used in the Tax Code, and the purpose of the act, as stated, was to amend the Tax Code \u201cby adding a section, numbered 188-b, to define the words \u2018place of manufacture\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">A term can be defined without a technical definition. It can be defined by description. Here the term \u201cplace of manufacture\u201d as used in the Tax Code is plainly described, that is, the act says in effect that two places of manufacture become as one if other requirements in the act are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Acts of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional both as to title and text. <em>Good </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 996, 1000, 154 S. E. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">The title of the act in question plainly shows with what it is dealing and should be held to be sufficient where it fairly identifies and is in furtherance of the object expressed therein. The provision of the Constitution is to be liberally construed so as to uphold the law if practicable. All that is required is that the subjects embraced in the statute but not specified in the title are congruous and have natural connection with or are germane to the subject in the title. As we have many times said, the object of the constitutional provision is to prevent the members of the legislature and the people from being misled by the title to a law. Its purpose is to prevent the use of deceptive titles as a cover to vicious legislation and the practice of bringing together for corrupt purposes subjects diverse and dissimilar in their nature and having no necessary connection with each other, and for the prevention of fraud in legislation by means of provisions in bills of which the title gives no intimation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>91 Va. 762, 771, 774, 21 S. E. 357. See also Annotations, Code, 1950, Constitution of Virginia, \u00a7 52, p. 462, <em>et seq.; </em>1956 Cum. Supp., Code, 1950, Constitution of Virginia, \u00a7 52, p. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">We are here dealing with \u201cAn Act to amend the Tax Code of Vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ginia by adding a section, numbered 188-b, to define the words \u2018place of manufacture\u2019 \u201d. Clearly this title pin-points by description the object and purpose of the legislation, and no one could be misled by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">For the reasons stated we are of the opinion that the order complained of be reversed and the petitioner granted the relief prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 52.
