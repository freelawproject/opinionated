J. Bles, trading as M. J. Bles Construction Company, to recover damages in the amount of $27,774 for the alleged breach of a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss upon the ground that the contract sued on was \u201cunlawful and void.\u201d He asserted that it was unlawful and unenforceable because plaintiffs\u2019 undertaking was in excess of $20,000, and they had not registered with, and qualified before the State Registration Board for Contractors, as general contractors or subcontractors, as required by Code of Virginia, 1950, Chapter 7, Title 54, \u00a7\u00a7 54-113 to 54-145, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The case was heard by the court on the notice of motion supplemented by a bill of particulars, certain exhibits submitted by council, and the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">It appeared from the pleadings and exhibits that defendant, as a general contractor, entered into a contract in July, 1953, with the City of Martinsville, Virginia, entitled a \u201cContract for Projects Numbers 2, 4 and 5, and Specifications for Waterworks Improvements for City of Martinsville.\u201d The contract provided that defendant was to clear a reservoir area, construct a dam and spillways, lay pipe lines, and do certain other things incidental to the completion of the whole waterworks improvement plan. Project No. 2 was entitled \u201cPipe Line;\u201d Project No. 4 \u201cClearing Reservoir Area;\u201d and Project No. 5 \u201cEarth Fill Dam.\u201d The area to be cleared and the work to be done under Project No. 4 was set out as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-12\">\u201cBeginning at a line parallel to and 300 ft. upstream above the construction base line of the dam, the contractor shall remove from the entire area to be flooded and a marginal strip approximately 50 ft\u201e beyond tfoe flooded area all trees, saplings, undergrowth, brush <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>wood, fallen trees, houses, fences, and other perishable material. He shall also burn over all of the area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">It was also provided that \u201cthe Contractor may determine for himself the method in which he shall destroy or remove the timber or material to be disposed of and shall have the privilege of clearing the land with bulldozers or similar equipment if found to be more economical than cutting with axes, saws or similar equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In clearing the reservoir area the contractor was allowed to use explosives for blasting, but in handling, using and storing explosives was required to conform to the laws and regulations of the City of Martinsville and the State, and to conduct blasting so as not to endanger persons or property. Strict requirements were prescribed as to adequate sanitary protection to insure cleanliness to the community and to prevent pollution of the water shed, in a manner satisfactory to the State Department of Health, the local Sanitary Officer and Engineer. The specifications only required that the trees be cut a short distance from the ground and the removal of stumps was not involved. No grading was required, no dirt was to be removed; and none of this was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Defendant, the general contractor, sublet Project No. 4 to plaintiffs as subcontractors, and the latter undertook the clearing of the reservoir area in accordance with the plans and specifications of that project. The area to be cleared consisted of 225 acres, and plaintiffs were to receive $143 per acre and the timber cut from that acreage.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">A few weeks after plaintiffs began work, the Lester Lumber Company, Inc., made claim to the timber, and the parties interested being unable to agree on the ownership of the timber, defendant notified plaintiffs to stop all work and leave the area. Plaintiffs complied with that demand and then instituted their action on April 16, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The trial court, in a written opinion, held that plaintiffs were subcontractors within the meaning of Chapter 7, Title 54, \u00a7\u00a7 54-113 to 54-145, inclusive, Code of Virginia, 1950. It being admitted that they had not registered and qualified as a general contractor or subcontractor under \u00a7 54-113(2), and that the cost of the work to be performed by plaintiffs was in excess of $20,000, the court dismissed the action. Upon petition of the plaintiffs, we granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">The issue for determination is: What effect, if any, did the failure of plaintiffs, trading as Sellers Brothers, to register and qualify as a subcontractor under Chapter 7, Title 54, Code of 1950 have on their right to maintain this action? In their brief plaintiffs concede that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>amendment made to \u00a7 54-113(2) in 1954, Acts 1954,- ch. 428, p. 523<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">So much of Chapter 7, Title 54, Code, 1950, as is material and pertinent reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u00a754-113(2) <em>General </em>contractor\u2019 or \u2018subcontractor\u2019 shall mean any person, firm, association or corporation that for a fixed price, commission, fee or percentage, undertakes to bid upon, or to construct or superintend the construction of, any building, highway, bridge, railway, sewer, pipe line, grading, or any improvement, or structure or part thereof, when the cost of the undertaking or a subcontract thereunder is twenty thousand dollars or more; and any person, firm, association or corporation who shall bid upon or engage in constructing or superintending the construction of any structure or any undertaking or improvements or part thereof above mentioned in the State, costing twenty thousand dollars or more, shall be deemed to have engaged in the business of general contracting or subcontracting in this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u00a7 54-128: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to engage in, or offer to engage in, general contracting or subcontracting in this State, unless he has been duly licensed and issued a certificate of registration under the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00a7 54-129 provides for application for registration, fees, examination and issuance of certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u00a7 54-142 makes a violation of the statute punishable as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">If the contract undertaken by Sellers Brothers brought them within the purview of \u00a754-113(2), then upon engaging in the work as subcontractors without having obtained the required license and certificate of registration, they committed a misdemeanor, (\u00a7\u00a7 54-128 and 54-142), and their contract is unenforceable. <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>194 Va. 92, 72 S. E. 2d 388; <em>Hancock Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>177 Va. 349, 14 S. E. 2d 332; <em>Massie, et al. </em>v. <em>Dudley, Exec\u2019r, </em>173 Va. 42, 3 S. E. 2d 176; <em>Colbert, etc. </em>v. <em>Ashland Construction Co., </em>176 Va. 500, 11 S. E. 2d 612; <em>Lasting Products Co. </em>v. <em>Genovese, </em>197 Va. 1, 87 S. E. 2d 811; <em>Sutton Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wise Contracting Co., Inc., et al., </em>197 Va. 705, 90 S. E. 2d 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Before undertaking to interpret \u00a754-113(2) to determine if that section includes what plaintiffs contracted to do, we consider the character of the legislation embodied in Chapter 7, Title 54, Code of 1950, of which it is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Chapter 7, Title 54, was enacted in the exercise of the state\u2019s police power. Though it has remedial features, yet it imposes restrictions upon a common trade or occupation, and it is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u201cIn Virginia the well-settled rule of construction is that even though a statute be remedial, when, at the same time, it is also in derogation of common law, it must be strictly construed.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>188 Va. 214, 222, 49 S. E. 2d 310. 17 M. J., Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 69, p. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The act in question is also penal, and for that reason, in applying its penal provision or giving effect to its sanctions, strict construction is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">\u201cThis is a penal ordinance, and is, therefore, to be construed strictly. It is not to be extended by implication, and must be limited in its application to cases clearly described by the language employed. The books abound with cases illustrating this principle, which is of universal application, except in particular instances in which the doctrine has been modified by statute.\u201d <em>Gates &amp; Son Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>103 Va. 702, 704, 49 S. E. 965. 17 M. J., Statutes, \u00a7 67, p. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">Unless the work that plaintiffs did falls within the letter and the spirit of \u00a7 54-113(2), they have committed no criminal offense, and their contract is enforceable. 17 M. J., Statutes, \u00a7 67, p. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u201cThere is nothing immoral or contrary to public policy in a construction contract involving $20,000 or more. Neither does the statute (Code, \u00a7 54-113 if.), either expressly or impliedly, forbid such a contract. It merely prohibits unqualified persons\u2014that is those who have not registered or taken out the required license\u2014 from entering into such an agreement.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Mayflower Corp., </em>196 Va. 1153, 1160, 86 S. E. 2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Only general contractors and subcontractors as defined by \u00a7 54-113 (2) are required to take an examination and get a certificate. That section provides that the contractors to whom these statutes are applicable are those who bid upon, construct or superintend the construction of any (1) building, (2) highway, (3) bridge, (4) railway, (5) sewer, (6) pipe line, (7) grading, (8) or any improvement, (9) or structure or part thereof, \u201cwhen the cost of the undertaking or a subcontract thereunder is twenty thousand dollars or more. # # #\u00bb jt tpen eXpressiy provides that any person who \u201cshall bid upon or engage in constructing or superintending the construction of any structure or any undertaking or improvements or parts thereof above mentioned * * * shall be deemed to have engaged in the business of general contracting or subcontracting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">It is conceded that neither a general contractor nor a subcontractor is required to take the examination and qualify unless the work that he <em>personally </em>bids upon or undertakes amounts to $20,000 or more. We likewise think fair interpretation and application of \u00a7 54-113(2) leads to the inevitable conclusion that it is the character of a subcontractor\u2019s undertaking and not the character of the general contractor\u2019s over-all undertaking that determines whether or not the subcontractor is within the terms of the statute. Consistency and reason negative the idea that the over-all character of the general contractor\u2019s work should be determinative of the subcontractor\u2019s status. The subcontractor might well agree with the general contractor to perform specified work and not be aware of what was the character of the general contractor\u2019s over-all undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Certainly the work performed by plaintiffs did not come within the specific things which the statute enumerated in defining contractors. What they did must come under the head of \u201cany improvement,\u201d numbered (8) above if it be covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The words \u201cimprovement\u201d or \u201cany improvement\u201d may have broad meaning when the user intends that they have a wide scope. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d ed,, defines the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cimprovement\u201d as \u201ca valuable addition, or betterment, as a building, clearing, drain, fence, etc., on land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018improvement\u2019 is a comprehensive term, which includes in its meaning any development whereunder work is done and money expended with reference to the future benefit or enrichment of the premises.\u201d <em>Eppes </em>v. <em>Eppes, Exec'x, etc., </em>181 Va. 970, 988, 27 S. E. 2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">However, the word \u201cimprovement\u201d may also have a narrow meaning if that is intended. As said in 42 C. J. S., page 416, \u201cThe word \u2018improvement\u2019 is a relative and very comprehensive term, whose meaning must be ascertained from the context and the subject matter of the instrument in which it is used.\u201d Building a house on a tract of land is malting an improvement, and is covered by the statute. Cutting weeds, hauling off rocks, spreading fertilizer, or planting an orchard would each be an improvement, but not the kind covered by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In \u00a7 54-113(2) the words \u201cconstruct\u201d and \u201cconstruction,\u201d modify and color the enumerated undertakings. They are the dominant and controlling words because all nine undertakings are susceptible of construction. All of the things listed except \u201cany improvement\u201d must be constructed, and their construction is contemplated in \u00a754-113(2). None but an \u201cimprovement\u201d can be accomplished without construction work. An improvement may or may not be susceptible of construction. Whether or not a contemplated improvement is one that will be constructed is wholly dependent upon what type of improvement is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The words \u201cany improvement\u201d as they appear in \u00a754-113(2) follow seven other specified undertakings that must be \u201cconstructed.\u201d They also immediately precede the words \u201cstructure or part thereof.\u201d This indicates that the words \u201cany improvement\u201d contemplate undertakings which are susceptible of construction as are the other listed things.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The two canons of construction <em>noscitur a sociis </em>and <em>ejusdem generis </em>indicate that the general words \u201cany improvement\u201d which follow several specifically enumerated things, all of which are modh fled by the words \u201cconstruct\u201d or \u201cconstruction\u201d were intended to include only undertakings that were to be accomplished through construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\u201cThe maxim Noscitur a sociis, is frequently discussed in connection with the maxim Ejusdem generis, and tinder these doctrines, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>there are general words following particular and specific words, the general words must be confined to matters of the same kind as those specified.\u201d <em>66 </em>C. J. S., p. 608. 28 C. J. S., p. 1049; 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 248, 249, 250, pp. 243-246; <em>Gates &amp; Son Co. </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, supra; State </em>v. <em>Western Union Telegraph Co., </em>196 Ala. 570, 72 So. 99; <em>Nettles </em>v. <em>Lichtman, </em>228 Ala. 52, 152 So. 450; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>State, </em>140 Fla. 754, 192 So. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cImprovement\u201d is not a word of art having a fixed and definite meaning. It takes color and significance from its surroundings and must be interpreted and given the meaning indicated by its setting. It will be judged by the company it keeps. 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 247, p. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The work plaintiffs did, and what they ask to be paid for was clearing the reservoir area. That was the undertaking personal to them, and it was mere manual labor, the work of cutting and removing trees and brush, and nothing more. Not even the stumps of the trees had to be taken out. No grading was contracted to be done. No dirt was contracted to be moved. No construction of any character was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Over the years much land has been cleared, and up to now it has not been considered necessary that one who does that sort of work should first take an examination and get a certificate. The language of a statute which requires one who merely clears \u201cnew grounds\u201d to take an examination and get a certificate ought to be clear, certain and specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">It seems obvious that the people this statute is intended to regulate are those who engage in <em>construction </em>work\u2014those who undertake to <em>construct </em>the enumerated things, or <em>construct </em>things of like character. People who do that kind of work will be required to take an examination to ascertain their qualifications for the performance of their undertaking, <em>i.e., </em>whether they possess the proper skill and are reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In the four cases <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, Rohanna </em>v. <em>Vazzana, </em>196 Va. 549, 84 S. E. 2d 440, <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Mayflower Corp., supra, Sutton Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wise Contracting Co., Inc., et </em>al., <em>supra, </em>in which non-compliance by the contractor with Chapter 7, Title 54, Code of 1950, was sought to be invoked as a defense to plaintiff\u2019s claim, no issue upon the kind of work done arose for in each instance the work undertaken was construction of one kind or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">When a subcontractor\u2019s agreement merely requires that he cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>down trees and remove or burn the trunks, boughs and twigs, it cannot be fairly said that by doing so he has undertaken \u201cto bid upon, or to construct, or superintendend the construction of * * <em>* </em>any improvement or structure or part thereof # * whatever may be the general contractor\u2019s undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The facts are not in dispute and unless what Sellers Brothers contracted to do constitutes a crime under the statutes, their contract is valid. Certainly a fair and reasonable application of \u00a754-113(2) to the facts of this case under the principles of construction and interpretation applicable to this statute would demand a finding that their undertaking was not within the letter or spirit of the penal provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Spratley and Smith, JJ., dissenting.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> \u201c(2) \u2018General contractor\u2019 or \u2018subcontractor\u2019 shall mean any person, firm, association or corporation that for a fixed price, commission, fee or percentage, undertakes to bid upon, <em>or accepts or offers to accept,* orders or contracts for performing or superintending-, </em>(a) <em>any work on or in any building or structure, requiring the use of paint, stone, brick, mortar, wood, cement, structural iron or steel, sheet iron, galvanized iron, metallic piping, tin, lead, or other metal or any other building material; </em>(b) <em>any paving, curbing or other work on sidewalks, streets, alleys, or highways, on public or private property, using asphalt, brick, stone, cement, concrete, wood or any composition; </em>(c) <em>the excavating of earth, rock, or other material for foundation or any other purpose; </em>(d) <em>the construction of any sewer of stone, brick, terra cotta or other material; </em>(e) <em>any work involving the erecting, installing, altering or repairing, electric wiring, devices or appliances permanently connected to such wiring; or the erecting, repairing or maintaining of lines for the transmission or distribution of electric light and power; </em>(f) <em>any work involving the installing, altering or repairing of any plumbing, steam -fitting or other piping, </em>when the <em>amount of the bid or </em>cost of the undertaking, <em>order, contract </em>or* subcontract* is twenty thousand dollars or more; and any person, firm, association or corporation who shall bid upon, <em>accept, offer to accept, </em>or engage in* <em>the doing or superintending of any work </em>above mentioned in the State, costing twenty thousand dollars or more, shall be deemed to have engaged in the business of general contracting or subcontracting-in this State.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b207-9\">Spratley, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AuP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">I would affirm the judgment of the trial court, basing affirmance upon what we said in <em>Bowen Electric Company </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>194 Va. 92, 72 S. E. 2d 388, and the line of cases applying the statute involved. In those cases we repeatedly stated the purpose and design of the legislature in enacting the statute. We recognized the hardships which may result from its enforcement; but we nevertheless applied its provisions without attempting to resort to a subtlety of reasoning and expression in the effort to find some ambiguity, which might relieve an unregistered contractor from the penalties of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">In <em>Bowen Electric Company </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, </em>we critically discussed the provisions of Chapter 7, Title 54, Code 1950, reviewed the cases involving that Act and other cognate acts, and made the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-12\">\u201cThe statute is designed to protect the public from inexperienced, unscrupulous, irresponsible, or incompetent contractors and to effectuate this purpose it requires a demonstration of ability, character, and financial responsibility as well as a good record of past performance. (194 Va. page 96)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThe legislature has stated the rule that when a contractor engages in the construction of any structure, or part thereof, and the cost of the work performed amounts to $20,000 or more, then the public interest is sufficiently involved to justify the imposition of regulations governing the licensing and registration of the contractor. <em>It is the cost of the work to be done on a given project which determines whether or not the contractor is subject to the provisions of section 54-113 et seq. The reason for the cost limitation is obvious. The legislature has concluded that projects costing less than $20,000 do not sufficiently involve the public welfare to justify the imposition of the statute, whereas those costing $20,000 or more are of sufficient importance to justify regulation. </em>However, there is nothing in the statute which is designed to work any hardship on the competent and qualified contractor.\u201d (194 Va. page 99)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">* * <em>* </em># # * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201cThe appellant was engaged in performing part of the work (furnishing and installing certain electrical equipment), which went into the construction of the outdoor theater. <em>What it did was just as much a part of the completed project as was the work performed by any other contractor. The total cost of the work performed by the appellant on this one theater project was $34,151.20. Since the cost of the work performed was in excess of $20,000, it necessarily follows that registration under the statute was required.\u201d </em>(194 Va. page 100) (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In <em>Rohanna </em>v. <em>Vazzana, </em>196 Va. 549, 84 S. E. 2d 440, Mr. Justice Whittle, citing <em>Bowen Electric Company </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\u201cThe chapter of the Code here referred to requires that any person who undertakes <em>to bid upon or to construct any building or other thing, if the undertaking is to cost twenty thousand dollars or more, secure a State license before engaging in the undertaking. </em>A failure to comply with the statute precludes a recovery by the contractor on his contract.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Mayflower Corp., </em>196 Va. 1153, 86 S. E. 2d 860, where the innocent party sued the contractor for the alleged breach of the latter\u2019s contract, we said: \u201cThe statute applies \u2018when the cost of the undertaking * <em>* * </em>is twenty thousand dollars or more.\u2019 \u201d (196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Va. page 1159), and later added: \u201cThere is nothing immoral or contrary to public policy in a construction contract involving $20,000 or more. Neither does the statute (Code, \u00a7 54-113 if.), either expressly or impliedly, forbid such a contract. It merely prohibits unqualified persons\u2014that is, those who have not registered or taken out the required license\u2014from entering into such an agreement.\u201d (196 Va. page 1160, 1161)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The above statement, made under the facts there involved, affords no support to the contention of the plaintiffs here, because the subcontractors here are the unqualified persons and the defendants the innocent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The statement overlooks sections 54-128 and 54-142, which do more than \u201cmerely prohibit\u201d unqualified persons from entering into contracts in violation of the statute. Section 54-128 provides that \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to engage in, or offer to engage in, general contracting or subcontracting in this State, unless he has been licensed and issued a certificate of registration under the provisions of this Chapter.\u201d Section 54-142 further provides that anyone guilty of violating the statute shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In <em>Sutton Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wise Contracting Co., Inc., et al., </em>197 Va. 705, 90 S. E. 2d 805, referring to the purpose of the statute, Mr. Justice Smith said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201c* * <em>* </em>enforcement of the contract is denied the unregistered contractor, not because of the nature of the transaction but as a penalty for failing to comply with the registration statutes, and the other party to the contract who is innocent of any illegal conduct is permitted to enforce the contract. \u2018This view is based upon the principle that such innocent party is among the class of persons designed to be protected by such statutes, that he is not <em>in pari delicto </em>with the unlicensed party, and is therefore entitled to relief. Or, to state the matter another way, to deny relief to the innocent party in such cases would defeat the purpose of the statute and penalize the person intended to be protected thereby.\u2019 <em>Cohen </em>case, <em>supra, </em>196 Va., at page 1162.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">In <em>Lasting Products Company </em>v. <em>Genovese, </em>197 Va. 1, 87 S. E. 2d 811, Chief Justice Hudgins, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201cThe general rule is that a contract made in violation of a statute enacted to protect the public against fraud, imposition, or to safeguard the public health or morals is illegal and unenforceable by the guilty party.\u201d Cases cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>When we review the history of \u00a7 54-113, we find that the original statute, Acts 1938, Chapter 431, page 969, was amended in 1944, Acts 1944, Chapter 404, page 634, and made to apply to subcontractors as well as general contractors. The definition of subcontractors and general contractors, with respect to their undertakings, was broadened by adding the words <em>\u201cor part thereof </em>after the language <em>\u201cany </em>improvement, or structure\u201d and after the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>structure or <em>any undertaking </em>or improvements.\u201d It will be noted that the words <em>\u201cor any </em>improvement\u201d are used instead of <em>\u201cor other </em>improvement,\u201d and that the definition applies when the cost of <em>\u201cany structure </em>or <em>any undertaking </em>or <em>improvement or part thereof </em>is $20,000 or more. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Subsequent to the decisions of this Court applying the provisions of the statute, the legislature by Acts 1954, Chapter 428, page 523, amended and reenacted the Act and restricted the definition of general contractors or subcontractors to undertakings in certain specified activities. The amendment deals with special classes of undertakings, and particularizes in each class. The words \u201crailway,\u201d and \u201cgrading\u201d and the language \u201cor any improvement, or structure, or part thereof\u201d and \u201cany structure, or any undertaking, or improvement, or part thereof\u201d are absent in the revision. If the 1954 amendment indicated any particular intention of the legislature, it was obviously the intention to amend and restrict the coverage and effect of the statute prior thereto as it had been construed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The policy of the legislation is not questioned, and the language of \u00a754-113(2) is, to me, clear and unambiguous, especially so when read in the light of the design and purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Section 54-113(2) defines a general contractor or subcontractor as any person who undertakes to engage in certain stated activities when <em>\u201cthe cost of the undertaking or a subcontract thereunder is twenty thousand dollars or more, </em>and as any person who engages in the construction of <em>any structure </em>or <em>any undertaking </em>or <em>improvements </em>or <em>part thereof </em>above mentioned # * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Here, Bles, as general contractor, was awarded a contract for three projects, each of which was an essential and integral part of a Federal Works Agency Project for the \u201cconstruction\u201d of a \u201cstructure,\u201d \u201can undertaking or improvement\u201d constituting \u201cWater Works Improvements for City of Martinsville.\u201d His contract was identified on the outside of its front page as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cCONTRACT for PROJECTS NOS. 2,4 &amp; 5 and SPECIFICATIONS for WATER WORKS IMPROVEMENTS for CITY OF MARTINSVILLE Martinsville, Va.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">Project No. 2\u2014Pipe Lines</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">Project No. 4\u2014Clearing Reservoir Area</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-13\">Project No. 5\u2014Earth Fill Dam</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-14\">Accompanying Drawings Sheets Nos.

Under those specifications, a safe and sanitary reservoir area, cleared of trees, undergrowth and perishable material, was as essential and necessary in the completed water works improvement project, as the furnishing and installing of electrical fixtures in an outdoor theater, or as an excavation may be for certain buildings. Cf. <em>Bowen Electric Company </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, </em>and <em>Sutton Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Wise Contracting Co., Inc., et al., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-17\">The facts are correctly stated in the beginning of the majority opinion. However, it is later stated that the undertaking of the plaintiffs was \u201cpersonal to them, and it was mere manual labor, the work of cutting and removing trees and brush and nothing more. * * * No construction of any character was involved.\u201d This statement and conclusion leave out of consideration plaintiffs\u2019 subcontract to perform work which was a constituent <em>part of the general con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>tractor\u2019s undertaking to construct </em>a reservoir in accordance with certain specifications and strict requirements as to sanitary protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In support of their opinion, the majority say: First, that \u201cIt is the character of a subcontractor\u2019s undertaking and not the character of the general contractor\u2019s over-all undertaking that determines whether or not the subcontractor is within the terms of the statute.\u201d Second, that the \u201cwork performed by plaintiffs did not come within the specific things which the statute enumerated in defining contractors.\u201d Third, that \u201cUnless what Sellers Brothers contracted to do constitutes a crime under the statute, their contract is valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The first ground asserted is in direct contradiction of the language of \u00a7 54-113(2), and of our holding in the <em>Bowen </em>case. \u00a7 54-113(2) provides exactly the same definition for general contractors and subcontractors in the enumerated activities, \u201cwhen the cost of the undertaking or a subcontract thereunder is twenty thousand dollars or more.\u201d \u201cIt is the cost of the work to be done on a given project which determines whether or not the contractor is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 54-113, et seq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In support of the assertion, that plaintiffs\u2019 work did not come within the specific things which the statute enumerated, the majority opinion enters into a dialectic discussion of certain words in the statute, and concluded that those words have no definite or fixed meaning. Thus resort is had to the canons of <em>noscitur a sociis </em>and <em>ejusdem generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Assuming, for the purpose of the argument, that there is some ambiguity in the statute and agreeing that the Act has remedial features, yet imposes restrictions in derogation of the common law, and is, at the same time also penal, and must, therefore, be strictly construed, it must be remembered that a strict construction does not prevent consideration by the Court of the general purpose and design of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">\u201cThe object of interpretation of statutes is to ascertain the meaning of the legislature. Primarily this is to be obtained from the language used. If the language used is plain and unambiguous, and its meaning clear and definite, effect must be given to it regardless of what courts think of its wisdom or policy.\u201d <em>Fairbanks, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Cape Charles, </em>144 Va. 56, 63, 131 S. E. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">\u201cThe object of judicial interpretation of a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature, express and implied, as the intent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the vital part of the statute.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State Entomologist, </em>146 Va. 175, 188, 135 S. E. 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Werth, </em>116 Va. 604, 607, 82 S. E. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In <em>Tiller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 418, 420, 69 S. E. 2d 441, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cIn construing a statute the cardinal rule of construction is that the intention of the legislature constitutes the law, and the primary object in the interpretation of a statute is to ascertain that intention. <em>Anglin </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>181 Va. 660, 26 S. E. 2d 58.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201cIn construing penal statutes, the legislative intent is in most cases, to be found by giving to the words the meaning in which they are used in ordinary speech.\u201d <em>Gates &amp; Son Co., </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>103 Va. 702, 49 S. E. 965. <em>Tiller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">We do not have to justify the policy of the legislature. It is the judicial function to search for and follow the direct legislative intent and adopt that sense of the words used which will attain the results intended by the legislature, being mindful not to enlarge by implication the obvious effect of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is not one \u201cof universal application and it is not controlling in all instances. It is only a rule of construction, to be applied as an aid in ascertaining the legislative intent, or an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty; # * However, \u201cit is inapplicable where the legislative intent is clearly expressed.\u201d 82 C. J. S., Statutes, \u00a7 332 b, pages 662, 663. The rule does not apply where general words follow specific words which exhaust or embrace all objects of their class, nor where the specific words signify subjects greatly different from one another, or of a different class. 50 Am. Jur., Statutes, \u00a7 250, pages 247, 248; and 82 C. J. S., Statutes, \u00a7 332 b, page 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">The lexicographers define \u201cstructure\u201d as something built or constructed; a building, bridge, dam, framework. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 2d Ed., page 2501.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">The adjective \u201cany\u201d means one or many, an undetermined, unmeasured or unlimited quantity, indicating lack of restriction or limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Had the legislature intended the statute to apply only to those engaged in the particular activities named, there was no need to add the words \u201cor any improvement, or structure,\u201d and \u201cany undertaking.\u201d It should be presumed that effect was intended to be given each of those words. <em>Rockingham Bureau </em>v. <em>Harrisonburg, </em>171 Va. 339, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>344, 198 S. E. 908. It is only by treating them as surplusage and meaningless, and by disregarding their connection with the context of the statute and the object of the legislation that the conclusion of the majority can be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The particular undertakings listed in \u00a7 54-113(2), Code, 1950, exhaust the class of each specific undertaking. The undertakings in most instances are essentially diverse in character. A \u201cbuilding\u201d differs from a \u201chighway,\u201d a \u201cbridge\u201d from a \u201csewer\u201d or \u201cpipe line,\u201d and a \u201crailway\u201d from \u201cgrading.\u201d Therefore, the general words which follow the enumerated undertakings must be given a meaning outside of the class indicated by the latter; otherwise, the general words would be mere surplusage and void of meaning. When this occurs, the rule does not apply and the general expression must receive its natural and wide meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u201cThe rule of construction limiting the scope or meaning of general words, such as \u2018other\u2019 and \u2018otherwise\u2019 used in connection with definite and specific enumerations, to things of the class or family of those named, has no application when the context manifests intention to give them a more extensive meaning and effect. Also, since it is really a rule of strict construction its severity should be relaxed in the case of statutes of a remedial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u201cIt should also be noted that if the preceding term is general, as well as that which follows, the rule can have no application. Nor does it apply where the specific words signify subjects greatly different from one another, for here the general expression might very consistently add one more variety. In such case, the general term must receive its natural and wide meaning # # 17 Michie\u2019s Jur., Statutes, Section 62, page 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">To the same effect see 17 Va. Law Review, pages 511, 514, 515; <em>Corby Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 10, 13, 96 S. E. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The work called for under plaintiff\u2019s subcontract in itself constituted not only a betterment, a more desirable condition, and thus an improvement, made with reference to the future benefit of the reservoir; but was a part of the undertaking of the general contractor, that is, the construction of a reservoir, a structure under any meaning of the word. The dam was useless for the purpose desired without a clearing for the sanitary reservoir area. What plaintiffs \u201cdid was just as 'much a part of the completed project as was the work performed by any other contractor.\u201d <em>Bowen Electric Company </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>194 Va. page 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Finally, Mr. Justice Miller, in a mild form of sophistic reasoning, makes the assertion that \u201cunless what Sellers Brothers contracted to do constitutes a crime under the statute, their contract is valid.\u201d The answer to this is, the validity of the contract is not in question. As Mr. Justice Eggleston said in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Mayflower Corp., supra, </em>196 Va. 1160, there is nothing wrong or immoral in the contract. The statute does not expressly or impliedly forbid such a contract, it merely prohibits unqualified persons from entering into such an agreement and thereby denies enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Nor is there any issue here as to whether Sellers Brothers committed a crime under the statute. There is no provision that the enforcement of such a contract depends upon the guilt or innocence of the contractor. Guilt or innocence of a crime must be determined in a different forum under rules of evidence and procedure different from those in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The issue here, and the sole issue, is clearly stated in the forepart of the majority\u2019s opinion. It is, \u201cWhat effect, if any, did the failure of plaintiffs, trading as Sellers Brothers, to register and qualify as a subcontractor under Chapter 7, Title 54, Code of 1950, have on their right to maintain this section?\u201d Therefore, the test as to the right of Sellers Brothers to enforce their contract is dependent upon whether they were duly licensed and registered under the statute, not whether their contract is valid or invalid, nor whether they were guilrv of a crime in entering into the contract. The criminal penalty merely emphasizes the illegality of their action in making the contract. <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>173 Va. 42, 51, 3 S. E. 2d 176; <em>Bowen Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, supra, </em>194 Va. 92. The statute applies to the innocent and the guiltv, to the competent and incompetent, to the responsible and to the irresponsible, in the furtherance of the public welfare. [Whether or not there have been any criminal prosecutions under the statute in the cases which have been cited herein we have not been advised. ]</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Not having been licensed and registered as required by the statute, plaintiffs\u2019 contract was unlawful and therefore unenforceable by them. It also made them subject to prosecution for a conviction of a misdemeanor; but whether or not they were prosecuted, or, if prosecuted, were found guilty or not guilty, we are not told. It was the commission of the unlawful act and not a conviction of the unregistered subcontractors for the misdemeanor which made their contract unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The majority opinion cites four cases in which noncompliance by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the contractor was sought to be invoked as the defense to plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and say no issue upon the kind of work done arose, for in each instance the work undertaken was construction of one kind or another. That can be true only if excavating dirt for a foundation, as in the <em>Sutton </em>case, <em>supra, </em>can be considered as different from removing trees, shrubbery, undergrowth and perishable material from an area to provide a sanitary basin for a reservoir. None of the plaintiffs in those cases, nor the plaintiffs in this case, in view of our former decisions, had the temerity to assert that the over-all character of the general contractors\u2019 work bore no relation to the status of the subcontractor, nor that it must first be determined that an unqualified contractor is guilty of having committed a misdemeanor under the statutes before an innocent person can rely upon its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">1 am unable to accept or comprehend the position of the majority that plaintiffs did not contract for and did not engage in the construction of the reservoir, a part of the waterworks improvement project for Martinsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Paraphrasing a statement of the majority: When a subcontractor\u2019s undertaking requires that he cut down trees and remove or bum the trunks, boughs, and twigs to prepare a reservoir area under a subcontract from one who has agreed to construct a reservoir, surely the subcontractor has undertaken to perform a part of the construction of the completed project.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Giving Code, \u00a7 54-113(2) a fair and reasonable construction, in the light of the manifest intention of the legislature, the object to be attained from the natural import of the words in common and accepted usage, the setting in which they are employed, and the general structure of Chapter 7, Title 54, as a whole, and the decisions of this Court, it is inescapable that plaintiffs\u2019 contract.was illegal and, therefore, unenforceable by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">It may well be that the enactment of the 1954 amendment will forthwith remove the necessity for any new or different construction of the statute as it stood prior thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Smith, J., concurs in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
