From an adverse judgment in each case the dairy company has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The two cases have the same factual background. The dairy company is a District of Columbia corporation with its plant located in the District where it processes and assembles its products, loads them on trucks, transports them from the plant into the City of Alexandria, and there sells and delivers them to its customers. These products consist of milk, butter, cream, eggs, chocolate mix, eggnog mix (in certain seasons), fruit juices, cottage cheese and margarine. Some of these products are sold and delivered to customers whose orders have been previously taken. Others are sold directly by the drivers to any who may wish to purchase them.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">For the privilege of selling certain of these commodities in the City, the Commissioner of Revenue has assessed each of the dairy company\u2019s trucks so used with a State peddler\u2019s license tax under Code, \u00a7 58-340, and a city peddler\u2019s license tax under section 17-64 of the city code, for the years stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">The dairy company has no plant or place of business in Virginia and pays no taxes either to the State or the City other than the peddler\u2019s license taxes here in question. Resident dairies, and nonresident dairies \u201cdoing business in the State,\u201d are taxable on the capital employed in business in this State (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 58-416, 58-414) and are exempt from the payment of State and local peddler\u2019s license taxes. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 58-340, 58-346 as amended, 58-344, 58-354 as amended, 58-266.2 as amended. See also, <em>Thompson\u2019s Dairy </em>v. <em>County Board of Arlington, </em>197 Va. 623, 627, 90 S. E. 2d 810, 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">The dairy company challenges the validity of the peddler\u2019s license taxes assessed against it on these grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>First, it says, Code, \u00a7 58-340, provides that \u201ca dairyman who uses upon the streets of any city one or more wagons may sell and deliver from his wagons milk, butter, cream and eggs in such city without procuring a peddler\u2019s license.\u201d Moreover, it says, Code, \u00a7 58-344, prohibits the imposition of a municipal peddler\u2019s license tax \u201cupon those exempted from a State license by this article.\u201d The effect of these provisions, the dairy company argues, exempts it from the peddler\u2019s license taxes here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The answer to this contention is that the undisputed evidence shows that the dairy company\u2019s drivers sell and deliver from its wagons or trucks in the City of Alexandria other commodities than \u201cmilk, butter, cream and eggs,\u201d the sale of which is exempt from the imposition of the peddler\u2019s license tax under section 58-340. Both the State and city peddler\u2019s license taxes here imposed are for the privilege of selling in the City of Alexandria other commodities than those mentioned in the statute. Code, \u00a7 58-344, authorizes a municipality to impose a peddler\u2019s license tax except upon those exempted from a State peddler\u2019s license tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Next, the dairy company says that the imposition of the license taxes here under consideration is invalid because (1) it constitutes a tax on its operations in interstate commerce, forbidden by the Federal Constitution, and (2) discriminates against its business in interstate commerce and denies to it the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, in that \u201cresident dairies were not assessed with (such) taxes, whereas the plaintiff, a nonresident dairy, was assessed with the tax(es) complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFe\">This same contention was made by the same appellant under a similar state of facts and fully answered in <em>Thompson\u2019s Dairy </em>v. <em>County Board of </em>Arlington, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">For these reasons the judgment in each case is</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
