The court denied claimant\u2019s request for an award of benefits by the State Compensation Insurance Fund because it determined that the claimant failed to notify his employer, Ownerrent Rent to Own, of an alleged work-related accident as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The claimant presents the following issue for review: Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in determining that claimant failed to notify his employer of an alleged work-related accident as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Claimant and T. C. Collins were both hired by Ownerrent as drivers/deliverers during December 1992. On January 6,1993, claimant and Collins were in the process of repossessing one of Ownerrent\u2019s washing machines. As they loaded the machine into the delivery van, claimant alleges that he fell and that the machine landed on top of him. Collins stated that claimant \u201cslipped and the washer, the dolly came back down on top of him.\u201d The next day claimant called his manager at Ownerrent, David Robinson, and informed Robinson that claimant would be taking sick leave because \u201c[he] was hurting where [he] could not get off the couch ....\u201d Both parties agree that claimant did not notify Robinson of a work-related accident at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">After two days\u2019 sick leave claimant resumed his work at Owner-rent. On January 15, 1993, he was terminated from employment for reasons not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>According to medical records, claimant visited Dr. Allen Weinert regarding back pain on January 27, 1993. On February 8 and 12, 1993, claimant visited Dr. Brooke Hunter. On February 8 Dr. Hunter ordered an MRI examination. On February 12, Dr. Hunter gave the claimant the results of the MRI which showed claimant had a herniated disc on the right side of his spine. Claimant testified that he subsequently had reconstructive disc surgery in March 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">On February 25,1993, claimant filed a claim for benefits alleging that his back injury was a result of the work-related accident mentioned above. The State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) denied the claim because claimant failed to comply with the notification requirements set forth in \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that the claim for benefits was barred because of claimant\u2019s failure to notify his employer of a work-related accident within thirty days of the January 6,1993 accident. From the transcripts of proceedings before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, the record discloses the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">JUDGE MCCARTER: Mr. Bogle, I do have a couple of questions. As I understand your testimony, and I want to make sure that I am understanding you correctly, when you called Mr. Robinson the day after the injury, you didn\u2019t tell him about the accident. You just told him that you were hurting and couldn\u2019t come in to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acp\">THE WITNESS: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">JUDGE MCCARTER: If I understand you further, the first time you specifically told him about the accident was after you had the MRI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">THE WITNESS: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">JUDGE MCCARTER: So your conversations with him prior to that had been about your hurting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">THE WITNESS: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">At trial, claimant further testified that he believed Collins to be a supervisor for Ownerrent, and that Collins\u2019 actual knowledge of the accident satisfied the notice requirements of \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA. The court, however, determined that claimant\u2019s testimony that he believed Collins to be his supervisor was not credible or reasonable. After analyzing the inapplicability of ostensible authority in this case, the court entered judgment for the State Fund. Claimant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in determining that claimant failed to notify his employer of an alleged work-related accident as required by \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In reviewing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact, we will not substitute our judgment for the trier of fact unless the findings are clearly erroneous, and the court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine if the conclusions are correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 803 P.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Claimant argues that the object and purpose of \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA, have been met. In support of his argument, he asserts that substantial, credible evidence supports his belief that Collins was his supervisor; that because of the nature of his injury he was prohibited from notifying his employer of the work-related injury within thirty days of the accident; and that the court erred in finding that Robinson was not aware of claimant\u2019s work-related accident within thirty days of the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">To obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the State Fund, an employee who is injured on the job or involved in a work-related accident must, within thirty days, notify the employer of the time and place where the accident occurred and the nature of the injury. Section 39-71-603, MCA. Actual knowledge of the accident and injury by the employer, manager or superintendent of the employer is also notice under \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Claimant argues that the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should be reversed based upon our decision in <em>Killebrew v. Larson Cattle Company </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 513, 839 P.2d 1260. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In <em>Killebrew </em>the claimant suffered an industrial accident on December 17, 1989, and within two days personally told his employer that he had hurt his shoulder in the accident. On March 17, 1990, claimant suffered another industrial accident and on the next day claimant told his employer of the accident and showed him physical injuries to his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Clearly in <em>Killebrew </em>the employer had actual knowledge of the accident and injuries, thereby satisfying the requirement of notice under \u00a7 39-71-603, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The facts in <em>Killebrew </em>are not comparable to those in this case. No knowledge of the claimed industrial accident was made available by claimant to the employer, the employer\u2019s managing agent or superintendent within thirty days of the claimed injury as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">In this case claimant failed to timely notify the employer or its manager, David Robinson, of the accident which is alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>caused the back injury. See <em>Lee v. Lee </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 197, 761 P.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Further, claimant\u2019s contention that he believed Collins occupied a supervisory position at Ownerrent is equally insufficient to give his employer actual notice in this case. Claimant and Collins were hired the same day and held identical positions at Ownerrent. When asked about whether he held himself out as the claimant\u2019s supervisor, Collins stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[W]hat I said was that when I had my interview there the manager that gave me my interview had said that he was looking for somebody to be \u2014 that he could appoint to warehouse manager. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">It\u2019s possible that I could have said it in a way that he thought I was the warehouse manager, yes, but when we were talking about it I said in my interview that David [Robinson] said he was looking for somebody \u2014 He had told me he was looking for somebody to appoint to warehouse manager, somebody he didn\u2019t have to watch all the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Claimant contended that his belief in Collins\u2019 supervisory authority was reasonable because Collins \u201calways jump[ed] in the driver\u2019s seat and [did] the paper work and what have you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In rejecting the claimant\u2019s argument that Collins was an ostensible supervisory agent, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">Whether ostensible authority existed must be determined from all facts and circumstances surrounding the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201cThe test is found in a determination of the exact extent to which the principal held the agent out or permitted him to hold himself out as authorized, and what a prudent person, acting in good faith, under the circumstances would reasonably believe the authority to be.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\"><em>Butler Mfg. Co. v. J &amp; L Imp. Co., </em>167 Mont. 519, 527, 540 P.2d 962 (1975). The belief that another is an agent must be reasonable. <em>Kraus v. Treasure Belt Mining Co., </em>146 Mont. 432, 435-6, 408 P.2d 151 (1965). The circumstances in this case are inconsistent with the creation of an ostensible agency. Robinson, not Collins, assigned deliveries, determined work schedules, and signed off on time sheets. Collins performed no supervisory functions. Collins\u2019 \u201cjumping\u201d into the driver\u2019s seat when he made deliveries does not amount to supervision or provide a basis for petitioner to reasonably believe that Collins was his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>After reviewing the record, we conclude the court\u2019s decision that, under the facts in the record, the employer did not have notice within thirty days of the alleged work-related injury is not clearly erroneous. We affirm the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-4\">JUSTICES HARRISON, GRAY, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
