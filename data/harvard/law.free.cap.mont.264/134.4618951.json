We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that medical opinion evidence was required to meet claimant\u2019s burden that it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that an accident occurred at work and that it caused the claimant\u2019s condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-19\">Rebecca Prillaman (claimant) is a nurse at Community Medical Center in the outpatient surgery department. She suffered two lumbar vertebrae fractures and contends that the injuries occurred while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>at work on March 4,1992, following her attempt to lift a patient. The patient was in recovery from surgery but was not responding as expected. In an attempt to help the patient come out of anesthesia more quickly, claimant lifted patient from a prone position to a sitting position without assistance from the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Claimant testified that she felt the pain in her back immediately but that she was determined to finish her shift because there was no other nurse on duty. She was in great pain throughout the evening and remained in pain throughout the night. Because she was the only nurse scheduled for the next day\u2019s 2:00 p.m. shift, claimant went to work, but she testified that within an hour she was forced to call her supervisor because the pain was unbearable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Claimant went to the medical center emergency room for back x-rays which revealed compression fractures in two vertebrae. She first sought medical help from Dr. Lennard Wilson, a neurologist. Dr. Wilson determined that this type of fracture was \u201cextremely remarkable for this type of activity\u201d and referred her to an orthopedic surgeon. Claimant then went to see Dr. James Burton, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Burton stated that, although her back injury was unusual given the activity that spawned it, he had no reason to doubt that her injury was caused by the incident of March 4, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that medical opinion evidence was required to meet claimant\u2019s burden that it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that an accident occurred at work and that it caused the claimant\u2019s condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This case involves the determination of when liability attaches to the insurer for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation. We are concerned with the statutory interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-407(2), MCA, and the interplay between this statute and \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, to which subsection (a) refers and to the interplay between subsection (a) and (b) of \u00a7 39-71-407 (2), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">(2)(a) An insurer is liable for an injury as defined in 39-71-119, [MCA] if the claimant establishes it is <em>more probable than not </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">(i) a claimed injury occurred; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">(ii) a claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">(b) Proof that it was <em>medically possible </em>that a claimed injury occurred or that such claimed injury aggravated a preexisting condition is not sufficient to establish liability. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdM\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court interpreted this statute to mean that the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d burden of proof required of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>claimant must be based on <em>\u201cmedical </em>opinion.\u201d Our review of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s legal interpretation is plenary. <em>See St. John\u2019s Lutheran Church v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 516, 830 P.2d 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">Subsection (a) of the above mentioned statute specifically attaches the burden of proof \u201cmore probable than not\u201d to \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">Injury and accident defined. (2) An injury is <em>caused </em>by an accident. An accident is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">(a) an unexpected traumatic incident or unusual strain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">(b) identifiable by time and place of occurrence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">(c) identifiable by member or part of the body affected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">and (d) caused by a specific event on a single day or during a <em>single work shift. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">We have interpreted the current version of \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, in <em>Welch v. American Mine Services, Inc. </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 76, 831 P.2d 580:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">A compensable injury must meet all three definitional requirements contained in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA (1987): there must be an \u201cinjury\u201d and an \u201caccident,\u201d and the injury must be \u201ccaused by\u201d the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\"><em>Welch, </em>253 Mont. at 81, 831 P.2d at 584. Therefore, by reference, \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA, dictates that \u201caccident,\u201d \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201ccausation\u201d must be proven by the claimant with the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Respondents argue that because the word \u201cmedical\u201d is used in subsection (b), of \u00a7 39-71-407(2), MCA, that claimant must establish this burden by \u201cmedical opinion evidence.\u201d Claimant contends that subsection (a) of \u00a7 39-71-407(2), MCA, does not contain the word \u201cmedical\u201d when defining her burden of proof. Therefore, claimant contends that, although she must prove that her injury occurred at work, and that it caused her current condition, she does not have to prove this through medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">A plain reading of subsection (a) shows that claimant is not required to prove occurrence pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407(2) and by referenc\u00e9, causation as called for by \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, by use of \u201cmedical opinion evidence.\u201d Although our function as a reviewing court is to ascertain what the legislature meant by writing a statute a particular way, we are bound by law to ascertain that meaning if possible from the words in the statute. <em>Gaub v. Milbank Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>(1986), 220 Mont. 424, 715 P.2d 443. Subsection (a) does not contain the words \u201cmedical opinion evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Subsection (a) is separate from subsection (b) because the legislature used a period to separate the two subsections; thus, we have two separate thoughts. <em>See, </em>N. Singer, 2A <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>(5th ed.) \u00a7 47.01, p. 136 (1992); <em>see also Regents of the University of Michigan v. Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid </em>(Mich. 1980), 296 N.W.2d 94, 98. This brings us to the observation that unless the context of subsection (a) specifically refers to it, subsection (b)\u2019s reference to \u201cmedically possible\u201d proof cannot be inserted into subsection (a). Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the present case, six individual witnesses testified. These witnesses included claimant, the claimant\u2019s roommate (also a nurse), the claimant\u2019s chiropractor, claimant\u2019s co-workers, and claimant\u2019s supervisor. These six witnesses testified as to claimant\u2019s pain and other factors which were significant in determining if the accident occurred at work and whether it had any connection or nexus to the claimant\u2019s present injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Here, where no eyewitness exists to the accident, testimony such as that of claimant\u2019s chiropractor, James Scott Garr, becomes important as to whether the alleged accident caused the injury of which claimant complains. Dr. Garr saw claimant in Missoula and stated before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that, given Rebecca\u2019s abnormal formation of certain vertebrae and her osteoporosis, attempting to lift the dead weight of a patient could very easily have caused the damage (injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The court also ignored the testimony of other witnesses who gave \u201cbefore and after\u201d the occurrence testimony. Claimant\u2019s house-mate, Jane Dubbe, testified that claimant had not shown any signs of abnormal back pain before she went to work on the day of the accident, March 4, or as late as 4:30 p.m. that same day when Dubbe left her shift as RN at the same medical center. Dubbe also stated that when claimant came home at about midnight on March 4, she told Dubbe about the incident in which she attempted to lift the woman and that she had been in severe pain since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Claimant\u2019s immediate supervisor, Carol Matthews, also testified that when claimant arrived at work the day after, on March 5, she told her supervisor what had happened and that she was in great pain. Matthews sent claimant to the emergency room where x-rays revealed that she had two compression fractures. Matthews also testified that claimant was an excellent employee. Another fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>employee, Patrice Moffitt, testified that claimant was fine late in the afternoon of March 4th, but that the next day when she saw her she complained of severe back pain. Moffitt also saw claimant after her visit to the emergency room on March 5. Moffitt testified that claimant said that she was going home because she was in so much pain. Moffitt also characterizes claimant as an honest person.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">The two treating physicians testified by way of deposition. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court considered only the doctor\u2019s testimony which revolved around whether such an occurrence could have possibly caused claimant\u2019s permanent back injury. It is clear from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court opinion that it intertwined the ideas of \u201coccurrence\u201d and \u201ccausation.\u201d Yet, as we stated in a similar case, <em>Plainbull v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>[264 Mont. 120] 870 P.2d 76 (1994) 51 St.Rep. 0181: \u201cwhile the <em>occurrence </em>of the injury may be susceptible of proof without medical evidence, the <em>causation of </em>the claimant\u2019s condition may very well require medical evidence if the claimant is to meet his burden of proof, especially in the face of contrary medical evidence presented by the carrier.\u201d The facts of each case must dictate the degree to which medical evidence is needed, if at all. Here, where both facts surrounding the \u201coccurrence\u201d and conflicting views as to medical opinion of \u201ccausation\u201d are at issue, it is essential that all testimony, including the medical, be considered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Yet neither \u201coccurrence\u201d of an accident nor the connection between the accident and the injury (cause) statutorily require medical opinion evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">On remand, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court must consider and weigh all testimony, whether \u201cmedical opinion evidence\u201d or not. We do not mean to say that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court should cast aside the depositions of the doctors, but the wording of the applicable statutes make it clear that such evidence, while potentially valuable, is not the only source from which claimant can prove that an accident caused her injury. We conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Despite admirable efforts by claimant\u2019s counsel, neither Drs. Wilson nor Burton would waiver from their positions that while claimant\u2019s fractures might possibly have <em>occurred </em>as she described, they could not say it was more probable than not that the injury <em>occurred </em>in that fashion. ... Claimant has failed to sustain her burden of proof that it is more probable than not that her compression fractures in her lower back <em>were caused </em>by and arose from her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>employment..... \u201cMore probable than not\u201d is a burden of proof requiring a <em>medical </em>opinion. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because of its conclusion, the court considered only the doctors\u2019 medical opinions as to occurrence and \u201ccause.\u201d We finally conclude that the requirement of \u00a7 39-71-407(2)(a), MCA, that the claimant establish that it is \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that a claimed injury occurred at work and that it caused the current condition do not require \u201cmedical opinion evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that \u201cmedical opinion evidence\u201d was required to meet claimant\u2019s burden that it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that an accident occurred at work and that it caused the claimant\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, HUNT, GRAY, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
