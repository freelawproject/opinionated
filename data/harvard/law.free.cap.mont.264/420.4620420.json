Eklund moved to dismiss the charge due to lack of a speedy trial, and moved for a mistrial contending that the court allowed the State to introduce inadmissible character evidence at trial. The District Court denied both motions. Eklund appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">1. Was Eklund denied a speedy trial since 197 days elapsed between his arrest and his trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>2. Did the District Court err in allowing character evidence to be introduced during cross-examination of Eklund\u2019s character witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In June 1992, a neighbor of Eklund\u2019s estranged wife reported to the Department of Family Services that Eklund\u2019s 13-year-old stepdaughter, J.L., had told her that Eklund had molested her. J.L. stated that the alleged offenses occurred in early April 1992, when she and Eklund\u2019s natural children, six-year-old B.E. and five-year-old A.E., stayed two weekends at Eklund\u2019s house. She and Eklund had slept on separate couches in the living room where the television was, while the other two children slept in another room. She alleged that before he sexually molested her he ordered her to take her clothes off, and that she complied because she was afraid he would hit her. Eklund denied that the acts took place or that J.L. slept in the living room with him during the visits. He stated that his house guest and renter, who were staying with him during the time of the alleged occurrences, would confirm his version.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">On June 24, 1992, prior to his arrest for the present charges, Eklund was arrested and incarcerated on contempt charges for failing meet a release condition resulting from a conviction for driving under the influence. Therefore, on July 7, 1992, when Eklund was arrested for charges of sexual intercourse without consent, he was already incarcerated. On September 2, 1992, Eklund was arraigned and pled not guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On October 29,1992, the court denied Eklund\u2019s motion to dismiss for delay of his arraignment until September 2, 1992. Also, on January 13,1993, the court denied his motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial after finding that he was not prejudiced by the delay. Ajury trial was held on January 19 and 20, 1993. During trial, Eklund called Dave Svinth as a character witness. Svinth testified about Eklund\u2019s good relationship with his children and his nonviolent behavior toward them. In rebuttal to Svinth\u2019s testimony, during cross-examination the State questioned him concerning Eklund\u2019s numerous driving under the influence offenses, prior incarceration, alcohol abuse, and murder charges in 1974. The court denied Eklund\u2019s objections to the evidence as inadmissible character evidence. On January 20,1993, Eklund moved for a mistrial, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The jury found Eklund guilty of sexual intercourse without consent. The court classified Eklund as a dangerous offender and sentenced him to 40 years at the Montana State Prison. Eklund appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\n<em>ISSUE 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Was Eklund denied a speedy trial since 197 days elapsed between his arrest and his trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Eklund was arrested on July 7, 1992, and was incarcerated at all times prior to his trial beginning on January 19, 1993, resulting in a delay of 197 days. Eklund argues that the delay violates his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated is determined by a four-part test set out in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed. 2d 101, 117. The four-part test was adopted by this Court in <em>State ex rel. Briceno v. District Court </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 516, 518, 568 P.2d 162, 163-64. A sensitive balancing of the following four factors determines whether a defendant was denied a speedy trial: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the assertion of the right by the defendant; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1993), [263 Mont. 17], 865 P.2d 1125, 1135. All four factors are weighed by considering the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The first factor of the <em>Barker </em>test, length of delay, triggers further inquiry into the other three factors; it is not necessary to consider the other factors unless the length of the delay is presumptively prejudicial. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1134. When considering the length of delay, no regard is given to which party caused the delay. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135. A delay of over 200 days will usually trigger further analysis. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135. In <em>State v. Bartnes </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 522, 764 P.2d 1271, this Court completed a full analysis where there was a delay of 175 days. Here, 197 days is presumptively prejudicial to Eklund, given the close proximity to the 200-day trigger. The State has the burden to provide reasonable explanation for the delay and to show that Eklund was not prejudiced by the delay. <em>State v. Curtis </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 288, 299, 787 P.2d 306, 314. In analyzing the three remaining factors, no particular factor is determinative. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The second factor of the <em>Barker </em>test, reason for the delay, is analyzed by first allocating delay to the responsible party. <em>Thompson, 865 </em>P.2d at 1135. Here, the State and Eklund agree that the reason for the delay was institutional due to the clogged court system. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>delay is chargeable to the State, however, institutional delay \u201cweighs less heavily against the State than does purposeful delay.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Both parties agree that the third factor of the <em>Barker </em>test, the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to a speedy trial, has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The fourth factor of the <em>Barker </em>test, prejudice to the defendant, is analyzed by considering its three parts: (1) pretrial incarceration; (2) anxiety and concern; and (3) impairment of defense, the most critical factor. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135. After applying these three parts of the fourth factor to this case we conclude that Eklund was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Eklund argues that he has met the requirement of pretrial incarceration because he was incarcerated at all times prior to his trial. The State argues that he would have been incarcerated regardless of the pending charge and trial due to his incarceration for an unrelated offense. Eklund replies that the State\u2019s argument is weak because Eklund\u2019s memorandum for motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial stated that the Justice Court would release him from the sentence for his driving under the influence offense if released from the present charges. Our review of the record fails to show sufficient evidence to resolve this argument. However, based on the further discussion in this opinion we need not decide this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Eklund argues that he has met the next part, anxiety and concern, because anxiety and concern are inherent in the experience of being incarcerated for 197 days. He also argues that due to incarceration he was unable to locate his witnesses, and being separated from his friends caused him anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The presence of anxiety and concern is difficult for a defendant to prove, and the State is presented with the \u201cnear impossible burden of proving that it does not exist.\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 316. However, the State\u2019s burden to show lack of anxiety lessens considerably when marginal evidence of anxiety is presented. <em>Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 316. Here, Eklund\u2019s argument that he was unable to contact his witnesses and he missed his friends appears to us as marginal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Eklund argues that he has met impairment of defense, because he was unable to locate his house guest and renter as defense witnesses, and all his witnesses experienced memory loss due to the delay. However, he provides no evidence that his defense was impaired by the delay, and the record reveals that he did not attempt to locate witnesses until they were unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>On January 13,1993, at the hearing for motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial, Eklund testified that he knew the location of potential witnesses in July 1992, but waited until October 1992 to locate them for his defense as alibi witnesses. He also testified that he lacked evidence to prove that the witnesses\u2019 memories were dimmed because neither he nor his attorney had contacted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Eklund next argues that B.E. and A.E., his children who were present in his home during the alleged offenses, had experienced memory loss due to the delay. In <em>State v. Scott </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 454, 459-60, 850 P.2d 286, 289, the defendant argued that due to the delay of his trial, his child witnesses were unable to remember important details concerning whether the defendant sexually assaulted another child, thus impairing his defense. However, this Court stated that the defendant had failed to show how he was prejudiced by providing details of the children\u2019s memory loss; rather the children\u2019s memory loss was beneficial to the defendant because they could not remember the circumstances of the offense and give testimony against the defendant that he sexually assaulted the child. Here, at the end of the trial and at Eklund\u2019s request, B.E. and A.E. were examined by counsel and the court; after the examination neither child was called to testify. Neither of the children\u2019s transcripts support that their testimony would have benefitted his defense, and he fails to show how he was prejudiced. We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Eklund\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Did the District Court err in allowing character evidence to be introduced during cross-examination of Eklund\u2019s character witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">On January 15, 1992, prior to trial, Eklund filed notice of the character witnesses he intended to call at trial. During the jury trial, Svinth, Eklund\u2019s character witness, responded to questions on direct examination and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">Q. Did you know whether or not he exhibited any harsh words or discipline toward any of the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">A. None. In fact, maybe to the opposite. In fact, he didn\u2019t see them as often as he would have liked, really. He was probably the opposite, you know, letting them get away with more than I would have, myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">On cross examination, the prosecutor for the State asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Q. Why is it, do you think, that Mr. Eklund didn\u2019t get to see his kids as much as he liked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">A. His drinking problem, I am sure, was a big factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">Q. He would rather be out drinking and carousing around, as opposed to taking care of his family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">A: It was a factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">EKLUND\u2019S COUNSEL: Your Honor, I object to that question as calling for a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">The State continued to cross-examine Svinth about Eklund\u2019s convictions for driving under the influence, and his incarceration. The State then asked the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-10\">Q. Do you know what Mr. Eklund is charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-11\">A. No, not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">Q. He is accused of using threat of violence to coerce his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter into allowing him to have intercourse with her. Does it surprise you that he has threatened her with violence, that he could be violent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-13\">A. I have never known him to be violent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-14\">Q. How long have you known him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-15\">A. Since the mid-seventies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-16\">Q. And you have never known him to be violent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-17\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-18\">Q. Were you aware of a charge filed against him in 1974?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-19\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-20\">EKLUND\u2019S COUNSEL: Your Honor, I object to this question as well. Improper cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-21\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-22\">Q. Were you aware, in 1974, that he was charged with murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-23\">A. Yeah, I have been filled in with bits and pieces from my sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa9\">Q. Did she tell you that he took a man by the name of \u201cFox\u201d out hunting, shot him in the head, and dumped his body in a barrow pit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-24\">A. I am not aware of the particulars. I don\u2019t know if she was even</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-25\">The State continued to ask questions concerning prior reports that Eklund was emotionally and physically abusive toward his children while he was intoxicated. Eklund objected to the questions as introducing new evidence which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>After trial, Eklund moved for a mistrial, contending that the State had introduced inadmissible character evidence because Eklund did not open the door to his character as to truthfulness or that he was law-abiding, but had presented testimony to show generally that he treated his children well and never hit J.L. to rebut her testimony that he threatened her. The court denied this motion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">The Court is satisfied that the Rules of Evidence \u2014 for the requirement precedent to allowing the State, in this case, to produce evidence as to certain of Defendant\u2019s character, the requirements of Rule 404, the Court is satisfied with that being opened up, first by the Defendant, since beginning with counsel's opening statement, and then various questions on cross-examination, as well as Defendant\u2019s testimony; and the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\">The State contends that Eklund opened the door to all legitimate cross-examination of that witness when he called his character witness to support his good reputation that he was a kind, caring, and nonviolent father pursuant to Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Eklund argues that the court erred in overruling his objection to the state\u2019s statement that he was charged with murder in 1974. Eklund denies that he was charged with murder in 1974. He admits that he was convicted in 1973 of manslaughter, a crime of negligence rather than of intent. He argues that the statement was highly prejudicial and inflammatory and impossible to defend against, and that he did not receive a fair and impartial trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A mistrial may be granted upon a demonstration of manifest necessity, along with the denial of a fair and impartial trial. This Court will not disturb a lower court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless there is clear and convincing proof of error. <em>State v. Dixon </em>(1994), [264 Mont. 38], 869 P.2d 779, 781, 51 St. Rep. 135, 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">A new trial may be granted if there is an \u201cirregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial.\u201d Section 25-11-102(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Generally, character evidence is not admissible to prove conduct. Rule 404(a), M.R.Evid. Rule 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid., allows the prosecution to rebut the accused\u2019s offer of a pertinent trait of character. Rule 405(a), M.R.Evid., provides the following method to prove character:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Reputation or opinion. ... proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The State claims that the cross-examination properly rebutted Eklund\u2019s character evidence. <em>State v. Clark </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 473, 682 P.2d 1339. In <em>Clark, </em>the defendant was charged with sexual intercourse without consent with his young stepdaughter whereby he offered character evidence that he was gentle and nonviolent with his children and others, and concerning his propensity for truthfulness. By presenting character evidence, the defendant had placed his character at issue pursuant to 404(a)(1), M.R.Evid. Using the method in Rule 405(a), M.R.Evid., the prosecution properly cross-examined the defense character witness by asking whether he knew the following: the defendant had a prior armed robbery conviction; the defendant forcibly escaped from jail by overpowering the jailer; and other violent crimes the defendant committed while serving in Vietnam. <em>Clark, </em>682 P.2d at 1347. This Court found that the evidence was relevant to rebut the defendant\u2019s good character evidence because the defendant denied the charges and denied any violent acts toward the stepdaughter; also, this Court noted that the court gave the jury a cautionary instruction. <em>Clark, </em>682 P.2d at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Clark. </em>The evidence in <em>Clark </em>concerned prior <em>convictions </em>that depicted the defendant\u2019s violent character, and the probative value of the evidence outweighed the unfair prejudice to the defendant. Here, the State cross-examined Eklund\u2019s character witness about Eklund\u2019s prior murder <em>charges </em>to rebut his nonviolent character evidence; the actual conviction for these charges was for manslaughter. <em>See State v. Benton </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 401, 404, 825 P.2d 565, 567, where danger of unfair prejudice of evidence of <em>charges, </em>not a conviction, clearly outweighed the probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Character is defined as the \u201caggregate of the moral qualities which belong to and distinguish an individual person; the general result of one\u2019s distinguishing attributes.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 232 (6th ed. rev. 1990). While the prosecution may rebut defendant\u2019s offer of character evidence, the prosecution must present legitimate and relevant character evidence, and \u201cthe accused\u2019s entire life should not be searched in a effort to convict him.\u201d <em>State v. Heine </em>(1975), 169 Mont. 25, 29, 544 P.2d 1212, 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">After the court overruled Eklund\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s inquiry concerning murder charges, the State asked the following: \u201cDid she tell you that he took a man by the name of \u201cFox\u201d out hunting, shot him in the head, and dumped his body in a barrow pit?\u201d This Court, in <em>State v. Jones </em>(1914), 48 Mont. 505, 517, 139 P. 441, 446, condemned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>questions in cross-examination where the question assumes the existence of facts not admissible as independent evidence, citing <em>People v. Mullings </em>(1890), 83 Cal. 138, 23 P. 229:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">It is quite evident that the questions, and not the answers, were what the prosecution thought important. The purpose of the questions clearly was to keep persistently before the jury the assumption of damaging facts which could not be proven, and thus impress upon their minds the probability of the existence of the assumed facts upon which the questions were based.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">This Court said \u201c[w]hether or not such questions are answered or not, the putting of them is condemned by the courts and text-writers as gross misconduct.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>139 P. at 446. In the present case, the inquiry was improper and was intended to show Eklund had a violent character, and the prejudice to him outweighed the probative value under Rule 403, M.R.Evid. We conclude that Eklund has met his burden of showing clear and convincing evidence of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Section 46-20-701, MCA, provides that any ruling of the trial court that affects the respondent\u2019s substantial rights will be deemed harmless unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial. The test to decide if the prejudicial error requires a reversal is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the verdict.\u201d <em>Brodniak v. State </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 110, 114, 779 P.2d 71, 73, (quoting <em>State v. Gray </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 261, 268, 673 P.2d 1262, 1266). In our inquiry, we must examine the totality of the circumstances in which the error occurred. <em>Brodniak, </em>779 P.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In the present case, the following testimony was presented by the State: J.L.\u2019s testimony concerning the alleged offenses; J.L.\u2019s mother who gave general testimony; the neighbor\u2019s testimony who reported the alleged offenses; and the social worker\u2019s and detective\u2019s testimony who were involved in the investigation. Because the jury reached its verdict by considering the credibility of all the witnesses, the misleading evidence must have created great prejudice to Eklund for the jury to know he was charged with murder. We conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence of Eklund\u2019s murder charge denied him a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Because we have found reversible error on the evidence concerning murder charges and remand for retrial, we decline to discuss further evidence concerning Eklund\u2019s driving under the influence convictions, that he had abused alcohol, and that he had been incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Eklund\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial, reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of motion for mistrial, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b455-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, TRIEWEILER, GRAY, NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
