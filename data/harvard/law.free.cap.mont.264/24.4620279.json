We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>M.C. presents two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">1. Did the District Court err by deciding that two treatment plans were appropriate to M.C.\u2019s needs when the social worker testified that the treatment plans did not meet M.C.\u2019s needs?</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">2. Did the District Court err by deciding that M.C.\u2019s mental condition and chaotic lifestyle were unlikely to change within a reasonable time when the court based that decision, in part, on testimony that did not exist in the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">S.C. was born on May 2, 1985. M.C. is the natural mother of S.C. and S.C.\u2019s natural father is deceased. The Department of Family Services\u2019 (Department\u2019s) first contact with M.C. and S.C. was on May 22, 1985, when M.C. asked the Department to watch S.C. The Department communicated with M.C. about S.C. many more times in 1985. The case was closed in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">However, in April 1988, the Department received a report that M.C. contemplated hurting S.C., who, at that time, was almost three years old. The counselor arranged for S.C. to go to her maternal grandfather\u2019s home in Helena, Montana. S.C. was in Helena until August 1988. M.C. later informed the Department that S.C. was in her care in Billings. The Department assigned a social worker and child care was arranged for S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">In October 1989, the Department petitioned for temporary custody of the child. On October 30,1989, the District Court named S.C., then four years old, a youth in need of care and granted the Department temporary custody of S.C. The Department\u2019s goal was to stabilize M.C. and reunite her with her daughter at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">On May 2, 1990, M.C. and S.C. were reunited. However, almost immediately after this placement, M.C. experienced parenting problems. By July 1, 1990, she was depressed to the point that she discussed the possibility of returning S.C. to foster care. In August 1990, S.C. was returned to her maternal grandfather and step-grandmother in Helena.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">In October 1990, the Department again petitioned the court for temporary custody of S.C. M.C. acknowledged her inability to parent S.C. and consented that S.C. be placed in the Department\u2019s temporary custody. The court placed S.C. in the Department\u2019s temporary custody through October 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">In October 1991, the Department petitioned the court for permanent custody of S.C. and termination of M.C.\u2019s parental rights. The Department stayed the petition, however, in a last-ditch effort to reunite M.C. with S.C. The court continued the temporary custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>order through October 1992 and ordered M.C. to complete a treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The Department and M.C. signed a treatment plan and the court approved the plan as \u201cappropriate to the family\u2019s needs\u201d on October 10, 1991. Between December 11, 1991, and May 20, 1992, M.C. complied with the treatment plan. On May 20, 1992, M.C. was so depressed that she was admitted to the hospital. This setback delayed S.C.\u2019s return to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On June 29, 1992, the court approved a second treatment plan as appropriate to the needs of the family. M.C. complied with the second treatment plan. On July 31, 1992, S.C., then seven years old, was returned to M.C.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">While in her mother\u2019s care, S.C. stayed with her maternal grandmother three to four nights a week. S.C.\u2019s maternal grandmother lived with a man who was charged with sexually assaulting a child. The Department instructed M.C. not to allow any contact between that man and S.C. Despite the Department\u2019s instructions, S.C. continued to stay with her maternal grandmother three to four nights a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On August 29,1992, M.C. was hospitalized because she overdosed on prescription drugs. Three weeks later, M.C. attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on prescription drugs. During M.C.\u2019s hospitalizations, S.C. was in the care of her maternal grandmother and the man charged with sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The Department\u2019s attempt to reunite M.C. and S.C. was cut short. The Department decided to place S.C. back into foster care. Tragically, M.C. only parented S.C. for seven weeks, which included the three to four nights a week in which M.C.\u2019s mother took care of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Since October 1989, S.C. has only been in M.C.\u2019s care for a total five and one-half months. At best, M.C. has had minimal contact with S.C., even when the Department returned the child to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In October 1992, M.C. was hospitalized four more times for mental problems and suicidal tendencies. All told, M.C. was hospitalized seven times in a five and one-half month period for mental problems and suicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">On October 6, 1992, the Department petitioned the court for permanent custody of S.C., who was then seven and one-half years old. The Department also petitioned the court to terminate M.C.\u2019s parental rights. The District Court, after hearing the evidence, issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment on January 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>1993. The court terminated M.C.\u2019s parental rights and awarded permanent custody and care of S.C. to the Department. M.C. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Did the District Court err by deciding that two treatment plans were appropriate to M.C.\u2019s needs when the social worker testified that the treatment plans did not meet M.C.\u2019s needs?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Section 41-3-609(1), MCA, provides that a court may terminate a person\u2019s parental rights if it finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">(c) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">(i) an <em>appropriate </em>treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time[.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u201cThe State has the burden of proving by \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence that the statutory criteria under [\u00a7] 41-3-609, MCA, have been met.\u201d <em>Matter of J.H., S.H. &amp; N.H. </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 31, 34, 825 P.2d 1222, 1224. Our standard of review when examining a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights is whether the court interpreted the law correctly and whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Matter of F.M. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 358, 363, 811 P.2d 1263, 1266; <em>Matter of J.W. &amp; J.C. </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 46, 50, 757 P.2d 769, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">In the instant case, the District Court adjudicated S.C. a youth in need of care, approved two treatment plans and decided that the plans were appropriate. The District Court found that the plans addressed M.C.\u2019s mental health problems and her inept parenting skills. The court in Conclusion of Law No. 3 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">The Treatment Plans for [M.C.] were appropriate for the needs of this family, and were approved by this Court. They were complied with, but were not successful in resolving [M.C.\u2019s] long-term mental illness problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">M.C. argues that the social worker testified that the treatment plans did not meet her needs and, thus, the District Court erred when it decided that the treatment plans were appropriate for the needs of this family. M.C.\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">The social worker\u2019s testimony, when read in context with his remaining testimony, established that he was simply expressing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>M.C. had shown no improvement even though she was attending psychological treatment and counseling. From his testimony it is clear that the treatment plans were appropriate, but M.C. was unable to improve from the treatment she received.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">He testified that the Department established an elaborate support system which included counselors, psychiatrists, and programs to improve M.C.\u2019s mental health. Even with that support system in place, M.C. was hospitalized seven times for mental health reasons and she even attempted suicide. In short, M.C. complied with the treatment plans, but the treatment plans were not successful in resolving her mental health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">It is well established that a parent must not only comply with the treatment plan, but the treatment plan must also be successful. J.H., 825 P.2d at 1226. After reviewing the record in this case we conclude that the District Court properly determined that the treatment plans were appropriate and they were complied with, but were not successful in resolving M.C.\u2019s long-term mental illness problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Did the District Court err by deciding that M.C.\u2019s mental condition and chaotic lifestyle were unlikely to change within a reasonable time when the court based that decision, in part, on testimony that did not exist in the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The District Court in Finding of Fact No. 27 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">[w]hen asked whether [M.C.\u2019s] condition was likely to change in a reasonable amount of time, [the social worker\u2019s] response was negative because of [M.C.\u2019s] on-going mental illness and her past history of mental illness. [M.C.\u2019s doctor]... was also not able to provide a time frame for improvement sufficient to allow parenting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">These facts provided the basis for Conclusion of Law No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">[M.C.\u2019s] mental illness renders her unfit and unable to provide [S.C.] with adequate parental care and guidance. Her conduct and condition has [sic] remained unchanged the past year and is [sic] unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">At trial, the social worker was asked this question: \u201cIn your opinion is [M.C.\u2019s] conduct [or] condition that renders her unfit likely to change in a reasonable time?\u201d M.C.\u2019s attorney objected to the question for lack of foundation and the court sustained the objection. The social worker was never allowed to answer the question. Thus, M.C. argues that the first sentence of Finding of Fact No. 27 is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Although the District Court based its decision on testimony which did not exist, the court\u2019s mistake in Finding of Fact No. 27 does not constitute reversible error. This Court has repeatedly stated that a district court\u2019s decision will not be reversed or remanded when the eventual result of the case would be the same without the error. <em>In re Marriage of Cannon </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 272, 275, 697 P.2d 901, 903. In this case, disregarding the first sentence of Finding of Fact No. 27, there was still substantial evidence to support the ultimate finding and conclusion that M.C.\u2019s mental condition, which rendered her unfit, was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">M.C.\u2019s psychiatrist and therapist both testified that M.C. was unable to take care of herself, let alone take care of the needs of a seven-year-old girl. M.C. could not put S.C.\u2019s needs before her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Even when M.C. cared for S.C., her care was, at best, sporadic, inconsistent and unstable. At the time of trial she could not care for S.C. and she has been unable to care for the child during the past three years. In fact, in those three years, S.C. was only in M.C.\u2019s care, off and on, for a total of five and one-half months. Moreover, while in M.C.\u2019s care during those five and one-half months, S.C. spent three to four nights a week at her maternal grandmother\u2019s house, where her grandmother lived with a man who was charged with sexually assaulting a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">M.C.\u2019s psychiatrist testified that S.C. suffered from major depression, recurrent generalized anxiety and a borderline personality disorder. M.C.\u2019s psychiatrist could not provide a time limit for her recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">In evaluating whether a parent\u2019s conduct or condition rendering her unfit is -unlikely to change within a reasonable time:</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">the court [must] consider but is not limited to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of such duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">(c) a single incident of life-threatening or gravely disabling injury to or disfigurement of the child caused by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">(d) excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>(e) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">(f) the injury or death of a sibling due to proven parental abuse or neglect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">(g) any reasonable efforts by protective service agencies that have been unable to rehabilitate the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Here, the court considered M.C.\u2019s mental illness. Since 1989, M.C.\u2019s mental health has severely affected her parenting ability. First, she threatened to hurt S.C. Next, several mental health hospitalizations forced M.C. to send S.C. into different homes and even to her mother, who lived with a man charged with sexual assault of a child. Most recently, in the five and one-half months before trial, M.C. was hospitalized seven times for suicidal tendencies and mental health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The court also considered the Department\u2019s extensive efforts in attempting to rehabilitate M.C. The Department set up an elaborate support system for M.C., including psychiatrists, counselors and social workers. Despite that support system and the Department\u2019s efforts to improve her mental health, M.C.\u2019s mental health was only slightly improved, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">She attended counseling and parenting classes, but she was unable to implement what she learned and she failed to use that information to change her lifestyle. Her needs were too great and S.C.\u2019s needs went by the wayside for three years while the Department futilely attempted to reunite M.C. with S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Moreover, the District Court was bound to give paramount consideration to the urgency of S.C.\u2019s needs and S.C\u2019s needs take precedence over M.C.\u2019s parental rights. See <em>J.H., </em>825 P.2d at 1224-25; see also <em>Matter of H.R.B. &amp; K.R.B. </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 387, 390, 780 P.2d 1139, 1141. Section 41-3-609(3), MCA, mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">[i]n considering any of the factors in [\u00a7 41-3-609(2)] ..., the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Here, the testimony established that S.C. needed stability and predictability in her life. The testimony confirmed that further delay in providing S.C. with stability and predictability would cause her substantial emotional harm. In short, S.C.\u2019s emotional well-being was threatened by M.C.\u2019s chaotic and unstable lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>After a review of the record, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding \u2014 that M.C.\u2019s mental health rendered her unfit, to parent and her mental health was not likely to improve in a reasonable time \u2014 was supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, 1) expert testimony established that M.C. had all she could handle just taking care of herself; 2) M.C.\u2019s mental health only improved slightly during the three years the Department worked with her; 3) of those three years, she was only able to parent S.C. for five and one-half months; 4) even with the Department\u2019s support system, M.C. was hospitalized seven times in a five and one-half month period for mental health and suicidal tendencies; 5) M.C. left S.C. in the care of her mother, who lived with a man charged with sexually assaulting a child; and 6) most importantly, S.C.\u2019s needs for stability and predictability were extremely urgent. The District Court correctly determined that S.C.\u2019s emotional needs prevailed over M.C.\u2019s parental rights. See <em>H.R.B., </em>780 P.2d at 1141. We uphold the court\u2019s decision to terminate M.C.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b56-5\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">I specially concur with the result of the majority opinion. However, I do not agree with all that is said therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">I agree that there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that M.C.\u2019s mental health rendered her unfit to serve as S.C.\u2019s parent and that that condition was unlikely to improve in the near enough future to be of benefit to S.C. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s repeated reference to the irrelevant fact that M.C.\u2019s mother lived with a man \u201ccharged with sexually assaulting a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The mere fact that someone with whom S.C. was allowed to associate was \u201ccharged\u201d with something has no significance. If there is any place where a person ought to be entitled to a presumption that a mere charge of wrongdoing has no legal significance, it is in the highest court of the state. And yet, the majority opinion embarrassingly refers no fewer than five times to the fact that S.C. was allowed to associate with a person \u201ccharged\u201d with criminal conduct. Those references are unnecessary and inappropriate bases for the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
