The commission denied Kmart\u2019s motion, and Kmart requested a writ of mandamus to overturn that decision before the commission could either grant or deny Frantom\u2019s application for permanent and total disability compensation. The Court of Appeals for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Franklin County denied the writ, holding that mandamus is not available to challenge an agency\u2019s interlocutory discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We affirm. In <em>State ex rel. McKim v. Hobart Corp. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 99, 568 N.E.2d 670, we unanimously rejected an employee-claimant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to grant her permission to depose a doctor. We held that the commission\u2019s discovery order could not be reviewed in mandamus because the writ cannot be used to create an appeal from an order that is not final. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 568 N.E.2d at 670-671, citing <em>State ex rel. Sobczak v. Show </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 550 N.E.2d 455, 456. Accord <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Moody\u2019s of Dayton, Inc. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 238, 1 OBR 260, 438 N.E.2d 1162 (denial of deposition order reviewed in mandamus after commission determined extent of disability and granted compensation). But, see, <em>State ex rel. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. </em>Indus. <em>Comm. </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 78, 547 N.E.2d 1173 (denial of deposition order reviewed in mandamus prior to disposition of claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation and without court comment on the lack of finality). We are not persuaded to abandon this established rule on the basis of Kmart\u2019s arguments that the commission\u2019s order was wrong and unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The court of appeals\u2019 judgment, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
