Because there were at that time no provisions requiring a visual or audible warning device, the application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Recently, in <em>State ex rel. Colliver v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 476, 705 N.E.2d 349, we held that a motorized mobile object is not \u201can installation or construction\u201d for purposes of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-01(A) and is not subject to the provision\u2019s grandfather clause. Accordingly, the present claimant\u2019s VSSR application is governed by the specific safety requirements in effect on the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">Here applicable, Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-13(C)(7) required \u201c[a]ll motor vehicles operating within the confines of the owner\u2019s property\u201d to have \u201can audible or visual warning device.\u201d The commission found that the towmotor had no \u201ccontinuously operating audible or visual device,\u201d but did have a working horn. The question thus remains for the commission to determine whether this horn satisfied the requirements of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201413(C)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">Accordingly, we grant a writ of mandamus vacating the commission\u2019s order and returning the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">\n<em>Writ granted and cause returned.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
