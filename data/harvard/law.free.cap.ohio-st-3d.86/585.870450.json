Forsyth v. Brigner </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 71, 711 N.E.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We also agree that by filing numerous original actions to challenge the same rulings by Judge Brigner, Forsyth has abused his <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. As the United States Supreme Court observed in <em>In re Sindram </em>(1991), 498 U.S. 177, 179-180, 111 S.Ct. 596, 597-598, 112 L.Ed.2d 599, 604-605:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\u201c[T]he Court waives filing fees and costs for indigent individuals in order to promote the interests of justice. The goal of fairly dispensing justice, however, is compromised when the Court is forced to devote its limited resources to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests. <em>Pro se </em>petitioners have a greater capacity than most to disrupt the fair allocation of judicial resources because they are not subject to the financial considerations \u2014 filing fees and attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 that deter other litigants from filing frivolous petitions. * * * The risks of abuse are particularly acute with respect to applications for extraordinary relief, since such petitions are not subject to any time limitations and, theoretically, could be filed at any time without limitation. In order to prevent frivolous petitions for extraordinary relief from unsettling the fair administration of justice, the Court has a duty to deny <em>in forma pauperis </em>status to those individuals who have abused the system. Under the circumstances <em>of </em>this case, we find it appropriate to deny <em>informa pauperis </em>status to petitioner in this and all future petitions for extraordinary relief.\u201d (Citation omitted.) See, also, <em>State ex rel. Richard v. Cuyahoga Cty. Commrs. </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 592, 654 N.E.2d 443; <em>Karmasu v. Wilkinson </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 737, 686 N.E.2d 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. We also order that the Clerk of this court not accept for filing any additional appeals or original actions from Forsyth unless accompanied by the docket fee and security deposit required by S.Ct.Prac.R. XV. See <em>Smith v. Servar-Portion, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 1504, 679 N.E.2d 5; <em>In re Guess </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 1515, 665 N.E.2d 684; S.Ct.Prac.R. XIV(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b702-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-10\">. We deny Forsyth\u2019s request for oral argument. He has not established any of the factors that might warrant oral argument <em>State ex rel. Lee v. Trumbull Cty. Probate Court </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 369, 371. 700 N.E.2d 4, 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
