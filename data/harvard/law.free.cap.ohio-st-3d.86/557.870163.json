I respectfully dissent for the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 667, 710 N.E.2d 1116, 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Koichiro Ezawa, a minor, was injured in an accident while a passenger in an automobile driven by Diedre Soler. Ezawa\u2019s damages exceeded the $250,000 per person limit of Soler\u2019s liability insurance policy. At the time of the accident, Ezawa\u2019s father, Fumiko Ezawa, was employed by Tomasco Mulciber, Inc. (\u201cTomasco\u201d). Tomasco had a business automobile insurance policy issued by appellee Yasuda Fire <em>&amp; </em>Marine Insurance Company of America (\u201cYasuda\u201d). Although Ezawa was injured by a third party who was not a Tomasco employee and was not in a vehicle covered by Tomasco\u2019s insurance policy, Ezawa and his father, nevertheless, made an underinsured motorists (\u201cUIM\u201d) claim against the Yasuda policy issued to Fumiko Ezawa\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The trial court granted Yasuda\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings because, based on the unambiguous language in the Yasuda policy, Koichiro was not an \u201cinsured\u201d as that term is defined in the policy. The court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">The Yasuda policy was issued to a corporation. According to the language of the policy, UIM coverage extends to family members of the insured <em>only </em>if the named insured is an individual. Here, it is not. Yet the majority applies its convoluted reasoning in <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>to once again extend the reach of UIM coverage. Now a corporate policy must afford UIM coverage to an employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>minor son who was injured by a non-employee while riding in a non-covered vehicle and whose injuries had nothing to do with the corporation\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"AM1\">Pandora\u2019s Box continues to release its contents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
