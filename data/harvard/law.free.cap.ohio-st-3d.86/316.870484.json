In this case, the decedent Dillard had clocked out after his shift ended and left the Canton Drop Forge plant where he worked. He was walking to his personal automobile that was parked in a lot across the street from the plant when he was struck and killed by an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The Liberty Mutual Insurance Company policy issued to the decedent\u2019s employer, Canton Drop Forge, contained the identical definitions of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d for purposes of UM/UIM coverage as did the policy in <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116. The Stark County Court of Appeals held that Dillard was not an insured under the Liberty Mutual policy because he did not fit into any of the categories of \u201cinsured.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that the term \u2018You\u2019, under the section defining who is an \u2018insured\u2019, in the policy issued by Liberty, refers to Canton Drop Forge. Second, we find the phrase \u2018if you are an individual, any family member\u2019 unambiguous. A plain reading of this provision establishes that the provision applies only when the insured is an individual.\u201d The court noted a distinction in the definition between \u201cyou\u201d and \u201can individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The appellate court stated that since the term \u201cyou\u201d refers to corporations, which are not individuals, the provision does not extend coverage to Dillard because the named insured was not an individual. Furthermore, at the time of the accident, Dillard was not operating a \u201ccovered auto.\u201d Because Dillard did not fit any of the categories of \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy issued by Liberty, the court concluded that he may not be afforded coverage for injuries sustained due to an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For the reasons more fully set forth in my dissenting opinion in <em>Scottr-Pontzer, </em>I respectfully dissent and would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-6\">Cook, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
