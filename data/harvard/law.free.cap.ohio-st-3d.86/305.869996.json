As to the former, we find that Dr. Purewal\u2019s report is \u201csome evidence.\u201d Claimant attacks the report, asserting that it was invalidated by the later allowance of \u201cthoracic sprain and myofascial pain syndrome.\u201d Dr. Purewal, however, examined claimant\u2019s entire back, including the thoracic region, and commented on the complaints of pain that presumably prompted claimant to seek recognition of thoracic sprain and myofascial pain syndrome. This distinguishes this case from <em>State ex rel. Richardson v. Quarto Mining Co. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 358, 652 N.E.2d 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the examining physician considered only the allowed condition of \u201clumbosacral strain\u201d in assessing MMI. His examination did not encompass the other more serious allowed condition of \u201ccentral disc herniation at L4-5 and L5-S1,\u201d causing us to declare that his report was not \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting TTD denial. In this case, claimant\u2019s additional conditions were thoracic sprain and myofascial pain syndrome, the manifestation of which was covered by Dr. Purewal\u2019s examination. Given the nature of claimant\u2019s additionally allowed conditions, we find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that Dr. Purewal in effect considered all allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Turning to the remaining question, we find that it has already been answered by <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 516, 696 N.E.2d 1069, at syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cThe appropriate date on which to terminate disputed temporary total disability compensation on the basis of maximum medical improvement is the date of the termination hearing, and the commission may not declare an overpayment for payments received by the claimant before that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Accordingly, we affirm that part of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that finds \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s termination of TTD. The balance of the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AYA\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b425-8\">F.E.
