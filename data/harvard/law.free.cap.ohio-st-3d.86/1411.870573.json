This cause is pending before the court as an appeal from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. On June 21, 1999, appellant filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction that exceeds the page limitation prescribed by S.Ct.Prac.R. III(1)(C). Whereas appellant has not filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction in compliance with S.Ct.Prac.R. Ill within the time for perfecting his appeal, and whereas, pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. II(2)(A)(1), appellant\u2019s failure to file a memorandum in support of jurisdiction within the prescribed time period divests this court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal,</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">IT IS ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that appellant\u2019s memorandum in support of jurisdiction be, and hereby is, stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED by the court, <em>sua sponte, </em>that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
