For the following reasons, however, we believe that a more severe sanction is warranted. DR 5-105(B) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not continue multiple employment if the exercise of his independent professional judgment in behalf of a client will be or is <em>likely to be adversely affected </em>by his representation of another client, except to the extent permitted under DR 5-105(C).\u201d (Emphasis added.) DR 5-105(C) permits an attorney to represent multiple clients \u201cif <em>it is obvious that he can adequately represent the interest of each </em>and if each consents to the representation after full disclosure of the possible effect of such representation on the exercise of his independent professional judgment on behalf of each.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Here, respondent himself acknowledged in 1993 to Crites\u2019s then-attorney in the state court litigation that the interests of Demmler and Crites contained \u201cclear and distinct differences.\u201d The common pleas court subsequently determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>these concerns to be substantial enough to merit including a provision in the settlement agreement to settle any dispute between Demmler and Crites regarding the distribution of the settlement proceeds. On the day that Crites fired respondent, Crites sent respondent a facsimile transmission that referred to disagreements between himself and Demmler.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Based on this evidence, it was \u201clikely\u201d that respondent\u2019s continued representation of both Demmler and Crites in the state court litigation would adversely affect his clients and it was far from \u201cobvious\u201d that he could adequately represent both Demmler\u2019s and Crites\u2019s interests. DR 5-105(B) and (C). In addition, neither of the written consents to representation of multiple clients executed by Demmler and Crites applied to the state court litigation\u2019s $900,000 settlement option. Therefore, respondent\u2019s conduct manifestly violated DR 5 \u2014 105(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We further concur in the board\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated DR 5-106(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In sum, \u201c[a] lawyer should never represent in litigation multiple clients with differing interests; and <em>there are few situations in which he would be justified in representing in litigation multiple clients with potentially differing interests.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) EC 5-15. Respondent\u2019s continued representation of Demmler and Crites, whom he had previously noted to have \u201cclear and distinct\u201d interests, is not one of those few justifiable situations. Regardless of whether respondent\u2019s conduct created an actual conflict of interest, it created a <em>potential </em>conflict of interest, which is sufficient to violate DR 5-105(B). See, <em>e.g., Kentucky Bar Assn. v. Roberts </em>(Ky.1979), 579 S.W.2d 107, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In considering respondent\u2019s violations of DR 5-105(B) and 5-106(A) and his previous violation of a comparable Disciplinary Rule, we find that a six-month suspension is appropriate. See <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Schmelzer </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 382, 704 N.E.2d 243; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Podor </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 40, 647 N.E.2d 470; and <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Ewing </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 377, 588 N.E.2d 783, where we imposed a similar sanction for comparable violations of DR 5-105; see, also, <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Westmeyer </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 38, 40, 567 N.E.2d 1016, 1018 (\u201c[Rjespondent\u2019s prior misconduct, based on similar charges, is relevant to the choice of sanction.\u201d). Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six months.
