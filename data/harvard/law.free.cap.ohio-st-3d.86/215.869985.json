Hirschvogel does not dispute noncompliance with these specific safety requirements. The Cratex 203-A grinding wheel was not attached to the wheel armature with flanges, and the wheel\u2019s maximum rated speed was greatly exceeded by the minimum speed of the grinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Hirschvogel instead attempts to excuse its noncompliance by asserting that the provisions do not apply. Alternatively, it alleges that claimant acted negligently, thereby shielding Hirschvogel from liability. Neither contention is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The employer\u2019s initial argument is directed primarily to Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-12(D)(4)(a). Hirschvogel argues that because the rubberized nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the grinding wheel made it nnconducive to \u201cring testing,\u201d it was not encompassed by section (D)(4)(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Claimant\u2019s accident demonstrates the dangers of using a grinding wheel incapable of handling the R.P.M.s produced by the grinder. Yet Hirschvogel essentially argues that wheeVgrinder incompatibility is somehow ameliorated by a wheel\u2019s inability to emit a ringing sound when tapped. We cannot ratify this premise. Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-12 applies to \u201cabrasive grinding and * * * polishing * * * equipment.\u201d Hirschvogel itself describes the equipment at issue as a \u201crubberized abrasive disc.\u201d We find, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in applying Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-12(D)(4)(a) and in finding a violation of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Hirschvogel also alleges that claimant was negligent in not using approved safety glasses and that this negligence immunizes it from penalty. Claimant\u2019s alleged negligence, however, even if it existed, is a defense only where the employer has <em>first </em>complied with the relevant safety requirement. See <em>State ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 524 N.E.2d 482. Here, Hirschvogel did not satisfy either requirement at issue, negating our need to explore its assertion further.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
