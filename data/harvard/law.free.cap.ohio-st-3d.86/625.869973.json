Parker failed to allege sufficient facts supporting his claims to withstand dismissal. See <em>State ex rel. Jackson v. McFaul </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 185, 188, 652 N.E.2d 746, 748-749; <em>State ex rel. Carrion v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 637, 638, 687 N.E.2d 759, 760. Parker instead relied on conclusory allegations that his \u201cdefense was hurt by the many delays\u201d and that his acquittal \u201cremoved all factual support\u201d for his revocation. <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Carrion. </em>In fact, the attachments to Parker\u2019s own petition establish that one of his charged parole violations was his failure to notify his parole officer of his arrest on the new criminal charges. Consequently, it is evident that acquittal on those charges did not remove all factual support for his parole revocation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b742-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Although the <em>court </em>of appeals erred in relying in part <em>on </em>materials attached to appellee\u2019s dismissal motion in making its determination, <em>State ex rel. Freeman v. Morris </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 579 N.E.2d 702, 703, this error does not warrant reversal. See <em>Johnson v. Ohio Parole Bd. </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 140. 141. 684 N.E.2d 1227, 1227-1228.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
