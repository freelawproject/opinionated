Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 191, 658 N.E.2d 237, 240. Here, respondent\u2019s repeated deceit regarding the arbitration proceedings constitutes a \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d rather than an isolated act and consequently warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law. See, <em>e.g., Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Caliman </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 461, 700 N.E.2d 857. Sleep apnea does not exonerate respondent from punishment for his acts of deceit. See <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Knowlton </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 76, 689 N.E.2d 538. The panel\u2019s recommendation of a stayed suspension, which the board properly rejected, did not follow the <em>Fowerbaugh </em>prescription of an \u201cactual suspension.\u201d <em>Caliman, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 462, 700 N.E.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Accordingly, we suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with six months of the suspension stayed on the conditions that respondent\u2019s office practice be monitored for six months, that respondent obtain certification by a physician that his medical condition has been treated and no longer poses any interference with his ability to practice law in Ohio, that respondent attend an additional six hours of continuing legal education on ethics and professional responsibility in addition to his regular OLE requirements, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>respondent reimburse DES for the $1,568.78 in costs in connection with the dismissal of the arbitration proceedings, and that respondent return the $160 retainer to Stevens.
