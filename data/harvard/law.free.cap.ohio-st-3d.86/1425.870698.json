This cause is pending before the court as a discretionary appeal. It appears from the records of this court that appellant has not filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction, due July 2, 1999, in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore has failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence.
