While there is evidence of such misconduct in the <em>Kentucky </em>litigation, neither the complaint nor the motions for default judgment and attached exhibits support these findings for the Hamilton County case.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Nevertheless, we adopt the conclusions and recommendation of the board. \u201c \u2018The continuing public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest discipline be imposed in misappropriation cases.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Romaniw </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 462, 464, 700 N.E.2d 858, 859, quoting <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897, 899. Respondent converted funds to which he was not entitled for his personal use and blatantly disregarded court orders in litigation prompted by his wrongful appropriation of these funds. No mitigation circumstances exist, and disbarment is the appropriate sanction. Respondent is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b669-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
