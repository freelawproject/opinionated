Despite the facts, noted above, claimant asserts that the safety equipment should have nevertheless been taken to the job site. We disagree. Decedent had the opportunity to get whatever safety equipment he needed for this job. He declined that invitation, and pattern and practice strongly implied that even if the equipment had been at the job site, decedent would not have used it.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in denying claimant\u2019s VSSR application. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
