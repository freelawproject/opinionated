Finding that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying a VSSR award, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-3-03(J)(l) directs employers to provide lifelines, safety belts, and lanyards to employees \u201cexposed to hazards of falling when the operation being performed is more than fifteen feet above ground or above a floor or platform.\u201d The code does not define the phrase \u201coperation being performed.\u201d As such, its interpretation lies solely within the commission\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State ex rel. Berry v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 193, 4 OBR 513, 448 N.E.2d 134. Equally important, specific safety requirements \u201cmust be strictly construed, and all reasonable doubts construing the interpretation of the safety standard are to be construed against its applicability to the employer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 172, 545 N.E.2d 1216, 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">These principles compel our conclusion that the commission\u2019s interpretation was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we find that the commission did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>its discretion in measuring \u201coperation being performed\u201d as the distance between the employee\u2019s feet and the ground, floor, or platform. Since that distance was less than fifteen feet, the commission\u2019s refusal to find a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-3-03(J)(l) was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Claimant also alleges a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 3\u201414(B)(8). Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 3\u201414(B), however, is entitled simply \u201cdefinitions.\u201d As such, the commission ruled that subsection (B)(8), falling thereunder, was only a definition and not a specific safety requirement that imposed a duty on an employer. We agree and find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying a violation <em>of </em>this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b700-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
