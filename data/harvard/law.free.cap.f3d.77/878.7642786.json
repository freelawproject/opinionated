For the reasons assigned, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"Abk\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsK5\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>on February 1, 1993 Long invoked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and filed suit against Vera Simmons, Pete Pope, and Major Robincheaux, alleging that while a pretrial detainee in Pascagoula, Mississippi he was placed in a cell with a convicted inmate against whom he had testified at a murder trial. He alleges that the inmate stabbed him several times.</p>\n<p id=\"AHH9\">On November 17, 1993 the clerk for the Southern District of Mississippi sent Long a document entitled \u201cNew Procedure for 1983 Pro Se Prisoner Cases,\u201d which called for a disclosure form to be returned by December 20, 1993. Long failed to return the form in a timely manner and the district court dismissed his action on January 31, 1994. Ten days later Long moved to reinstate his action. On May 13, 1994, before the district court ruled on the motion to reinstate, Long filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of his case. He then sought a voluntary dismissal of his motion to reinstate. This request was granted on September 13,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"AE72\">On the first appeal, without reaching the merits, we remanded to the district court for a determination whether the motion to reinstate, construed as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend, had been served timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This finding was deemed essential to a decision on appellate jurisdiction because former Rule 59(e) provided that a motion to alter or amend had to be <em>served </em>within ten days of entry of the judgment in order to be timely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On remand, the district court did not reach this <em>issue </em>but, rather, found the question moot in light of the voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"An6h\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhX\">Prior to December 1, 1995 Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure required <em>service </em>of a motion to alter or amend judgment within ten days of the entry of the judgment. As recently amended, that Rule now provides that \u201c[a]ny motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be <em>filed </em>no later than 10 days after entry of judgment.\u201d The amended rule applied to all proceedings in civil cases then pending \u201cinsofar as just and practicable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should be given retroactive application \u201cto the maximum extent possible.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the amended rule should be applied in this instance. The record reflects that Long\u2019s motion was filed timely. We gained jurisdiction over this appeal when the district court disposed of that motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Akui\">A district court may dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to comply with a court order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review such dismissals for an abuse of disere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the action at bar without prejudice. Because of the operation of the statute of limitations, however, the dismissal operates as a dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A dismissal with prejudice is appropriate only if the failure to comply with the court order was the result of purposeful delay or contumaciousness and the record reflects that the district court employed lesser sanctions before dismissing the action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record contains no indication that Long failed to comply with the court order to secure a delay or out of contumaciousness. Nor does the record reflect that the district court employed lesser sanctions before dismissing the action. We therefore must conclude that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"As5\">.
