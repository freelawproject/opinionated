The district court granted Sinisterra\u2019s motion to suppress approximately 200 kilograms of cocaine seized from an unoccupied van in a shopping center parking lot, and it denied the Government\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This case is now before us on the Government\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s suppression order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-16\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">The basic facts relevant to the suppression issue are not disputed. Federal agents placed a house located at 7306 Daleview in Houston, Texas, under surveillance based on information that the house was used for drug-related activities. The agents saw Sin-isterra arrive in a green Nissan and enter the house. Shortly thereafter, a woman came out of the house and drove the Nissan around the neighborhood, making brief stops at two houses. The agents concluded that the woman was making a \u201cheat run.\u201d The woman returned to 7306 Daleview and entered the house. She was inside the house for approximately one minute; then she left and drove away in the Nissan. Sinisterra left the house in a brown Dodge van and caught up with the woman. The brown van and the Nissan drove slowly in tandem for some time; when the Nissan turned off, agents followed the van. Sinisterra drove the van to a shopping mall, Memorial City Mall, parked in the mail\u2019s public parking lot, and got out of the van with a small dog. He made a call from a pay telephone and walked around the mall. He went into a Sears Automotive Center and tethered the dog in a service bay. He walked to a nearby medical office building and made another telephone call. After about twenty minutes, he left the medical building and got on a city bus. He rode the bus for about one and one-half miles, then he got off and began to walk back towards the mall. He stopped at a food store to make a telephone call and then he walked into a residential neighborhood where the agents \u201clost\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The unoccupied van was under continuous surveillance, but no one approached it. Houston police officers walked a trained narcotics-detecting dog around the van, and the dog alerted strongly to the van. An officer then looked into the van\u2019s window (without entering or opening the van) and saw two large duffle bags. Two officers left to obtain a search warrant. While the officers were gone, Sinisterra and the woman returned to the parking lot in the green Nissan. Sinist-erra retrieved his dog, but he did not go near the van. He drove the Nissan out of the mall parking lot and stopped at a pay telephone in a nearby strip shopping center, about 100 yards away from the van. Agents detained him before he could make a telephone call and asked him to explain his behavior. A Spanish-speaking officer obtained Sinisterra\u2019s permission to search the Nissan, but Sinisterra refused to consent to a search of the van. Sinisterra was placed under arrest and the Nissan was searched, but it did not contain any contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">By this time, it was night. Andy Fullerton, a U.S. Customs Agent with over twenty years\u2019 experience, looked through the windows of the van with a flashlight. Agent Fullerton saw several kilogram-size, cellophane-wrapped packages. One of the packages was marked with a logo and had the name \u201cLotus\u201d printed on it. Agent Fullerton testified that it was his experience that packages marked in this way always contained either cocaine or marihuana. When the officers who were charged with obtaining the warrant told an assistant U.S. Attorney of Agent Fullerton\u2019s discovery, the assistant U.S. Attorney advised that a warrant was unnecessary, and all efforts to obtain a warrant ceased. The van was then towed to the police department where a warrantless search revealed approximately 200 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">After a suppression hearing, the district court held that Sinisterra had standing to challenge the search of the van, a holding the Government does not challenge on this appeal. The district court also determined that the officers had probable cause to arrest Sinisterra, but it held that Sinisterra\u2019s relationship to the van at the time of his arrest was too attenuated for the evidence to be admissible as seized in a search incident to arrest. The court held that the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement authorized the officers to seize the van without a warrant, but that they could not search the vehicle without a warrant or consent. Citing <em>United States v. McBee, </em>659 F.2d 1302, 1304 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 949, 102 S.Ct. 2020, 72 L.Ed.2d 474 (1982), the court held that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement requires both probable cause and exigent circumstances. The court determined that the search was not justified by exigent circumstances because the police had a valid basis to seize the vehicle and, thus, could have obtained a warrant at their leisure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further reasoned that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the van was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>parked in a privately owned parking lot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, the district court granted the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Government argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence is admissible under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. We Agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s fact-findings on a motion to suppress for clear error and reviews de novo the \u201cultimate determination of Fourth Amendment reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Seals, </em>987 F.2d 1102, 1106 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 155, 126 L.Ed.2d 116 (1993). The district court\u2019s determination that the search of the van was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment was based on certain erroneous legal assumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">First, the district court concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest Sinisterra and to seize the van, but that they were prohibited from searching the van without obtaining a warrant. There is no constitutional difference between \u201cseizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant. Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Marrowy, </em>399 U.S. 42, 52, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1981, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">Second, to the extent that <em>McBee </em>and its progeny require, in a situation such as the present, a finding of exigent circumstances other than the fact of the automobile\u2019s potential mobility, they are inconsistent with more recent Supreme Court jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has held that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement applies when a vehicle is \u201creadily capable\u201d of \u201cbeing used on the highways\u201d and it \u201cis found stationary in a place not regularly used for residential purposes.... \u201d <em>California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 392, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 2070, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985). Under these circumstances \u201coverriding societal interests in effective law enforcement\u201d justify an immediate warrantless search because (1) \u201cthe vehicle is obviously readily mobile by the turn of an ignition key ...\u201d and (2) it is subject to a \u201creduced expectation of privacy stemming from its use as a licensed motor vehicle subject to a range of police regulation inapplicable to a fixed dwelling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">Finally, the district court attached importance to the fact that the car was parked in a shopping center parking lot \u2014 rather than on a public street \u2014 at the time that it was seized. For the reasons discussed below, this fact is not determinative of the legality of the seizure and subsequent search here.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">In <em>Carney, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the warrantless search of a motor home parked in a downtown San Diego parking \u201clot\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 105 S.Ct. at 2067. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents had information that Carney and other persons were engaging in sex in the motor home and paying their partners with marihuana. They searched the motor home without a warrant or consent and discovered a quantity of marihuana and drug paraphernalia. The California Supreme Court suppressed the drugs and reversed Carney\u2019s conviction for possession of marihuana. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed because it concluded that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement applied. <em>Id. </em>at 392-93, 105 S.Ct. at 2070.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">This court has concluded that, under <em>Carney, </em>\u201cprobable cause <em>alone </em>suffices to justify a warrantless search of a vehicle lawfully parked in a public place, as long as the scope of the search is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>949 F.2d 737, 747 (5th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted; emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 U.S. 975, 112 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>2945, 119 L.Ed.2d 569 (1992). Sinisterra argues that <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 461-62, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2035-36, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), and <em>United States v. Reed, </em>26 F.3d 523, 530 (5th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1116, 130 L.Ed.2d 1080 (1995), dictate that exigent circumstances were required to justify a war-rantless search of the van.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Coolidge </em>and <em>Reed </em>are distinguishable because both cases involved vehicles parked in the driveways of the residences of the defendants (who were in custody). See <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 447, 91 S.Ct. at 2028; <em>Reed, </em>26 F.3d at 525. <em>Carney </em>controls this ease because of the similarity of the factual situations. Here, the mall parking lot was not related to anyone\u2019s residence, it was open to the public and available for public use, and Sinisterra had no more right in it than any member of the public. That the lot was owned by the mall \u2014 and not by the city \u2014 is irrelevant in these circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">This court has applied the automobile exception to admit evidence seized in warrantless searches of vehicles which were legally parked in privately-owned motel parking lots where there was probable cause to search but no showing of exigent circumstances. <em>United States v. Buchner, </em>7 F.3d 1149, 1150-51, 1154-55 (5th Cir.1993) (La-Quinta Motel), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1331, 127 L.Ed.2d 378 (1994); <em>United States v. Ervin, </em>907 F.2d 1534, 1536-39 (5th Cir.1990) (Big Bend Motor Inn Motel). The rule applicable here is that if, under the totality of the circumstances, officers have probable cause to believe that a vehicle contains contraband, they are authorized to search the van without a warrant. <em>Buchner, </em>7 F.3d at 1154-55; <em>Seals, </em>987 F.2d at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Here, in addition to the dog alert, the officers were also aware of the informant\u2019s tip; Sinisterra\u2019s unusual behavior that afternoon; and the fact that Agent Fullerton had recognized that the packages in the van contained narcotics. Probable cause was thus clearly established. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>69 F.3d 27, 28 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>27 F.3d 126, 129-130 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>976 F.2d 929, 930 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Basulto, </em>898 F.2d 1011, 1013 (5th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Dovali-Avila, </em>895 F.2d 206, 207 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Because the officers had probable cause to believe that the van \u2014 which was in operational condition and was parked in the mall parking lot which was open to the public (at least those shopping at the mall) though not publicly owned \u2014 contained narcotics, they were legally authorized to search it without a warrant, even if the circumstances were not exigent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court hence erred in granting the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting Sinisterra\u2019s motion to suppress is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-14\">. A motions panel of this court denied Sinistcr- . ra\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the Government had not timely complied with the interlocutory appeal certificate rcquirc-ments of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We agree with the decision of the motions panel as well as with its admonitions to the Government in regard to the certificate requirements of \u00a7 3731.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\">. In its oral ruling on the motion to suppress, the district court stated \u201cthat is not an [sic] in dispute here, whether or not the contraband [in the van] was in plain view provides a basis for the arrest of the defendant. And the answer, I believe, is, yes, that that would provide a basis for the arrest of the defendant\u201d; and, \u2018\u2018[t]hc whole basis of this defendant\u2019s arrest centers, it seems to me, on the probable cause to arrest, which obviously, in my opinion, existed\u201d; and, \u201d[s]o, the evidence ... does not suggest that any exigent circumstances existed.... the fact that the vehicle itself was seized and was taken to the police lot gives rise to the fact that there was no exigent circumstance, because, in my view, the police had a valid basis for seizing the vehicle and holding it\"; further \"I think there was probable cause for the arrest, I think there was probable cause for seizures [sic] of the vehicle based upon what they saw and believed to be in the vehicle\u201d; and finally \"[t]hcy seized the vehicle, which I think they were totally entitled to do, they did not have the right to search it. They were seeking a search warrant, they should have gotten it, that's all.\" In its written order granting the suppression motion, the court recites that the motion was \"granted based on its [the court\u2019s] findings and statements in the record and those stated here.\u201d The written order further states that \"the police officers had probable cause for a detention and arrest and possibly a seizure of the vehicle.\u201d It is entirely plain that the district court found that the officers had probable cause to believe that the van (when it was seized and searched) contained narcotics and that <em>that </em>\u2014 plus the defendant's association with the van \u2014 is what constituted probable cause to arrest the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-11\">. The district court also distinguished the result in <em>McBee, </em>where suppression was denied, on the basis that there \"the vehicle was parked on a public street\u201d, while here \"unlike <em>McBee, </em>the vehicle was not on the public street but on private property\". The district court recognized that the mall parking lot, where the van was seized, was open to the public, but felt it was significant that the parking lot was privately owned. The Government urged that the parking lot was a \"public area\u201d. The district court responded \"sure. Anything outside the [mall] building is public, but that\u2019s private property\u201d and not \"the public streets\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">. Sinisterra docs not suggest that the duffle bags should not have been searched incident to the search of the van. <em>See California v. Acevedo, </em>500 U.S. 565, 580, 111 S.Ct. 1982, 1991, 114 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991) (containers in an automobile may be searched if there is probable cause to believe that they contain contraband).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\">. Nothing in <em>Carney </em>indicates that the parking \"lot\u201d there was publicly owned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AfsG\">.Because of our holding in this respect, we do not determine whether suppression should have been denied cither on the inevitable discovery doctrine or on the theory that the officers acted on the reasonable, good faith belief that a warrant was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
