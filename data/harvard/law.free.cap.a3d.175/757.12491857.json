However, in both of those cases, charter schools initially challenged a local school board's proposed annual funding allocation in an administrative adjudicatory proceeding before the State Board of Education (\"the State Board\"), and the dispute came before the courts only when one of the parties subsequently filed a petition for judicial review of the State Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In contrast, the Petitioners in the instant case, thirteen operators of charter schools in Baltimore City (the \"Charter School Operators\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sought to obtain relief in a similar commensurate funding dispute by filing breach of contract complaints against the Respondent, the Baltimore\n   City Board of School Commissioners (the \"City Board\"), directly in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City without first seeking review before the State Board. The contracts at issue all contained a provision in which the City Board agreed to \"allocate Commensurate\n   Funding to the [Charter] School Operator,\" and to provide information as to its own finances and how it had reached a specific per-pupil commensurate funding figure for the charter school. The Charter School Operators contended that the City Board breached those contractual requirements by not providing information as to its finances and commensurate funding calculations and by failing to provide the correct amount of commensurate funding for the 2015-16 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the cases were consolidated before the circuit court, the City Board moved to dismiss the case or stay the proceedings on the grounds that the State Board had primary jurisdiction over commensurate funding determinations. After holding a hearing, Judge Julie Rubin concluded that the State Board had \"provided sufficient guidance\" regarding the meaning of commensurate funding so that the circuit court was \"no longer obliged to punt the issue to the expertise of the administrative body.\" Therefore, she declined to invoke the primary jurisdiction doctrine and denied the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the same day as it filed its motion to dismiss before the circuit court, the City Board filed a petition for declaratory relief before the State Board, requesting that the State Board declare that its funding formula complies with ED \u00a7 9-109 and has resulted in commensurate funding. After Judge Rubin's order, the State Board dismissed the petition, noting that the circuit court had \"asserted its jurisdiction.\" Thereafter, the City Board filed a counterclaim against the Charter School Operators before the circuit court. The Charter School Operators moved to dismiss the counterclaim, and a hearing on their motion to dismiss was scheduled before the circuit court. At that hearing, Judge Alfred Nance questioned counsel as to the procedural background of the case, instructing them to \"[t]ell me what happened that causes you to rightfully be in my courtroom.\" After a brief recess and off-the-record discussion in chambers, counsel for the City Board made an oral motion to dismiss the Charter School Operators' complaints. Judge Nance, after hearing arguments for and against the motion, determined that \"in lieu of\" granting the motion he\n   would issue an order staying proceedings in the circuit court \"pending administrative review of the parties' dispute by the State Board of Education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the Stay Order ruling, the parties moved to proceed on separate procedural tracks. The Charter School Operators appealed from the circuit court's Stay Order to the Court of Special Appeals, while the City Board once again filed a petition for declaratory relief before the State Board. The State Board once again dismissed the City Board's petition, stating that \"the case remain[ed] within the jurisdictional purview of the courts.\" Subsequently, in a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed the Charter School Operators' appeal after concluding that the circuit court's Stay Order was not an appealable order.\n   <em>\n    Monarch Acad.

The Charter School Operators further assert that the State Board does not have primary jurisdiction over their breach of contract claims, and therefore the circuit court erred in entering the Stay Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When a court determines that a party's claim is within the authority of an administrative agency under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, it is ordinarily entirely appropriate under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to enter a stay to permit that party to bring his or her claim before the appropriate agency. Then, after the agency has had the opportunity to evaluate and rule on the claim, a party may ordinarily seek judicial review before the circuit court. In this appeal, however, we are confronted with a rare and unique set of circumstances in\n   which there is a strong likelihood that the Charter School Operators would not be able to obtain an administrative ruling on their breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Here, the State Board is the only agency to which the Charter School Operators can bring their claim at the juncture at which the Stay Order was entered, and they can only do so in the form of a petition for declaratory relief. However, the agency has twice denied petitions for declaratory relief in this case, citing in the first denial the lack of any factual record upon which it could review and issue a declaratory judgment. Despite the arguments raised by the City Board in this appeal, there is no guarantee that the State Board would grant a third petition for declaratory relief under the circumstances present here. The State Board's prior declaratory rulings and this Court's precedent set forth a detailed and highly fact specific inquiry for charter school funding disputes. Of great significance to our decision, the contract between parties\n   <strong>\n    requires\n   </strong>\n   certain financial information to be disclosed by the City Board to the Charter School Operators. However, the Charter School Operators allege that they did not receive that information. If true, the Charter School Operators simply may not have enough information to successfully frame a declaratory petition to the State Board, or to obtain a declaratory order from the State Board that fully resolves the charter school funding issues raised in their Complaint. And, although there is the potential for a limited discovery process before the State Board, it is discretionary and even if employed may not be sufficient to address this concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, the Stay Order was entered in a rushed and improper manner, before there was any opportunity for discovery as to the information necessary for the resolution of the charter school funding claims, and without clear guidance to the State Board as to exactly what issues needed to be resolved before the matter could resume before the circuit court. Thus, the rushed and non-specific Stay Order at issue here further exacerbated the difficulties facing the Charter School Operators in pursuing an administrative remedy and\n   eventually being able to return to court for a judicial resolution of their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Therefore, under the above-described unique circumstances of this case, we shall hold that the Stay Order was a final and appealable judgment and therefore shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing the appeal. We shall also hold that the circuit court abused its discretion in staying the proceeding in order for the parties to seek administrative review because the court did not first allow for discovery and did not provide guidance as to how and when the case would resume in circuit court. However, we shall also hold that the State Board\n   retains primary jurisdiction as to the underlying commensurate funding issues in dispute and that, after discovery before the circuit court is concluded, it will be appropriate for the circuit court to enter a more definite order staying proceedings for review of those issues before the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

The Charter School Operators maintained that per-pupil figure \"reflected an expectation that the State of Maryland ... would cut State funding to the System by approximately $35 million.\" However, the City Board ultimately adopted a budget for the 2015-16 school year that \"reflected the restoration of over $27 million in State funding and increases of $3 million dollars in City funding and $3 million from 'other revenue sources' as compared to the earlier projections.\" Nonetheless, the Charter School Operators\n   claimed that the City Board, \"without explanation, kept the charter school per pupil at the previously stated [$9387].\" That figure is, according to the Charter School Operators, 1.77% less than that provided for charter schools in the 2014-15 school year budget. At the same time, the Charter School Operators asserted that the City Board adopted a budget for traditional (non-charter) public schools that was roughly the same as provided in the 2014-15 school year budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Charter School Operators also claimed that the City Board had not met its contractual requirement to provide detailed information as to its finances and the basis of its calculations of the annual per-pupil commensurate funding allocation. Instead, the Charter School Operators alleged\n   that the City Board \"from year to year, arbitrarily presented charter school operators with take-it-or-leave-it charter school per pupil figures derived using varying (or no) calculation methodology, inflated estimates of overall System enrollment, and unsupported and dubious financial and budget figures.\" Specifically, they claimed that for the 2015-16 school year, the City Board provided only two single page documents in support of the $9387 \"Revised Per Pupil\" allocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    b. Initial Motions to Dismiss or Stay the Action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The City Board filed motions \"to dismiss, or in the alternative, motion to stay\" the complaints. In an accompanying memorandum, the City Board contended that \"at the heart\" of the Charter School Operators complaints were the alleged failure of the City Board to provide commensurate funding for charter school students as required under ED \u00a7 9-109. The City Board insisted that under the primary jurisdiction doctrine\n   the commensurate funding dispute is \"for the State Board to decide in the first instance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Charter School Operators opposed the City Board's motions, asserting that the circuit court, and not the State Board, \"has proper jurisdiction over this breach of contract action.\" They also noted that the relief they were seeking included \"monetary damages,\" which they contended was not available in a declaratory action before the State Board. In the alternative, the Charter School Operators insisted that \"[e]ven if the State Board had jurisdiction and [was] able to provide the [Charter School Operators] with relief,\" the State Board had already issued a \"comprehensive\" interpretation of commensurate funding under ED \u00a7 9-109, which was \"litigated through final affirmance by the Court of Appeals.\" Thus, they claimed that \" 'primary jurisdiction' has already been satisfied.\" Finally, they requested that even if the court determined that the commensurate funding dispute needed to first be resolved by the State Board, the court should permit the matter to proceed through the discovery phase of litigation in circuit court and merely stay any ruling on a motion for summary judgment or beginning a trial on the breach of contract claim pending the decision of the State Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On January 8, 2016, Judge Rubin held a hearing on the City Board's motion to dismiss, at which both parties offered extensive arguments as to whether the State Board had primary jurisdiction over the parties' dispute. The City Board argued that, although the case was a breach of contract action, the claim that the City Board did not provide funding for charter schools that was commensurate with funding provided to traditional public schools \"boils down to whether there has\n   been compliance with [ ED \u00a7 9-109 ].\" The City Board argued that, under this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   , ED \u00a7 9-109 was ambiguous and the State Board had the primary authority to interpret it. The City Board acknowledged that the State Board had previously set forth a working definition of commensurate funding and a formula for calculating that funding in the\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   declaratory rulings, but insisted that neither the State Board nor this Court has ever said \"that is the only\n   formula that can be used.\" The circuit court questioned the City Board's counsel on that point, resulting in the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Judge Rubin: So the question that really I think where the rubber meets the road in this instance is has the issue of commensurate funding already been determined and so to send it back [to the State Board] is not only unnecessary, but, arguably, inefficient and potentially unfair[.] ... [T]he flip side is that every single time a charter school takes issue or challenges that proper commensurate funding has been placed, at least the way I see the logical extension of your arguments is that ... the State Board of Education will always be entitled to make that a moving target.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   City Board Counsel: But that's what [the State Board has] said in their opinions. I agree with that. If they came out with-if the statute said this is what you need to do and here are the details or if [the State Board] came up with a regulation that said this is exactly how it needs to be done ... then I would say no[.] [B]ut in a situation where you have this guidance ...then I think the State Board of Education should weigh in on these issues and has to weigh in on these issues ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In response, the Charter School Operators argued that under some circumstances, a party may elect to proceed before the circuit court for its breach of contract claim even if that claim implicated provisions of the Education Article. Specifically, they contended that \"once the State Board has had the opportunity to have a crack at interpreting its statutes,\" parties may file a claim dependent on that interpretation\n   before the circuit court. And, they disputed the City Board's contention that the State Board would have discretion to depart from its previous interpretation and formula for calculating commensurate funding if the parties' dispute proceeded to adjudication before the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Charter School Operators also opposed the City Board's alternative request that the case be stayed. They pointed out that their claim that the City Board had breached its contractual obligations to provide information as to its budget and finances did not depend on the interpretation of a statute or regulations by the State Board and was \"squarely before only the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.\" They also argued that if the case proceeded before the State Board, discovery to obtain that information would be restricted compared to the discovery available in circuit court. The Charter School Operators therefore contended that even if the court found that the commensurate funding dispute was in the primary jurisdiction of the State Board, rather than grant a stay, the court should permit the case to proceed through discovery in the circuit court. Finally, they requested that if any issue in the case needed to go before the State Board, that the court issue \"very specific instructions as to what exactly the State Board would need to accomplish or could accomplish on any proceeding that would be appropriate,\" and also explain how to \"bring this [matter] back to [the circuit court] for actual resolution and remedies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   During the hearing, Judge Rubin noted that the City Board's reluctance to disclose the facts supporting the commensurate funding calculations left the Charter School Operators in a disadvantaged position considering the \"illusory\" nature of commensurate funding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Judge Rubin: [T]o the extent that the concept of commensurate funding or what it means in each charter school contract could be different from the next charter school contract because there are different things in play, as [City Board has] argued, on some level does this not raise an issue that in essence when the charter school contracts for, among other things,\n   its commensurate funding, that its entitlement to whatever commensurate funding is ... somewhat illusory? In other words, we'll tell you what it is once you complain that we haven't given it to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Judge Rubin thereafter issued a comprehensive oral ruling from the bench, in which she ultimately determined that the State Board had \"provided sufficient guidance\" regarding the meaning of commensurate funding, including the \"requisite factors to be considered, the data to be considered.\" She therefore concluded that the circuit court was \"no longer obliged to punt the issue to the expertise of the administrative body,\" but rather, it was entitled \"to decline to invoke primary jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, she denied the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    c. The City Board's Initial Petition for Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On November 9, 2015, the same day that the City Board filed its motions to dismiss the complaints in the circuit court, it also filed a petition with the State Board, requesting that the State Board declare that its funding formula complied with ED \u00a7 9-109 and resulted in commensurate funding. The Charter School Operators thereafter moved to dismiss the declaratory petition. After Judge Rubin denied the City Board's motions to dismiss before the circuit court, the State Board dismissed the City Board's petition for declaratory ruling. In a written order, the State Board noted that the circuit court had \"asserted its jurisdiction\" on the issue, and it did not serve the interests of conserving judicial (and quasi-judicial) resources to have parallel proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The State Board also addressed whether it should stay or dismiss the declaratory petition, and explained that the City Board had failed to present it with sufficient facts from which it could declare the law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Having reviewed the Petition,\n   <strong>\n    we find that it fails to present any facts concerning the funding formula that the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) actually used to fund the charter schools\n   </strong>\n   .... The Petition is, in essence, a request for an evidentiary hearing at which time BCPSS states that it will present the facts and the formula it used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A request for a declaratory judgment must present a \"justiciable controversy, rather than abstract, hypothetical, or contingent questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The Petition here presents no concrete facts from which we could declare the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Emphasis added). The Charter School Operators requested that the State Board compel the City Board to disclose its commensurate funding information. In a request for an appeal in front of the State Board, a party must provide \"a statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the appeal.\" COMAR 13A.01.05.02(A)(3). While an appellant may request to \"present\n   additional evidence on the issues in an appeal,\" the State Board must first deem the additional evidence as \"material\" and \"that there were good reasons for the failure to offer the evidence in the proceedings before the local board.\" COMAR 13A.01.05.04(C). After satisfying these factors, the State Board may, but is not required to: (a) \"[r]emand the appeal to the local board for the limited purpose of receiving the additional evidence,\" or (b) \"[r]eceive the additional evidence.\" COMAR 13A.01.05.04(C). Here, the Charter School Operators did not possess the \"additional evidence\" of commensurate funding information and thus did not have the ability to present \"additional evidence\" in its petition to the State Board. Adhering to the confines of COMAR, the State Board was unwilling, and statutorily unable, to conduct evidentiary hearings regarding the disputed commensurate funding information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    d. Further Proceedings Before the Circuit Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Subsequently, the City Board filed a counterclaim against the Charter School Operators before the circuit court. In the\n   counterclaim, the City Board contended that it had provided the Charter School Operators with administrative services whose value were significantly greater than 2% of the charter schools' commensurate funding allocation, and that the 2% cap on administrative services stated in the\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   declaratory rulings should only apply to mandatory functions \"that may only be performed by the central office of a local school system.\" The City Board therefore requested that the circuit court issue a declaratory ruling stating which services provided to charter schools were \"mandatory\" and subject to the 2% deduction. And, the City Board requested that either the value of the additional, non-mandatory services provided be counted as commensurate funding received from the City Board, or in the alternative, that the Charter School Operators be required to reimburse the City Board for the cost of those services to prevent unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Charter School Operators moved to dismiss the City Board's counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 18, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing on the Charter School Operators' motion to dismiss. At that hearing, Judge Nance questioned counsel about the procedural history of the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   May I beg a question of both parties-or both sides, if you would, please? Tell me procedurally what happened in this case, procedurally in terms of what [the Charter School Operators] did before it got to being a litigation in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. ... My understanding is,\n   is that if there is a dispute, the dispute is raised with the local board. If there is a problem in the resolution by the local board there is an administrative process. That is the reason for my question. ...\n   <strong>\n    Tell me what happened\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    that causes you to rightfully be in my courtroom.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Emphasis added). Counsel for the City Board responded to the judge's question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   I wish I were in front of you I think in January we had a hearing on a motion to dismiss where we argued exactly what Your Honor is stating, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction that this case should be stayed in favor of the State Board ... making a determination of these issues and our motion was denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Counsel for the City Board also informed the judge that there had been an administrative proceeding pending before the State Board, but that it had been dismissed after Judge Rubin's order directing that the case proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Judge Nance thereafter took a brief recess during which he \"had an opportunity to review ... part of the matters procedurally in chambers.\" Upon returning to the bench, the judge noted that the City Board \"would like to make an oral motion at this time.\" The City Board then moved to dismiss \"on the basis that the appropriate tribunal or court or body to hear this matter is the State Board of Education.\" Citing\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   , counsel for the City Board stated that the \"case law is very clear that [the State Board] should be the first one to take up matters such as the ones that have been raised by the Plaintiff here relating to intricate, detailed, and important issues of public policy relating to education and educational funding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Counsel for the Charter School Operators responded that the claim raised in their complaints was for breach of contract, and the resolution of such disputes is for the courts and did not need to first be resolved by the State Board. He also argued that proceeding before the State Board would provide no remedy in the form of monetary damages. And, he argued that the issue of commensurate funding had already been\n   settled and affirmed by the courts, thus \"satisfying the requirements of primary jurisdiction of letting the administrative agency have a crack at setting out the interpretation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   At one point in the hearing, Judge Nance questioned counsel for the Charter School Operators as to what proceedings had taken place before the City Board. Counsel responded that the Charter School Operators had not sought a hearing or opinion from the City Board. Later in the hearing, Judge Nance stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   I want to make sure that\n   <strong>\n    this [c]ourt\n   </strong>\n   says specifically that it\n   <strong>\n    believes that [the Charter School Operators] have a duty to seek administrative review of a local [school] board and if not [then the State] Board\n   </strong>\n   as to that which is asserted and claimed by [the Charter School Operators] in this case for there to be an administrative review as to your claims before it comes to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Nance granted the Charter School Operators' motion to dismiss the City Board's counterclaims without prejudice. The judge also determined that, while granting the City Board's verbal motion to dismiss was not appropriate, \"in lieu of [the City Board's] motion to dismiss, this [c]ourt is granting an order to stay as to these matters pending administrative review and appeal.\" The following day, Judge Nance entered a written order to that effect, which in pertinent part ordered that the consolidated action was stayed \"pending administrative review of the parties' dispute by the State Board of Education\" (the \"Stay Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    e. The City Board's Second Petition for Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   After the Stay Order was issued, the City Board filed a second petition for declaratory ruling before the State Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Unlike in its initial petition for declaratory relief filed before the State Board, the City Board provided a partial explanation of its charter school funding formula for the 2015-16 school year. The City Board stated that the City School System's \"Total Operating Budget, for the 2015-16 school year was $1,322,461,846.\" The City Board explained that in calculating charter schools funding, it began by excluding numerous categories of funds from that figure, including: \"restricted funds,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   funds for debt servicing, adult education, retiree health benefits, pre-kindergarten,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"non-public education,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   contributions from the City School System's annual fund balance\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"non-state/local revenue,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   funding for\n   special education students, funding for students with limited English language proficiency (\"ESOL\" funds), and funding for specialized transportation services, primarily for special education students. The excluded funds amount to $572,978,187, or slightly over 43% of the City Board's total operating budget for the 2015-16 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The City Board stated that its total budget after \"adjusting\" for the restricted funds was $749,483,659. The City Board explained that it divided that figure by the\n   population of students enrolled in kindergarten through the twelfth grade in the City School System from the previous year, 78,631, to reach a per-pupil figure of $9532. The City Board explained that it then deducted 2% from that figure for central administrative costs, as permitted by prior State Board precedent. And, the City Board stated that it added an additional $46 to the per-pupil total as part of a \"negotiated adjustment,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   to reach a \"base cash charter per pupil allocation\" of $9387.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, the City Board then added to the $9387 proposed allocation the cost of various \"needs-based\" services that it provides \"in-kind\" to charter schools, which it valued at $3496, to reach a total figure of both cash and in-kind services of $12,883. It contended that figure was slightly higher than would have been reached under the approved State Board methodology, and thus was \"commensurate\" funding under\n   ED \u00a7 9-109 and State Board guidance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the City Board contended that its funding formula, including all of the exclusions and its insistence on providing certain services \"in-kind\" instead of as a cash allocation, was consistent with State Board precedent. Therefore, the City Board requested that the State Board declare that it had provided commensurate funding for the 2015-16 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   However, the City Board also asked that the State Board reconsider some of the guidance it had provided in the\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   declaratory rulings. Specifically, the City Board contended that the limitation that it can only deduct up to 2% of a charter school's funding allocation for the cost of central administrative services \"does not remotely cover the true cost of those services, resulting in an unfair subsidy for charter schools.\" The City Board therefore requested that the State Board entirely \"eliminate the 2% cap or lift it to cover the actual cost of all services\" that the City Board provides centrally. In the alternative, the City Board requested that if the State Board reaffirms the 2% cap, that it \"clarify that the 2% cap covers only a limited number of services and that City Schools can require reimbursement from charter schools for [additional services.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Charter School Operators filed a motion to dismiss the State Board's petition, contending that it was \"outside of the State Board's jurisdiction because it asks for extensive fact finding instead of interpretation of laws,\" and because they had appealed the circuit court's Stay Order to the Court of Special Appeals. In the State Board's order, the State Board considered the disposition of the \"ongoing dispute.\" The State\n   Board specifically referenced Judge Rubin's holding that \"the Circuit Court had proper jurisdiction\" when the circuit court denied the petition to dismiss\n   Charter School Operators' complaint. The State Board then stated that \"the Circuit Court case is stayed and that [the Charter School Operators] have appealed the stay to the Court of Special Appeals.\" As a result, the State Board held that the \"case remains pending in the judicial system\" and entered an order dismissing the petition \"because the case remains within the jurisdictional purview of the courts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    f. Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals stated that the Charter School Operators had presented a single issue before it on appeal, which it had rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Did the circuit court err in staying the proceedings pending administrative review on the ground that the State Board has primary jurisdiction over the issues raised in the complaint?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Monarch Acad.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314200,12489061\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/231/594/\">\n    231 Md.

However, the only procedural route available to the Charter School Operators at this juncture-filing a petition to the State Board for a declaratory ruling under COMAR 13A.01.05.02(D) -would not lead to a full resolution by the State Board of their breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Initially, the State Board may decline to issue a declaratory ruling for issues that do not involve public educational laws or its own regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 13A.01.05.02(D) (stating that a party may file a petition for declaratory ruling by the State Board only as to \"the interpretation of a public school law or regulation of the State Board that is material to an existing case or controversy.\"). Thus, the Charter School Operators will be unable to obtain a declaratory ruling as to the first part of their breach of contract claim, their allegation that the City Board failed to provide them with the budget and financial information specified in the Contract.

Here, it does appear that the Charter School Operators could file a petition with the State Board seeking a declaratory ruling as to a key issue underlying their breach of contract claim, namely, whether the City Board's proposed charter school funding allocation for the 2015-16 school year is commensurate funding under ED \u00a7 9-109 and State Board precedent. That petition would certainly present the State Board with the interpretation of a matter of State public educational law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   However, a declaratory ruling issued by the State Board, like any State agency declaratory ruling, generally is based solely \"on the facts set forth in the petition.\" SG \u00a7 10-305(b). Accordingly, even when a petition for declaratory ruling raises an issue involving the interpretation of a public educational law or State Board regulation material to an existing case or controversy, the petition must set forth sufficient facts to enable the State Board to declare the meaning of the law. In this case, the\n   State Board has already denied two similar petitions for a declaratory ruling filed by the City Board, stating that it was denying the first petition in part because it lacked \"concrete facts from which [it] could declare the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Since that denial, the City Board ultimately divulged some details of its funding formula for charter schools for the 2015-16 school year in its second petition for declaratory ruling filed before the State Board. But, that information is incomplete and one-sided, and may not be sufficient for the State Board to determine whether the City Board's proposed funding allocation is commensurate under the complex, multi-step formula and approach developed by the State Board. For instance, the City Board did not fully explain why certain funds were \"restricted\" and excluded from the calculation of commensurate funding. Nor did the City Board describe\n   which, if any, of the \"in-kind\" services that it was providing to charter schools instead of cash funding had been affirmatively requested by charter schools. And, the Charter School Operators note in their brief to this Court that they \"believe the City Board has not, as a factual matter, used correct, accurate numbers to perform the funding calculation.\" Thus, the Charter School Operators may still lack sufficient concrete facts and information about the City Board's finances and commensurate funding formula to successfully petition the State Board to declare whether the City Board's proposed funding allocation is commensurate funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The State Board does have a procedural option available to it to develop a more detailed factual record as to the City Board's finances and charter school funding formula. As counsel for the Charter School Operators and the City Board discussed in oral arguments before this Court, the State Board does not have dedicated administrative law judges (\"ALJs\"). However, the State Board\n   <strong>\n    can\n   </strong>\n   refer a case to the Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\") for a fact-finding hearing before an ALJ.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 13A.01.05.06(C) (providing that, in an appeal or declaratory ruling action before the State Board, \"[u]pon review of the record, the State Board\n   <strong>\n    may\n   </strong>\n   transfer the case to the Office of Administrative hearings for the scheduling of a hearing before an administrative law judge.\") (Emphasis added). But the decision of whether to transfer a case to the OAH is generally a discretionary matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as a recent State Board decision indicates, the State Board generally declines to transfer petitions for declaratory rulings to the OAH:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   The superintendent [of the Board of Education of Howard County], alleging a host of factual disputes, requests that this case be transferred to OAH.

Neither that regulation nor the statute giving the State Board authority to interpret the true intent and meaning of State education law,\n   [ED] \u00a7 2-205(e), envision that a declaratory ruling proceeding before this Board is one in which the underlying factual controversy between the parties was intended to be resolved....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    In re Bd. of Educ. of Howard Cty. v.

If the State Board referred the case to the OAH, the parties would have the opportunity to conduct limited discovery and a fact-finding hearing before an ALJ. COMAR 28.02.01.01\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (describing the rules of procedure for discovery and\n   hearings before an OAH administrative law judge).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ALJ designated by OAH could then proceed to make findings, conclusions of law and recommended rulings, which would be referred to the State Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 13A.01.05.07(E). The State Board would then need to make a final ruling based on those findings and recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 13A.01.05.09. Presumably, given the financial stakes for the parties, the losing party would then start an appeals process before the courts by filing a petition for judicial review of the State Board's decision before the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR 13A.01.05.11 (summarizing procedures for appealing final decision of State Board to the circuit court). If that appeals process was followed to its full extent, with additional appeals to the Court of Special Appeals and this Court-as occurred recently in\n   <em>\n    Frederick Classical\n   </em>\n   -the process could drag on for years before the Charter School Operators could obtain a final decision as to the appropriate commensurate funding for the 2015-16 school year, from which it could then move to reopen its breach of contract action. Therefore, under the persuasive authority stated in\n   <em>\n    Occidental Chemical Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060466\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/299/#p305\">\n    810 F.3d 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2016), the Stay Order would most likely place the Charter School Operators out of court for a protracted and indefinite period and is akin to a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In sum, we conclude that: appellate review of the Stay Order would not result in piecemeal appeals or undermine judicial efficiency; the Stay Order is unclear as to what issues need to be resolved by the State Board, and how and when the Charter School Operators would be able to resume proceedings in the circuit court; and there is a substantial likelihood that the Stay Order will result in the Charter\n   School Operators being effectively out of court for a prolonged and indefinite\n   period.

For the following reasons, we conclude that the Stay Order was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Judge Nance interrupted counsel during the motions hearing as to the counterclaims filed by the City Board to raise\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the issue of whether the Charter School Operators' complaints were properly before the circuit court, instructing counsel to \"[t]ell me what happened that causes you to rightfully be in my courtroom.\" Then, after a brief recess, Judge Nance invited the City Board's counsel to make an oral motion to dismiss the complaints. During subsequent oral arguments as to that motion to dismiss, the City Board argued that the issue of commensurate funding must be referred to the State Board under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Judge Nance seems to have agreed with the City Board, stating \"[the Charter School Operators] have a duty to seek administrative review of a local [school] board and if not [then the State] Board.\" Ultimately, Judge Nance entered the Stay Order \"in lieu of\" granting the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Initially, contrary to Judge Nance's statements, the Charter School Operators were not required to seek administrative review before the City Board or State Board prior to filing their breach of contract action before the circuit court, and appear to have had a good reason for not doing so. The Charter School Operators allege that they could not have appealed to the City Board the proposed charter school funding allocation for the 2015-16 school year that they received from the Baltimore School System staff. If we assume that the Charter Operators are correct, without deciding that issue, then the only available path to bring their dispute before the\n   State Board would be to file a petition for declaratory review before the State Board. However, there is no statutory or regulatory basis for the State Board to award damages in a declaratory ruling. COMAR 13A.01.05.05\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as the Charter School Operators correctly point out, prior declaratory rulings in which the State Board decided that local school boards failed to provide commensurate funding to charter schools resulted in those charter schools not receiving reimbursement from their local school boards. Thus, the Charter School Operators logically decided to instead first bring a breach of contract action in circuit court, which would permit them to potentially recover monetary damages from the City Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Moreover, as to primary jurisdiction, Judge Rubin had previously issued a ruling denying the City Board's first motion to dismiss the complaints on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The parties' extensively briefed the issue of primary jurisdiction in written motions and memoranda for that motion to dismiss, and Judge Rubin held a hearing in which she heard extensive oral arguments from counsel regarding whether the commensurate funding issue must be first decided by the State Board. Judge Rubin denied the motion, based in part on her finding that the State Board had provided sufficient guidance as to how to determine whether a charter school was receiving commensurate funding that the issue did not need to be brought first before the State Board under primary jurisdiction. Although counsel for the City Board informed Judge Nance of the prior ruling by Judge Rubin, there is no clear indication in the record that Judge Nance reviewed that ruling prior to issuing the Stay Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   A circuit court judge is not necessarily bound to respect an earlier legal ruling in a given case made by a fellow circuit court judge in the same way that a circuit court judge must respect a legal ruling in a given case by an appellate court under the doctrine of the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elec.

However, it is concerning for a trial judge to effectively reverse a prior ruling made by another judge of the same court in the same case without even acknowledging that he is doing so, and without any indication in the record that he had reviewed and considered the earlier decision of his colleague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The reversal in this case is particularly concerning because important arguments were raised during the course of proceedings on the first motion to dismiss the complaints before Judge Rubin. Specifically, the Charter School Operators argued against the imposition of an immediate stay in both their written response to the City Board's first motion to dismiss and during oral arguments as to that motion before Judge Rubin. They contended that if the circuit court felt that the case must first proceed before the State Board under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the court should allow the case to proceed through discovery before the circuit court. And, during oral arguments before Judge Rubin, they argued that if a stay was issued the court should provide \"very specific instructions as to what exactly the State Board would need to accomplish or could accomplish on any proceeding that would be appropriate,\" and also explain how to \"bring this [matter] back to [the circuit court] for actual resolution and remedies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   However, unlike in the first motion to dismiss, the City Board did not request a stay as an alternative to a dismissal in the oral motion to dismiss before Judge Nance. Instead, Judge\n   Nance ordered that the circuit court proceedings be stayed\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   at the very end of the hearing \"in lieu of\" granting the motion to dismiss. Thus, during the hearing before Judge Nance, the Charter School Operators had no reason to offer, and did not offer, similar arguments against an immediate stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Despite the arguments raised before Judge Rubin that a stay order needed detailed instructions, the Stay Order did not clearly state which issues needed to be resolved before the State Board and how the Charter School Operators could bring the case back and resume proceedings before\n   the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the Stay Order immediately stayed all proceedings before the circuit court, thereby precluding the Charter School Operators from conducting any further discovery before the circuit court. As noted above, without the opportunity to conduct additional discovery as to the City Board's finances and funding formula, the Charter School Operators may be unable to successfully bring any of the issues in their case before the State Board through the only procedural mechanism available to them at this juncture, a petition for declaratory ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In summary, the Stay Order reversed the prior decision of Judge Rubin without any indication that Judge Nance had reviewed the earlier proceedings and decision before Judge Rubin. And, during the proceedings before Judge Rubin, the Charter School Operators raised cogent arguments against a stay, pointing out the importance of conducting discovery in circuit court in order to be able to successfully take the case before the State Board, as well as the need for clear instructions as to which issues needed to be resolved by the State Board. However, Judge Nance imposed the Stay Order\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , and there is no indication that he was aware of or\n   addressed the concerns regarding the open-ended and unclear stay. For these reasons, we hold that Judge Nance's decision to impose the Stay Order was an abuse of discretion, and we shall vacate the Stay Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Our holding today does not suggest that in every instance where a party files an action in circuit court that could also have been brought before an administrative agency, that party is entitled to discovery in circuit court before a stay may be issued under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Instead, we hold only that discovery must be permitted to proceed before the circuit court under the unique circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Here, the Charter School Operators have a Contract with the City Board, under which the City Board was required to provide the Charter School Operators with detailed information as to its finances and charter school funding formula. The Charter School Operators, however, allege that the City Board has failed to provide them with such information for the 2015-16 school year. And, in the absence of discovery as to the City Board's finances and charter school funding formula, the Charter School Operators may not be able to successfully bring any issue in the case before the State Board. Further, even if they were able to bring some or all of the issues in the case before the State Board, they may not be able to conduct any further discovery or fact-finding before the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   In many other situations, when a party does not have a contractual or other right to obtain information from a state agency, or when there is a clear administrative process available for a party to obtain an administrative ruling or resolution, it would likely be appropriate for a court to stay a case under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction prior to permitting the case to proceed to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

In its brief and at oral argument, the City Board attempted to distinguish the case on that point. However, in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   the election of either State Board review or arbitration was due to the contract the teachers had signed which provided for binding arbitration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059815\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/774/#p788\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059815\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/774/#p788\">\n    at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059815\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/774/#p788\">\n    506 A.2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present matter, the Contract between the parties has no binding arbitration clause, and the election of remedies is between State Board review and a breach of contract claim in circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In her ruling, Judge Rubin took the view that the history of declaratory rulings and adjudications issued by the State Board regarding charter school commensurate funding has effectively \"resolved\" the statutory interpretation issues for commensurate funding and provided courts with sufficient guidance for courts to resolve the issue. However, in\n   <em>\n    Frederick Classical\n   </em>\n   , we held that the State Board has not provided a formal rule for charter school commensurate funding, and instead has stuck solely to a case-by-case adjudicatory approach.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314610,12489996\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/330/\">\n    454 Md. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314610,12489996\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/330/\">\n    164 A.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). And, we held that the State Board could change its commensurate funding formula, although it would have to give a detailed reason for doing so that accounts for charter schools' reliance interests\n   and comports with the controlling statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314610,12489996\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/330/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314610,12489996\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/330/\">\n    at 411-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314610,12489996\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/454/330/\">\n    164 A.3d 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, we note that the City Board contends that there are several parts of its current funding formula that have not been previously ruled on or resolved by the State Board in earlier commensurate funding decisions. Therefore, following the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , the statutory interpretation issues have not been finally resolved through regulation, and the State Board should resolve the level of funding \"commensurate\" for the school year in question under the doctrine primary jurisdiction.\n   Judge Rubin, during the January 8, 2016 hearing on the City Board's motion to dismiss, stated \"that every single time a charter school takes issue or challenges that proper commensurate funding has been placed, ... the State Board of Education will always be entitled to make that a moving target.\" We agree with Judge Rubin's sentiment and note that the State Board still has not provided a clear rule defining \"commensurate funding\" even though it has been more than a decade since this Court's\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   decision. If the State Board were to issue clear regulations regarding commensurate funding, the possibility for disputes between charter schools and local school boards would diminish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Furthermore, although the Charter School Operators were at significant risk of being left in limbo and unable to return to the circuit court under the vague and open-ended Stay Order entered prior to the conclusion of discovery, the commensurate funding issue could easily be referred to the State Board without incurring that risk if the defects in the Stay Order were rectified. Thus, once discovery has concluded, or the circuit court determines that the Charter School Operators have obtained the financial and related information in discovery necessary to fairly present the commensurate funding dispute before the State Board, it would be appropriate to stay proceedings to permit the parties to obtain a declaratory ruling from the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Charter School Operators cite to\n   <em>\n    Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners v.

This holding does not conflict with the present matter. Here, Charter School Operators filed their contractual claim in circuit court, the claim clearly identifies a contractual breach involving the Education Article, and interpretation of the Education Article is specifically granted to the State Board via the General Assembly. After the State Board has made a determination on the interpretation of commensurate funding in ED \u00a7 9-109, assuming there is an appeal, the circuit court will have an opportunity to review the State Board's decision. As such, neither of these cases bolster Charter School Operators' argument that primary jurisdiction should not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   In conclusion, we find the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   compelling as applied to the present matter and see no reason to apply the analysis of any other cases cited by the parties as to primary jurisdiction. In applying\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   to the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the matter should be stayed to permit the State Board to decide whether the City Board's proposed per-pupil funding allocation to charter school for the 2015-16 school year was commensurate funding. Therefore, the circuit court should order the State Board to make a final ruling on commensurate funding pursuant to its primary jurisdiction as we explain in more detail in the conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In summary, under the unique circumstances of this case, and in particular the likelihood that the Stay Order would put the Charter School Operators entirely out of court without a clear path forward to obtain an agency or judicial resolution of their breach of contract claims, we hold that the Stay Order was a final and appealable judgment because the factual disposition of this case fulfills the high standard necessary for a stay order to be final and appealable. Therefore we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing the appeal. Additionally, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion in staying the breach of contract proceedings when no factual record had yet been developed through discovery that would enable the State Board to resolve that issue, and without providing guidance to the parties as to how and when the case could resume before the court. Lastly, we hold that the State Board has primary jurisdiction as whether the City\n   Board's proposed per-pupil funding allocation to charter school for the 2015-16 school year was commensurate funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Therefore, we direct a remand to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for the parties to complete discovery. Discovery should proceed so that the Charter School Operators may receive more information and, either when the circuit court decides it has the information it needs or discovery ends, a more detailed stay order would be appropriate. Following the new stay order, Charter School Operators could file a declaratory petition with the State Board within a reasonable period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc. v.

Unlike the Majority, I would conclude that the stay order is not appealable because it is neither a final judgment nor an order appealable under the collateral order doctrine. As such, I would have affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Before explaining my reasons, it is helpful to set forth some of the relevant factual and procedural background of the case, as well as relevant law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   This case arises from complaints filed in the circuit court by various charter schools in Baltimore City (\"the Charter Schools\"), Petitioners, against the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners (\"the City Board\"), Respondent, alleging that the City Board breached contracts by failing to provide funding to the Charter Schools that was commensurate with the amount disbursed to other public schools and by failing to provide budget and financial information. Among other things, in the complaints, the Charter Schools alleged that the City Board had \"never provided 'commensurate funding' \" as required by Md. Code Ann., Educ. (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\"ED\") \u00a7 9-109, and had instead, \"from year to year, arbitrarily presented charter school operators with take-it-or-leave-it charter school per pupil figures derived\n   from using varying (or no) calculation methodology, inflated estimates of overall System enrollment, and unsupported and dubious financial and budget figures.\" And, according to the Charter Schools, the City Board had \"failed to apply the per pupil calculation methodology put forth by the [ ] State Board [ ] and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\" In addition, the Charter Schools alleged that the City Board had \"unilaterally changed [its] methodology in developing the amount to be disbursed to charter schools.\" The cases were later consolidated.\n   The City Board filed motions to dismiss, or in the alternative, to stay and memoranda in support, contending that the complaints should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for lack of primary jurisdiction. Alternatively, the City Board sought to stay the cases \"pending a ruling\" from the State Board. Specifically, among other things, the City Board argued that the \"gravamen\" of the complaints-that the City Board failed to provide commensurate funding for charter school students-was \"a matter that should be decided\" in the first instance by the State Board, not the circuit court, pursuant to the primary jurisdiction doctrine. In the memoranda accompanying the motions, the City Board alleged that, on November 9, 2015, it filed with the State Board a petition for declaratory relief seeking a ruling that it has provided commensurate funding to the Charter Schools and \"that the funding formula has been properly applied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The Charter Schools filed oppositions to the motions to the dismiss or stay, contending that the circuit court, not the State Board, \"has proper jurisdiction over th[e] breach of contract action[s].\" As to the City Board's alternative request for a stay, the Charter Schools contended that the request should be denied because the City Board's petition to the State Board did not seek or implicate \"interpretation of the 'true intent and meaning' of education law[,]\" but rather sought \"to apply the education law, as already explained and interpreted, and incorporated into a contract, to a specific set of circumstances.\" Additionally, the Charter Schools argued that, because the\n   State Board was not required to issue a declaratory ruling, granting the motions to stay could result in the Charter Schools being \"left indefinitely without any result[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   On January 8, 2016, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motions to dismiss or stay, and, at the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court denied the motion to dismiss or stay, orally ruling from the bench. The circuit court determined that\n   <em>\n    Balt. City Bd. of Sch. Comm'rs v.

Specifically, the State Board determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   The arguments raised in the underlying dispute are not addressed herein. Rather, the issue here is whether the appeal should be stayed, dismissed, or proceed for review. Moreover, whether or not the [c]ircuit [c]ourt correctly ruled on the jurisdiction of the State Board is not an issue here. Even if the State Board has concurrent jurisdiction with the [c]ircuit [c]ourt over the issue raised, the [c]ircuit [c]ourt has already asserted its jurisdiction on the consolidated proceeding before it and has elected to move forward rather than impose a stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   One of the central tenets of the legal process is the conservation of judicial (and quasi-judicial) resources. As we\n   recognized when we stayed the State Board proceedings in [another case] while the corresponding court case proceed,\n   \"[i]nstituting a parallel and simultaneous proceeding here while the circuit court also hears this case would be contrary to that tenet.\" It is our view in this matter that it does not serve the interests of judicial economy to proceed further.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   (Last alteration in original). The State Board also noted that the petition for declaratory ruling \"fail[ed] to present any facts concerning the funding formula that [the City Board] actually used to fund the [C]harter [S]chools [,]\" and, thus, failed to present \"concrete facts from which [the State Board] could declare the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Also on February 23, 2016, the City Board filed counterclaims against the Charter Schools. On March 17, 2016, the Charter Schools filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims. On April 4, 2016, the City Board filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss the counterclaims. And, on April 13, 2016, the Charter Schools filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss the counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   On April 18, 2016, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss the counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the hearing, the circuit court asked whether an administrative proceeding was pending and requested that the parties tell the court \"what happened that causes you to rightfully be in [the] courtroom.\" The City Board's counsel responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   I wish I was in front of you several months ago. I think in January we had a hearing on a motion to dismiss where we argued exactly what Your honor is stating, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction that this case should be stayed in favor of the State Board [ ] making a determination of these issues and our motion was denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   After additional discussion about the procedural history of the case, the circuit court took a brief recess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   After the recess, the circuit court stated that it understood that the City Board wanted to make an oral motion. At that point, the City Board's counsel moved to dismiss the case \"on the basis that the appropriate tribunal or court or body to hear th[e] matter is the State Board [.]\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    City Neighbors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551733\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/400/324/\">\n    400 Md. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551733\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/400/324/\">\n    929 A.2d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the City Board's counsel argued that \"case law is very clear that [the State Board] should be the first one to take up matters such as the ones that have been raised by the\" Charter Schools \"relating to intricate, detailed, and important issues of public policy relating to education and educational funding[.]\" The Charter Schools' counsel responded that the claim raised in the complaint was for a breach of contract, and the resolution of such a claim is properly with the circuit court, not the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court granted the Charter Schools' motion to dismiss the counterclaims without prejudice. As to the City Board's oral motion to dismiss the complaints, the circuit court denied the motion to dismiss, but ruled that the case should be stayed \"pending the matter be[ing] administratively reviewed before it comes to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.\" Essentially, the circuit court found that the State Board had primary jurisdiction over the matter. The following day, April 19, 2016, the circuit court issued an order granting the motion to dismiss the counterclaims without prejudice, denying\n   the motion to dismiss the complaints without prejudice, and staying the consolidated case pending review by the State Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   On May 5, 2016, the Charter Schools noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals seeking review of the circuit court's stay order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 15, 2016, the Charter Schools filed in the\n   circuit court a motion to lift stay, and on August 2, 2016, the City Board filed an opposition to the motion to lift stay.

In other words, neither CJ \u00a7 12-303 nor Maryland Rule 2-602 is applicable in this case; as such, an examination of more detail as to whether the stay order constituted a final judgment or was appealable under the collateral order doctrine is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Under the final judgment rule, \"a final judgment exists only when the trial court intends an 'unqualified, final disposition of the matter of the controversy' that completely adjudicates all claims against all parties in the suit, and only when the trial court has followed certain procedural steps when entering a judgment in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    URS Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 452 Md.

Second, the issue of whether a court can lawfully impose such a condition on the government's power to acquire property by condemnation is clearly important. Many essential public projects begin with a taking of land and require various permits before completion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   Third, the question of whether the [c]ounty can be required to obtain the permit before having a trial is obviously distinct from the trial itself. ...

If the [c]ounty were to get the permit, it would take the property after a trial on value only, and the issue of whether the court could impose the condition would be moot on appeal. Meanwhile, the [c]ounty, having gone through an expensive and time-consuming permit process, would be in a position where it would be difficult to exercise its right to abandon the taking if it considered the jury award to be unreasonably high. Moreover, the [c]ounty would have to wait until it gets the permit to begin preparing the property for a landfill.

The order in this case assures that if the [c]ounty does get the permit, only then can it prepare the property as a landfill.

I would begin by examining whether the stay order\n   constitutes a final judgment, and would determine that it does not.

Indeed, the stay order does not decide and conclude the rights of the parties involved because it is not a ruling on or resolution of the merits of the breach of contract claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the stay order did not \"decide\" or \"conclude\" the rights of the parties vis-\u00e0 -vis the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Nevertheless, order does not need to resolve the merits of a case to constitute a final judgment where the order denies a party the means to prosecute or defend rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding and, thus, \"has the effect of putting the party out of court.\"\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    442 Md. at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    112 A.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). As stated, in determining whether an order has the effect of putting a party out of court, \"the key question is whether the order contemplates that the parties will no longer litigate their rights in that court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"413\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    112 A.3d at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Here, the very language of the circuit court's oral ruling and the stay order demonstrates that the stay order does not contemplate that the parties will no longer litigate their rights in the circuit court. In denying the City Board's motion to dismiss, the circuit court ruled that the case should be stayed \"pending the matter be[ing] administratively reviewed before it comes to the [c]ircuit [c]ourt.\" And, the stay order itself states, in pertinent part, \"that the above-captioned consolidated action, and all actions contained and consolidated therein, hereby are\n   <strong>\n    STAYED\n   </strong>\n   pending administrative review of the parties' dispute by the State Board[.]\" (Emphasis in original). Simply put, the stay order clearly contemplates that the parties will litigate their rights in the circuit court after the State Board conducts its administrative review. Stated otherwise, the stay order directs the parties to seek review first before the State Board concerning issues of commensurate\n   funding prior to litigating the breach of contract claim in the circuit court; notably, the stay order does not state or even contemplate that the parties are prohibited from litigation in the circuit court altogether. And, the stay order did not terminate the proceedings in the circuit court; rather, the stay order is in the nature of a postponement, not an order that has the effect of putting the Charter Schools out of court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"414\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    442 Md. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185186\" index=\"415\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/289/#p297\">\n    112 A.3d at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The order need only have the effect of terminating the proceedings in a particular court; the availability of another forum in which the parties may litigate their dispute is irrelevant to finality.\" (Citations omitted)). Moreover, the stay order does not send the Charter Schools to a different court and thus terminate the proceedings in the circuit court, but rather the stay order\n   places the case on hold pending review by the State Board of the statutory issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The Charter Schools' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the stay order is the equivalent of a dismissal, and, thus, constitutes a final judgment that is immediately appealable is not persuasive. Initially, I do not agree, as a general matter, that a dismissal and a stay are the same and that both are final and immediately appealable. To be sure, there may be circumstances where a stay order, perhaps indefinite in nature, can constitute a final judgment. For example, an order staying proceedings and compelling arbitration \"is immediately appealable as a final judgment even though it does not finally dispose of all claims in the action in which it was filed because the order has the effect of putting the parties out of court.\"\n   <em>\n    Schuele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688856\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/555/#p565\">\n    412 Md. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688856\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/412/555/#p565\">\n    989 A.2d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). But, as I would determine, the stay order in this case does not have the effect of putting the parties out of court and, as such, is distinct from an order dismissing a case, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699712\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/420/605/\">\n    420 Md. at 608-09, 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699712\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/420/605/\">\n    24 A.3d at 723, 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court was clear that the case involved an \"appeal from a judgment\" of a trial court in which the trial court had granted a motion to dismiss, ruling that the MIA had primary jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , administrative proceedings\n   needed to occur first.

That is exactly what happened in this case-the circuit court concluded that the State Board has primary jurisdiction and stayed the proceedings pending administrative review by the State Board. This is so even if the parties have not filed an administrative complaint at the time the stay is issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699712\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/420/605/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699712\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/420/605/\">\n    at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699712\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/420/605/\">\n    24 A.3d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e conclude that, although Carter did not file an administrative complaint, he was not foreclosed from filing the present judicial action, only that he could not pursue it to a conclusion at this time.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   That the State Board declined to weigh in on the commensurate funding issue while the case was pending in the circuit court and then the Court of Special Appeals is of no consequence because the State Board's reasoning is now inapplicable,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the court proceedings are on hold pending the State Board's administrative review. The State Board's order dismissing the City Board's second petition for declaratory ruling specifically explained that, \"because the case remains within the jurisdiction purview of the courts, the State Board declines to consider the Petition for Declaratory Ruling.\" Now that the court proceedings are stayed and the appellate process concluded by virtue of this opinion, the State Board can begin administrative proceedings upon the filing of an administrative\n   complaint, request for a declaratory ruling, or the like. Moreover, nothing in the record-aside from the Charter Schools' contention-indicates that the\n   State Board will unduly delay in deciding the commensurate funding issue once the issue is properly presented to it. As such, I would determine that the stay order does not put the Charter Schools out of court; rather, the stay order simply postpones resolution of the breach of contract claim pending guidance from the State Board on the commensurate funding issue, which will inform the circuit court's decision with respect to the breach of contract claim. In short, the stay order does not end the litigation on the merits. Under these circumstances, I would conclude that the stay order is not a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   I likewise would conclude that the stay order does not fulfill the requirements of the collateral order doctrine and is not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. As to whether the stay order conclusively determines the disputed question, I would conclude that the disputed question at the heart of the breach of contract claim-whether the City Board provided the Charter Schools with commensurate funding as required by ED \u00a7 9-109 -is not conclusively determined by the stay order. Indeed, the stay order did not comment on, let alone conclusively determine or resolve, the merits of the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Additionally, I would determine that the stay order does not resolve an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action. The issue of which entity has primary jurisdiction, the circuit court or the State Board, and, thus, which entity determines in the first instance the commensurate funding issue, is intrinsically tied to the merits of the case and whether the City Board provided the Charter Schools with commensurate funding in accord with the statute. As an initial matter, I note that I am not aware of any Maryland case discussing whether a determination of primary jurisdiction is an issue completely separate from the merits of the action. Thus, I turn to federal case law, and find instructive the approach stated by the United States Court of Appeal for the Tenth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crystal Clear Commc'ns, Inc. v.

In particular, the district court's decision whether to invoke primary jurisdiction required it to consider whether the issues of fact in the case: (1) are not within the conventional experience of judges; (2) require the exercise of administrative discretion; or (3) require uniformity and consistency in the regulation of the business entrusted to a particular agency. These issues are all highly dependent on the specific allegations in plaintiffs' complaint and required the district court to examine factual and legal issues underlying the dispute.

Once the State Board issues its decision in the case after proper request by the parties, there is absolutely no prohibition against the Charter Schools eventually obtaining review of the circuit court's decision to issue the stay order and its determination of primary jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

In other words, Schrodel did not involve issues of primary jurisdiction and a stay for administrative review of a legal issue. And, significantly, in\n   <em>\n    Schrodel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042610\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/202/#p213\">\n    320 Md. at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042610\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/202/#p213\">\n    577 A.2d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court\n   expressly acknowledged that \"a trial court's decision on a motion for a postponement, continuance, or stay is ordinarily not appealable.\" (Citation omitted). Moreover, importantly, in\n   <em>\n    Schrodel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042610\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/202/#p213\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042610\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/202/#p213\">\n    at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042610\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/202/#p213\">\n    577 A.2d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the order at issue was not simply a run-of-the-mill postponement or stay order; rather, it was an order that would essentially deprive the parties of a trial if the county failed to obtain the permit. That is obviously not the case here-the stay order does not put the parties out of court or otherwise deprive them of the ability to litigate the merits of the breach of contract claim after the State Board conducts its administrative review of the statutory issue concerning commensurate funding. In other words, the stay order in this case is more like a postponement of a trial, and not a deprivation altogether of the right to proceed with a trial. In sum, I would determine that the stay order is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Although I would conclude otherwise and do not endorse the Majority's holding, the Majority's language limiting the holding that the stay order is a final judgment and is appealable to \"the unique circumstances of this case\" is welcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 49, 175 A.3d at 786. The Majority states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   Generally, a stay order to permit a party to bring a claim before an administrative agency will only\n   <strong>\n    temporarily\n   </strong>\n   put a\n   party \"out of court\" and will carry with it the \"strong potential, bordering on certainty, that the issue at hand ... will be back for determination by the circuit court\" if either of the parties is dissatisfied with the agency's decision and seeks judicial review before the circuit court. However, under the unique circumstances of this case, the Stay Order issued by the circuit court was a final and appealable order that had the effect of putting the Charter School Operators entirely out of court with no clear procedural path they could follow to return to court within a reasonable period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Maj. Op. at 49, 175 A.3d at 786 (citation omitted) (emphasis and ellipsis in original). From my perspective, as a cautionary note, the significance of the Majority's limitation cannot be overstated. The Majority essentially counsels that trial courts and the Court of Special Appeals should not interpret this opinion to mean that stay orders in general or stay orders pertaining to matters other than those involving the unique circumstances of this case are final judgments and therefore appealable. In other words, nothing in the majority opinion's holding undermines the conclusion that stay orders in general are neither final judgments nor appealable under the collateral order doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Because I would conclude that the stay order in this case is not a final judgment and is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine, I would dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. And, because I would dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, I would not reach the issue of whether the State Board has primary jurisdiction. However, were I to reach that issue, I agree with the Majority that the State Board has primary jurisdiction over the underlying commensurate funding issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Thus, for the above reasons, respectfully, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Judge Greene and Judge Hotten have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Petitioners are the following Baltimore City charter school operators: Afya Baltimore, Inc., Baltimore International Academy Inc., Baltimore Montessori, Inc., City Neighbors Charter School, Inc., City Neighbors Hamilton, Inc., City Neighbors High School, Inc., Creative City Public Charter School Foundation, Inc., Empowerment Center, Inc., Experiential Environmental Education, Inc., Kipp Baltimore, Inc., Patterson Park Public Charter School, Inc., Southwest Baltimore Charter School, Inc., and Monarch Academy Baltimore Campus, Inc.
