After conviction and sentencing\n   in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for conspiracy to violate the Controlled Dangerous Substance laws, Leonard Simms (\"Mr. Simms\") appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before the Court of Special Appeals heard oral arguments, the State, in the trial court, nol prossed the charge underlying Mr. Simms' conviction and sentence. Subsequently, the State moved to dismiss the case pending before the Court of Special Appeals as moot. The Court of Special Appeals determined that the case was not moot and held that the State lacked the authority to nol pros a charge underlying a conviction and sentence. Ultimately, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court based on insufficient evidence. We review the issue of whether the State had the authority to enter a nol pros of a charge that resulted in a conviction and sentence. We affirm the Court of Special Appeals, holding that because the State's authority to nol pros applies only to charges, the State may not use its nol pros authority to alter a final judgment, i.e. conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts, taken from the parties' agreed-upon statement of fact, have no\n   bearing on the procedural posture of this case and are included only for context. On February 9, 2015, Officer Rajcsok investigated a report of individuals who had not paid for hotel services after ejectment from the property. The officer found Mr. Simms, along with another suspect, in the vicinity of the hotel. The officer positively identified Mr. Simms and discovered what he believed to be heroin and cocaine among the items in close proximity to where Mr. Simms was found. Mr. Simms was arrested, and it was later discovered that Mr. Simms had ethylone, a Schedule I Controlled Dangerous Substance, on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State charged Mr. Simms on February 10, 2015, and a grand jury returned a seven-count indictment on March 13, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Simms filed a Motion to Suppress drugs, which the\n   Circuit Court denied on May 27, 2015. Thereafter, Mr. Simms pled not guilty on November 5, 2015 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, waived his right to a trial, and proceeded on a previously agreed-upon statement of facts. Before reading the statement of facts into the record, the State orally amended the seventh count of the indictment to possession with intent to distribute methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\"MDMA\"). At the conclusion of the proceeding, the trial judge found Mr. Simms guilty of the amended count seven on the basis that Mr. Simms had ethylone on his person at the time of arrest. At sentencing, the State nol prossed the remaining six charges. Subsequently, Mr. Simms noted a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While the conviction and sentence of Mr. Simms was pending on appeal, but before the deadline for briefing by the State in the Court of Special Appeals, the State entered a nol pros in the Circuit Court of count seven, the charge on which Mr. Simms was convicted. Subsequently, the State moved to dismiss the case pending in the Court of Special Appeals on the basis that the case was moot due to its abandonment of count seven. In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Simms v.

Because we hold that the State does not have authority to nol pros charges after the trial court has entered a\n   final judgment, we need not and do not reach the second question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court has never addressed directly the issue presented to us in this case. The State urges this Court to conclude that the State's Attorney has the authority to enter a nol pros, even after a final judgment based on its wide discretion to enter a nol pros. The State contends that this broad authority is derived from the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article V, \u00a7 3. The State also directs us to the absence of any limitation on the powers of the State to enter a nol pros on appeal in the language of Maryland Rule 4-247. The State maintains, therefore, that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the State could not enter a nol pros in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The legislature and the judiciary have both regarded the act of entering a nolle prosequi as an act inherently tied to charges against a criminal defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 1-101(k) (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2017 Supp.) (defining \"nolle prosequi\" as \"a formal entry on the record by the State that declares the State's intention not to prosecute a charge\"). We have defined entering a nolle prosequi \"as an official declaration by the State, announcing that it will not pursue the charges in a particular charging document.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Gilmer v.

We have previously described it as \"[t]he abandonment of the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

Md. Rule 4-247 provides the parameters for the State's authority to enter a nol pros:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) Disposition by nolle prosequi. The State's Attorney may terminate a prosecution on a charge and dismiss the charge by entering a nolle prosequi on the record in open court. The defendant need not be present in court when the nolle prosequi is entered, but if neither the defendant nor the defendant's attorney is present, the clerk shall send notice to the defendant, if the defendant's whereabouts are known, and to the defendant's attorney of record. Notice shall not be sent if either the defendant or the defendant's attorney was present in court when the nolle prosequi was entered. If notice is required, the clerk may send one notice that lists all of the charges that were dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (b) Effect of nolle prosequi. When a nolle prosequi has been entered on a charge, any conditions of pretrial release on that charge are terminated, and any bail bond posted for the defendant on that charge shall be released. The clerk shall take the action necessary to recall or revoke any outstanding warrant or detainer that could lead to the arrest or detention of the defendant because of that charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We recognize that the language of Rule 4-247 does not explicitly preclude the State from entering a nol pros on charges at the appellate stage or after final judgment has been reached. Indeed, the Rule is silent on when a charge can no longer be nol prossed. Importantly, Rule 4-247 presupposes the existence of charges that the State may cease prosecuting. For example, the language suggests that \"entering a nolle prosequi\" has the effect of \"terminat [ing] a prosecution on a charge.\" Rule 4-247(a) also states that \"[e]ntering a nolle prosequi\" results in \"dismiss[al of] the charge.\" Subsection (b) of the Rule again refers to a \"charge,\" supporting the relationship between nol prossing and charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When considering the effect of its entry for a defendant, a nol pros \"has the effect of a nonsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Calvert's Lessee v.

This case is not about exceptions to the State's authority, such as whether the State would have authority but for a violation of a defendant's rights, but rather this case concerns whether the State's nol pros authority continues after a defendant has received a final judgment.

Here, we deal with the authority of the State, not to withdraw a previously entered nol pros, but to enter a nol pros after the entry of a final judgment in a criminal case. Although the State urges that\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   is dispositive with respect to the State's authority to enter a nol pros on appeal, the difference in when the State entered the nol pros makes\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   inapposite in deciding the case before us. Moreover, the Assistant Attorney General entered a nol pros in\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   during oral argument in this Court by way of moving to dismiss the case because the State had filed a new information against the defendants, charging them with the same crimes. Prior to the entry of the nol pros,\n   the State had\n   not prosecuted the charges filed against the defendants, except to the extent that the trial court dismissed the indictments, creating the initial impetus for the appeal. The withdrawal of the nol pros and reinstatement of the indictments in\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   was the sole issue on appeal. To the contrary, in Mr. Simms' case, the State prosecuted the charges against Mr. Simms. Not only had the charges been prosecuted, but Mr. Simms was convicted and sentenced, and he appealed the conviction and sentence. The appeal initiated by Mr. Simms in the Court of Special Appeals related to the sufficiency of the evidence against him that resulted in his conviction, as well as whether the hearing judge's denial of a motion to suppress was in error. The nol pros only became an issue on appeal as a result of procedural maneuvering by the State while the appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   cited to\n   <em>\n    Friend\n   </em>\n   for support of its discussion regarding the appropriate procedural technique for nol prossing an appeal. In\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   we stated that \"it would seem that a nol pros of a case pending on appeal should normally be done in the appellate court in which the appeal is pending at the time.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1971077\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/293/162/#p171\">\n    293 Md. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20A.2d%2086\">\n    443 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 n.3 (1982). This observation, buried in a footnote, referred to nol prossing a pending\n   <em>\n    interlocutory\n   </em>\n   appeal, not nol prossing at the appellate stage on a charge underling a\n   <em>\n    final judgment\n   </em>\n   after conviction and sentencing.

Upon receiving final judgment, Mr. Simms chose to exercise his statutorily-granted right to appeal his conviction and sentence.

Rule 4-345(e)(1) (\"Upon a motion filed within 90 days after imposition of a sentence ... the court has revisory power over the sentence[.]\"). In the present case, the nol pros entered in the trial court as to the charge underlying the conviction and sentence was simply a nullity, \"improper\" and therefore \"ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2264304\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/175/352/\">\n    175 Md. at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20430\">\n    2 A.2d at 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the State was not attempting to nol pros charges but rather sought to erase a conviction and sentence, and in doing so attempted an end run around the appellate process. Succinctly, the State did not and does not have the authority to alter a final judgment under Rule 4-247.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The State has presented no justification for its assertion that it has the authority to enter a nolle prosequi of a charge underlying a conviction and sentence. It contends that because Rule 4-247 lacks a specific limitation, the State has authority to enter a nol pros at any point. The State explains that the only limitation on its authority to nol pros is when entry of a nol pros contravenes justice, and here, entry of the nol pros did not cause any injustice to Mr. Simms. According to the State, because Mr. Simms received efficient justice by his prompt release from prison as a result of the State's\n   decision to enter a nol pros, the exercise of its authority was proper. Furthermore, the State contends that this Court has yet to expressly deny the State this authority by pointing to\n   <em>\n    Friend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   . To be sure, we do so now and clarify in this case that the State does not have the authority to enter a nol pros of a charge that has resulted in a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Additionally, the State argues that Mr. Simms failed to object to the entry of the nol pros and that his lack of objection was, in effect, an agreement with the abandonment of the prosecution. First, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the nol\n   pros, making the nol pros ineffective, regardless of Mr. Simms' failure to object. Second, at no time did Mr. Simms waive his right to appeal, nor does the record demonstrate that Mr. Simms appreciated that failing to object meant that he could no longer pursue his appeal. The notion that the defendant ought to object to entry of a nol pros goes against the letter and the spirit of Rule 4-247(a) as the Rule does not even require the defendant's presence in court at the time of entry of a nol pros. Notwithstanding, we need not decide whether Mr. Simms needed to object to the State's action, or whether the lack of objection equates to an agreement by Mr. Simms, because the State lacked the authority to alter the final judgment against Mr. Simms via the State's nol pros authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We reject the State's suggestion that its power to nol pros may divest a criminal defendant of his or her right to appeal a final judgment. In this case, Mr. Simms' interest in the outcome of his appeal, specifically a determination of whether the trial court properly ruled on his suppression motion and whether there was sufficient evidence to convict him, were not controlled by the prosecuting attorneys. That the State has not yet re-charged Mr. Simms, or does not intend to charge\n   Mr. Simms with a different crime, does not alter Mr. Simms' right to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The State maintains that it should not be saddled with prosecuting meritless appeals. This contention again is unpersuasive. The State has several options on appeal, such as conceding error or by filing no arguments with the appellate court. The State ignores the fact that it was saddled with prosecuting a meritless appeal in this case because of a self-inflicted error in the trial court. The most important step for preventing the State from having to prosecute the appeal in this case would have been to have charged Mr. Simms with a crime supported by the evidence against him. In limiting the State's authority to enter a nol pros to the period prior to a final judgment, we do not mandate that the State, knowing there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction against a criminal defendant, must proceed in arguing in favor of that conviction on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In conclusion, we hold that, after a defendant has received a final judgment in the form of a conviction and sentencing, the State may not enter a nolle prosequi to alter the final judgment. Upon conviction and sentencing based upon an underlying charge, the underlying charge is no longer pending and the State's authority to enter a nol pros has ended. Final judgment terminates the case in the trial court. Mr. Simms was convicted and sentenced. Therefore, the State lacked the authority to nol pros in order to alter the final judgment or to eliminate the appellate process initiated by Mr. Simms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article V, \u00a7 3.
