The Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Maryland Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12-601, 12-613 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJ\") empowers this Court\n   to \"answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States...if the answer may be determinative of an issue in a pending litigation in the certifying court and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute of this State.\" CJ \u00a7 12-603.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The United States District Court for the District of Maryland has asked us to answer the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Would application of Georgia's interpretation of the pollution exclusion contained in the insurance policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company to the Salvation Army as excluding coverage for bodily injuries resulting from the ingestion of lead-based paint violate Maryland public policy?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We answer this question in the negative. For reasons to be explained, we hold that application of Georgia law concerning the pollution exclusion in the policy under the principle of\n   <em>\n    lex loci contractus\n   </em>\n   does not violate Maryland public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Quanta Brownlee, Jamal Brownlee, Shakeira Jones, Daquane\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones, and De'Aunttae Jones (collectively \"Appellants\") were exposed to lead-based paint at a property, owned by the Salvation Army, located at 1114 North Calvert Street in Baltimore City, Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1995, Appellants Quanta Brownlee and Jamal Brownlee resided at the property,\n   which contained deteriorated lead-based paint. Appellants sustained permanent brain damage and elevated blood lead levels as a result of the exposure to lead-based paint. In 2001, Shakeira Jones, Daquane Jones, and De'Aunttae Jones also resided at the property. Shakeira Jones, Daquane Jones, and De'Aunttae Jones also sustained\n   permanent brain damage and elevated blood lead levels as a result of the exposure to lead-based paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants named the Salvation Army as a defendant in their lead-based paint related tort claims in a complaint that is now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to alleging that there was no insurance available in connection with Appellants' claim, the Salvation Army asserted that it was immune from liability on charitable immunity grounds, unless and until Liberty Mutual indemnified it as responsible for Appellants' injuries and damages. The parties do not dispute that Liberty Mutual issued comprehensive general liability insurance policies (\"the Liberty Mutual insurance policies\") to the Salvation Army, or that these policies were purchased in Georgia, and were effective from October 1, 1993 until October 1, 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Notably, the policies do not include lead-based paint exclusion provisions, but the policies do include pollution exclusion provisions. The pollution exclusion provision is written as such:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (f) Pollution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) At or from any premises, site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by, or rented or loaned to any insured ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Complaint, Exhibit 4 at 82. \"Pollutants\" are defined in each of the Liberty Mutual insurance policies as \"any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemical or waste.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appellants seek affirmation from this Court that Liberty Mutual is obligated to indemnify the Salvation Army and defend against claims brought by the Appellants. Appellee\n   Liberty Mutual asserts that it is under no obligation to indemnify and defend Appellee Salvation Army because: (1) the Liberty Mutual insurance policies were formed in Georgia, thus implicating the legal principle of\n   <em>\n    lex loci contractus i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the law governing the contracts is the law of the place where the contract is formed, and (2) pursuant to Georgia law, the pollution exclusion provision in the insurance policies excluded coverage for bodily injuries resulting from exposure to lead-based paint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Supreme Court of Georgia has held that bodily injuries allegedly resulting from the ingestion of lead-based paint are within the pollution exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Georgia Farm Bureau of Mut.

To the contrary, Appellants contended in the federal district court that Maryland courts would not apply Georgia's interpretation of the pollution exclusion clause because it violates Maryland's public policy. The United States District Court for the District of Maryland asks us resolve which law applies, so that the federal court may decide the merits on Liberty Mutual's Motion to Dismiss. This Court must answer whether application of Georgia's decision in\n   <em>\n    Georgia Farm\n   </em>\n   violate Maryland's public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Lex Loci Contractus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is not in dispute that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    lex loci contractus\n   </em>\n   is applicable here. Both parties agree that\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    contractus\n   </em>\n   is the proper lens through which this Court should analyze their claims.

The General Assembly expressly indicated that insurers can exclude lead-based paint related claims from insurance policies. Thus, the General Assembly had the opportunity and means to consider lead-based paint related insurance issues. It then follows that if the\n   General Assembly considered the maximum of explicitly permitting insurers to exclude coverage of lead-based paint claims, it cannot be contrary to the State's public policy to exclude lead-based paint claims pursuant to a pollution exclusion clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   IN \u00a7 19-704(c) does not reference a duty for insurers to indemnify and defend lead-based paint claims through a pollution exclusion clause.

The General Assembly evidenced this policy through direct legislation banning lead-based paint in homes, allowing insurers to remove coverage for lead-based paint related claims, requiring homeowners to register properties that could be affected by lead-based paint, protecting tenants' financial interests who may be living in homes with lead-based paint, funding loan and grant programs to remove lead-based paint from homes, and establishing healthcare funds for victims of lead-based paint poisoning. Appellants are correct that the overarching public policy in Maryland affords protection for victims of childhood lead-based paint poisoning. However, Maryland's public policy approach focused on eradicating the source of lead-based paint and aiding victims' health care needs, if impacted. Georgia's decision holding that lead-based paint is a pollutant, is not at odds with Maryland's public policy where our General Assembly has not directly indicated otherwise, and the clear trend of Maryland's public policy is to remove lead-based paint in\n   homes and provide health care for victims.\n   <em>\n    Georgia Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782431\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/298/716/\">\n    298 Ga. at 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782431\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/298/716/\">\n    784 S.E.2d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.

Indeed, IN \u00a7 19-704(c) specifically provides that, with respect to certain properties-affected properties as that term is defined in IN \u00a7 19-701(b)-insurers may include within an insurance policy a lead hazard coverage exclusion.

Without qualification, the Majority writes: \"IN \u00a7 19-704(c) does not reference a duty for insurers to indemnify and defend lead-based paint claims through a pollution exclusion clause. It does not reference pollutants at all. Rather, it plainly states that insurers have the option to exclude coverage for lead-based paint related claims.\" Maj. Op. at 599, 175 A.3d at 709. With this admission, the majority opinion concedes that\n   IN \u00a7 19-704 offers no support for the proposition that it provides guidance with respect to public policy in Maryland concerning allowing pollutant exclusions in insurance policies to act as lead hazard coverage exclusions.

Op. at 600, 175 A.3d at 710. The majority opinion apparently reasons that there is a lack of strong public policy against pollutant exclusions being treated as lead hazard coverage exclusions because the General Assembly has not expressly addressed the issue of pollutant exclusions covering lead-based paint.

Laws 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ch. 11, H.B. 11). As recodified, IN \u00a7 19-704(c) provided, and continues to provide, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Exclusion of coverage\n   </em>\n   .-Notwithstanding subsection (g) of this section, whenever an authorized insurer issues or renews a policy for an affected property, the authorized insurer may include in the policy a lead hazard coverage exclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The history of IN \u00a7 19-704 demonstrates that the lead hazard coverage exclusion in Maryland preceded the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   . It is inaccurate to link the enactment of IN \u00a7 19-704 to\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   in any way. This Court issued\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   on November 6, 1995, after Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a) was enacted and became effective. However,\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   involved an insurance policy that was issued\n   on September 14, 1990;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a) would not have applied to the policy at issue in that case. And, in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   , this Court did not discuss or mention Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a) or the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol, 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a) was recodified in 1996 as IN \u00a7 19-704(c) without substantive change. As stated,\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1995. In recodifying Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol, 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a) in 1996, the General Assembly would have been aware of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   , and could have made changes to the lead hazard coverage exclusion to enlarge it to encompass pollutant exclusions generally, but the General Assembly did not do this. It is clear that the strong public policy in Maryland is that a lead-based paint exclusion must be unambiguous. Undoubtedly, one of the purposes of IN \u00a7 19-704(c) and its predecessor is plainly to prevent insureds from signing insurance policies and being unaware that coverage for injuries caused by lead-based paint is excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Ultimately, in Maryland, there is a strong public policy of protecting children from injuries caused by lead-based paint and of requiring that lead-based paint exclusions in insurance policies be clear and unambiguous. This is evident from statutes enacted by the General Assembly. For example, in Md. Code Ann., Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev. (2005-06) \u00a7 4-702, part of the subtitle governing the lead hazard reduction grant program and lead hazard reduction loan program, the General Assembly specifically made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   The General Assembly finds that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (1) lead paint is present in a large percentage of residential properties in the State, particularly residential rental properties constructed before 1950;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (2) lead paint on the friction surfaces of windows is a leading cause of lead poisoning ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (3) lead poisoning harms the health and well-being of children and pregnant women and causes substantial long-\n   term public costs for medical expenses and additional education; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (4) reduction or elimination of lead in the environment will reduce:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (i) the risk of lead poisoning of children and pregnant women;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (ii) the incidence of learning disabilities and behavioral problems in children who live in older housing; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (iii) the cost of publicly financed medical care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   I would conclude that there is an equally strong public policy in Maryland, as demonstrated by Md. Code (1994 Repl. Vol., 1995 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 735(a), and its recodification without substantive change to IN \u00a7 19-704(c) after this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   , that for an insurance policy exclusion from coverage of injuries caused by lead-based paint to be valid, the exclusion must be explicit and unambiguous. Stated otherwise, in my view, IN \u00a7 19-704(c), its predecessor, and the existence of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   inescapably lead to the conclusion that a lead-based paint exclusion in an insurance policy must be expressly and unambiguously identified, either through a lead hazard coverage exclusion of the type authorized by IN \u00a7 19-704(c) or through some other exclusion, which expressly includes lead-based paint for purposes of the exclusion. Respectfully, the Majority's conclusion that, under Georgia case law, an insurance contract with a pollution exclusion is enforceable as a lead-based paint exclusion and that this does not violate Maryland's public policy is in direct contradiction with this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court answered the same certified question to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   I would determine that the pollutant exclusion in the Liberty Mutual insurance policy runs afoul of a strong Maryland public policy on its face by failing to specifically and unambiguously include lead-based paint as a \"pollutant\" covered in the pollutant exclusion. The definition of \"pollutant\" contained in the Liberty Mutual insurance policy-\"any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste\"-is\n   ambiguous and a reasonably prudent layperson both may and may not believe lead-based paint to be a \"pollutant\" based on the plain language of the pollutant exclusion contained in the Liberty Mutual insurance policy. And, notably, the Liberty Mutual pollutant exclusion contains environmental law terms of art such as \"discharge,\" \"dispersal,\" \"seepage,\" \"migration, \"release\", and \"escape,\" which, as this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031221\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/503/\">\n    340 Md. at 515-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2031221\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/340/503/\">\n    667 A.2d at 622-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , supports the conclusion that the insurance industry intended pollutant exclusions to apply only to environmental pollution damage, and not necessarily to the lawful use of products in the home, and that a reasonably prudent layperson could \"interpret the term[ ] 'pollution' ... as\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   encompassing lead paint, a product used legally and intentionally.\" (Emphasis in original). I would conclude that the public policy exception to the principle of\n   <em>\n    lex loci contractus\n   </em>\n   is applicable, and I would answer the certified question of law \"yes,\" and hold that it would violate Maryland public policy to apply Georgia case law, specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Ga. Farm\n   </em>\n   case, under the circumstances of this case because Maryland has both a strong public policy of protecting children from injuries caused by lead-based paint and of requiring exclusions for lead-based paint to be unambiguous to be valid.\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    These facts are adopted from the factual allegations set forth in Appellants' and Appellees' briefs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    In Appellants' brief, Daquane Jones' name is spelled inconsistently, sometimes being referenced as Dequane Jones.
