The court imposed concurrent sentences of life in prison for attempted murder, five years for illegal possession of a firearm, and twenty years for the remaining crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On appeal, Boston presents three questions, which we have reordered and slightly rephrased:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Did the trial court err by admitting into evidence a recording of a telephone conversation between Boston and his brother?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   II. Did the trial court err by admitting into evidence a gun seized during Boston's arrest?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   III. Did the trial court err by admitting into evidence a jacket that police saw at the crime scene but did not take into custody until days later?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We answer all three questions in the negative and shall affirm the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, the following facts were adduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At around 10:00 p.m. on November 29, 2014, three masked men burst into Steven Matthews's house in Catonsville and attacked him. The assailants kicked in Matthews's front door, pointed guns at him, and tied him up with an exercise band. They hit him with nearby objects and ransacked his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Five minutes after the three assailants entered, Boston entered the house as well. He was not wearing a mask, and Matthews recognized him from the neighborhood. Boston took some \"petty stuff,\" like video game consoles, and then approached Matthews, put a gun \"five inches\" from his head, and pulled the trigger. The gun did not fire. Boston turned to one of the other men, later identified as David Grant, and said: \"We got to kill [Matthews] because he seen my face.\" Grant, who was standing about six feet away from Matthews, fired his gun at Matthews. Although the bullet struck Matthews in the back of his head, Matthews managed to break free from the exercise band, get up, and go after Grant. As the two were \"tussling ... on the ground,\" Grant fired two more shots at Matthews's head. Matthews tried to protect his head with his hands, to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Grant got up from the ground, and the four men left with two televisions and the keys to Matthews's BMW X6. Still functional despite the attack, Matthews stayed on the floor, waiting for the assailants to leave. After \"a couple of minutes,\" he walked outside to get help from a neighbor. He saw Boston, Grant, and a third assailant inside his BMW, seemingly about to drive off. The fourth assailant left in the car the assailants originally arrived in. When Boston saw Matthews, he and the third assailant jumped out of the car and attacked him. The three ended up on the ground, fighting. Boston called for Grant, who got out of the car with a gun, got close to the fighting men, and shot Matthews in the back of his arm. Matthews kicked the gun out of Grant's hand, but it discharged\n   and the bullet struck the back of Matthews's leg. When Matthews attempted to get up to run away, Grant shot him in the back of the head. Boston, Grant, and the third assailant got back in Matthews's BMW and drove away.\n   Somehow, Matthews got himself to his next door neighbor's house, and the neighbor called 911. On the 911 tape, Matthews can be heard in the background telling his neighbor that Boston had attacked him. Matthews was taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery. Following the surgery, Matthews spoke with investigating officers and told them that Boston, along with three other men, had attacked him and burglarized his house. The officers showed Matthews a photograph of Boston and he confirmed that Boston was one of the attackers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 1, 2014, police located Boston in Baltimore City. They surveilled him as he and Grant and an unidentified woman entered a vehicle near the 3400 block of Round Road. The police followed the vehicle and eventually made a traffic stop during which Boston and Grant were arrested. The police recovered a \"Colt .45 caliber handgun\" from \"the front waistband of ... Boston's sweatpants.\" They also recovered a \".32 semi-automatic handgun\" from where Grant had been sitting in the vehicle immediately before being arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Recorded Telephone Conversation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the times relevant to this case, Jonte Lee, Boston's older brother, was incarcerated at the Baltimore County Detention Center (\"Detention Center\"). On November 30, 2014, the day after Matthews was attacked, Lee placed a telephone call from the Detention Center to his girlfriend. Before Lee started to speak, an automated recording announced: \"This call will be recorded and subject to monitoring at any time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Near the beginning of the conversation, Lee asked his girlfriend to call Boston toward the end of the call. After Lee and his girlfriend had talked for a while, Lee told her to try to call Boston. She then dialed Boston into the call. The pertinent portions of the recorded call with Boston on the line are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MR.

She argued that Boston \"did not waive his right to not be recorded\" and that the conversation did not specifically mention Matthews or the date on which the attack on Matthews\n   took\n   place and therefore was too vague to be admitted. Finally, she argued that the conversation was \"extremely prejudicial\" and that its prejudice outweighed its probative value. The trial court denied the motion. Later, the court granted defense counsel a continuing objection based on these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The trial proceeded and eventually the prosecutor sought to introduce the recorded conversation through Detective Matthew Barnes, the lead detective in the case. Defense counsel objected on the basis of relevance, and the court recognized her continuing objection. The court denied the motion. The prosecutor played for the jury the very beginning of the recorded call, in which the automated recording was played and Lee asked his girlfriend to add Boston to the call later, and the portion of the recorded call between Lee and Boston. Detective Barnes identified Boston's voice on the call.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On appeal, Boston argues that the recording of his telephone conversation with his brother was inadmissible as a matter of law because it was made in violation of the Maryland Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.),\n   \u00a7\u00a7 10-401\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\") (\"the Wiretap Act\"). He further argues that, in any event, the conversation was not sufficiently linked to the attack on Matthews to be relevant evidence and, if it was, any probative value it had was outweighed by the likelihood that it would cause unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Boston maintains that his telephone call with Lee was recorded in violation of the Wiretap Act because he did not consent to its being recorded. Specifically, he was added to the call after the warning that it was being recorded was played, so he did not know the call was being recorded and therefore could not have consented. The State responds that Boston failed to make an adequate showing that the recording was obtained in violation of the Wiretap Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \"Except as otherwise specifically provided in [the Wiretap Act] it is unlawful for any person to ...

There the defendant placed a recording device in the bathroom of his friend's family's house. After the\n   friend's aunt used the bathroom, took a shower, and dried herself off, she noticed an unfamiliar piece of equipment hidden in the bathroom. As she and the friend's father tried to figure out what it was, the device recorded their conversation. Ultimately, the defendant admitted placing the equipment to record sounds in the bathroom, but maintained that the interception of the conversation between the friend's aunt and his father was not willful, under the Wiretap Act, because he did not know that his conduct was prohibited by the Wiretap Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court reviewed the \"bewildering array\" of meanings given the word \"willful\" under federal and Maryland law, and ultimately concluded that the defendant need not have acted with knowledge that he was violating the Wiretap Act to have \"willfully intercepted\" the conversation in question. As relevant here, the Court held that for purposes of CJP sections 10-402(a) and 10-405, \"an interception that is not otherwise specifically authorized is done willfully if it is done intentionally-purposely.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672448\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/365/185/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672448\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/365/185/\">\n    at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"672448\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/365/185/\">\n    776 A.2d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At trial, the Commonwealth introduced recordings of telephone calls the defendant made from the jail where he was being held before trial. During some of the calls, the recipient, who had heard the automated announcement at the\n   outset of the call that the call was being recorded, passed the telephone to another person, who had not heard the announcement. In the portions of the calls with these third parties, the defendant made incriminating statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argued that those calls were recorded in violation of the Massachusetts wiretap act, as the people with whom he was speaking had not been informed that they were being recorded, did not otherwise know that that was the case, and therefore had not consented to being recorded. The court rejected this argument, explaining that there was no evidence \"that those responsible at the jail for recording calls had any knowledge that the initial recipient of the defendant's telephone call had passed the telephone to someone else and no evidence in any event that the jail had any power to prevent such an occurrence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684313\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/700/\">\n    452 Mass. at 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20N.E.2d%20574\">\n    897 N.E.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It concluded that the interception was not willful: \"As was true in\n   <em>\n    Ennis\n   </em>\n   , the absence of knowledge, power, and control on the jail's part signifies that the interception could not be deemed\n   willful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20N.E.2d%20574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The facts in\n   <em>\n    Ennis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyarsky\n   </em>\n   are similar to those in the case at bar, in that a third party was added to the call after the automated recording was played and apparently did not know that the call was being recorded.

In\n   <em>\n    Boyarsky\n   </em>\n   , there was no evidence that the correctional facility had a policy limiting calls to only the initial recipients. The parties here have not referenced any policy governing telephone calls placed by inmates at the Detention Center. We are aware, from our own research, that the\n   <em>\n    Baltimore County Department of Corrections Inmate Hand\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    book &amp; Rules\n   </em>\n   (2013-2014) (\"Handbook\"), which covers \"Telephone Privileges\" for inmates, makes telephone calls by inmates \"subject to recording and monitoring.\" Handbook at 11. The Handbook provides that calls by inmates are collect calls, and, if an intended recipient uses a carrier other than Verizon, the recipient must set up an account with ICSolutions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20N.E.2d%20574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The \"Telephone Privileges\" portion of the Handbook says nothing about three-way calls or adding a third person to a call, however.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We agree with the reasoning of the court in\n   <em>\n    Ennis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boyarsky\n   </em>\n   , and hold that although the Detention Center's recording of Lee's call to his girlfriend was an intentional, purposeful act,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   was willful, its recording of Boston's portion of the telephone conversation was not. A call by an inmate at the Detention Center commences with its placement to the party being called, at which point the inmate and the recipient of the call are notified that the call is being recorded and monitored. The call is between those two people and the intent to record is directed to them. Even in the absence of a policy prohibiting the later addition of a third participant to an inmate call, the Detention Center ordinarily would not be acting \"willfully\" by continuing to record the call once it came to include the third participant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In his abbreviated motion to suppress, Boston alleged only that his telephone conversation with his brother was recorded in violation of the Wiretap Act. He did not assert any constitutional or non-statutory violation. We conclude, therefore, that as the proponent of the motion it was Boston's burden to produce evidence to show that the Wiretap Act was violated and to\n   persuade the court to so rule. Unlike defense motions seeking the suppression of evidence obtained by a warrantless search, where, because the search is presumptively unconstitutional, and therefore the State bears the burden of production and persuasion,\n   <em>\n    see e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCain v.

Nor did he produce any evidence that, if any such monitoring takes place, telephone calls may be disconnected depending upon what the monitoring reveals. Just as the court in\n   <em>\n    Boyarsky\n   </em>\n   observed, without evidence of knowledge, power, and control on the part of the Detention Center, its recording of a conversation between an inmate and a person who was not the recipient of the inmate's call but was added to the call by the recipient is not willful. At most it would be inadvertent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, Boston sought to have his recorded telephone conversation with his brother excluded from evidence as having been obtained in violation of the Wiretap Act, but did not offer evidence that would support a finding that the Detention Center willfully intercepted that call.

Boston argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the inference that the words he spoke during his telephone conversation with Lee, about changing his contact information and leaving the area, showed consciousness of guilt of the crimes against Matthews. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In the telephone call, Boston suggested that he intended to leave the area and change his contact information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   [BOSTON]: (Indiscernible) might be out of town for a little bit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   MR.

Thus, Boston is describing a victim who was shot in the head several times and is still alive-a very particular and unusual set of events that matches what happened to Matthews. In addition, he and Lee discuss the fact that the victim is \"saying the name,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that he is telling the police who attacked him, which Matthews in fact was doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We conclude that the substance of the recorded telephone conversation was sufficient to show consciousness of guilt on Boston's part over the crimes against Matthews and therefore was relevant evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice[.]\" Md.

He was very specific about the guns that were described in this case and this .45 caliber is not one that was described. Introducing this gun is more prejudicial than probative in this case ... the State is trying to force Mr. Boston to get on the stand and say no, this gun wasn't used in this case, but it was used in another case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The prosecutor opposed the motion, arguing that Matthews would \"be absolutely clear about the fact that there was more than one gun used in the assault against him.\" She further argued that the gun was \"probative\" of whether Boston had attempted to shoot Matthews because he was in possession of a gun two days after the attack and \"in [the] company of a person [Grant] who [wa]s in possession of the gun that was used to shoot Steven Matthews.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Ultimately, the court denied the motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   I think it's relevant given the fact that the victim identified that there was more than one weapon.

He repeats the arguments he made below, namely that the gun \"was irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\" He maintains that the gun was irrelevant evidence because \"the State offered nothing more than sheer speculation that the gun that police found on Mr. Boston during his\n   arrest was a gun used during the home invasion and attack on Mr. Matthews.\" He argues that the gun and the evidence about it was substantially prejudicial because the jury could conclude that Boston \"was simply a man of questionable character[,]\" especially because he \"could not be expected to take the stand and explain why he was arrested with the gun, because an admission that the gun related to other, uncharged crimes, would still prejudice his defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \" '[P]hysical evidence need not be positively connected with the accused or the crime to be admissible; it is admissible where there is a reasonable probability of its connection with the accused or the crime[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Aiken v.

Also on the same day as the robbery, the victim told the police the gun had had a long barrel, was black with a brown handle, and possibly was a .38 caliber. At trial, however, the victim testified that the gun was silver with a brown handle. In upholding the trial court's decision to admit the gun into evidence, we stated that the evidence \"was sufficient to create a 'reasonable probability' that the gun was connected to the\" defendant, and that it was within the province of the jury to determine the weight to give that evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993364\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/202/70/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993364\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/202/70/\">\n    at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3993364\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/202/70/\">\n    30 A.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   We return to the instant case. Matthews testified at trial that Boston attempted to shoot him with \"a [ ]9 or a [.]45 chrome whatever it was.\" The .45 caliber handgun was recovered from Boston 36 hours after the attack, from the same vehicle and at the same time that the .32 caliber handgun Grant used to shoot Matthews was recovered. The fact that Matthews had provided an earlier inconsistent description of the precise caliber and color of the handgun did not make the .45 caliber handgun irrelevant to the case; the inconsistent\n   descriptions went to the weight of the evidence and were fodder for cross-examination.\n   As noted, under Rule 5-403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. A trial court exercises its discretion when it balances the \"probative value\" of the evidence against its potentially unfair prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , 447 Md. at 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265621\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/31/#p48\">\n    133 A.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Boston argues that the .45 caliber handgun was prejudicial evidence in that it could have led the jury to think he was of questionable character. The test is not whether prejudice exists, however. It is whether there is unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. The gun, which was partly described by Matthews at trial, was found on Boston not long after Matthews was attacked and was in the vicinity of other guns used against Matthews, was highly probative of Boston's involvement in the crimes against Matthews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Boston also argues that the gun was unfairly prejudicial because he had used it in another crime, but he could not explain that to the jury without harming his defense. He relies on\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657485\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/291/\">\n    393 Md. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657485\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/291/\">\n    901 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). There, shortly after an attempted murder, the defendant, who was riding his bike, was followed by a police officer. He pedaled away from the officer, but was caught minutes later with 86 vials of crack cocaine. At the defendant's trial for attempted murder, there was no evidence elicited about the crack cocaine, and the defendant did not testify, thus offering the jury no explanation for why he attempted to flee from the officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury that flight after the commission of a crime may be considered as evidence of guilt if the flight demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals held that this jury instruction was given in error because it was misleading. The jury did not know that the defendant had been in possession of a significant amount of crack cocaine and, thus, was unaware of a reasonable\n   justification for his flight that had nothing to do with the attempted murder. Nor could the jury be told of that fact without prejudicing the defendant. Accordingly, the \"circumstances of the case ... impaired the confidence with which the inference that [the defendant] fled from the police due to a consciousness of guilt with respect to the [attempted murder charges] could be drawn[.]\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657485\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657485\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/291/\">\n    at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657485\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/393/291/\">\n    901 A.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable. Because the defendant there had crack cocaine in his possession, it was clear that there was a reasonable justification for his flight from the police unconnected with the attempted murder. Here, Boston merely proffered that the gun was used in another criminal matter. There was no other evidence to support that and the trial court was not obligated to believe that proffer. The admission of the gun in evidence was not misleading in the way the flight instruction in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   had been. From the evidence presented, there still was a reasonable probability that the gun was connected to the crimes for which Boston was charged. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the probative value of the .45 caliber gun was not substantially outweighed by any potential unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Jacket\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In the early morning of November 30, 2014, only a few hours after the attack on Matthews, detectives with the Baltimore County Police Department executed a search warrant at Matthews's house. During the search, they discovered a black Calvin Klein jacket draped over a couch. There were three bags of marijuana in the\n   pocket of the jacket. The detectives confiscated the marijuana but left the jacket where it was because they thought it belonged to Matthews and \"did not know if it was actually of evidentiary value.\" When the search was finished, the detectives locked Matthews's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   On December 3, 2014, Matthews, who was still in the hospital, asked a family member to bring him a jacket from his house so he would have one to wear when he left the\n   hospital. The family member returned with the black Calvin Klein jacket. Matthews realized the jacket did not belong to him, so he called the detectives. They took the jacket and submitted it for DNA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Christina Tran, a forensic biologist for the Baltimore County Police Department, examined the jacket and detected amylase and acid phosphatase on the left cuff. Amylase is an enzyme found in high quantities of saliva and acid phosphatase is an enzyme found in high quantities of semen. Tran took a cutting from the left cuff of the jacket and sent the cutting to Bode Technology for DNA testing. The test results showed that the jacket contained a \"DNA profile consistent with a mixture of two individuals, including a major male contributor\" whose DNA profile matched Boston's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   At trial, the State sought to admit the jacket into evidence. Detective Eli Visnick testified that the jacket appeared to be the same one he had seen at Matthews's house during the search on November 30, 2014, and also the same one he had obtained from Matthews at the hospital on December 3, 2014, \"minus the markings from ... [the] Crime Lab and Forensic Unit.\" Matthews testified that pictures of the jacket taken at his house after the crimes showed the same jacket that his family member brought him from his house on December 3. Boston objected to the jacket's admission, arguing that the State did not establish a sufficient chain of custody to account for what could have happened to the jacket from November 30 to December 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The trial court initially reserved ruling, but later overruled Boston's objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   With respect to the ... jacket that I reserved on, the testimony with the condition of the jacket remains the ... same as when this detective first took possession of the jacket. There's no evidence of any tampering since that time so the objection is overruled and Exhibit 52 [the jacket] is admitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   On appeal, Boston contends the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the jacket because the State did not sufficiently\n   establish its chain of custody. Specifically, he asserts that the \"[p]olice did not take the jacket into evidence until four days after the home invasion. None of the State's witnesses could say with certainty who had access to the jacket or whether the jacket underwent any transformations before Mr. Matthews's relative brought it to the hospital.\" The State retorts that the trial court acted within its discretion by admitting the jacket because \"the State ... sufficiently demonstrated that there was not a reasonable probability that the jacket had been altered in the three days between November 30 ... and December 3.\" We agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   A proper chain of custody is established when \"there is a 'reasonable probability that no tampering occurred.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.
