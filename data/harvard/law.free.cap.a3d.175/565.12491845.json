He claims that the court\n   improperly concluded that he failed to prove that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing (1) to challenge the state's medical evidence by consulting and calling as a witness a medical expert with experience evaluating medical evidence in child sexual abuse cases, and (2) to present the testimony of John Strugar, a neurosurgeon, who performed back surgery on the petitioner in August, 1999. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This court's decision in the petitioner's direct appeal sets forth the following relevant facts, which the jury in the petitioner's criminal trial reasonably could have found, and procedural history. \"Between the spring of\n   1997 and mid-October, 1999, the victim\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her three younger sisters lived with their mother, who was the [petitioner's] girlfriend, her uncle and the [petitioner] at various residences in the city of New Haven. The victim was approximately eight years old when the [petitioner] began to abuse her. The [petitioner] beat her about once a week for a variety of reasons. In November, 1997, the [petitioner] knocked the victim to the floor, causing a spiral fracture of her left humerus. The victim was taken to a hospital, but her mother instructed her and her sisters to attribute the injury to the victim's having fallen off her bed. On another occasion, the [petitioner] banged the victim's head on a sink, breaking one of her teeth. When the victim told her mother of the broken tooth, her mother instructed her to go outside and play. The [petitioner] struck the victim with a wooden paddle and on one occasion gave her a black eye. The victim's mother put makeup on the bruise to cover it. The victim's teacher, however, noticed the makeup and bruise. At another time, the school personnel discovered a hickey on the victim's neck. The victim had told her mother that the [petitioner] had given her the hickey. The [petitioner] convinced her mother that someone else had given the victim a hickey and then beat the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Sometime between August and October, 1999, the [petitioner] placed the victim in a situation that was likely to injure her health. When the victim did not comply with the [petitioner's] instructions, he made her put her head out a window and then he poured water over her head. He made her stay there until it was time to go to school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"At night, the [petitioner] would awaken the victim and take her to his room where he told her to rub his\n   back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initially, the [petitioner] lay face down but would turn over and instruct the victim to rub his lower body. The [petitioner] took the victim's hand and placed it on his penis, at first outside of his boxer shorts and then inside. The [petitioner's] sexual abuse progressed beyond back-rubs and having the victim touch his penis. The [petitioner] began to grope the victim's vagina, buttocks, thighs and undeveloped chest. On three or four occasions, the [petitioner] forced his penis into the victim's vagina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the victim asked the [petitioner] to stop, he would tell her not to tell him what to do. The\n   victim bled after the first and second rapes and told her mother, who told her she was having her menstrual period. Although the victim reported the abuse to her grandfather, he refused to believe her. Consequently, the victim did not report the continuing abuse for fear that no one would believe her. The victim eventually disclosed the [petitioner's] sexual abuse to her cousin but implored her not to tell anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"In early 2001, the victim, her sisters and mother moved to a homeless shelter in Waterbury, after which the victim and her sisters were removed from their mother's custody by the department of children and families (department). The victim was placed in a foster home. While the victim and her foster mother were watching a television movie about sexual abuse, the victim ran from the room crying. Because the victim was so overcome with emotion, her foster mother waited until the next day to discuss the subject with her. During the conversation, the victim confided that\n   the [petitioner] had raped her and hurt her private parts. The foster mother reported the complaint to a department social worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Subsequently, the victim was interviewed by a forensic specialist, examined by a pediatric nurse practitioner [Judith Moskal-Kanz, who also served as a forensic medical examiner for child sexual abuse and child abuse] and interviewed by a detective, Michael Hunter. [Moskal-Kanz] found a furrow running through the victim's hymen, an injury consistent with penile penetration. Hunter also interviewed the [petitioner] and recorded his statement. According to the [petitioner], subsequent to his having back surgery, he slept in a hospital bed in the living room where he awoke one night to find the victim stroking his penis. The [petitioner] so informed the victim's mother, who beat the victim. One month later, the [petitioner] again awoke and found the victim fondling his penis. He again reported the incident to the victim's mother who administered 'a whupping.' In his statement, the [petitioner] acknowledged having spanked the victim but denied that he ever punched her, hit her, broke her arm or had sexual intercourse with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The [petitioner] was arrested and charged on December 5, 2002. The state filed a twelve count long form information. The theory of defense was that the victim lied about the abuse to avoid being returned to the care of her mother.\" (Footnotes in original.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039044\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/168/#p170\">\n    102 Conn.

Relevant to this appeal, the petitioner alleged that his trial attorney, Michael Moscowitz, rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by (1) failing to consult with and\n   call as a witness a medical expert with experience evaluating medical evidence in child sexual abuse cases for the purpose of refuting Moskal-Kanz' testimony that her colposcopic examination of the victim revealed trauma to the victim's hymen consistent with sexual abuse, and (2) failing to present testimony from Strugar regarding the petitioner's August, 1999 back surgery and subsequent incapacitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following a three day trial, the habeas court issued a memorandum of decision on March 3, 2016, denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. As to both alleged bases for ineffective assistance, the habeas court found that the petitioner had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that Moscowitz' performance was objectively unreasonable. Following a grant of a petition for certification to appeal, this appeal followed.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. As previously set forth, Moskal-Kanz testified at the petitioner's criminal trial that her colposcopic examination of the victim revealed scarring or furrowing on the victim's hymen consistent with sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039044\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/102/168/#p170\">\n    102 Conn.

At the petitioner's habeas trial, Jennifer Canter, a child abuse pediatrician, testified that she had examined the victim's colposcopy photographs and determined, contrary to Moskal-Kanz, that the victim had an \"absolutely normal exam,\" a \"normal\" hymen that exhibited \"no scar or furrowing,\" and that there was \"no affirmative evidence of laceration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The habeas court, however, found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that Moscowitz performed deficiently by failing to consult or call as a witness an expert for purposes of challenging Moskal-Kanz' testimony at the petitioner's criminal trial. The habeas court stated: \"Regarding the sexual abuse and medical findings [of Moskal-Kanz], [Moscowitz] testified credibly to consulting with medical experts in practically every case he has tried with medical findings of trauma, although he could not specifically recall consulting with a medical expert in this case. [Moscowitz] had access to all of the relevant medical information in the case as part of the discovery process. He testified\n   credibly that if, in his consultation with a medical expert, the consultant opined that the findings were 'normal,' he would either have the witness take the stand in his case-in-chief or use the information to cross-examine the state's witness.\" Accordingly, the habeas court found: \"It is clear ... that ... Moscowitz' performance in ... either relying on his experience and/or consulting with a medical expert was not objectively unreasonable or constitutionally deficient. It would be the very definition of the kind of second-guessing disfavored in the law to allow the petitioner to substitute both the strategic judgments and the newly discovered medical expert [Canter] ... for that of [Moscowitz].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that he failed to demonstrate that Moscowitz performed deficiently by \"failing to consult with and present [as a witness] a medical expert\" to challenge Moskal-Kanz' testimony. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The petitioner's claim on appeal is based largely upon a mischaracterization of the record. He grounds his claim that Moscowitz performed deficiently on the factual assertion that Moscowitz \"fail[ed] to consult with ... a medical expert\" and took Moskal-Kanz' testimony \"at face value.\" Our review of the habeas court's\n   memorandum of decision, however, does not reveal any finding that Moscowitz failed to consult with a medical expert in preparation for Moskal-Kanz' testimony. It, instead, reveals that the habeas court credited Moscowitz' testimony that, although he consulted with medical experts in \"practically every case\" he has tried in which the state presented medical evidence trauma, he could not recall specifically whether he used one to assess Moskal-Kanz' testimony that the victim's hymen exhibited signs of sexual abuse. Indeed, the habeas court found that Moscowitz was not deficient for \"\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   relying on his experience\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   consulting with a medical expert,\" indicating that it had not made a definitive finding as to whether Moscowitz consulted an expert in the petitioner's case, as opposed to relying on his own experience cross-examining the state's medical witnesses in other cases. (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the petitioner's claim that Moscowitz performed deficiently by failing to consult with an expert in preparation for Moskal-Kanz' testimony must fail because there is no factual basis for it in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It appears that the petitioner attempts to avoid this fatal gap in the record by two methods. First, he asserts that \"[r]easonable inferences to be drawn from the record indicate that [Moscowitz] did not consult with a medical expert in preparing for the petitioner's criminal trial.\" It is well settled, however, that \"it is not the function of this court ... to make factual findings ....

Nothing either in the habeas\n   court's subordinate factual findings or in the evidence adduced at the habeas trial\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   , as a matter of law, the conclusion that Moscowitz did not consult with an expert prior to cross-examining Moskal-Kanz. We, therefore, cannot assume the existence of such a fact on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the petitioner argues in the alternative that, even if the habeas court did not find that Moscowitz\n   <em>\n    had not\n   </em>\n   consulted with an expert, it also did not find that he\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   . Because, however, it is the petitioner's burden to prove the factual basis for his ineffective assistance claim; see\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20664\">\n    306 Conn. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%20948\">\n    51 A.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and not the respondent's burden to prove a negative, the fact that the habeas court did not find that Moscowitz consulted an expert does not help the petitioner. There was no evidence adduced at the habeas trial affirmatively establishing that Moscowitz did not consult an expert. That Moscowitz could not remember specifically his method for preparing for Moskal-Kanz' testimony, which had occurred\n   many years prior to the habeas trial-and thus could not rule out the possibility that he relied on his experience and cross-examined Moskal-Kanz without help from an expert, as he did in some cases-does not overcome the strong presumption of constitutionally effective counsel. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has observed, \"[t]ime inevitably fogs the memory of busy attorneys.

Accordingly, the petitioner's claim that Moscowitz performed deficiently because he failed to consult an expert witness must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We also agree with the habeas court that the petitioner failed to meet his burden of establishing that Moscowitz performed deficiently by failing to present testimony from an expert witness at the petitioner's criminal trial in order to refute Moskal-Kanz' testimony. Although Canter testified at the habeas trial that her examination of the victim's colposcopic photographs showed no signs of abnormalities, there are no findings in the habeas court's memorandum of decision that, prior to trial, Moscowitz knew about an expert who, like Canter, disagreed with Moskal-Kanz' opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To the contrary, the habeas court credited Moscowitz' testimony that, had he consulted with a medical expert who believed that the victim's hymen was \"normal,\" he would have either called that expert as a witness at trial or used the information to cross-examine Moskal-Kanz. This finding, together with the fact that\n   Moscowitz did not call, or otherwise use the information provided by, an expert to refute Moskal-Kanz' testimony regarding the results of the victim's colposcopic examination, leads us to the conclusion that Moscowitz had not encountered such an expert prior to the petitioner's criminal trial. Although Moscowitz could have undertaken a search in hopes of finding such an expert, the constitution does not require trial lawyers to \"track down each and every lead or personally investigate every evidentiary possibility before choosing a defense and developing it.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gaines\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20664\">\n    306 Conn. at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moscowitz testified that his strategy for confronting Moskal-Kanz instead was to establish the possibility that the trauma to the victim's hymen could have been caused by something other than penile penetration; we cannot second-guess that strategy here. Accordingly, the habeas court properly rejected this ineffective assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The petitioner next claims that the court improperly determined that he failed to prove that Moscowitz performed deficiently by failing to present the testimony of Strugar, the petitioner's neurosurgeon who performed back surgery on the petitioner in August, 1999, to establish that he was incapable of physically or sexually abusing the victim.
