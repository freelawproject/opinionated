Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The sole question presented on remand is whether the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on accomplice testimony with regard to Bates. The defendant claims that Bates' assistance with the coverup of the crimes, by helping to clean the vehicle, provided a basis for an accomplice instruction. In particular, he argues that Bates' participation in the coverup resulted in her being charged with tampering with evidence, and, therefore, she \"had the same motive to curry favor with the prosecution as an accomplice to the murder.\" Thus, according to the defendant, the court had a duty to instruct the jury to scrutinize her testimony carefully. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We begin by setting forth the legal principles that govern our consideration of this claim. \"[T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment ... for reasons of policy.... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.... Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly.... Implicit in this\n   very demanding standard is the notion ... that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily [discernible] on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable.... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application.... [I]n addition to examining the patent nature of the error, the reviewing court must examine that error for the grievousness of its consequences in order to determine whether reversal under the plain error doctrine is appropriate. A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jamison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20589\">\n    320 Conn. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596-97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20560\">\n    134 A.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Generally, a defendant is not entitled to an instruction singling out any of the state's witnesses and highlighting his or her possible motive for testifying falsely....

Taylor, prior to the drug deal that led to the shooting, she knew Taylor was a drug dealer and had seen him with a gun, and she helped clean the [vehicle] of blood and dispose of the evidence of the murder afterward.\" The defendant also posits that Bates was \"charged with offenses based on the same set of facts that led to the charges against Taylor and [the defendant], and ... the state had promised her lenient\n   treatment in her pending case in exchange for her testimony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the defendant, this evidence was sufficient to implicate the court's duty to provide an accomplice testimony instruction with regard to Bates. We disagree. These circumstances do not support a determination that Bates was an accomplice such that the court was required to give, sua sponte, an accomplice instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, Bates was not with the defendant when he murdered the victim. Indeed, there was no testimony from the defendant or any other witness that attributed any involvement by Bates in the defendant's plan to obtain drugs from the victim. There also was no evidence that Bates had any shared intention with the defendant to commit any crimes against the victim once the defendant encountered the victim. Second, there was no evidence showing that Bates intentionally aided the defendant in any conduct that constituted the crimes against the victim, i.e., robbery or murder. In fact, there was no evidence that Bates even was aware of the robbery or the murder until the defendant and his coconspirator returned to her residence after completing those crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The evidence shows that once the defendant and Taylor returned to Bates' home,\n   although Bates helped to clean the vehicle, she did not do so voluntarily. The evidence shows that Taylor threatened her, by telling her he would \"F her up if she did not do whatever the F he wanted her to do\" and then he ordered her to clean\n   the vehicle. As a result, Bates testified, she cleaned the bloody vehicle because she was afraid of Taylor. She explained that she feared him because he had a gun and could have killed her if she called the police. Thus, the evidence did not show Bates to be a willing participant but, rather, it showed that Taylor threatened Bates in order to make sure that she would do what he told her to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Given that Bates was not present at the crime scene, was not a participant in the crimes with which the defendant was charged, was not aware of the commission of the crimes prior to or during their commission, only helped to clean the bloody vehicle under duress, and only after the crimes already had been completed, she clearly did not have the mutuality of intent or community of unlawful purpose to commit the robbery and murder the victim. Accordingly, Bates was not charged with the same crimes as the defendant or as a coconspirator. Instead, Bates was charged with tampering with evidence.

Id., at 551,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20770\">\n    613 A.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The witness testified that he acted under duress because the defendant threatened to kill him if he did not assist with moving the victim's body. Id., at 539,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20770\">\n    613 A.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our Supreme Court ruled that the trial court reasonably could have found that the evidence \"did not indicate mutuality of intent and community of unlawful purpose or that the evidence thereof was so insufficient, inconclusive or ambivalent that an accomplice instruction was not appropriate.\" Id., at 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20770\">\n    613 A.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further concluded that \"the omission of an accomplice instruction in the court's charge to the jury, if misguided, was not so obvious or egregious that it merits plain error review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20770\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Boles\n   </em>\n   , the facts of the present case provide an even stronger basis for this court to conclude that no error arose from the trial court's failure to deliver, sua sponte, an accomplice instruction with respect to Bates' testimony. First, unlike the witness in\n   <em>\n    Boles\n   </em>\n   , Bates was not present at the crime scene during the commission of the crimes. Therefore, it is much clearer in this case that Bates was not an active participant in the robbery and murder of the victim. Second, there was evidence that\n   Bates, like the witness in\n   <em>\n    Boles\n   </em>\n   , acted under duress in helping to clean the vehicle after the commission of the crimes as a result of Taylor's threats and orders that she do so. Consequently, it is not at all clear that Bates willingly assisted in a coverup by cleaning the vehicle.\n   Thus, here, as in\n   <em>\n    Boles\n   </em>\n   , the evidence adduced at trial did not so clearly support the conclusion that Bates was an accomplice that it was plain error for the trial court not to deliver, sua sponte, a special credibility instruction. See id., at 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20770\">\n    613 A.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the contrary, on the basis of the evidence before it, the trial court's failure to give an accomplice instruction concerning Bates' testimony would not have been improper even if the defendant had requested such an instruction. Accordingly, the court's failure to give, sua sponte, an accomplice instruction was not \"so clearly and obviously an error that it undermines the integrity and fairness of the judicial proceeding necessitating reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489138\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/221/\">\n    324 Conn. at 820-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under these circumstances, we conclude that the omission of an accomplice instruction was not an error, much less an error so plain on its face and obvious in the sense of being not debatable.
