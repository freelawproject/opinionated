The defendant, the city of New Haven, appeals from the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, William O'Brien, its former tax assessor, awarding him the attorney's fees and costs that he incurred in defending himself in a prior action brought by a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its appeal, the defendant claims that the plaintiff's action for indemnification was barred because he failed to comply with the notice requirement and time limitations of \u00a7 7-101a(d). In his appeal, the plaintiff challenges the trial court's denial of his request for the attorney's fees and costs that he incurred in bringing the present action, claiming that \u00a7 7-101a authorizes such an award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history, as set forth in the trial court's memorandum of decision, are relevant to this appeal. \"On November 20, 2010, the plaintiff was sued by Tax Data Solutions, LLC (Tax\n   Data), in the action of\n   <em>\n    Tax Data Solutions, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Brien,\n   </em>\n   Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-10-6016263-S [prior action]. In that action, Tax Data alleged that [while] the plaintiff was the tax assessor for the defendant ... Tax Data was subjected to various misdeeds by the plaintiff. Upon receiving notice of the lawsuit, the plaintiff contacted the defendant by way of the mayor and the defendant's counsel, Victor Bolden, and requested that the defendant provide the plaintiff with legal representation in the [action] since it involved his duties as tax assessor. The defendant refused ... the plaintiff's request, even after judgment entered in his favor in the [prior action].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The plaintiff further alleges that he then hired private counsel, the law firm of Sabatini and Associates, LLC, in order to convince the defendant to provide [him] with legal representation. The defendant continued to refuse to provide legal representation, and on December 22, 2010, Bolden wrote a letter to the plaintiff's counsel wherein he stated that the defendant would not provide a defense, but pursuant to [\u00a7] 7-101a (b), if no judgment was rendered against the plaintiff, then the defendant would indemnify him for financial loss and expenses, which included attorney's fees, provided he was also acting in the discharge of his duties. The plaintiff subsequently retained Sabatini and Associates, LLC, to defend him in the [prior action], and he expended money for the legal services and fees associated with his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"In the [prior] action, the court [rendered] judgment in the plaintiff's favor on January 15, 2015. The plaintiff further alleges that as a result of this favorable judgment, Sabatini and Associates, LLC, presented the defendant with the plaintiff's\n   bill for attorney's fees, but the defendant again refused to pay said fees, despite having an obligation to defend or indemnify the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a.\"\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(d), on April 24, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice with the defendant's city clerk of his intention to bring an action for indemnification. On May 26, 2015, the plaintiff commenced the present action by service of process on the defendant's city clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court continued: \"On July 14, 2015, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint on the ground that the plaintiff failed to provide timely and proper notice required by \u00a7 7-101a. The court ... issued a memorandum of decision on November 10, 2015, denying the defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the notice provided to the defendant on April 24, 2015, was timely, as it was filed with the defendant's [city] clerk within six months of receiving a final judgment in the [prior] action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The plaintiff then filed an amended complaint on December 15, 2015, alleging the same facts as his original complaint, but revising his prayer for relief. The defendant filed an answer and special defense to the plaintiff's amended complaint on December 22, 2015, denying or leaving the plaintiff to his proof as to the allegations in the amended complaint. As for the defendant's special defense, it allege[d] that the plaintiff's claim is barred because the notice provided by the plaintiff to the defendant was untimely and improper. On December 23, 2015, the plaintiff filed a response to the defendant's special defense, alleging that the issue of notice was previously adjudicated by the court [when it] denied the defendant's motion to dismiss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The matter was tried to the court. In its memorandum of decision dated March 29, 2016, the court concluded that (1) the notice provided by the plaintiff to the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(d) was proper and timely; (2) the plaintiff was entitled to recoup attorney's fees and costs he expended to defend himself in the prior action; but (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to recoup\n   costs and attorney's fees he incurred to prosecute the present action against the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The principal question raised by the defendant's appeal is when did the plaintiff's cause of action for indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b) accrue for the purposes of the notice requirement and time limitations set forth in \u00a7 7-101a(d). The defendant maintains that the time limitations in \u00a7 7-101a(d) began to run when Tax Data's cause of action against the plaintiff arose in 2010, and that therefore, the present action was not timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the outset, we note that \"[i]ssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=153%20Conn.%20App.%20639\">\n    153 Conn.

Section 7-101a(a) provides in relevant part: \"Each municipality shall protect and save harmless any municipal officer, whether elected or appointed, of any board, committee, council, agency or commission ... or any municipal employee, of such municipality from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and\n   costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence, or for alleged infringement of any person's civil rights, on the part of such officer or such employee while acting in the discharge of his duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 7-101a(b) provides: \"In addition to the protection provided under subsection (a) of this section, each municipality shall protect and save harmless any such municipal officer or municipal employee from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand or suit instituted against such officer or employee by reason of alleged malicious, wanton or wilful act or ultra vires act, on the part of such officer or employee while acting in the discharge of his duties. In the event such officer or employee has a judgment entered against him for a malicious, wanton or wilful act in a court of law, such municipality shall be reimbursed by such officer or employee for expenses it incurred in providing such defense and shall not be held liable to such officer and employee for any financial loss or expense resulting from such act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 7-101a plainly provide three causes of action: (1) a municipal employee's indemnification action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(a) ; (2) a municipal employee's indemnification action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b) ; and (3) a municipality's reimbursement action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b). In order to bring an action under either subsection (a) or (b) of \u00a7 7-101a, the municipal employee must comply with the time limitations and notice requirement set forth in \u00a7 7-101a(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 7-101a(d) provides in relevant part: \"No action shall be maintained under this section against such municipality ... unless such action is commenced within two years after the cause of action therefor arose nor unless written notice of the intention to\n   commence such action and of the time when and the place where the damages were incurred or sustained has been filed with the clerk of such municipality within six months after such cause of action has accrued.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following principles governing statutory construction are well established and guide our analysis. \"When construing a statute, our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature....

If the prior action involves allegations of negligence or infringement of any person's civil rights on the part of the municipal officer or employee, then the municipal officer or employee can maintain an action against the municipality under \u00a7 7-101a(a). If the prior action involves allegations of malicious, wanton or wilful acts or ultra vires acts on the part of the municipal officer or employee, the indemnification action by the employee is maintained under \u00a7 7-101a(b). According to \u00a7 7-101a(b), however, the municipality will not be liable to the municipal officer or employee if the officer or employee\n   has a judgment entered against him or her for a malicious, wanton or wilful act in a court of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the municipal officer or employee has a judgment entered against him or her for a malicious, wanton or wilful act in a court of law, and the municipality has expended resources in providing a defense for him or her in that action, the municipal officer or employee will be liable to the municipality for all expenses that the municipality incurred in providing that defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present case, it is uncontested that Tax Data's complaint in the prior action included allegations of malicious, wanton or wilful acts or ultra vires acts on the part of the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff's indemnification action here is maintained under \u00a7 7-101a(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As previously discussed, to maintain an indemnification action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b), the municipal employee must comply with the notice requirement and time limitations of \u00a7 7-101a(d). The phrase \"under this section\" in \u00a7 7-101a(d) restricts its time limitations and notice provision to apply only to actions maintained under \u00a7 7-101a(a) and (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As our Supreme Court has recognized, \"[a] plain reading of the whole statute indicates that the limitation and notice provisions of \u00a7 7-101a(d) are applicable only to actions for indemnification maintained under \u00a7 7-101a(a) and to an action for reimbursement of defense expenses pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Orticelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695367\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/9/#p13\">\n    197 Conn. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%201023\">\n    495 A.2d 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Subsection (d) of ... \u00a7 7-101a specifically limits its application to actions maintained under ... \u00a7 7-101a.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%201023\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   It logically follows that the party required to file such notice with the clerk of the municipality in an indemnification action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a (b) is the municipal employee seeking indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a (b).

When two constructions are possible, courts will adopt the one which makes the [statute] effective and workable, and not one which leads to difficult and possibly bizarre results.\" [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ) To hold that the term \"cause of action\" as used in \u00a7 7-101a(d) refers to the alleged tortious conduct underlying the prior action would create an irrational result. For example,\n   the six month time limitation to file notice of an intention to sue required by\n   \u00a7 7-101a(d) could expire before the officer or employee has been sued for the allegedly tortious conduct. In such circumstances, the employee or officer would lose the protections of \u00a7 7-101a due to the inability to give timely notice to the municipality.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Orticelli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Norwich\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff in the present case has properly pursued a \u00a7 7-101a (b) indemnification action against the defendant to recover expenses that he incurred in a prior action initiated by a third party. Hence, the cases cited provide no support for the defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To further support its contention that the term \"cause of action\" in \u00a7 7-101a(d) refers to the third party's cause of action against the plaintiff in the prior action, the defendant argues that notice must be given to the municipality prior to judgment in the prior action because, otherwise, the municipality would be deprived of the opportunity to investigate, defend against, or settle the claims it may ultimately be required to indemnify, and the municipality\n   would likely be without insurance coverage for the loss. The defendant contends that its interpretation of \"cause of action\" is supported by the legislature's inclusion of \u00a7 7-101a(c), which authorizes municipalities to purchase liability insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 7-101a(c) provides: \"Each such municipality may insure against the liability imposed by this section in any insurance company organized in this state or in\n   any insurance company of another state authorized to write such insurance in this state or may elect to act as self-insurer of such liability.\" The defendant argues that if a municipality was not informed of the third-party claim before judgment was rendered in the underlying action, it would not be able to inform its insurance carrier of a potential claim and the insurer would be unable to investigate and defend that claim. The defendant claims that, ultimately, the municipality would be without insurance coverage for such claims. As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Norwich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Silverberg\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559688\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/367/\">\n    200 Conn. at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20A.2d%20336\">\n    511 A.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"subsection [ (c) of \u00a7 7-101a ] authorizes municipalities to purchase insurance to cover 'the liability imposed by [ \u00a7 7-101a ].' \" There is no evidence in the record before this court, however, that insurance coverage for such claims would not be available. Further, a municipality's ability or inability to obtain insurance coverage authorized by subsection (c) is a separate matter. We decline to consider such extratextual evidence in our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant also argues that the reimbursement language in \u00a7 7-101a(b) presupposes that the municipality will be aware of the third party's action against the municipal employee. We acknowledge that a reimbursement of defense expenses would only occur if the municipality provided a defense in the prior action, and that a defense can be mounted only if the municipality has knowledge of the prior action. Knowledge of the prior action, however, is not required for a municipality to be liable to indemnify its employee under \u00a7 7-101a(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The requirement of notice for a municipal officer\n   or employee to bring a \u00a7 7-101a action against the municipality is contained within \u00a7 7-101a(d), and we decline to extend the requirement of notice beyond what the text of the statute requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At oral argument before this court, the defendant claimed that \u00a7 7-101a imposed on the municipality a duty to defend, citing to the word \"protect\" in \u00a7 7-101a(a) and (b). The defendant's interpretation of \"cause of action\" might have some merit if the provisions of \u00a7 7-101a incorporated a duty to defend, as that might provide some relationship between the notice required for a \u00a7 7-101a action and the cause of action in the prior action. Our Supreme Court, however, in\n   <em>\n    Vibert\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831878\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/167/#p174\">\n    260 Conn. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174-76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%201076\">\n    793 A.2d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), has stated that the language \"protect and save harmless\" establishes a duty to indemnify, not a duty to defend. The court in\n   <em>\n    Vibert\n   </em>\n   noted that General Statutes \u00a7 10-235\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   contained the same\n   \"protect and save harmless\" language as set forth in \u00a7 7-101a.

Id., at 175-76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%201076\">\n    793 A.2d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Our Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Vibert\n   </em>\n   compels a similar conclusion here. Indeed, at oral argument before this court, the defendant stated that \"the city has to have the opportunity to determine whether to defend,\" effectively conceding that \u00a7 7-101a imposes no duty to defend on the municipality because the opportunity to choose to defend is, by its very nature, not a duty to defend. Although the language of \u00a7 7-101a suggests that a municipality may choose to defend its employees, nothing in its provisions imposes upon it a duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, the defendant argues that \u00a7 7-101a(d) contains no provision regarding the municipality \"reimbursing\" the employee after a judgment has been rendered. As previously discussed, pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a(b), the municipality will not be liable to the municipal officer or employee if the officer or employee has a judgment rendered against him or her in a court of law for malicious, wanton or wilful acts. Therefore, the municipal officer or employee will not be able to successfully maintain an action against the municipality until there is a determination of the prior action in the employee's favor. Although the defendant is correct that \u00a7 7-101a(b) does not include the same reimbursement language\n   for the municipal employee, it does include an obligation for the municipality to \"protect and save harmless any such municipal officer or municipal employee from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand or suit instituted against such officer or employee by reason of alleged malicious, wanton or wilful act or ultra vires act....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Despite the numerous arguments presented by the defendant to support its contention that the term \"cause of action\" in \u00a7 7-101a(d) should be interpreted as the third party's cause of action against the municipal officer or employee in the prior action, we ultimately are not persuaded. According to the text of \u00a7 7-101a itself, and its relationship to other similar statutes, the cause of action for the plaintiff's claim for indemnification accrued, and the six month notice period and the two\n   year limitation period of \u00a7 7-101a(d) began to run, when the plaintiff first could have successfully held the defendant liable. The plaintiff could not have successfully done so under \u00a7 7-101a(b) until the prior action concluded, which occurred on January 15, 2015. Because notice was provided to the defendant on April 24, 2015, it therefore was timely filed with the defendant's city clerk within the six month period. Further, the plaintiff commenced the indemnification action on May 26, 2015, thereby satisfying the two year time limitation of \u00a7 7-101a(d) as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We next consider the plaintiff's appeal. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court denied the plaintiff's request to recover all attorney's fees and costs he incurred to prosecute the present indemnification action. The plaintiff claims that the phrase \"financial loss\" in \u00a7 7-101a authorizes the reimbursement of his expenses incurred in prosecuting this action against the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the attorney's fees and costs he expended in the present action because \u00a7 7-101a(b) does not authorize the recovery of such attorney's fees and costs. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"It is well entrenched in our jurisprudence that Connecticut adheres to the American rule....

It is important to note that \"[u]nlike [\u00a7] 7-465, which permits a plaintiff to bring a claim against a municipality to indemnify [its] employees, [\u00a7] 7-101a provides indemnification to the employee from the municipality, and does not contain a direct action by a non-employee plaintiff against the municipality.\"\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Cornell\n    </em>\n    , United States District Court, Docket No. 3:13-CV-878 (WIG),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204023285\">\n     2017 WL 4023285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , *4,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20147878\">\n     2017 U.S. Dist.

Section 7-465(a) provides in relevant part: \"No action for personal physical injuries or damages to real or personal property shall be maintained against such municipality and employee jointly unless such action is commenced within two years after the cause of action therefor arose and written notice of the intention to commence such action and of the time when and the place where the damages were incurred or sustained has been filed with the clerk of such municipality within six months after such cause of action has accrued....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The defendant mischaracterizes dicta in\n    <em>\n     Orticelli\n    </em>\n    in support of its position. Specifically, the defendant represents in its brief that the Supreme Court \"did not recognize a right for a municipal employee to sue a municipality under [\u00a7] 7-101a (b),\" the plaintiff's cause of action in this case. As previously discussed, the plain language makes clear there are three distinct causes of action in \u00a7 7-101a(a) and (b). Further, the Supreme Court, used the language cited by the defendant to clarify what the phrase \"or employee\" in \u00a7 7-101a(d) refers to and not for purposes of excluding the right for a municipal employee to sue a municipality under \u00a7 7-101a(b). The Supreme Court stated that \"or employee\" as used in \u00a7 7-101a(d)\"places a time limitation on the action a municipality can take against an employee for reimbursement of defense expenses pursuant to ... \u00a7 7-101a(b) in cases involving malicious, wanton and wilful or ultra vires acts of municipal officers and employees.\"\n    <em>\n     Orticelli\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Powers\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695367\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/9/#p13\">\n     197 Conn. at 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=495%20A.2d%201023\">\n     495 A.2d 1023\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Supreme Court's failure to comment on the employee's cause of action under \u00a7 7-101a(b) does not, as the defendant implies, constitute a determination that employees are limited to a cause of action under \u00a7 7-101a(a). The statute plainly provides for a municipal employee's indemnification action pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a (b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In addition, the defendant suggests that the trial court's interpretation of the statute would render the statute unconstitutional under the due process clause of the federal and state constitutions.

A plain reading of the statute reveals the word \"action\" refers to a \u00a7 7-101a action and the \"cause of action\" for a \u00a7 7-101a action accrues when the plaintiff could have held the defendant liable for the \u00a7 7-101a action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Section 7-101a(b) provides in relevant part that \"each municipality shall protect and save harmless any such municipal officer or municipal employee from\n    <em>\n     financial loss\n    </em>\n    and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand or suit instituted against such officer or employee ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
