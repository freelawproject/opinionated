In its memorandum of law in support of this motion, GMAC argued that Wells Fargo\n   was the real party in interest, as it had acquired the right to collect the debt due on the loan in foreclosure\n   through an assignment of the mortgage. GMAC attached a copy of the assignment of the mortgage to its memorandum. The defendant did not object to the substitution, and the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Richard P. Gilardi\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted the motion to substitute on June 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 9, 2015, the plaintiff moved to open the judgment of strict foreclosure for the purpose of setting new law days. The defendant objected, arguing, inter alia, that (1) this court did not rule on all of his issues in his prior appeal, (2) he \"did not default on the alleged note and mortgage\" in 2009 because he \"exercised his federal right to cancel under the Truth in Lending Act\" (TILA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the issue of standing, raised by the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was never resolved. In his objection, the defendant cited\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   for the first time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 27, 2015, the defendant filed a supplemental objection to the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment. He primarily argued that he rescinded his loan within the statutory rescission period because\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   \"clarified that a TILA rescission disputed or undisputed is effectuated at the moment the notice of right to cancel is timely mailed within three years of the loan date\n   ....\" The supplemental objection referred to a notice of right to cancel, signed and sworn to by the defendant on July 10, 2009, which was recorded in the Bridgeport land records on September 29, 2009. The defendant previously had filed this notice with the trial court on June 20, 2011, but did not attach a copy to his supplemental objection. On October 13, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Alfred J. Jennings, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, overruled the defendant's objections and granted the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment. The court set new law days, pursuant to this court's remand order, to commence on November 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, on November 2, 2015, the defendant filed a motion for reargument. On November 20, 2015, the plaintiff objected to this motion, claiming that reargument was not warranted because the defendant had not alleged some principle of law that would have a controlling effect but was overlooked by the court, nor were there claims of law that the court had failed to address. On December 8, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Alfred J. Jennings, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, denied the defendant's motion for reargument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During this period of time, on October 9, 2015, the defendant moved to open the judgment, citing \"evidence to submit that lends to my defense.\" The plaintiff objected to this motion, arguing that the defendant was engaging in dilatory behavior in an attempt to delay the foreclosure. On November 13, 2015, the defendant filed a memorandum to \"supplement ... defendant's motion to open,\" in which he argued that\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   , which the Supreme Court decided subsequent to this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ford I\n   </em>\n   , overruled any conclusion by this court that his alleged TILA rescission was\n   not effective. He also filed an affidavit, to which he attached the July 10, 2009 notice of right to cancel. After a brief hearing on November 17, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Edward F. Stodolink\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, denied the\n   defendant's motion to open the judgment and sua sponte set new law days to commence on December 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 7, 2015, the defendant filed an additional motion to reargue, a motion for articulation, and a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 14, 2015, the defendant filed this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant first argues that on remand, the trial court erred in granting the plaintiff's motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure, and denying his motion to open the judgment. Specifically, the defendant argues that, based on\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   , \"a TILA notice is effective as long as it is in writing and is mailed to a creditor within three years from the consummation of the loan.\" Thus, he claims that his alleged rescission of the loan was effective as a matter of law in this foreclosure action, and that the trial court erred in ruling on the motions at issue without considering the effect of\n   <em>\n    Jesinoski\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review.

We disagree, as the defendant has suggested no competent evidence, either at the time of the unopposed substitution of Wells Fargo as the plaintiff\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   or now, that the Harborview Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-10 \"has no legal existence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We are guided by the general principles governing a trial court's disposition of a motion to dismiss that challenges jurisdiction.

He claims that\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    declares his TILA rescission effective as a matter of law. Accordingly, he argues that the burden of proof at summary judgment should have been placed on the plaintiff, as the movant, to disprove the effectiveness of his TILA rescission, and that in affirming the trial court's summary judgment and judgment of strict foreclosure, this court decided that his TILA rescission was ineffective-a decision that \"conflicts with the [United States] Supreme Court.\" We reject this argument for two reasons. First,\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    does not apply to the facts of this case. Second, the defendant has appealed to this court seeking review of the trial court's judgment granting the plaintiff's motion to open and denying the defendant's motion to open, not whether this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Ford I\n    </em>\n    is proper in light of\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Although we do not reach the merits of the defendant's arguments regarding the requirements of a TILA rescission, we note that a TILA rescission within the three year statutory period also requires that \"the information and forms required under this section or any other disclosures required under this part have not been delivered\" to the borrower.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201635\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1635\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594207\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/790/\">\n     135 S.Ct. at 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[the TILA] regime grants borrowers an unconditional right to rescind for three days, after which they may rescind only if the lender failed to satisfy the Act's disclosure requirements\"). Where a defendant in a foreclosure action alleges a TILA rescission within three years of the loan's consummation date, the issue is whether the defendant was entitled to the three year rescission period because he did not receive the required disclosures, not merely whether the defendant mailed the notice within the three year period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The defendant argues that the mailing of a rescission notice, whether disputed by the lender or undisputed, is sufficient. Specifically, he claims that \"\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    shows that the presence of a disputed claim has no bearing on the effectiveness of a TILA notice.\" This language from the Supreme Court's opinion was in response to an argument advanced by the respondents that, although written notice of rescission would suffice for undisputed claims, an action would be required, in addition to written notice, where the parties disputed the adequacy of the disclosures.\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594207\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/790/\">\n     135 S.Ct. at 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Because we conclude that\n    <em>\n     Jesinoski\n    </em>\n    does not apply to the facts of this case, we decline to address these arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The defendant also argues the significance of the facts that the plaintiff's complaint listed, as a possible encumbrance to title, the rescission notice filed in the Bridgeport land records, and that the plaintiff has not denied receiving the rescission notice. These arguments are immaterial to this appeal. The defendant argued rescission before the trial court. The trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and entered a judgment of strict foreclosure, which this court affirmed, concluding that \"[t]he defendant presented no documentary evidence or other proof to support his allegations that the note and mortgage were properly rescinded in accordance with [TILA].\"\n    <em>\n     Ford I\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415848\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/165/\">\n     144 Conn.
