The defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that his resentencing did not give rise to a double jeopardy violation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history is relevant to the present claim. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of two counts of sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and one count of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). For each of\n   the sale of narcotics counts, the court,\n   <em>\n    D'Addabbo, J.\n   </em>\n   , imposed a sentence of seven years of imprisonment. For each of the possession of narcotics counts, the court imposed a sentence of seven years of imprisonment. For these four counts, the court ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. For the manslaughter in the first degree count, the court imposed a sentence of eighteen years of imprisonment. The court ordered the sentence for the manslaughter count to be served consecutive to the sentences imposed with respect to the other counts. This resulted in a total effective sentence of twenty-five years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a direct appeal to this court, the defendant claimed that the evidence did not support the conviction for manslaughter in the first degree and that the trial court improperly had instructed the jury with respect to the state's burden of proof and the presumption of innocence.

The trial court vacated the sentences it had imposed on all counts in the judgment and modified the judgment to reflect a conviction of the four narcotics related counts that were affirmed by this court as well as manslaughter in the second degree. The trial court resentenced the defendant by imposing a total effective sentence of twenty-three years. It restructured the original sentence by increasing the concurrent terms of imprisonment on the four narcotics related counts from seven years each to thirteen years each. The court ordered that these four sentences be served consecutively to a ten year term of imprisonment for the manslaughter in the second degree conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following his resentencing, the defendant appealed to this court.

The court,\n   <em>\n    Alander, J.\n   </em>\n   , rejected these three claims on their merits and denied the motion to correct. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the present appeal, the defendant challenges only that part of the court's decision in which it rejected his double jeopardy claim. In its memorandum of decision, the court addressed the double jeopardy claim as follows: \"The defendant's second claim is that the reopening of his drug convictions for purposes of resentencing violated the double jeopardy clauses of the United States constitution and the Connecticut constitution. This claim lacks merit for the simple reason that the Appellate Court in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20289\">\n    156 Conn.

In\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   , the defendant appealed his convictions in two cases consolidated for trial. The convictions in one of the cases were reversed by our Supreme Court which vacated the entire sentence in both cases and remanded the cases for resentencing. Just as the defendant does here, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   claimed that his subsequent sentence violated the double jeopardy prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense because he had an expectation of finality in the original sentence [with respect to the convictions that were not reversed on appeal]. The Appellate Court disagreed. 'Even if the defendant had raised claims that challenged only some of the counts under which he had been convicted, the fact that he exercised his right to an appeal undermines his argument to an expectation of finality in the sentence originally imposed. The defendant was successful in undermining a portion of a sentencing package, and the legal consequence of doing so resulted in a resentencing proceeding in which the trial court properly resentenced him pursuant to the remand\n   order.'

According to the defendant, this language \"suggests that a successful challenge to the validity of a\n    <em>\n     conviction\n    </em>\n    , as opposed to a\n    <em>\n     sentence\n    </em>\n    , prevents the trial court from refashion[ing] the entire sentence for each of the crimes within the confines of the original package on double jeopardy grounds.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant in the present case, having challenged the legality of his convictions, reasons: \"\n    <em>\n     Tabone\n    </em>\n    leaves doubt as to whether the prohibition against double jeopardy is implicated when the aggregate package theory of sentencing is applied upon remand following a successful challenge to a conviction rather than a sentence ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    We disagree with the defendant's narrow interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Tabone\n    </em>\n    .

Where, as here, a defendant has challenged the validity of his multicount conviction on direct appeal, he is unable thereafter to claim an expectation of finality in the sentences imposed.
