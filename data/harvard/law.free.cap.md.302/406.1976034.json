John F.

Kennedy, a passenger in a vehicle involved in an automobile accident (1) was medically treated for injuries sustained at that time; (2) that the injuries \u201cwere serious enough that she should have been compensated\u201d and should have \u201cobtained a recovery from someone\u201d; (3) that nevertheless no clear and convincing evidence had been adduced that Ms. Kennedy suffered any economic loss because of the Respondent\u2019s neglect or that any financial consequences attended the Respondent\u2019s failure to make timely claim upon the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund; and</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">It appearing to the Court that more specific factual findings should be made in this case as to .whether a loss or losses were in fact sustained by Ms. Kennedy, attributable to Respondent\u2019s misconduct, including loss of PIP and other statutory benefits under Maryland Code (1979 Repl. Vol.), Article 48A.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It is, therefore, this <em>25th </em>day of February, 1985, ORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, that the case be remanded to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for the taking of additional evidence and for more specific factual findings concerning any economic loss actually suffered by Karen M. Kennedy as a result of the Respondent\u2019s violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
