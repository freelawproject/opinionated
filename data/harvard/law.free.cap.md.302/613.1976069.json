After defining the offenses charged, the trial judge concluded his jury instructions with the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">\u201cYou are instructed that your verdict must be unanimous. You are further instructed that there are many cases in which absolute certainty cannot be expected. Although the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror as a result of his own conviction and not a mere acquiescence of the conclusions of his fellows, each one of you should examine the questions submitted with candor and <em>with proper regard and deference to the opinion of your fellow jurors. </em>It is your duty to decide this case if you can conscientiously do so, and you should listen <em>with a disposition to be convinced </em>to each other\u2019s argument. <em>If your views are contrary to those of the vast majority, you should consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors, are correct.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Defense counsel objected to the instruction, but his objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Following closing arguments, the jury retired. After slightly more than two and one-half hours of deliberation, the jury returned its verdicts. The defendant Goodmuth was found guilty on the charges of burglary and malicious destruction of property. He was also found guilty on one charge of theft and not guilty on two other theft counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">On appeal Goodmuth argued <em>inter alia </em>that the above-quoted jury instruction should not have been given. The Court of Special Appeals, however, affirmed in an unreported opinion. While acknowledging that the instruction was identical to the instruction disapproved by this Court in <em>Burnette v. State, </em>280 Md. 88, 371 A.2d 663 (1977), and that the \u201ctrial judge was skating on thin ice in giving the instruction,\u201d the intermediate appellate court held that reversal was not required because the instruction, instead of being given to a deadlocked jury, was given before the jurors began to deliberate. Thereafter we granted Goodmuth\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In No. 76, Kenneth Franklin Pierce Beach was charged, also in the Circuit Court for Howard County, with rape and related offenses, and he elected a jury trial. As in <em>Goodmuth, </em>before the jury in the <em>Beach </em>case retired the trial judge gave an instruction concerning the jurors\u2019 responsibilities with regard to their deliberations. While given by a different trial judge, the instruction was absolutely identical to the previously quoted instruction in the <em>Goodmuth </em>case. Beach\u2019s attorney objected to the instruction, and the objection was overruled. The jury acquitted Beach of first degree rape but convicted him of a second degree sexual offense and related crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Beach appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, raising several issues including the propriety of the above-discussed jury instruction, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed in an unreported opinion. The Court of Special Appeals, relying upon language in <em>Kelly v. State, </em>270 Md. 139, 144, 310 A.2d 538 (1973), held that the trial court\u2019s instruction was appropriate because it \u201cwas given <em>before </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the jury retired.\u201d Beach then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted the petition and ordered that the case be heard at the same time as the <em>Goodmuth </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The jury instruction challenged in these cases was essentially the same as the instruction approved in <em>Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 157, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896). This instruction, often called the <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d or \u201ctraditional <em>Allen </em>charge,\u201d has been heavily criticized in recent cases as coercive. The principal focus of the criticisms has been the instruction\u2019s emphasis on the deference to be given to other jurors\u2019 opinions, its advice that one should listen to others with a \u201cdisposition to be convinced,\u201d and the admonition that those in the minority should reconsider their views which have made \u201cno impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors.\u201d <em>See Burnette v. State, supra, </em>280 Md. at 93-100, 371 A.2d 663; <em>Kelly v. State, supra, </em>270 Md. at 140-144, 310 A.2d 538. On the other hand, instructions concerning the responsibilities of jurors in the course of their deliberations, which have been modified by deleting the coercive language of the instruction given in the <em>Allen </em>case, have generally been approved in recent years. Such non-coercive instructions are sometimes referred to as <em>\u201cAllen </em>-type charges\u201d or \u201cmodified <em>Allen </em>charges\u201d as opposed to \u201ctraditional <em>Allen </em>charges.\u201d <em>Burnette, </em>280 Md. at 96-97, 371 A.2d 663; <em>Kelly, </em>270 Md. at 143-144, 310 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The first case in which this Court considered the propriety of a traditional <em>Allen </em>charge, and the only case in which this Court has upheld the use of the traditional charge, was <em>Leupen v. Lackey, </em>248 Md. 19, 234 A.2d 573 (1967). <em>Leupen </em>was a civil action for damages for a back injury allegedly incurred in a motor vehicle accident. The jury, after three hours of deliberation, sent a note to the court stating: \u201cIf the jury is deadlocked but in favor of the defense does the verdict go to the defense?\u201d 248 Md. at 21-22, 234 A.2d 573. The court, in response and over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, gave the jury a traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction. Then, after further deliberations, the jury re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>turned with a verdict in favor of the <em>plaintiff. </em>The plaintiff, dissatisfied with the amount of the award, took an appeal, contending that the instruction should not have been given. This Court upheld the use of the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge under the circumstances, relying upon cases in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. <em>See </em>248 Md. at 24-25, 234 A.2d 573.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Court in <em>Leupen </em>did issue a caution regarding the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge <em>(id. </em>at 25-26, 234 A.2d 573):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201cIt must not be supposed that an Allen charge is proper in every case. There well may be facts and circumstances in a given case which would make such a charge either inadvisable or require the trial judge to exercise great care and restraint in presenting it to the jury. In any case, however, it would be well for the court to keep in mind the language found in 1 Branson\u2019s <em>Instructions to Juries </em>(3rd ed. A. Reid 1960 Replacement).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u2018The trial judge may advise an unagreed jury of the importance of their reaching a verdict, if they can do so without surrendering their conscientious convictions. But he cannot go beyond that and say anything to the prejudice of either party. There is no prescribed language that he must use in this connection. What he may with propriety say must in a large measure be left to his good judgment. But as the exclusive right to agree or not to agree rests with the jury, the judge must not by threat or entreaty attempt to coerce a verdict or to exert his authority to force an agreement; nor must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>he under any circumstances or in any manner indicate the character of verdict that the jury should return.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asx\">The next case in this Court to consider the matter was <em>Kelly v. State, supra, </em>270 Md. 139, 310 A.2d 538. Unlike the challenged instructions in <em>Leupen </em>and in the present case, the instruction at issue in <em>Kelly </em>was not a traditional <em>Allen </em>charge. The trial court in <em>Kelly, </em>before the jury began its deliberations, gave an <em>Allen </em>-type instruction regarding the jurors\u2019 responsibilities concerning deliberations. The instruction, however, did not contain the coercive language of the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge that a juror should deliberate \u201cwith proper regard and deference to the opinion of your fellow jurors\u201d or that a juror should listen with a \u201cdisposition to be convinced,\u201d or that jurors in the minority \u201cshould consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors, are correct.\u201d Instead, the charge in <em>Kelly, </em>while pointing to the need to consult with each other and the need to listen, emphasized that a juror should adhere to his conscientious opinion. The charge did not suggest deference to other opinions; it was not specifically directed to the minority as the group which should reconsider its views.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The Court in <em>Kelly, </em>in an opinion by Judge Digges, began by stating that it would \u201cextrapolate from <em>and expand upon </em>the precepts established by this Court in <em>Leupen v. </em>Lackey____\u201d 270 Md. at 140, 310 A.2d 538, emphasis added. The Court then pointed to the criticisms of the <em>Allen </em>charge and the decisions of several courts \u201cthat they would only accept a recitation of the charge as circumscribed by the American Bar Association\u2019s Standards Relating to Trial by Jury (Standards), \u00a7 5.4 (1968).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 310 A.2d 538. The Court went on to agree with the ABA <em>Standards </em>that it is often appropriate for a trial court to instruct the jury on its responsibilities in the course of deliberations. Therefore, the Court said, an Allen-type charge should not be eliminated as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 310 A.2d 538. Whether or not to utilize an <em>Allen </em>-type charge, and the particular words selected in giving an <em>Allen </em>-type charge, were deemed to be initially matters of trial court discretion, subject to reversal if abused. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 310 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Next, the <em>Kelly </em>opinion suggested \u201cguidelines for employment of the <em>Allen </em>-type charge.\u201d 270 Md. at 143, 310 A.2d 538. First, it stated that \u201cit is always proper to use the ... ABA approved <em>Allen </em>-type instruction before the jury begins its deliberations,\u201d ibid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court further said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that if the trial judge desires \u201cto personalize his Allen-type instruction, he has greater latitude in doing so when the charge is given before the jury retires to consider the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 310 A.2d 538. Then, in a sentence seized upon by the Court of Special Appeals in the <em>Beach </em>case and by the State in both cases before us, the <em>Kelly </em>opinion commented that before the jury retires \u201cthe use of language at variance with that recommended by the ABA is nevertheless acceptable if it is similar to that approved by this Court in <em>Leupen,\u201d ibid. </em>The Court in <em>Kelly </em>went on to state that, after the jury has retired to deliberate, \u201ca trial judge, who decides to give an <em>Allen </em>-type charge because of an apparent deadlock, should closely adhere to the wording of the ABA recommended instruction.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Applying these guidelines, the Court upheld the instruction given in the <em>Kelly </em>case, as it was delivered before the jury retired \u201cand as the words are similar to those which the ABA suggested,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 145, 310 A.2d 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The propriety <em>of </em>instructions concerning jurors\u2019 deliberation responsibilities was next, and most recently, considered by us in <em>Burnette v. State, supra. </em>In that case, four hours after it began deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge that it could not decide one of the principal issues in the case, namely whether or not the defendant was sane at the time the alleged offenses were committed. The trial judge had the jurors return to the box and, over the defendant\u2019s objection, gave them a traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction. Thereafter the defendant was convicted. Holding that the giving of the traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction was error, this Court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The <em>Burnette </em>opinion attempted to clarify the <em>Kelly </em>opinion and the law in this State concerning instructions to jurors regarding their deliberation responsibilities. We again reviewed the many cases and other authorities which had criticized the language of the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge because of its coercive elements. 280 Md. at 92-95, 371 A.2d 663. We pointed out that the American Bar Association had become persuaded of the validity of these criticisms, and had \u201cconcluded that the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge should no longer be used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95, 371 A.2d 663. After setting out the American Bar Association\u2019s suggested charge as approved in the <em>Kelly </em>case, the Court in <em>Burnette </em>flatly took the position that it is superior to the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge and avoids the coerciveness of that charge. <em>Id. </em>at 96-97, 371 A.2d 663. After reviewing the <em>Leupen </em>and <em>Kelly </em>cases, we stated that instructions which deviate from the ABA recommended charge will be \u201cclosely scrutinized to insure that they conform to the spirit of the American Bar Association\u2019s developed standards,\u201d and that the presence of the coercive \u201clanguage constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 371 A.2d 663. Finally, with regard to the language in <em>Kelly </em>relating to the permissibility of a trial judge\u2019s \u201cpersonalizing\u201d the charge, the <em>Burnette </em>Court held that the language must in substance be the same as the ABA approved charge. We thus stated <em>(ibid., </em>emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201cWe do not, therefore, require that the exact wording of the American Bar Association\u2019s approved instruction be the only instruction a trial judge may employ. He may \u2018personalize\u2019 this charge, adopting minor deviations in language which adjust the charge to the circumstances encountered. This must, however, be done cautiously and in the spirit of the American Bar Association language. <em>Deviations in substance will not meet with our approv</em>al.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">And we concluded <em>(id. </em>at 100-101, 371 A.2d 663):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cWe reiterate, however, our approval of the American Bar Association suggested instruction, and we emphasize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>further that the deviations from the American Bar Association standards permitted by <em>Kelly </em>are those primarily concerned with form and style. These types of minor word changes, which allow the instruction to be \u2018personalized,\u2019 remain properly within the province of the trial judge. Deviations in substance, however, are not permitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The <em>Burnette </em>opinion compels the rejection of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position in the two cases now before us. The factual situation in <em>Burnette </em>may have involved an instruction given after the jury retired to deliberate. Nevertheless, in disapproving the traditional <em>Allen </em>charge and requiring \u201cin substance\u201d the ABA recommended charge if a trial judge decides to give an instruction concerning jurors\u2019 deliberation responsibilities, the Court in <em>Burnette </em>did not distinguish between pre-deliberation and post-deliberation instructions. In fact, <em>Burnette </em>clearly indicated that no such distinction was intended insofar as the permissibility of a traditional <em>Allen </em>charge. In addressing that portion of the <em>Kelly </em>opinion dealing with a judge\u2019s latitude to \u201cpersonalize his <em>Allen </em>-type instruction ... before the jury retires,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <em>Burnette </em>opinion authorized only deviations from the ABA instruction which were \u201cconcerned with form and style,\u201d while stating that \u201c[djeviations in substance ... are not permitted.\u201d 280 Md. at 101, 371 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Moreover, <em>Burnette </em>compared in detail the traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction given in that case with the ABA recommended instruction, and flatly concluded that the traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction was coercive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even when traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Allen </em>instructions are given before juries retire to deliberate, the same coercion will frequently exist. We know from experience that in many cases juries are initially divided into majority and minority groups, and, whenever this occurs, the traditional <em>Allen </em>instruction given just before deliberations began may well impact upon the minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Therefore, under <em>Burnette v. State, supra, </em>the trial courts in these cases erred in giving traditional <em>Allen </em>charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASES REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASES FOR NEW TRIALS.

The Court in <em>Burnette </em>thus stated (280 Md. at 100, 371 A.2d 663): \"The instruction in this case begins by telling the jurors that \u2018absolute certainty cannot be expected,\u2019 whereas the American Bar Association\u2019s recommended instruction begins by pointing out that the verdict must be \u2018the considered judgment of each juror\u2019 and must be unanimous. The <em>Allen </em>instruction here does pay passing attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to the important principle that honest judgment, and not mere acquiescence, should be that basis of a juror\u2019s decision, but it does so within a concessive clause: <em>\u2018Although </em>the verdict must be ... [that] of each individual juror and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusions of his fellows.' Thus, the emphasis of the instruction falls upon the following clause, namely that questions are to be considered with \u2018proper regard and <em>deference </em>to the opinion of others.\u2019 Although a definition of the phrase \u2018proper regard and deference\u2019 is not given, the jury is later told that \u2018[i]f your views are contrary to those of the vast majority you should consider whether your views, which make no impression on the minds of so many equally intelligent jurors, are correct.\u2019 It is difficult to imagine a minority juror who would not be placed in some discomfort on hearing this instruction. Criticism runs directly to <em>him, </em>and he might understandably conclude that proper \u2018deference\u2019 to the opinions of the majority demands that he abandon his conscientious position. The \u2018equally intelligent\u2019 majority, on the other hand, receives only flattering attention in this instruction. It is subjected to no criticism and receives, as such, no admonitions. If anything, the instruction might tend to unduly strengthen the majority\u2019s convictions, perhaps making the majority less willing to seriously engage in further deliberations. For, by tacitly affirming the \u2018intelligence\u2019 of the majority\u2019s position, the trial judge gives it the gloss of acceptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">\"In sum, we believe that the <em>Allen </em>instruction given in this case was coercive, and constituted reversible error.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
