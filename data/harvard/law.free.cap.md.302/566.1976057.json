We are, however, unable to reach the merits of the case because the record clearly demonstrates that the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">On December 21, 1981, the County Commissioners of Charles County, Maryland (the County) issued a building permit to the Ripley Community Church. On January 6, 1982, the Department issued an order declaring that the permit was null and void and ordering the County to revoke it. The church immediately ceased construction. Both the County and the church unsuccessfully pursued administrative remedies within the Department. Between the summer of 1982 and the summer of 1983 the church removed all building materials and returned the site to its original condition. Under its provisions, the building permit expired if the work was not commenced within six months, or if the work was suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after commencement.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The County appealed the administrative finding to the Circuit Court for Charles County (Ahalt, J.) which by order dated June 8, 1984, affirmed the Department\u2019s order. The County appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Appellate courts do not sit to give opinions on ab-. stract propositions or moot questions. <em>Nat\u2019l Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n v.

In <em>Attorney Gen. v. A.A. Co. School Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749 (1979), we set forth the test for mootness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\"><em>See also Koontz v. Ass\u2019n of Classified Emp., </em>297 Md. 521, 529, 467 A.2d 753 (1983); <em>Hagerstown Repro. Health Serv. v. Fritz, </em>295 Md. 268, 271-72, 454 A.2d 846 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">It is clear from the record that the building permit has expired by its own terms. Whether the Department had the authority to declare the permit null and void is a purely academic question because the permit has expired. Furthermore, the merits of the case do not warrant review under the rule that an appeal, although moot, will be considered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cwhere there is an imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern, which may frequently recur, and which, because of inherent time constraints, may not be able to be afforded complete appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-9\"><em>Attorney Gen. v.
