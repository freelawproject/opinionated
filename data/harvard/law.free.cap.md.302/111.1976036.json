John Lee Leonard was indicted for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, simple possession, and conspiracy. Keith Krissoff entered his appearance as Leonard\u2019s assigned public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>On May 21, 1982, a hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on Leonard\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Leonard was not present. Sergeant Russell Hall of the Annapolis Police Department testified that he received information from a confidential informant that Leonard was selling heroin from a blue Grand Prix with New York registration in the vicinity of Clay and Washington Streets in Annapolis. Sergeant Hall found Leonard who, after some preliminary negotiations, sold Sergeant Hall \u201ca pharmacy fold\u201d of purported cocaine for fifty dollars. When the officer realized that the pharmacy fold was empty, he signaled his back-up unit to arrest Leonard. The automobile was taken to the Annapolis Police Station where a search conducted pursuant to a search warrant revealed thirteen glassine envelopes of heroin. The Circuit Court denied Leonard\u2019s motion to suppress this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">When the court called Leonard\u2019s case for trial on May 25, 1982, he requested a postponement to locate a witness known to him only by the name of \u201cFish.\u201d The trial court denied his request in the following colloquy with Leonard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amb\">COURT: That\u2019s clear. You\u2019ve had reasonable opportunity [to locate the witness]. You didn\u2019t even disclose this witness to your attorney. The court denies the request for a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">MR. LEONARD: What about...can I get...can I get appointed another counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">MR. LEONARD: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">COURT: Because I said so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">MR. LEONARD: Just because you say so, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s [Krissoff] fairly representing me. Why can\u2019t I get appointed other counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">COURT: He has done an...he\u2019s done an excellent job representing you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">MR. LEONARD: Well, he\u2019s not representing me, then. COURT: Well, you\u2019ve made your motion and I\u2019ve refused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Immediately after this exchange, Leonard unsuccessfully attempted to leave the courtroom. After sheriffs restrained him, Leonard explained that, \u201cI don\u2019t want an unfair trial. I don\u2019t want [Krissoff] to represent me. You can throw me in the bullpen. That\u2019s alright with me.\u201d Leonard then tried to leave the courtroom, but was again physically restrained by sheriffs. The court ordered the sheriffs to remove Leonard from the courtroom, and indicated that the trial would continue with Leonard outside the courtroom but that Krissoff could consult with Leonard whenever Krissoff liked.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Upon completing the voir dire of prospective jurors, the trial court allowed Krissoff to consult with Leonard concerning the remaining peremptory strikes and to ascertain whether Leonard wanted to return to the courtroom. After Krissoff consulted with Leonard, the following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">MR. KRISSOFF: Your Honor, for the record, Keith Krissoff ... subsequent to the Voir Dire of the jury I went down and conferred with Mr. Leonard. He indicated to me that it was his desire to represent himself in this matter. I explained to him what benefit I could be to him in the trial and indicated to him that I thought I could be of substantial benefit to him, that I thought he had a reasonable chance in this case. Despite that, he indicates that he wants to represent himself and I believe under the case law, if the court finds that that\u2019s what... COURT: I have no problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">MR. KRISSOFF: ... he really wants to do...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">COURT: I\u2019ll permit it provided he conducts himself in an orderly manner representing himself, but I won\u2019t discharge you. You\u2019ll remain as counsel for any consultation or any use that he may choose to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">MR. KRISSOFF: I have a problem with that, Your Hon- or, in that what am I doing at the trial table if I\u2019m not representing him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>COURT: You\u2019re there because of my order ... just as simple as that. Okay. Let\u2019s bring him up and see if he\u2019ll conduct himself in an orderly manner. Back to the trial table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">When Leonard returned to the courtroom, he advised the court that he wanted to conduct his own defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">COURT: Alright. You can approach the bench. (Bench conference)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">COURT: Mr. Leonard, at the bench, sir. (Defendant approaches the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">COURT: <em>I understand you want to conduct your own defense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">MR. LEONARD: <em>That\u2019s the only choice I got.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">COURT: <em>I take it your answer is 'yes?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">MR. LEONARD: <em>It\u2019s got to be yes. It\u2019s the only choice I have.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">COURT: <em>Alright. </em>I\u2019m going to allow Mr. Krissoff to stay ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">MR. LEONARD: <em>I don\u2019t want you to allow him to do nothing. I have a right to do it </em>(all in one man). . (Mr. Leonard\u2019s diction is not proper.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">COURT: Well, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">MR. LEONARD: (?)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-16\">COURT: You have a right to ... Mr. Leonard, do you want to let me finish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-17\">MR. LEONARD: You can finish, man. I\u2019m ready to go on with it. I don\u2019t want to hear no more you got to say about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-18\">COURT: Well, you\u2019re going to hear what I have to say. Mr. Krissoff is going to sit at the table. You can consult with him or not as...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-19\">MR. LEONARD: I\u2019m not consulting with him...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-20\">COURT: That\u2019s up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-21\">MR. LEONARD: ... I\u2019m letting you know now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-22\">COURT: That\u2019s up to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>MR. LEONARD: <em>So don\u2019t even put it on the record about he\u2019s a legal advisor for me, because he\u2019s not. </em>COURT: He\u2019s going to ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">MR. LEONARD: <em>He\u2019s not no legal advisor for me. </em>COURT: Are you finished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">MR. LEONARD: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">COURT: He\u2019s going to sit at the table for you to consult with. If you choose to avail yourself of him, that\u2019s your privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">MR. LEONARD: I don\u2019t need him. I don\u2019t want him there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">COURT: That\u2019s your ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">MR. LEONARD: Don\u2019t keep telling me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">COURT: I intend to keep telling you until I get it on the record exactly what I want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\">MR. LEONARD: I don\u2019t care what you want to do. COURT: Mr. Leonard ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">MR. LEONARD: I tell you, I don\u2019t care what you want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">COURT: ... you have a charge against you which is serious enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">MR. LEONARD: I\u2019m not guilty of the charge and you\u2019re trying to force me to try it because the witness ain\u2019t here to testify ... and (?) ... you\u2019re telling lies about me. COURT: Finished? Do you understand how we\u2019re proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-16\">MR. LEONARD: Sure. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">After the jury was selected and sworn, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-18\">The defendant has chosen to represent himself ... which is his privilege. I have ordered [Krissoff] to stay at the table for Mr. Leonard to consult or not to consult as he sees fit with his attorney of record. That\u2019s up to him. But he has indicated that he wishes to conduct his own defense and the court obviously is going to permit him to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The trial then proceeded, with Leonard acting as his own counsel. Leonard made opening and closing statements to the jury, interposed objections, cross-examined the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, and called two witnesses in his own defense. The trial court advised Leonard of his right to remain silent and made a motion for a directed verdict on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">At the conclusion of the case, the court asked Krissoff if he wished any particular jury instructions. Leonard interposed: \u201cI\u2019d like to state again that Mr. Krissoff is not representing me and he\u2019s not no legal advisor for me.\u201d Finally, Krissoff answered the question, summarizing his participation in the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">MR. KRISSOFF: Your Honor, I\u2019d like it put on the record that Mr. Leonard has indicated that he doesn\u2019t want me to represent him. I know the court has ordered me to be here. I\u2019ve been here, available for consultation, but out of respect for Mr. Leonard and his desire to proceed on his own, he has indicated he wants me to make no objections, to make no statements to the court, to make no statements to the jury ... I have honored his request and the court will note that throughout the trial I made no objections, even though I would have, obviously, had I been conducted the trial ... because that is Mr. Leonard\u2019s wish with regard to my participation in the case. I am going to honor that wish. I think the court should, obviously, instruct as it sees fit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The jury convicted Leonard of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and conspiracy, and the court sentenced him to ten years\u2019 imprisonment to run consecutive to any sentence Leonard was then serving. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence in an unreported per curiam opinion filed March 23, 1983, reasoning that Leonard\u2019s \u201ctactics did not indicate a waiver of his right to counsel. He clearly wanted new counsel. Under the circumstances he was not entitled to new counsel.\u201d We granted certiorari to determine the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Two independent constitutional rights are involved in this case: the right to be represented by counsel and the right to defend <em>pro se. </em>The rights are mutually exclusive and the defendant cannot assert both simultaneously. The United States Supreme Court and other courts throughout the nation have thus sought to protect the right to counsel unless the defendant properly asserts his right to represent himself. The assertion of this right is conditioned upon a valid waiver of the right to assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 71, 53 S.Ct. 55, 65, 77 L.Ed. 158, 171-72 (1932), the Supreme Court held that the right to assistance of counsel was guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concluded that due process requires that, at least in capital cases, counsel be appointed for a criminal defendant. The Supreme Court subsequently extended the right to assistance of counsel to all criminal defendants in federal courts and enunciated the standard of proof of waiver of the right to counsel. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). The <em>Johnson </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">It has been pointed out that \u201ccourts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of fundamental constitutional rights and that we \u201cdo not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u201d A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. The determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Id., </em>304 U.S. at 464, 58 S.Ct. at 1023, 82 L.Ed. at 1466 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>A decade after its decision in <em>Johnson </em>the Court elaborated on the waiver requirement in a case involving a defendant who had been indicted for conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act of 1917. <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948) (plurality opinion). In that case, Von Moltke was arrested by federal agents and was detained for over a month without the benefit of counsel. She was eventually taken to federal district court where, after signing a document stating that she waived the \u201c \u2018right to be represented by counsel at the trial of this case,\u2019 \u201d she pleaded guilty. No counsel was present during this proceeding. The plurality quoted <em>Johnson v. Zerbst </em>and its standard of proof of waiver of the right to counsel. The <em>Von Moltke </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">To discharge this duty properly in light of the strong presumption against waiver of the constitutional right to counsel, a judge must investigate as long and as thoroughly as the circumstances of the case before him demand. The fact that an accused may tell him that he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to waive this right does not automatically end the judge\u2019s responsibility. To be valid such waiver must be made with an\u2019 apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter. A judge can make certain that an accused\u2019s professed waiver of counsel is understandingly and wisely made only from a penetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances under which such a plea is tendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\"><em>Id., </em>332 U.S. at 723-24, 68 S.Ct. at 323, 92 L.Ed. at 321 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268, 275 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In 1963, the Court extended the right to counsel to all indigent defendants in state criminal proceedings. <em>Gide</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>on v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). Not until 1975, however, did the Court determine that a defendant in a state criminal trial has an independent constitutional right of self-representation under the sixth and fourteenth amendments. <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 566 (1975); <em>see McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 944, 950, 79 L.Ed.2d 122, 132 (1984) (\u201cThe right to appear <em>pro se </em>exists to affirm the dignity and autonomy of the accused and to allow the presentation of what may, at least occasionally, be the accused\u2019s best possible defense.\u201d); <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 267, 347 A.2d 219, 225 (1975); <em>see also State v. Berry, </em>287 Md. 491, 413 A.2d 557 (1980); <em>State v. Bryan, </em>284 Md. 152, 395 A.2d 475 (1978); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>284 Md. 113, 394 A.2d 1190 (1978). The <em>Faretta </em>Court cautioned, however, that a defendant may proceed <em>pro se </em>only when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. In this regard, the Court emphasized that the accused \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the court will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta v. California, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 582 (quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, supra, </em>317 U.S. at 279, 63 S.Ct. at 242, 87 L.Ed. at 275). The dissent in <em>Faretta, </em>however, pointed out that the majority failed to establish any practical procedural guidelines for courts to decide whether and how a defendant is to exercise the right to proceed <em>pro se. Faretta v. California, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 852, 95 S.Ct. at 2549-50, 45 L.Ed.2d at 591-92 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Interestingly, Maryland in 1972 had already recognized the constitutional implications of the right to counsel and the right of a defendant to represent himself if he intelligently and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. This recognition was evidenced in Maryland Rule 719, the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>cursor to Rule 723 c.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the rule is intended to implement the constitutional rights, our task is limited to determining whether the trial court complied with the dictates of Rule 723 c.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Rule 723 c provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABB\">c. <em>Waiver Inquiry.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">When a defendant indicates a desire or inclination to waive counsel, the court may not accept the waiver until it determines, after appropriate questioning on the record in open court, that the defendant possesses the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of his decision, and fully comprehends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">1. The nature of the charges against him, any lesser included offenses, and the range of allowable penalties, including mandatory and minimum penalties, if any;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">2. That counsel can render important assistance to him in determining whether there may be defenses to the charges or circumstances in mitigation thereof, and in preparing for and representing him at trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">3. That even if the defendant intends to plead guilty, counsel may be of substantial assistance in developing and/presenting information which could affect the sentence or other disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">4. That if the defendant is found to be financially unable to retain private counsel, the Public Defender or the court would, if the defendant wishes, provide counsel to represent him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">This rule establishes that when a defendant properly asserts the right to proceed <em>pro se </em>and has complied with the waiver provisions under Rule 723, the defendant has the right to self-representation absolutely. A brief review of our cases that have analyzed the waiver inquiry provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>in light of a defendant\u2019s desire or inclination to proceed <em>pro se </em>will make clear the operation of this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In <em>State v. Renshaw, supra, </em>defense counsel explained to the trial court on the first day of trial that Renshaw was dissatisfied with counsel\u2019s efforts and that Renshaw desired new counsel. When the trial court asked Renshaw why he desired new counsel, Renshaw responded that he felt that his appointed counsel lacked faith in him, that his counsel believed him to be lying, and that he lacked confidence in his counsel. The court denied Renshaw\u2019s request, but allowed Renshaw to proceed and expressly instructed defense counsel to stand by and assist Renshaw only if the latter so desired. During the trial Renshaw as well as his standby counsel remained silent. On appeal, we held that Renshaw\u2019s request for different counsel did not constitute a waiver of the sixth amendment right to counsel, and consequently the trial court should have taken steps to ensure effective legal representation for the defendant. <em>Id., </em>276 Md. at 268, 347 A.2d at 226. We noted that courts must indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver and may not presume waiver from a silent record. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 723 e (record must reflect compliance with waiver inquiry provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Four years after our decision in <em>Renshaw, </em>we had another opportunity to determine whether a trial court erred in failing to conduct a waiver of counsel inquiry under Rule 723 c. <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 406 A.2d 98 (1979). In <em>Snead, </em>the defendant urged the trial court on the first day of trial to consider his previously filed motion for a continuance, which had been filed on the basis that he was allegedly ill. During his discussion of the motion with the court, Snead expressed dissatisfaction with his assigned public defender and explained that he \u201cwould like to get a delay in this case to get my nephew and my family time to get another attorney.\u201d The court denied Snead\u2019s request, reminding him that he had had sufficient time to secure other counsel. Once Snead realized that the trial court was not going to grant the requested continuance, Snead told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>court, \u201cI don\u2019t want no attorney then.\u201d <em>Id., </em>286 Md. at 126, 406 A.2d at 100. The trial court did not accede to this demand and indicated that Snead would have to proceed with his appointed counsel. Snead\u2019s subsequent convictions were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported decision. We reversed, holding, that Snead\u2019s statement (\u201cI don\u2019t want no attorney then\u201d) was a sufficient assertion of his right to proceed <em>pro se. </em>We further held that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to conduct a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry to determine whether Snead\u2019s decision to represent himself was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We made clear in <em>Snead </em>that to establish the minimum \u201cdeclaration\u201d sufficient to constitute assertion of the right to self-representation, the \u201cdeclaration [must serve] to alert the trial judge that further inquiry may be necessary. Therefore, any statement by the defendant from which the court could reasonably conclude that the defendant desired self-representation would be sufficient.\u201d <em>Id., </em>286 Md. at 127, 406 A.2d at 101. Once a defendant indicates a desire or inclination to represent himself, the trial court must determine that the defendant\u2019s election to proceed <em>pro se </em>is unequivocal and that the defendant fully appreciates the consequences of proceeding without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">An examination of these cases in light of the requirements set forth in Rule 723 c demonstrates that a defendant is not required to utter a talismanic phrase so as to place the court on notice that he desires self-representation. \u201cAny statement by the defendant from which the court could reasonably conclude that the defendant desired self-representation would be sufficient.\u201d <em>Id., </em>286 Md. at 127, 406 A.2d at 101. In view of this standard, we must determine whether the trial court in the instant case committed reversible error in failing to conduct a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Although Leonard appeared at trial with appointed counsel, he requested that the trial court appoint other counsel to represent him. The trial court, in accordance with the dictates of <em>Renshaw, </em>determined that the defendant had not shown adequate cause and correctly denied this request. Leonard, however, did not stop there. Leonard made other statements before trial that, in our view, should have led the court reasonably to conclude that Leonard desired self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Immediately after the trial court denied Leonard\u2019s request for new counsel, Leonard stated, \u201cWell, [Krissoff is] not representing me,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want [Krissoff] to represent me.\u201d When Leonard was returned to the courtroom after he was ordered outside by the court, the following critical colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">COURT: <em>I understand you want to conduct your own defense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">MR. LEONARD: <em>That\u2019s the only choice I got.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">COURT: <em>I take it your answer is yes?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">MR. LEONARD: <em>It\u2019s got to be yes. It\u2019s the only choice I have.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">COURT: <em>Alright. </em>I\u2019m going to allow Mr. Krissoff to stay____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">MR. LEONARD: I don\u2019t want you to allow him to do nothing. I have a right to do it (all in one man). (Mr. Leonard\u2019s diction is not proper) [emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAC\">Leonard further insisted that Krissoff \u201cis no legal advisor for me\u201d and that he \u201cdon\u2019t need [Krissoff]\u201d and he \u201cdon\u2019t want him [at the defense table.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">It seems obvious to us that Leonard expressed in clear terms a \u201cdesire or inclination\u201d to represent himself, and that his statements should have led the trial court reasonably to conclude that Leonard desired self-representation. <em>Cf. Howell v. State, </em>293 Md. 232, 241, 443 A.2d 103, 107 (1982) (defendant at no time indicated a desire or inclination to proceed <em>pro se; </em>defendant persistently, repeatedly, and without deviation explicitly asserted that he wanted to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>represented by counsel). In particular, Leonard\u2019s affirmative response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether he wanted to conduct his own defense was, standing alone, sufficient to trigger an inquiry under Rule 723 c to ascertain whether he truly wanted to represent himself. Although the defendant\u2019s response in <em>Snead </em>that, \u201cI don\u2019t want no attorney then,\u201d differs in form from that of Leonard\u2019s response, we see no substantive difference between the two statements. Moreover, Leonard\u2019s insistence that he did not want to be represented by Krissoff dispels any contention that Leonard was seeking hybrid representation. <em>Cf. Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 99-101, 472 A.2d 953, 958-59 (defendant did not indicate a desire to defend <em>pro se </em>when he stated that he be allowed to defend himself \u201cto a degree\u201d; defendant was \u201cat best\u201d seeking hybrid representation, thereby foreclosing the need to conduct a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984). Because Leonard\u2019s statement was sufficient to alert the court that he desired self-representation, we conclude that the trial court was required to conduct the requisite inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The State seeks to avoid this conclusion by arguing that Leonard\u2019s behavior effectively prevented the trial court from conducting the requisite waiver of counsel inquiry. Under this theory, the State seems to contend that Leonard\u2019s behavior foreclosed and excused totally a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry. Although the proposition that a defendant\u2019s conduct may in some limited circumstances preclude a Rule 723 c inquiry is correct in the abstract, we are unable to agree with the State that this proposition has any application to these facts. A brief explanation of our rationale will reveal the flaw in the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The Maryland Rules governing waiver of counsel recognize that a defendant may waive his right to counsel by conduct. Md. Rule 723 d 2 (now Md. Rule 4-215(c)); <em>see Brown v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 651, 441 A.2d 354 (1982) (defendants by their actions effectively waived their right to counsel). For example, a defendant may waive his right to counsel, either affirmatively or by neglecting or refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>obtain counsel. Md. Rules 723 b 7, 723 d. Similarly, a defendant who engages in a pattern of deliberate, obstructionist misconduct may forfeit his right to self-representation. <em>See, e.g., Faretta v. California, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 834-35 n. 46, 95 S.Ct. at 2541 n. 46, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581 n. 46 (suggesting that court may terminate self-representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct); <em>United States v. Dujanovic, </em>486 F.2d 182, 187 (9th Cir.1973) (disruptive behavior may constitute constructive waiver of defendant\u2019s right of self-representation); <em>People v. Manson, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 1, 49-50, 139 Cal.Rptr. 275, 302-03 (1977) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 953, 98 S.Ct. 1582, 55 L.Ed.2d 803 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Chapman, </em>8 Mass.App. 260, 267 &amp; n. 6, 392 N.E.2d 1213, 1217-18 &amp; n. 6 (1979) (same); <em>People v. Krom, </em>91 A.D.2d 39, 45-46, 458 N.Y.S.2d 693, 698-99 (1983) (same), <em>aff'd, </em>61 N.Y.2d 187, 461 N.E.2d 276, 473 N.Y.S.2d 139 (1984); <em>Coleman v. State, </em>617 P.2d 243, 245 (Okla.Crim.App.1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">A related question, and one which the State argues is at issue in this case, is whether a defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct can ever rise to such a level to excuse a Rule 723 c inquiry. Our short answer to the State\u2019s argument is that circumstances may arise where the defendant is so disruptive during the trial court\u2019s attempt to advise him of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation that the court would be justified in terminating its inquiry. In our view, these circumstances would be rare indeed. When it does occur, however, the record must be indelibly clear that the trial court made reasonable efforts to comply with Rule 723 c. The defendant\u2019s disruptive and obstreperous conduct during these efforts must be of a magnitude such as effectively to thwart the court from complying with the Rule or to reduce the proceeding to a mockery. Under all the circumstances, the record must clearly reflect that the trial court made a reasonable effort to inform the defendant of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice </em>the record is devoid of any reasonable effort by the trial court to engage in a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry. When it seemed most logical for the trial court to conduct this inquiry, it merely reiterated that Krissoff would act as Leonard\u2019s standby counsel. Simply stated, the trial court made no attempt on the record to comply with Rule 723 c. Absent such an effort, we are unable to conclude that Leonard\u2019s 'conduct prevented the court from complying with Rule 723 c. It is obvious from the record that the trial court was annoyed, to say the least, by Leonard\u2019s courtroom behavior. But this annoyance, standing alone, does not justify foregoing the Rule 723 c inquiry. It may have been prudent under these circumstances to recess the proceedings to allow the defendant to calm down as well as to help the trial court maintain its bearing. As one court put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">After all, in spite of the lofty historical and intellectual approach of <em>Faretta, </em>those with trial experience are quite aware that every prospective pro per is not necessarily sincerely convinced that his decision to represent himself is going to assure him of a trial more fair than if he were represented by a skilled, and experienced professional. Whether the prospective pro per is a naive character who sincerely believes he can represent himself better than can a lawyer, a cagey loser who is going to try to reduce the trial to a shambles in the hope that somehow reversible error will creep in, a free soul with a touch of ham,.or simply someone who wants to have some fun with the judicial establishment, the trial judge must recognize that the first ground of appeal is probably going to be that the defendant was allowed to represent himself without having intelligently and voluntarily made that decision. Such are the facts of life. Therefore, pragmatically, and defensively, in addition to the legal necessity of establishing that a defendant voluntarily and intelligently reached this decision, the trial court should also protect itself\u2014and the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>People v. Lopez, </em>71 Cal.App.3d 568, 571-73, 138 Cal.Rptr. 36, 38 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Accordingly, because the record fails to indicate that Leonard\u2019s behavior prevented the trial court from making a reasonable effort to conduct a Rule 723 c waiver inquiry, we hold that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to conduct this inquiry in response to Leonard\u2019s desire to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
