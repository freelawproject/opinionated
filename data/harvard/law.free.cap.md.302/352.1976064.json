Jennings was a passenger in an automobile, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>owned by him and operated by his stepson Hong M. Kim, which was involved in an accident. At the time of the accident Mr. Jennings carried a policy of automobile liability insurance issued by Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). The policy contained the following exclusionary language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201cEXCLUSIONS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">When Section 1 does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">1. Bodily injury to an insured or any family member of an insured residing in the insured\u2019s household is not covered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">At the time of the accident Jennings and Kim resided in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Jennings brought a negligence action against his stepson Kim in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in the accident. GEICO received timely notification of the accident and of the suit but refused to provide a defense for Kim. Kim defaulted, and a default judgment was entered in favor of Jennings for one hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Jennings then brought the present declaratory judgment action against GEICO, again in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, seeking a declaration that GEICO was obligated, by virtue of the insurance policy issued to Jennings, to pay the judgment obtained against Kim. Jennings asserted that the household exclusion in the policy was \u201cvoid because it is contrary to statute.\u201d GEICO answered by denying liability on the basis of the household exclusion, which it claimed was valid. GEICO also sought a declaratory judgment that it was \u201cnot obligated to pay any claim or judgment obtained in favor of the Plaintiff ... against ... Kim as a consequence of the accident of October 3, 1981\u201d and that Jennings was \u201cnot entitled to any coverage under Section 1 of the policy ... on account of. any injuries sustained by him in the accident of October 3, 1981.\u201d Both sides filed motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Thereafter, the circuit judge signed and filed an order which simply stated \u201cthat the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by the Defendant Government Employees Insurance Company be and the same is hereby granted and judgment is hereby entered in favor of the Defendant.\u201d Later \u201c[\u00a1judgment ... in favor of the defendant\u201d was entered on the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Jennings took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to argument in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Before addressing the merits of the contentions on appeal, it is appropriate to comment upon a procedural point.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In an action properly brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act, the court ordinarily must declare the rights of the parties in light of the issues raised. Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-406 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 90-91, 400 A.2d 1091 (1979). In <em>Robert T. Foley Co. v. W.S.S.C., </em>283 Md. 140, 155, 389 A.2d 350 (1978), quoting from <em>Dart Drug Corp. v. Hechinger Co., </em>272 Md. 15, 29, 320 A.2d 266 (1974), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201c \u2018While a declaratory decree need not be in any particular form, it must pass upon and adjudicate the issues raised in the proceeding, to the end that the rights of the parties are clearly delineated____\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Moreover, if a plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that a contractual clause or legal provision is invalid, \u201cand the court\u2019s conclusion regarding ... validity ... is exactly opposite from the plaintiff\u2019s contention, nevertheless the court must, under the plaintiff\u2019s prayer for relief, issue a declaratory judgment setting forth the court\u2019s conclusion as to validity.\u201d <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 461 n. 3, 445 A.2d 343 (1982). <em>See also Woodland Beach Ass\u2019n v. Worley, </em>253 Md. 442, 448, 252 A.2d 827 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Finally, an order stating only that one party\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, such as the order filed in the present case, fails to comply with the Declaratory Judgments Act requirement that the court declare the parties\u2019 rights in light of the issues presented. <em>Robert T. Foley Co. v. W.S.S.C., supra, </em>283 Md. at 155, 389 A.2d 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Consequently, whether or not the household exclusion provision in the subject insurance policy is valid, the circuit court\u2019s order in this declaratory judgment action was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Turning to the merits, Jennings concedes that he falls within that class of persons barred from recovery under the language of the policy and that, therefore, GEICO is under no obligation to satisfy the outstanding judgment if the policy exclusion is valid. Jennings argues, however, that the exclusion is invalid under the public policy of Maryland embodied in the Transportation Article<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Insurance Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in that it denies the benefits of compulsory automobile liability insurance to a class of claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">GEICO, in defending the validity of the household exclusion clause, relies <em>inter alia </em>on the fact that no Maryland statutory provision expressly forbids the household exclusion in an automobile liability insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">It is settled that a clause in an insurance policy, which is contrary to \u201cthe public policy of this State, as set forth in ... the Insurance Code\u201d or other statute, is invalid and unenforceable. <em>Guardian Life Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 643, 446 A.2d 1140 (1982). <em>See, e.g., Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Metropolitan Life, </em>296 Md. 334, 340 n. 6, 463 A.2d 793 (1983); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 730, 436 A.2d 465 (1981); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 156, 416 A.2d 734 (1980); <em>Reese v.. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins., </em>285 Md. 548, 552 n. 1, 403 A.2d 1229 (1979); <em>State Farm v. Md. Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>277 Md. 602, 356 A.2d 560 (1976). In our view, the household exclusion clause is inconsistent with the public policy which the General Assembly adopted in Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972, providing for compulsory automobile insurance for all Maryland automobiles with specified required coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Prior to 1972, this Court upheld the applicability of household exclusions in automobile insurance policies under some circumstances but not under others. <em>Compare, e.g., Parker v. St. Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., </em>263 Md. 206, 209-211, 282 A.2d 503 (1971), and <em>Kelsay v. State Farm Insurance, </em>242 Md. 528, 219 A.2d 830 (1965), <em>with State Farm v. Briscoe, </em>245 Md. 147, 153, 225 A.2d 270 (1967) (\u201cthe probability that collusion ... could prejudice the insurer is so remote that the household exclusion does not operate to relieve the insurer from the obligation to defend\u201d). Beginning in 1972, however, the General Assembly substantially changed the public policy of this State with regard to motor vehicle insurance and reparations for damages caused by motor vehicle accidents. By Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972, as supplemented by later statutes such as Ch. 562 of the Acts of 1975, primarily codified in \u00a7\u00a7 17-101 through 17-110 of the Transportation Article, and \u00a7\u00a7 234B, 240AA through 242, 243 through 243L, 539 through 547 of the Insurance Code (Art. 48A), the General Assembly mandated that all Maryland automobiles, plus many other types of motor vehicles, be covered by automobile insurance policies containing certain types of required coverages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>automobile insurance policy must contain coverage for the following: liability insurance for the \u201cpayment of claims for bodily injury or death arising from an accident of up to $20,000 for any one person and up to $40,000 for any two or more persons;\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> property damage liability insurance of up to $10,000;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> medical, hospital, disability and funeral benefits up to $2,500 covering insureds and their families, as well as specified classes of other persons, regardless of fault;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Other coverages must be offered to an insured.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">In the same statutory provisions enacted in 1972 and thereafter, the General Assembly expressly authorized specified exclusions from the required coverages. For example, under Art. 48A, \u00a7 240C-1, where an insurer would be authorized to cancel or nonrenew an automobile insurance policy because of the driving record or claims experience of one or more but less than all of the insureds under the policy, the person or persons with the poor record can be excluded from the policy in lieu of cancellation or nonrenewal. Other permissible exclusions from certain coverages are set forth in Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 541(c)(2) and 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Although this Court has not considered the so-called household exclusion in light of the above-reviewed statutory provisions, we have taken the position that generally we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>will not insert exclusions from the required coverages beyond those expressly set forth by the Legislature. <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 725, 475 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, supra </em>288 Md. at 156, 159-160, 416 A.2d 734. The policy involved in the <em>Gartelman </em>case excluded from the medical, disability, etc. coverage mandated by Art. 48A, \u00a7 539, <em>(i.e., </em>the PIP coverage), an insured who is injured while occupying a motor vehicle owned by a named insured. Like GEICO in the case at bar, the insurer in <em>Gartelman </em>contended \u201cthat there is \u2018no statutory bar or evidence of intent to preclude such an exclusion,\u2019 \u201d 288 Md. at 155-156, 416 A.2d 734. This Court, in an opinion by Judge Davidson, held that the exclusion was invalid, saying <em>(id. </em>at 156, 416 A.2d 734):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u201cSection 545 expressly provides for only four exclusions from the required PIP coverage. It does not expressly provide an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured. We decline to insert such an exclusion which would be contrary to the remedial legislative purpose of assuring compensation for damages to victims of motor vehicle accidents____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Recently in <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., supra, </em>299 Md. at 725, 475 A.2d 454, Judge Couch for the Court, after quoting from <em>Gartelman </em>that \u201c \u2018[wjhere a statute expressly provides for certain exclusions, others shall not be inserted,\u2019 \u201d stated that \u201cwe are still in accord with the sound reasoning of <em>Gartelman </em>in light of the remedial purpose of Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 538-547.\u201d In our view, GEICO has offered no sound reason why this principle should not be applied to invalidate the household exclusion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In addition to the general principle applied in <em>Gartelman, </em>there is specific evidence that if the Maryland Legislature had intended to permit the household exclusion from required liability coverage, it would have said so. With respect to the required uninsured motorist coverage, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>General Assembly has provided in Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">\u201cHowever, the insurer may exclude from coverage benefits for the named insured or members of his family residing in the household when occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, an uninsured motor vehicle that is owned by the named insured or a member of his immediate family residing in his household.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">No similar provision has been enacted with regard to the required liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Under \u00a7 17-103(b) of the Transportation Article, setting forth the required security for liability claims, an automobile liability insurance policy \u201cshall provide for at least:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">(1) The payment of claims for bodily injury or death arising from an accident of up to $20,000 for any one person and up to $40,000 for any two or more persons, in addition to interest and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">(2) The payment of claims for property of others damaged or destroyed in an accident of up to $10,000, in addition to interest and costs____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The exclusion of a large category of claimants, suffering bodily injury arising from accidents, is not consistent with this language. Moreover, if any and all exclusions from this required liability coverage are valid as long as they are not expressly prohibited by statute, the purpose of compulsory automobile liability insurance could be frustrated to a significant extent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Finally, of the cases in other jurisdictions which have addressed the validity of the household exclusion subsequent to enactment of mandatory automobile liability insurance, a clear majority have invalidated the exclusion. <em>See, e.g., DeWitt v. Young, </em>229 Kan. 474, 625 P.2d 478 (1981); <em>Bishop v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>623 S.W.2d 865 (Ky.1981); <em>State Farm v. Sivey, </em>404 Mich. 51, 272 N.W.2d 555 (1978); <em>Transamerica Insurance Co. v. Royle, </em>656 P.2d 820 (Mont. 1983); <em>Estate of Neal v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>93 Nev. 348, 566 P.2d 81 (Nev.1977); <em>Kish v. Motor Club of America Insur. Company, </em>108 N.J.Super. 405, 261 A.2d 662, <em>cert. denied, </em>55 N.J. 595, 264 A.2d 68 (1970); <em>Hughes v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>236 N.W.2d 870 (N.D.1975); <em>Jordan v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>264 S.C. 294, 214 S.E.2d 818 (1975); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wyoming Ins. Dept., </em>672 P.2d 810 (Wyo.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">For example, the Supreme Court of Montana, in holding invalid the household exclusion, traced a statutory history in that state similar to the history in Maryland, stating <em>(Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle, supra, </em>656 P.2d at 822):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvH\">\u201cPrior to 1979, Montana law required only certain persons to demonstrate and maintain financial security____ Only those who had their driver\u2019s license revoked due to conviction or forfeiture of bail of certain motor vehicle laws were required to demonstrate financial security, i.e., obtain a liability insurance policy____ However in 1979 the legislature mandated liability insurance. Every vehicle owner is now required to certify to the county treasurer that he possesses an automobile liability insurance policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">From this history the court concluded (656 P.2d at 823):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ3c\">\u201cThe effect of the language of the Mandatory Insurance Law requires the liability policy to protect against bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>injury and property damage to \u2018any person.\u2019 In so providing, the legislature has expressly outlawed the \u2018household exclusion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In reaching a similar conclusion in <em>Bishop v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>623 S.W.2d at 865-866, the Supreme Court of Kentucky observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cBy enacting the MVRA [Motor Vehicle Reparations Act] the legislature established for the first time a system of compulsory insurance for the owners and operators of motor vehicles in Kentucky____ [The statutory scheme] specifies the minimum amounts of coverage that a motor vehicle owner or operator must carry to fulfill these requirements____ [W]hen the legislature stated the policy behind the MVRA and set forth its requirements it specified no exclusions from minimum coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The Kentucky court went on <em>(id. </em>at 866):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u201cAn exclusionary clause in an insurance contract which reduces below minimum or eliminates either of these coverages [basic reparation benefits and liability coverage] effectively renders a driver uninsured to the extent of the reduction or elimination. Because the . stated purpose of the MVRA is to assure that a driver be insured to a minimum level, such an exclusion provision contravenes the purpose and policy of the compulsory insurance act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">We agree with this and similar reasoning set forth in the above-cited cases. While many exclusions in automobile insurance policies do not conflict with legislative policy and are therefore valid, the so-called household exclusion from compulsory automobile liability insurance does not fall into such category. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that the household exclusion is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

In addition to mandating compulsory automobile insurance with required coverages, Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972 effected many other changes, such as creating the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund, a state-owned automobile insurance company, to insure persons having difficulty obtaining automobile insurance policies in the private sector, abolishing the former assigned risk program, abolishing the former Unsatisfied Claims and Judgment Fund and transferring to some extent its functions to the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund, enacting new procedures for the cancellation and nonrenewal of automobile insurance policies, and authorization under some cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>cumstances for prejudgment interest in money judgments in automobile personal injury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">For more detailed discussions of some of the changes made by Ch. 73 of the Acts of 1972, <em>see, e.g., Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. v.

GEICO also argued that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. v.

This is an overbroad interpretation of <em>Pinkney. </em>The instant case deals with a policy exclusion that would exclude classes of people. For example, family members of the named insured\u2019s household as well as the named insured are precluded from recovery. The person qua person is precluded from recovery. <em>Pinkney, </em>on the other hand, dealt with an exclusion based upon an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>taken by a person\u2014in that case, acquiring permission, or failing to do so, to drive the vehicle.
