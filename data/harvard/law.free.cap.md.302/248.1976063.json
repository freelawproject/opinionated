In all three cases, insurance companies sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>notices of proposed nonrenewal of automobile liability insurance policies; the insureds protested and requested hearings before the Insurance Commissioner; after hearings, the Insurance Commissioner disallowed the proposed actions and ordered the insurers to renew the policies, and the insurers sought judicial review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The controversy in each of the cases is the same. It involves two distinct sets of statutory provisions concerning automobile liability insurance ratemaking and the cancellation or nonrenewal of automobile liability insurance policies. Before setting out the facts of the cases, we shall briefly review the pertinent statutory sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Section 242 of the Insurance Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifically deals with rates, rate making, rating plans, etc., in certain lines of insurance, including automobile liability insurance. Section 242(c) provides that all rates shall be made in accordance with the principles set forth in that section. Subsection (c)(1) states that in ratemaking, consideration shall be given to various factors, including loss experience, expenses, and underwriting profit. Subsection (c)(2) mandates, <em>inter alia, </em>that rates not be \u201cinadequate.\u201d Different classifications reflecting variations among risks, having a demonstrable effect on losses, are authorized by subsection (c)(4). Under \u00a7 242(c)(6), the Insurance Commissioner is authorized to disapprove of rate filings unless the filer \u201cdemonstrates that the proposed rate is not excessive or inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Section 242(d) contains detailed requirements concerning the filing of rates and rating plans with the Insurance Commissioner, including the filing of \u201cevery modification of\u201d any \u201cclass rate, rating schedule or rating plan.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>tensive provisions relating to the approval or disapproval of filings are set forth in \u00a7 242(f). Section 242B of the Insurance Code provides for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decisions under \u00a7 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The other set of statutory provisions relevant to these cases is contained in \u00a7\u00a7 234A through 240H of the Insurance Code and concerns underwriting practices, discrimination in underwriting, cancellation or nonrenewal of policies, and related matters. The two pertinent sections are 234A and 240AA.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Section 234A sets forth substantive underwriting requirements for insurance risks, including automobile insurance risks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it prohibits refusals to underwrite, cancella<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tions of policies, or nonrenewals of policies based in whole or in part on race, color, creed, sex, or for any arbitrary, capricious or unfairly discriminatory reason. Prior to 1974, the thrust of the section was to proscribe discriminatory underwriting. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>273 Md. 467, 478-480, 330 A.2d 653 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">By Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974, however, the Legislature amended \u00a7 234A and went far beyond a proscription of discrimination in underwriting. That statute added a requirement that no insurer may cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew an insurance risk \u201cexcept by the application of standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.\u201d Ch. 752 also added the provision that, at \u201cany hearing to determine whether there has been a violation of this section, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the insurer to demonstrate that the ... refusal to ... renew is justified under the standards so demonstrated.\u201d The preamble to Ch. 752 states that insurers\u2019 underwriting decisions must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeq\">\u201cbe made solely on the basis of a reasonable application to relevant facts of underwriting principles, standards and rules that can be demonstrated objectively to measure the probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer <em>in light of the approved rating plan or plans of the insurer then in </em>effect____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">As pointed out in <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>273 Md. at 482-483, 330 A.2d 653, in referring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>new statutory language and the preamble, the General Assembly in Ch. 752 \u201cwished to move beyond the historic prejudices already proscribed by \u00a7 234A, [and] it did so in explicit fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In 1977 the Legislature further restricted an automobile insurer\u2019s right to nonrenew a policy, by amending \u00a7 234A to prohibit nonrenewals because of the existence of traffic violations or accidents more than three years old. <em>See </em>Ch. 314 of the Acts of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Whereas \u00a7 234A contains the substantive limitations on an insurer\u2019s underwriting decisions, \u00a7 240AA prescribes procedures and procedural limitations with regard to the cancellation or nonrenewal of motor vehicle liability insurance policies. The section states that an insurer who intends to nonrenew a policyholder must send written notice to the policyholder on or before forty-five days prior to the proposed effective date of the nonrenewal informing the policyholder of the insurer\u2019s reasons for nonrenewal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>insured has a right to protest the proposed nonrenewal, and such protest stays the nonrenewal pending a final determination by the Insurance Commissioner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>insured has a right to a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner or his designee. Section 240AA(f) reiterates the requirement in \u00a7 234A, that at such \u201chearing the insurer has the burden of proving its proposed action to be justified____\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The facts in the three cases before us are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">\n<em>The Carter Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On May 13, 1981, the American Motorists Insurance Company sent a notice to one of its insureds, Judith Carter of Timonium, Maryland, informing Mrs. Carter that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>insurer did not intend to renew her automobile liability insurance policy when it expired on July 1,1981. The notice (as explained by the insurer\u2019s representative at the later hearing) indicated that the nonrenewal decision was based on two incidents occurring in 1979 and 1981. On October 17, 1979, the insured automobile, operated by Mrs. Carter, struck another vehicle in the rear, causing property damage to both vehicles, although there were no personal injuries. Based upon this incident, Mrs. Carter was convicted in the District Court of Maryland of following too closely. On March 6, 1981, the insured automobile, again operated by Mrs. Carter, slid on some ice, spun around, and struck another vehicle. This too caused property damage to both vehicles, but there were no personal injuries. Mrs. Carter was not convicted of any traffic offense based on this second incident, although the insurer did pay a property damage claim made by the owner of the other vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The nonrenewal notice sent to Mrs. Carter went on to refer to a study done by the State of California, which concluded that a driver with a traffic violation over a three year period was 1.81 times more likely to have an accident within the next three years than a driver who had no traffic violations, and that the average driver is involved in an accident only once every twelve years. The nonrenewal notice then pointed out that the insurance company was entitled under its filed rating plan to surcharge Mrs. Carter for the two accidents but that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auq\">\u201ccomparison of the permitted surcharge with the probability of future loss through accident reveals that the company will not be compensated adequately based on the premium rate and the surcharge authorized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The nonrenewal notice concluded by stating that maintaining an insured such as Mrs. Carter \u201chas a direct adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>bearing on the economic and business purpose of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Mrs. Carter protested the proposed action of American Motorists Insurance Company and requested a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner. In addition, she submitted a detailed statement to the Insurance Commissioner for the purpose of showing that the accident on March 6, 1981, was not her fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">At the subsequent administrative hearing the sole witness for the insurance company was Ruth Sheehan, identified as \u201cUnderwriting Supervisor, Kemper Insurance.\u201d Miss Sheehan testified that the American Motorists Insurance Company views any Maryland driver with more than one accident or traffic violation within a three year period as an unacceptable risk.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She stated that this determination was based on studies, reports and \u201cthe company\u2019s own experience.\u201d Nevertheless, no studies or reports were introduced in evidence, and no data or evidence was submitted concerning the company\u2019s experience. Miss Sheehan did testify that a study conducted by the California Division of Motor Vehicles</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cconcluded that the average driver is involved in an accident every twelve years. And that that single predictor of accident involvement is the driver\u2019s conviction record. An operator convicted of one conviction within a three-year period has 1.95 times the increased probability of an accident than does the violation-free driver. And the driver that\u2019s involved in two accidents within a three-year period has 2.93 times the increased probability of another accident than does the accident-free operator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Miss Sheehan went on to testify that American Motorists would be able, under its rating plan filed with the Maryland Insurance Commissioner, to surcharge Mrs. Carter for both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>of the accidents. Her direct testimony, under the questioning by the insurer\u2019s counsel, concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201cQ Is the\u2014are the premiums the company is allowed to charge, including the surcharge for these two accidents, sufficient to offset the increased risk of loss indicated by a person with Miss Carter\u2019s driving record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cA No, because we feel in comparison to the surcharge to the increased probability of future loss, does not compensate the company for the increased risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cQ You\u2019re saying that the increased risk is greater than is the increased premium that is allowed to be charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201cA That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cQ Does the company take this\u2014will the company take the same action when any. of its insureds in Maryland, that it is aware, has more than one accident or violation within a three-year period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cA It most certainly does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cQ And, were any factors other than the accidents and violations considered when the company sent out the notice of intent not to renew?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Following the hearing the Insurance Commissioner, by the Hearing Officer, issued a written order concluding that nonrenewal of Mrs. Carter\u2019s policy \u201cis in violation of Sections 234A, 240AA of Article 48A\u201d and ordering that \u201cthe Licensee [insurer] continue in effect the insurance coverages.\u201d Among the \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d the Hearing Officer found that the insurer \u201chas failed to produce evidence which demonstrates that its underwriting standards are reasonably related to its economic and business purposes.\u201d In addition, the Hearing Officer found that the \u201clicensee has a surcharge plan it can apply to the accidents of Mrs. Carter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\n<em>The Matthews Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">James E. Matthews of Baltimore City had an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Casualty Company. On August 11, 1981, Lumbermen\u2019s sent Mr. Matthews a \u201cNotice Of Intent Not To Renew\u201d which was virtually identical to the notice sent by American Motorist in the <em>Carter </em>case, although the incidents forming the basis for the decision were three traffic violations in 1980. As in the <em>Carter </em>case, the notice sent to Mr. Matthews referred to the study done in California, recited that the insurer was entitled to surcharge Mr. Matthews under its filed rating plan, complained that the surcharged rates under the rating plan were inadequate, and stated that keeping an insured such as Mr. Matthews \u201chas a direct adverse bearing on the economic and business purpose of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Mr. Matthews protested the intended action and requested a hearing before the Insurance Commissioner or his designee. At the administrative hearing, the only witness for Lumbermen\u2019s was again Ruth Sheehan, \u201cunderwriting supervisor\u201d for the Kemper Insurance Group. Miss Sheehan initially testified that the reason for the nonrenewal was that Mr. Matthew\u2019s driving record, dated September 9, 1981, disclosed three traffic convictions, namely an automatic signal violation on January 30, 1980, exceeding the speed limit on May 31, 1980, and failure to obey a stop or yield sign on October 26, 1980. Miss Sheehan reiterated that, under Lumbermen\u2019s underwriting guidelines, \u201cany operator with more than one accident or conviction within a three year period is an unacceptable operator\u201d so as to \u201cdisqualify this person for continued coverage with Lumbermen\u2019s.\u201d She stated again that this guideline was based on the company\u2019s \u201cown experience as well as various studies,\u201d including the \u201cCalifornia study.\u201d As in the <em>Carter </em>case, Miss Sheehan offered, no data or evidence with respect to the company\u2019s experience, and none of the \u201cstudies\u201d was introduced in evidence. Miss Sheehan did say that, \u201camong major conclusions reached by this [California] study are\u201d that the \u201cbest single predictor of accident involves conviction record,\u201d and that an \u201coperator with three moving traffic violations within a three year period has 3.54 times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>an increased probability of an accident than does a violation free driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Miss Sheehan acknowledged that Lumbermen\u2019s rating plan on file covered the instant situation, that it authorized a surcharge for certain initial traffic violations but not others, and that it allowed surcharges for Mr. Matthews\u2019s second and third violations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She went on to testify that the company would refuse to renew any of its drivers in Maryland who have more than one moving traffic violation over a three year period, despite its ability to surcharge under the rating plan. She stated that the amount of the surcharge under the rating plan \u201cdoes not compensate the company for the increased risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Mr. Matthews testified that he had been driving in Maryland since 1963 when he was discharged from the Air Force, that he had never had an accident, and that he had had no traffic violations on his record since 1963 except for the three tickets which he received and paid in 1980. Even though the study itself was not in evidence, Mr. Matthews stated that the California study relied on by Lumbermen\u2019s was \u201cdone ... sometime before 1968.\u201d Mr. Matthews also disputed Miss Sheehan\u2019s testimony concerning the \u201cconclusions\u201d of the California study. Mr. Matthews submitted into evidence Lumbermen\u2019s current rating plan which the company had filed with the Insurance Commissioner and the Commissioner had approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Lumbermen\u2019s counsel argued that the ability of the insurer to surcharge under its rating plan did not furnish a ground for upholding Mr. Matthews\u2019s protest, as \u201cthe amount of the surcharge does not adequately compensate the company.\u201d Counsel made the \u201cproffer\u201d that, were she asked, Miss Sheehan would testify that the surcharges under the plan were adequate only when there were \u201cfamily automobile policies in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>you have more than one driver, each having one ... accident or violation,\u201d but with no individual driver having more than one accident or violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Subsequently the Insurance Commissioner, by the Hearing Officer, filed an order finding that \u201cthe Licensee [insurer] has failed to show how this risk exceeds the surcharge capability of the Licensee\u2019s approved rating plan.\u201d The order concluded that Lumberman\u2019s had violated Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 234A and 240AA, and it required that Lumbermen\u2019s continue in effect Mr. Matthews\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\n<em>The Grainger Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Lumbermen\u2019s had also issued an automobile liability insurance policy to Jana Grainger of Laurel, Maryland. The insurer, on May 7, 1981, sent Miss Grainger a nonrenewal notice which referred to two traffic violations in 1980. Otherwise the notice was identical to the notices in the other two cases, referring to the inadequacy of the surcharges under the rating plan, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">As did the insureds in the other two cases, Miss Grainger protested and requested a hearing. The hearing was similar to those in <em>Carter </em>and <em>Matthews, </em>except that Lumbermen\u2019s sole witness was Donald M. Schlear, identified as the \u201cpersonalized underwriting supervisor with the Kemper Insurance Group.\u201d Mr. Schlear testified that the nonrenewal of Miss Grainger\u2019s policy was because of a conviction on April 17, 1980, for exceeding the speed limit and a conviction on May 16, 1980, for failure to obey a traffic device. Mr. Schlear also testified that Lumbermen\u2019s refuses to renew all policy holders who have more than one moving violation over a three year period, and that this underwriting decision is based on the insurer\u2019s own \u201cexperience\u201d and on \u201cstudies.\u201d Again, no data or evidence concerning Lumbermen\u2019s experience was offered, and no studies were offered into evidence. Mr. Schlear also testified that under its filed rating plan Lumbermen\u2019s could surcharge for both of Miss Grainger\u2019s traffic violations but that the surcharges under the plan do \u201cnot compensate the company for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>increased risk.\u201d He concluded by testifying that the surcharges in the rating plan are not \u201cadequate to provide sufficient premiums to offset the risk of loss shown by a driver with two violations within a three-year period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Miss Grainger testified concerning the circumstances underlying the two traffic convictions, stated that she had received no traffic tickets since those convictions, and testified that she had never been involved in a traffic accident. After the testimony had concluded, the Hearing Officer found that the nonrenewal was \u201cin violation of Seetion[s] 234A and 240AA, and the company\u2019s action will be disallowed, and the company will be allowed to surcharge for the violations but must remain on the risk.\u201d These findings were later embodied in a written order of the Insurance Commissioner, signed on behalf of the Commissioner by the Hearing Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The two insurers sought judicial review of all three decisions in the Baltimore City Court (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City). The cases were consolidated, and the court upheld the administrative decisions. The insurers took appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to argument in the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">It is clear in all three of these cases that the gist of the insurers\u2019 complaint, and the basis for the proposed nonrenewals, was the insurers\u2019 belief that the surcharge rates in the filed and approved rating plans were insufficient with respect to Maryland insured drivers having more than one accident or violation over a three year period. The companies\u2019 position was that the automobile liability policies of <em>all </em>of their Maryland insured drivers who fell within this allegedly inadequate rating category should not be renewed. The argument is that the asserted rate inadequacy for this broad category of insureds is \u201creasonably related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 234A, as amended by Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974, and that, therefore, it is justification under that section for the nonrenewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The Insurance Commissioner, both at the administrative level and before this Court, has rejected the insurers\u2019 position on alternate grounds. First, the Commissioner found that the insurers did not, factually, meet their burden of proving that the surcharge rating plan was inadequate or that, because of the driving records of the three insureds, continuation of the insurance presented risks for which the insurers would not be compensated. The Commissioner contended that this finding is supported by the record. <em>Second, </em>the Commissioner has taken the position that, as a matter of law, when an automobile liability insurer\u2019s filed and approved rating plan provides surcharges for certain underwriting factors which increase the risk of accident, the insurer cannot ignore its surcharge plan and refuse to renew an insured\u2019s policy because of the presence of those identical underwriting factors. In other words, the asserted inadequacy of the rates in an insurer\u2019s approved rating plan is not encompassed by \u00a7 234A\u2019s justification for nonrenewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In general, we agree with both arguments by the Insurance Commissioner. Therefore we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Even if it be assumed, arguendo, that the inadequacy of an insurer\u2019s surcharges under its filed and approved rating plan could, as a matter of statutory interpretation, constitute justification for nonrenewal under \u00a7 234A as that section was amended by Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974, the statutory provisions still place the burden of proving justification upon the insurer. Here, the Insurance Commissioner found that the insurers had not met the burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Under \u00a7 240AA(h) and \u00a7 40 of the Insurance Code, the basic standard for reviewing an administrative finding by the Insurance Commissioner is whether the finding is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d This means whether \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached,\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Doctors\u2019 Hospital v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>302 Md. 193, 200-201, 486 A.2d 744 (1985), quoting from <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978), and <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309, 236 A.2d 282 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In oyr view, a reasoning mind could have reasonably found that the insurers failed to prove that the surcharges under their rating plans were insufficient to compensate for the increased risk presented by the traffic violations or accidents in these cases. Other than a reference to the amount of the surcharges for each of the three insureds specified in the filed and approved rating plans, not a shred of evidence was introduced concerning the amount of premium revenue which would likely be produced from the companies' Maryland insureds in the rating classifications having surcharges for two or more violations or accidents over a three year period. Absolutely no evidence was presented with regard to the additional compensation to the companies from the surcharges, other than the bald conclusory statement by each of the two underwriters that it would be \u201cinadequate.\u201d Moreover, no evidence was introduced concerning the loss experience of these two companies with insureds having more than one traffic violation or accident over a three year period. None of the \u201cstudies\u201d or \u201creports\u201d referred to was introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">There was no data or factual basis, in any of these three cases, for the Insurance Commissioner to have concluded that the increased premiums available under the rating plans would not have adequately compensated the insurance companies for the asserted increased risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">There is a more fundamental reason, however, why the insurance companies cannot prevail in these cases. If the insurers had demonstrated the amount of increased risk presented by these three insureds, and had proven that the surcharged rates in the filed and approved rating plans were inadequate to compensate the insurers for such increased risk, this would not, under the circumstances here, have furnished justification for the nonrenewals under \u00a7 234A, as amended by Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974. The justification for cancellation or nonrenewal set forth in that statute, namely that the insurer must demonstrate that the standards applied \u201care reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes,\u201d does not encompass the situation where the gist of the insurer\u2019s complaint is that its filed and approved rating plan, covering the specific situation involved, is inadequate. We do not believe that the Legislature intended that a proceeding under \u00a7\u00a7 234A and 240A could be converted into a rate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The legislative intent in this regard is clearly shown by the language of Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974. As previously set forth, the Preamble to Ch. 752 states that cancellations and nonrenewals must be on the basis of \u201cprinciples, standards and rules that can be demonstrated objectively to measure the probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer <em>in light of the approved rating plan or plans of the insurer then in </em>effect----\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the instant cases, instead of applying an underwriting standard \u201cin light of the approved rating plan,\u201d the insurers have attempted to attack the approved rating plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Also, as the language of Ch. 752\u2019s Preamble underscores, the justification for nonrenewal must relate to \u201cthe probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer.\u201d But, under the ratemaking statute, \u00a7 242, where a rating plan has been approved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the Insurance Commissioner, and such approval has become final,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the rating plan as a matter of law is \u201cadequate.\u201d As previously discussed, the Insurance Commissioner is precluded from approving a rating plan unless it is adequate. Permitting an insurer to challenge the adequacy of its finally approved rating plan in a proceeding under \u00a7\u00a7 234A and 240AA, would create a conflict between those sections and \u00a7 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Even if the language of \u00a7 234A, as amended by Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974, were less clear, and if the general language of \u00a7 234A arguably covered the insurers\u2019 complaints in the present cases, the result would not be different. Section 242 is a specific statute dealing with rating plans and their adequacy. Section 242(d) expressly authorizes an insurer to file with the Insurance Commissioner a proposed modification of its rating plan if it is dissatisfied with the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">It is an often repeated principle that a specific statutory provision governs over a general one. <em>Director of Fin., Pr. Geo\u2019s Co. v. Cole, </em>296 Md. 607, 635, 465 A.2d 450 (1983); <em>Zellinger v. CRC Dev. Corp., </em>281 Md. 614, 625, 380 A.2d 1064 (1977); <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Laurel, </em>262 Md. 171, 182-183, 277 A.2d 262 (1971); <em>Rafferty v. Comptroller, </em>228 Md. 153, 158, 178 A.2d 896 (1962). Thus where one statutory provision specifically addresses a matter, and another more general statutory provision also may arguably cover the same matter, the specific statutory provision is held to be applicable and the general provision is deemed inapplicable. As this Court stated in <em>Maguire v. State, </em>192 Md. 615, 623, 65 A.2d 299 (1949), quoting from <em>United States v. Chase, </em>135 U.S. 255, 260, 10 S.Ct. 756, 757-758, 34 L.Ed. 117 (1890):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is an old and familiar rule that \u201cwhere there is, in the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u201d <em>Pretty v. Solly, </em>26 Beav. 610, per Romilly, M.R..... This rule applies wherever an act contains general provisions and also special ones upon a subject which, standing alone, the general provisions would include.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">To the same effect, <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>Bulova Watch Co. v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 753, 761, 81 S.Ct. 864, 869, 6 L.Ed.2d 72 (1961); <em>Criminal Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495, 331 A.2d 55 (1975); <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 133-134 n. 1, 328 A.2d 293 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Consequently, when an automobile liability insurer\u2019s complaint is over the adequacy of its filed and approved rating plan, \u00a7 242 is the specific statute dealing with the matter, and the controversy is not encompassed by \u00a7\u00a7 234A and 240AA.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">If the two insurers in these cases desired greater surcharges for insured drivers having more than one traffic violation or accident in a three year period, they could have applied for such modification of their rating plans under \u00a7 242. Or, if the insurers decided that they did not wish to insure such risks, they could similarly have sought to modify their rating plans by deleting this classification of risks. But, in our view, proceedings under \u00a7 234A and 240AA were not intended to encompass challenges to the adequacy of rating plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">.

The language of \u00a7 242(c) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u201c(c) <em>Making of </em>rates.\u2014All rates shall be made in accordance with the following principles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(1) Due consideration shall be given to (i) past and prospective loss experience within and outside this State; (ii) conflagration and catastrophe hazards, if any; (iii) past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specially applicable to this State; (iv) underwriting profits; (v) contingencies; (vi) investment income from unearned premium reserve and reserve for losses; (vii) dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders; (viii) and to all other relevant factors within and outside this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">(2) Rates shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">(3) The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer, or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expense provisions are applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">(4) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference among risks that are demonstrated objectively to the Commissioner to have had a direct and substantial effect upon losses or expenses. However, no rate may be based partially or entirely on geographic area itself, as opposed to underlying risk considerations, even though expressed in geographic terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">(5) Uniformity among insurers in any matters within the scope of this subsection is neither required or prohibited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">(6) Unless the filer demonstrates that the proposed rate is not excessive or inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, the Commissioner may disapprove the filing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">By Ch. 737 of the Acts of 1984, the General Assembly added new sections 244 through 244V to the Insurance Code. These are new provisions concerning rate making, in effect from 1984 to 1986, and, while effective, they render certain provisions of \u00a7 242 inapplicable. Ch. 737 has no application to the cases at bar. Moreover, even if it did, the essential reasoning and result of this opinion would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\">.

In the case of a cancellation of or refusal to renew a policy, provided the insured requests of the Commissioner that a review be undertaken of the insurer\u2019s action prior to the effective date of termination of the policy, and provided the Commissioner initiates action toward issuance of a finding in accord with \u00a7 234C, such policy shall remain in effect until such finding is issued. No insurer, agent or broker may cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk except by the application of standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.
