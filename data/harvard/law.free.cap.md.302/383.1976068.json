The dispute is between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>primary and excess medical malpractice insurers of an obstetrician. The question is whether the causes of action of a brain-damaged infant for personal injuries and of the infant\u2019s father for consequential expenses are subject to but one, or to two separate, limit(s) of liability under the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The primary carrier is the Pacific Indemnity Company (Pacific), which was a defendant in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in the action giving rise to the proceeding before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The excess insurer is Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Company (Interstate), which was the plaintiff in the United States District Court. Their insured was Dr. Vibhakar J. Mody (Dr. Mody). On September 14, 1979, a statement of claim was filed in the Health Claims Arbitration Office of Maryland against certain health care providers, including Dr. Mody. The claimants were an infant, George M. Cross, Jr. (George Jr.), and his parents, George M. Cross, Sr. (George Sr.) and Barbara Ann Cross (Barbara Ann). Each claimant alleged negligence by Dr. Mody in rendering obstetrical services. Money awards were claimed on behalf of George Jr. for brain damage, by George Sr. for the past and prospective expenses of George Jr. consequential to the brain damage, and by Barbara Ann for a tearing of the vaginal and perineal areas. The two insurers settled these claims by a total payment of $560,-500. As allocated between claimants the settlement is $350,000 on the infant\u2019s claim, $200,000 on the father\u2019s claim, and $10,500 on the mother\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We are concerned with the $200,000 allocated to George Sr. which Interstate supplied for the total settlement. Interstate now claims that $200,000 from Pacific in the federal litigation on the theory that it was the primary carrier\u2019s obligation to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d section of the declaration sheet of Pacific\u2019s policy provides: \u201c$200,000 each claim $600,000 aggregate.\u201d Pacific\u2019s position is that \u201ceach claim\u201d for policy limit purposes is not synonymous with a cause of action in legal theory for presenting a claim in a common law action in a Maryland court. Pacific says that one $200,000 limit applies to Barbara Ann\u2019s claim and another $200,000 limit applies to the infant\u2019s claim which, for purposes of limits under the policy provisions, includes the derivative claim of George Sr. Interstate\u2019s position is that three separate $200,000 limits are implicated with one limit applying to the claims of father, mother, and child respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The United States District Court for the District of Maryland concluded that Pacific\u2019s policy was unambiguous and entered summary judgment in favor of Interstate for $200,000. <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pacific Indent. Co., </em>568 F.Supp. 633 (D.Md.1983). Pacific\u2019s appeal resulted in transmittal of the certified question to us. <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pacific Indent. Co., </em>738 F.2d 638 (4th Cir.1984). That question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">Construing Pacific\u2019s policy under Maryland law, is Pacific liable to pay a separate $200,000 policy limit to Interstate for the claim of George M. Cross, Sr. for the financial injury sustained by him as a result of the insured\u2019s alleged malpractice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In responding to this question we shall first state the principles applied under Maryland law to the construction of insurance contracts. They are by no means unique to this state. We shall then apply those principles to Pacific\u2019s policy. As will be seen, that application does not produce a categorical answer to the certified question. In order to comply with the spirit of the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act under these circumstances, we shall then explicate how this Court would decide an appeal from a Maryland circuit court which presented the certified question on the same record which was made in the federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Construction of insurance contracts in Maryland is governed by a few well-established principles. An insurance contract, like any other contract, is measured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation, or public policy is violated thereby. <em>Bond v. Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>289 Md. 379, 424 A.2d 765 (1981); <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pinkney, </em>284 Md. 694, 399 A.2d 877 (1979); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 365 A.2d 1000 (1976). To determine the intention of the parties to the insurance contract, which is the point of the whole analysis, we construe the instrument as a whole. <em>Aragona v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>281 Md. 371, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977); <em>Federal Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>275 Md. 460, 341 A.2d 399 (1975); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Bierman, </em>266 Md. 420, 292 A.2d 674 (1972); <em>Mills v. Judd, </em>256 Md. 144, 259 A.2d 267 (1969); <em>Simkins Industries, Inc. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>42 Md.App. 396, 401 A.2d 181, <em>cert. denied, </em>285 Md. 730 (1979). Maryland courts should examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 229 A.2d 70 (1967); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>142 Md. 454, 121 A. 379 (1923); <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>52 Md.App. 269, 447 A.2d 896 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In so doing, we accord words their ordinary and accepted meanings. The test is what meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term. This Court has consulted <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary, Random House Dictionary, or, </em>less often, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. See, e.g., DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 475 A.2d 454 (1984) (\u201cuse of a motorcycle\u201d); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 438 A.2d 282 (1981) (\u201coccurrence\u201d); <em>Fisher v. Tyler, </em>284 Md. 100, 394 A.2d 1199 (1978) (\u201cloan\u201d and \u201cused under contract in behalf of\u201d); <em>Aragona, supra, </em>(\u201cany dishonest, fraudulent, criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>... act ... of ... partner\u201d); <em>C &amp; H Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>264 Md. 510, 287 A.2d 238 (1972) (\u201closs caused by infidelity of an ... employee\u201d); <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 261 A.2d 747 (1970) (\u201ccollapse\u201d) and cases cited therein; <em>Hurt v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>175 Md. 403, 2 A.2d 402 (1938) (\u201cdamages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In the first instance the inquiry is confined to analysis of the language used. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Marks Rentals, Inc., </em>288 Md. 428, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980); <em>Benton, supra; Levy v. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>195 Md. 537, 73 A.2d 892 (1950). Courts may construe unambiguous contracts as a matter of law. <em>Aragona; C &amp; H Plumbing; DeJames, </em>all <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The language used may be ambiguous if it is \u201cgeneral\u201d and may suggest two meanings to a reasonably prudent layperson. <em>Pryseski, supra; Truck Ins. Exchange, supra. </em>If the language of the contract is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be consulted to determine the intention of the parties and whether the ambiguous language has a trade usage. <em>Pryseski, supra; Truck Ins. Exchange, supra; Planters Mut. Ins. Co. v. Deford, </em>38 Md. 382 (1873); <em>Baltimore Fire Ins. Co. v. Loney, </em>20 Md. 20 (1863). Construction of the contract by the parties to it before the controversy arises is an important aid to interpretation of uncertain terms. <em>Hurt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">If the extrinsic evidence presents disputed factual issues, construction of the ambiguous contract is for the jury. The court may construe an ambiguous contract if there is no factual dispute in the evidence. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">A sampling of contract terms found ambiguous includes <em>Pryseski, supra, </em>292 Md. at 196-98, 438 A.2d at 287-88 (meaning of \u201coccurrence\u201d); <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>288 Md. at 433, 418 A.2d at 1190 (meaning of \u201coperate under his Thrifty Rent-A-Car franchise\u201d); and <em>DeJames, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>supra, </em>256 Md. at 719-25, 261 A.2d at 749-52 (meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Illustrative of contract terms found unambiguous are <em>DeJarnette, supra, </em>299 Md. at 714-22, 475 A.2d at 457-61 (meaning of \u201cus\u00e9 of a motorcycle\u201d); <em>Fisher, supra, </em>284 Md. at 110-12, 394 A.2d at 1204-06 (meaning of \u201cloan\u201d); <em>Aragona, supra, </em>281 Md. at 374-75, 378 A.2d at 1348-49 (meaning of \u201cany dishonest, fraudulent, criminal ... act ... of ... partner\u201d); <em>Benton, supra, </em>278 Md. at 544-46, 365 A.2d at 1003-04 (\u201c[n]o person may recover benefits as prescribed by law and afforded under this insurance from more than one motor vehicle liability insurance policy on either a duplicative or supplemental basis\u201d); and <em>C &amp; H Plumbing, supra, </em>264 Md. at 513-17, 287 A.2d at 239-42 (meaning of \u201closs by infidelity of an ... employee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The printed heading on Pacific\u2019s policy is: \u201cObstetricians\u2019 and Gynecologists\u2019 Professional Liability and Professional Premises Liability Policy.\u201d As the policy form is designed, Part I provides coverage for professional services liability, while Part II would afford professional premises liability coverage. The declarations indicate that Dr. Mody did not purchase Part II coverage. With respect to Part I the declarations reflect that Dr. Mody had \u201cIndividual Coverage\u201d as opposed to \u201cPartnership Coverage\u201d or \u201cCorporation Coverage.\u201d The dollar amounts for \u201ceach claim\u201d and \u201caggregate\u201d were typed in the preprinted limits of liability portion of the declarations. By preprinted declaration Dr. Mody represented that he was \u201cengaged in practice as an OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">We reproduce below the relevant provisions from Part I. Words which Interstate emphasizes are reproduced in italics and words which Pacific emphasizes are underlined.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">In consideration of the payment of the premium, in reliance upon the statements in the declarations made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>part hereof and subject to all of the terms of this policy, the company agrees with the named insured as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">I.

DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">When used in reference to this insurance: damages means all damages, including damages for death, which are payable because of <em>injury </em>to which this insurance applies, and <em>injury </em>includes libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of rights of privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">each claim means all claims or suits brought on account of <em>injury </em>sustained by any one person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">Interstate argues that the policy does not expressly limit \u201cinjury\u201d to bodily injury and that \u201cinjury\u201d literally em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>braces the economic injury suffered by George Sr. The district court agreed. It \u201cconcluded that no ambiguity exist[ed] in connection with the interpretation of [the] policy,\u201d 568 F.Supp. at 638, after having said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">The word \u201cinjury\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe invasion of any legally protected interest of another,\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 7 (1965), and as \u201cAny wrong or damage done to another, either in his person, rights, reputation or property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951). [568 F.Supp. at 637-38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Nothing expressed in Pacific\u2019s policy contradicts an interpretation under which \u201cinjury\u201d carries a meaning identical to its Restatement usage. If one assumes Interstate\u2019s reading, the economic injury of George Sr. falls within Coverage A because, under Maryland law, the subject invasion of George Sr.\u2019s economic interest gives rise to a cause of action in George Sr. in addition to the action of George Jr. <em>See Meyers v. Meagher, </em>277 Md. 128, 352 A.2d 827 (1976); <em>Hudson v. Hudson, </em>226 Md. 521, 174 A.2d 339 (1961). On the same assumption, the father\u2019s loss becomes an \u201cinjury to which this insurance applies\u201d within \u00b6 IY and the loss thereby is subject only to the \u201ceach claim\u201d limitation. That limitation is itself defined in IIV in terms of \u201cinjury.\u201d Consequently the father\u2019s economic loss is an \u201cinjury sustained by any one person\u201d and triggers a separate $200,000 limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The foregoing exercise demonstrates that Pacific\u2019s policy is drafted in a circular fashion. \u201cInjury\u201d is not a fully defined term in the policy (\u201cinjury includes libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of rights of privacy\u201d). Consequently the reader must enter the circle carrying a concept or definition of injury from a source outside of the words used. The district court entered the circle carrying definitions from the Restatement and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Once that assumption is made the reader may go around and around the circle without encountering any linguistic obstacle to the use of the extraneously derived concept of \u201cinjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In terms of the policy\u2019s partial (ie., \u201cincludes\u201d) definition of \u201cinjury\u201d the meaning ascribed to \u201cinjury\u201d by the district court is not illogical. A genus as broad as invasion of any legally protected interest necessarily subsumes the species of invasion known as libel, slander, defamation, or invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Pacific on the other hand emphasizes that the certified question deals with policy limits and not with coverage. Under \u00b6 IV the $200,000 \u201ceach claim\u201d limit applies to \u201cdamages because of injury to which this insurance applies, sustained by any one person____\u201d Because the policy covers injury arising out of rendering obstetrical/gynecological service, Pacific sees the \u201cinjury to which this insurance applies\u201d as bodily injury suffered by a person subjected to medical malpractice by the insured. There are two such persons in the instant case, George Jr. and Barbara Ann. Limits on the father\u2019s claim, says Pacific, are governed by the \u00b6 V definition under which \u201ceach claim\u201d means \u201call claims or suits brought on account of injury sustained by any one person.\u201d Pacific\u2019s more narrow reading of \u201cinjury\u201d attaches the father\u2019s claim, which is factually dependent on the injury to his son, to the son\u2019s claim when applying the $200,000 \u201ceach claim\u201d limit on damages payable \u201con account of injury sustained by any one person.\u201d Because that \u201cone person\u201d is George Jr., as to George Sr.\u2019s claim, Pacific says only one $200,000 limit applies to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">One of the difficulties which we encounter with Pacific\u2019s argument, and with the district court\u2019s rejection of that argument, is that neither undertakes to analyze the meaning of \u201cinjury\u201d in relation to all of the policy language. The analysis has been limited to the portions of the insuring agreement which are pertinent to coverage of the kind of claims presented here. A shorthand characterization of Pacific\u2019s argument is that \u201cperson\u201d should be read as \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d should be read as \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d On this aspect the district court said: \u201cHad the intention been to restrict the policy limits to a claim asserted on behalf of a patient for personal injury, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>more precise terms would certainly have been used.\u201d 568 F.Supp. at 637. In our view that reasoning might apply if Coverage A embraced only \u201c[ijnjury arising out of the rendering of ... professional services ... performed in the practice of the individual insured\u2019s profession described in the declarations,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cpractice as an OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST.\u201d Coverage A, however, contin-. ues with the words, \u201cincluding service by the individual insured as a member of a formal accreditation or similar professional board or committee of a hospital or professional society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">From the standpoint of the policy as a whole, this apparently expanded definition of the practice of obstetrics/gynecology clearly meshes with the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in \u00b6 V, namely, \u201c[w]hen used in reference to this insurance ... injury includes libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of rights of privacy.\u201d Consequently this policy also insures the individual obstetrician/gynecologist when acting as a member of a professional board or committee against liability for defamation or invasion of privacy. Patients would not ordinarily assert such claims. They would likely be asserted by other medical professionals. Further, defamation and invasion of privacy claims are not personal injury claims, at least in the bodily injury sense. Given the mixture of coverages for the individual obstetrician/gynecologist under Coverage A, the person drafting Pacific\u2019s policy could not use \u201cpatient\u201d in lieu of \u201cperson\u201d without contradicting Coverage A\u2019s application to service on professional committees and without contradicting that part of the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d which includes invasion of privacy and defamation. Further, while the policy might have expressly employed the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d for \u201cinjury,\u201d the policy\u2019s author would still have been required to enlarge the meaning of \u201cbodily injury\u201d by artificial definition so as to cover the injuries intended to be covered by having provided that \u201cprofessional services\u201d embrace work on professional committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The role which the partial definition of \u201cinjury\u201d necessarily plays under the respective versions has been given little attention in the briefs. Under Interstate\u2019s concept of \u201cinjury\u201d as an invasion of any legally protected interest which causes actual harm, each person who has a cause of action arising out of covered activity by an obstetrician/gynecologist is a person who has suffered an \u201cinjury.\u201d Seemingly this could include the personal representative who seeks funeral expenses, the relative who sues for solatium damages because of wrongful death, the dependent relative who sues for lost support because of wrongful death, the spouse who sues for loss of consortium in states which allow one spouse to sue alone for that loss, and, in states in which a husband is liable for necessaries for his wife, or in which one spouse is liable for the necessaries of another, a spouse\u2019s action for consequential expenses for necessaries. This reading makes the policy\u2019s partial definition of \u201cinjury\u201d surplusage. The enumerated torts which \u201cinjury includes\u201d are merely selected illustrations which also could have included trespass <em>q.c.f </em>because all are invasions of legally protected interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Under Pacific\u2019s version the \u201cdamages\u201d and \u201cinjury\u201d definitions would more precisely read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">When used in reference to this insurance: damages means all damages, including damages for death, which are payable because of [bodily] injury to which this insurance applies, and [bodily] injury includes <em>[i.e., </em>in addition means] libel, slander, defamation of character or invasion of rights of privacy[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In order to maintain consistency with the policy language, while nevertheless presenting an interpretation which does not reach the high plateau of generalization for \u201cinjury\u201d which Interstate advances, the result sought by Pacific requires interpreting the partial definition of \u201cinjury\u201d as if it in effect said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">[A]nd for purposes of this Part I read \u201cinjury,\u201d which in the context of medical malpractice liability usually means \u201cbodily injury,\u201d also to include libel, slander, defamation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of character or invasion of rights of privacy, because of the expanded definition of professional services found in Coverage A hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In other words, Pacific would have \u201cincludes\u201d in the ti V definition of \u201cinjury\u201d enlarge \u201c[bodily] injury\u201d while Interstate sees the list of torts following \u201cincludes\u201d as merely subsets illustrating the larger set, \u201cinvasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In <em>Group Health Ass\u2019n v.

Dr. Danyo sued his insurer for failure to defend a damage suit brought against him on behalf of the personal injury lawyer for one of Danyo\u2019s patients. The lawyer claimed loss of a fee because Danyo did not furnish a medical report or testify. Responding to the insurer\u2019s argument that the claim did not arise out of rendering \u201cprofessional services,\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">Moreover, by using the word \u201cincluding\u201d in referring to service on boards or committees as professional services, the policy implies the existence of a range of other services, not enumerated, which fall within the policy\u2019s coverage. <em>[Id. </em>at 31, 464 A.2d at 502.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Finding the language ambiguous, the court construed it liberally in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201c[including\u201d also appears in the definition\u2014\u201cdamages means all damages, including damages for death____\u201d One would think that death is the most extreme form of injury imaginable, yet policy language reflected in reported decisions has spoken of \u201cbodily injury or death,\u201d <em>see Perkins v.

This use of \u201cincluding\u201d may represent the same effort at enlargement as the use of \u201cor\u201d does in \u201cbodily injury or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Of course, in the partial definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d the meaning of \u201cincludes\u201d is influenced by the meaning attributed to \u201cinjury,\u201d when it is \u201cinjury\u201d we seek to define by discerning the meaning of \u201cincludes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Pacific\u2019s interpretation also requires implying \u201cbodily\u201d as a modifier of \u201cinjury.\u201d Implying that modifier is not beyond the contract interpretation process where the context makes the \u201cbodily\u201d meaning of \u201cinjury\u201d sufficiently clear. <em>Ravenswood Hospital v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>280 Ill. 103, 117 N.E. 485 (1917) is illustrative. The issue was whether, under a hospital\u2019s liability policy, a husband\u2019s claim for loss on account of injuries to his wife and his wife\u2019s claim for bodily injuries were subject to a single limit which applied to \u201cinjury to or the death of one person.\u201d Without ever using the word \u201cbodily\u201d the court necessarily read \u201cinjury\u201d to mean \u201cbodily injury.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">As to the further contention that appellee was entitled to be reimbursed for the $75 paid to the husband of Mrs. Appel, by the terms of the policy the liability for damages on account of injuries or death was limited to $5000 for each person, and the total liability assumed, in any event, was not to exceed $10,000, irrespective of the number of persons injured. The language of the policy is, \u201cdamages on account of injury to or the death of one person is limited to $5000 and subject to the same limit for each person.\u201d This language is too plain and clear to leave any doubt as to its meaning. It specifically limits appellant\u2019s liability to $5000 for injury or death to one person, irrespective of the number of persons who may make claim to damages on account of the injury to such person. In this case but one person was injured,\u2014Mrs. Appel,\u2014 and under the conditions of the policy the appellant\u2019s liability was limited to $5000 on account of such injury. For this reason we think the Appellate Court was right in refusing to allow appellee\u2019s claim for such item. [280 Ill. at 109, 117 N.E. at 487-88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>And see Chattanooga Dayton Bus Line v. Burney, </em>160 Tenn.

George Jr.\u2019s brain damage is the \u201c[bodily] injury\u201d arising out of the rendering of obstetrical service within Coverage A in III. George Sr.\u2019s economic loss is nevertheless payable under the policy, subject to applicable limits, because Pacific has promised to pay \u201call sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... [i]njury----\u201d Under Maryland law the insured is obligated to the father for damages incurred because of the son\u2019s bodily injury. As between the infant and the father, the infant is the \u201cone person\u201d who has sustained an \u201cinjury to which this insurance applies\u201d within the meaning of IIIV. The HIV definition of \u201ceach claim\u201d then closes the circle as drawn by Pacific. George Sr.\u2019s claim and George Jr.\u2019s claim are both \u201cbrought on account of injury sustained by any one person,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>George Jr. As a result there is no separate limit for the father\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The instant policy, on the basis of the words used, considered in their context, is not sufficiently clear to enable us to say that either Pacific's or Interstate's interpretation is the one intended. Using the standard of a reasonable layperson each party advances a reasonable interpretation. What we said in <em>Hearst Corp. v. Hughes, </em>297 Md. 112, 118, 466 A.2d 486, 489 (1983) is also appropriate to the problem here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">Unfortunately terms like \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cactual injury,\u201d \u201cdamage\u201d and \u201charm\u201d are used in different decisions, and often within the same decision, to represent different concepts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">At the first level of analysis of Pacific\u2019s policy, we are unable to answer the certified question because the words \u201cinjury\u201d and, in the definition of \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d are ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">At the next level of analysis we look to judicial construction. We recently repeated the rule in <em>Fisher v. Tyler, supra, </em>284 Md. at 106-07, 394 A.2d at 1203 (quoting <em>Stanley v. American Motorist Ins. Co., </em>195 Md. 180, 188, 73 A.2d 1, 4 (1950)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[T]he application of this policy provision in a factual posture similar to that presented here has been before the courts of our sister states. The decisions of these jurisdictions have special significance in this context because heretofore this Court has recognized that \u201clike a state which adopts, by copying, a foreign statute, ... parties who adopt an insurance policy, which apparently has had nationwide use and has been judicially construed in five or six states, adopt with it the uniform judicial construction that it has received in other states.\u201d ... In other words, while the contract term on its face may be ambiguous, which under other circumstances would ordinarily generate a jury question ..., the court in this situation may treat the term as unambiguous and, absent any factual dispute, adopt, as a matter of law, that construction placed on the language by the courts of other states. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The above-quoted rule has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Each party derives comfort from one of two decisions in litigation between Pacific, as primary carrier, and an excess carrier which is part of the same group of companies of which Interstate is a member. Those cases involved a different Pacific policy, its \u201cPhysicians\u2019, Surgeons\u2019, and Dentists\u2019 Professional Liability Policy.\u201d Interstate is partial to <em>Chicago Ins. Co. v. Pacific Indem. Co., </em>502 F.Supp. 725 (D.Md.1980), which the parties to this case call <em>Chicago I. </em>It is a decision by United States District Judge Alexander Harvey, II, who decided the subject case in the federal district court. In his opinion in the case <em>sub judice </em>Judge Harvey did not consider <em>Chicago I </em>to have precedential value and we agree. He pointed out that the policy in <em>Chicago I </em>did not include the definition of \u201ceach claim,\u201d 568 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>F.Supp. at 635, to which we would add that the policy in <em>Chicago I </em>did not contain a partial definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d Nevertheless, <em>Chicago I </em>did treat the claims of a mother, infant, and father which were like those asserted here as three separate claims under a limits of liability provision which in relevant part provided that \u201cthe limit of liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each claim\u2019 is the limit of the company\u2019s liability for all damages on account of each claim or suit covered hereby____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Pacific is partial to <em>Chicago Ins.

If no party presents extrinsic evidence bearing upon the meaning of the ambiguous term, \u201cwe would normally apply the \u2018principle of contract construction that where one party is responsible for the drafting of an instrument, absent evidence indicating the intention of the parties, any ambiguity will be resolved against that party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 438 A.2d at 288 (quoting <em>Truck Ins.

Were this case to have come to us from a Maryland circuit court, we would determine the legal relevancy of the factual submission and whether any dispute of material fact existed. On a factual showing by Pacific as relevant and undisputed as is indicated by the opinion certifying the question, we would interpret the policy in accord with Pacific\u2019s position and hold that but one limit applied to the claims of father and son.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The certified question, however, does not ask us to undertake that review which would be beyond the Maryland Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act.
