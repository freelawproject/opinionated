(Carrying Concealed Weapon\u2014 Art. 27, Sec. 36).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The appellant made no objection at or during trial to the sufficiency or form of the charge contained in the indictment. He was convicted of the offense and appealed, contending that the indictment was defective for failure to allege an offense in that it omitted an essential ingredient of the crime, namely, that the knife was not within the exception stated in the statute, i.e., that it was not a penknife without switchblade. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>Hall v. State, 57 </em>Md.App. 1, 468 A.2d 1015 (1983). It concluded that the omission of the penknife exception from the indictment did not result in its failure to charge an offense in view of the provisions of Maryland Rule 711 d (now Md.Rule 4-202(d)) that a charging document \u201cneed not negate an exception, excuse or proviso contained in a statute ... creating or defining the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The appellant argues before us that under <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 387 A.2d 762 (1978), the penknife exception is an essential ingredient of the statutory crime and consequently its omission from the indictment rendered the charging document void for failure to state an offense. He claims that Rule 711d is limited in application to those exceptions, excuses and provisos that are not elements of the offense but rather matters of defense. He contends that the constitutional mandate of Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires that all elements of the offense be included in the charging document and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>rule therefore cannot be interpreted in contravention of the constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">As we observed in <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 490 A.2d 1277 (1984), Maryland Rule 736 a (now Md.Rule 4-252(a)) requires that a motion claiming a non-jurisdictional defect in a charging document must be timely raised prior to trial or it is waived. We think the averments of the indictment in this case that the appellant did wear and carry concealed upon his person a dangerous and deadly knife in violation of \u00a7 36(a) sufficiently characterized the statutory crime charged so that the indictment was not defective for failure to charge an offense within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. As the appellant made no pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment, we need not determine whether the indictment was defective on a non-jurisdictional ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b889-7\">COLE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Gary Harrison Hall was convicted of violating Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 36(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>which prohibits the carrying of certain knives or any other dangerous or deadly weapon (except a penknife without switchblade) concealed upon or about the person. The indictment did not allege that the knife carried by Hall was not within the statutory exception, that is, the knife was not a penknife without switchblade. Hall contended before the Court of Special Appeals that this defect was fatal because the indictment omitted an essential or material element of the crime described in \u00a7 36(a). The intermediate appellate court rejected Hall\u2019s contention, holding that a charging document does not have to negate a statutory exception. <em>Hall v. State, 57 </em>Md.App. 1, 468 A.2d 1015 (1983) (2-1 decision). In reviewing Hall\u2019s case, the majority holds that the indictment was sufficient to characterize the crime, and that because Hall failed to file a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment, this Court need not determine whether the indictment was defective on a non-jurisdictional ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">I dissent for reasons stated in my dissent in <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 794, 490 A.2d 1277, 1281 (1985) (Cole, J., dissenting). It is clear to me that the statute excepts \u201cpenknifes without switchblades.\u201d Therefore, to charge properly an offense under this statute, the indictment must particularly describe the weapon involved or state the statutory exception. To do neither is to state no cognizable charge because one of the essential or material elements is missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">I would reverse Hall\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-9\">. This statute provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\">(a) <em>Carrying concealed or openly with intent to injure; carrying by persons under eighteen at night in certain </em>counties.\u2014Every person who shall wear or carry any dirk knife, bowie knife, switchblade knife, sandclub, metal knuckles, razor, nunchaku, or any other dangerous or deadly weapon of any kind, whatsoever <em>(penknives without switchblade and handguns, excepted) </em>concealed upon or about his person, and every person who shall wear or carry any such weapon, chemical mace or tear gas device openly with the intent or purpose of injuring any person in any unlawful manner, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or be imprisoned in jail, or sentenced to the Maryland Department of Correction for not more than three years; and in case of conviction, if it shall appear from the evidence that such weapon was carried, concealed or openly, with the deliberate purpose of injuring the person or destroying the life of another, the court shall impose the highest sentence of imprisonment prescribed. In Cecil, Anne Arundel, Talbot, Harford, Caro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>line, Prince George\u2019s, Montgomery, St. Mary\u2019s, Washington, Worcester, Kent, and Baltimore counties it shall also be unlawful and a misdemeanor, punishable as above set forth, for any person under eighteen years of age to carry any dangerous or deadly weapon, other than a handgun, between one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise, whether concealed or not, except while on a bona fide hunting trip, or except while engaged in or on the way to or returning from a bona fide trap shoot, sport shooting event, or any organized civic or military activity.
