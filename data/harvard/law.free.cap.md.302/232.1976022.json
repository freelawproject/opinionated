Simmons (Simmons), is an attorney. Respondent, Renee Perkins (Perkins), sued Simmons and another attorney in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for money damages based on alleged malpractice. Simmons has undertaken to represent himself in this suit. About three and one-half months after he first entered his appearance, and without ever having joined issue, Simmons filed a motion ne recipiatur to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, as particularized, and in the alternative moved to strike that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>declaration. The trial court found Simmons\u2019 motion to be without substantial justification and ordered him to pay $150, representing a reasonable fee to plaintiff\u2019s counsel for attending court for the hearing on Simmons\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simmons noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">That court dismissed the appeal in an unpublished per curiam opinion. We then granted Simmons\u2019 petition for certiorari, which was limited to the appealability issue. The petition rested appealability exclusively on the ground that the award of counsel fees under Md.R. 604 b is an order for the payment of money within the scope of \u00a7 12-303(3)(v) of the Courts Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In <em>Della Ratta v. Dixon, </em>47 Md.App. 270, 277-84, 422 A.2d 409, 413-16 (1980), Judge Wilner, writing for the Court of Special Appeals, presented what we have described as \u201can excellent survey of the history of ... \u00a7 12-303(c)(5)____\u201d <em>Anthony Plumbing of Maryland, Inc. v. Attorney General, </em>298 Md. 11, 18 n. 3, 467 A.2d 504, 508 n. 3 (1983). Much of the same background was covered by Judge Eldridge for this Court in <em>Anthony Plumbing. </em>Suffice it to say that Maryland statutes dealing with appeals, from Ch. 185 of the Acts of 1830 until the recodification by Ch. 2 of the Acts of the 1st Sp.Sess., 1973 which produced the Courts Article, have referred to the appealability <em>vel non </em>of an order for the payment of money only with respect to appeals from a court of equity. The 1973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>change, which enlarged the statute to cover appeals from interlocutory orders of a \u201ccircuit court,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcJ\">was a recognition that certain types of traditional equity orders, such as an injunction, could also be obtained from a court of law. [T]he 1973 revision was not intended to make any substantive alterations in the kinds of interlocutory orders that were appealable prior to a final judgment. <em>[Id. </em>at 20, 467 A.2d at 508.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><em>Anthony Plumbing </em>then summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">The history of \u00a7 12-303 thus indicates a legislative intent to allow interlocutory appeals only from those orders for the \u201cpayment of money\u201d which had traditionally been rendered in equity. This is confirmed by judicial decisions. The types of orders previously held by this Court to be orders for the \u201cpayment of money\u201d are orders for alimony, child support, and related counsel fees, <em>Chappell v. Chappell, </em>86 Md. 532, 39 A. 984 (1898), and <em>Pappas v. Pappas, </em>287 Md. 455, 413 A.2d 549 (1980). The Court of Special Appeals has recognized the appealability of similar interlocutory orders in domestic relations litigation, <em>Hofmann v. Hofmann, </em>50 Md.App. 240, 437 A.2d 247 (1981), and <em>Della Ratta v. Dixon, </em>47 Md.App. 270, 284, 422 A.2d 409 (1980), as well as an interlocutory order directing an assignee for the benefit of creditors to pay certain sums to creditors, <em>Genn v. CIT Corp., </em>40 Md.App. 516, 392 A.2d 1135 (1978).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">The common thread in the above-cited cases is that each involves an order for a specific sum of money which \u201cproceeds directly to the person\u201d and for which that individual is \u201cdirectly and personally answerable <em>to the court </em>in the event of noncompliance.\u201d <em>Della Ratta v. Dixon, supra, </em>47 Md.App. at 285, 422 A.2d 409 (emphasis in original). These characteristics of a traditional equity order for the payment of money differ markedly from those of a typical judgment at law for the payment of money. The latter type of judgment \u201cmay settle the respective rights of the parties ... but it does not purport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to order anyone to do anything.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is \u201cnot immediately enforceable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 286, 422 A.2d 409.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">Therefore, we conclude that an \u201corder for the ... payment of money\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-303(c)(5) is an order which is equitable in nature. [298 Md. at 20, 467 A.2d at 508-09.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The order appealed in this case is not equitable in nature. It does not proceed directly to the person so as to make Simmons directly and personally answerable to the court for noncompliance. The distinctive feature of the kind of equitable order described in <em>Anthony Plumbing </em>is that the court has available to it, among other possible sanctions for a violation of the order, the sanction of imprisonment for contempt. Here imprisonment for contempt is not available to the trial court for any violation of its order that Simmons pay money under Md.R. 604 b.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The point was settled by <em>Kerr v. Kerr, </em>287 Md. 363, 371, 412 A.2d 1001, 1006 (1980). That case involved a father who had contested, without substantial justification, his former wife\u2019s claim for arrearages of child support. The court ordered the father, pursuant to Md.R. 604 b, to pay $400 as counsel fees, and in addition, to pay $1,750 of accrued child support. Subsequently the circuit court found the father to be in contempt of the original support decree and conditioned purgation of the contempt on the father\u2019s payment of the counsel fee as well as of $2,300 in support arrearage. We held in <em>Kerr </em>that purgation of contempt could not be conditioned on payment of the Md.R. 604 b counsel fee. This was because the condition violated the prohibition of Md. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 38 against imprisonment for debt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Simmons relies on <em>Chappell v. Chappell, </em>86 Md. 532, 39 A. 984 (1898), in which an interlocutory appeal was entertained under the order to pay money provision. The action was a husband\u2019s bilr for divorce <em>a vinculo </em>and a wife\u2019s cross-bill for divorce <em>a mensa. </em>An order nisi had been entered directing the husband to pay alimony pendente lite, suit money of $500, and a counsel fee of $1,000. That order had become operative by the husband\u2019s failure to meet certain conditions. The court thereafter directed the husband to pay arrearages of alimony amounting to $1,000, the $500 in suit money, and the $1,000 counsel fee within ten days after service of a copy of the order upon the husband or his solicitor. This order was held to be immediately appealable under the predecessor of \u00a7 12-303(3)(v). That feature of the order in <em>Chappell </em>which directed the husband to pay a determined amount of arrearage in alimony pendente lite was clearly an order for \u201cthe payment of money.\u201d The husband could have been imprisoned for contempt. <em>Oles Envelope Corp. v. Oles, </em>193 Md. 79, 91-92, 65 A.2d 899, 904-05 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Chappell </em>is not authority for the immediate appealability of the counsel fees awarded under Md.R. 604 b in this case. The orders awarding counsel fees and suit money in <em>Chappell </em>cannot be isolated from the divorce action in which they were entered for purposes of applying the order for \u201cthe payment of money\u201d test of \u00a7 12-303(3)(v). Prior to <em>Chappell, </em>this Court had said in <em>McCurley v. McCurley, </em>60 Md. 185, 188 (1883), by quoting <em>Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, </em>that the wife\u2019s allowance for the expenses of suit \u201c \u2018is in fact a sort of alimony; the one being for the defraying the ordinary expenses of the wife in the matter of living; the other being for the same purpose in respect to the matter of the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCurley </em>further pointed out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that \u201c[t]he order or orders that may be passed upon the husband, if disregarded by him, may not only be enforced by the court granting them, by a <em>fieri facias, </em>but also by attachment for contempt; as in <em>Greeley v. Greeley, </em>31 How.Pr. 476, and <em>Dwilly v. Dwilly, </em>46 Maine, 381.\u201d 60 Md. at 189. And <em>see Rubin v. Rubin, </em>233 Md. 118, 129, 195 A.2d 696, 702 (1963) (order requiring husband to pay part of the charges of a private investigator engaged on behalf of the wife can be enforced by attachment for contempt because the unpaid charges are \u201c \u2018a sort of alimony\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Simmons\u2019 position of immediate appealability is supported by <em>Womble v. Miller, </em>25 Md.App. 656, 336 A.2d 138, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 758 (1975). The appeal in <em>Womble </em>was taken from an order awarding $137 to counsel for the appellant\u2019s adversary pursuant to former Md.R. 422 because of the appellant\u2019s refusal to be deposed. The <em>Womble </em>court, without discussion, cited to \u00a7 12-303(c)(5) in a footnote appended to the sentence: \u201cWomble noted an appeal to this Court on October 2, 1974.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 336 A.2d at 143. <em>Womble </em>was decided before <em>Della Ratta, supra, </em>47 Md.App. 270, 422 A.2d 409, and <em>Anthony Plumbing, supra, </em>298 Md. 11, 467 A.2d 504, developed the historical background of the order for \u201cthe payment of money.\u201d The more recent cases demonstrate that <em>Womble </em>was not correctly decided on the appealability issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
