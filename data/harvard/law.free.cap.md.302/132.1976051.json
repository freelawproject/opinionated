Section 551(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201cWhenever it be made to appear to any judge of any of the circuit courts in the counties of this State, or to any judge of the District Court, by written application signed and sworn to by the applicant, accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits containing facts within the personal knowledge of the affiant or affiants, that there is probable cause, the basis of which shall be set forth in said affidavit or affidavits, to believe that any misdemeanor or felony is being committed by any individual or in any building, apartment, premises, place or thing within the territorial jurisdiction of such judge, or that any property subject to seizure under the criminal laws of the State is situated or located on the person of any such individual or in or on any such building, apartment, premises, place or thing, then the judge may forthwith issue a search warrant directed to any duly constituted policeman, or police officer authorizing him to search such suspected individual, building, apartment, premises, place or thing, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>seize any property found liable to seizure under the criminal laws of this State____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In a twenty-one page application for a search warrant, the affiants\u2014a Maryland State Trooper and a New Jersey State Police Detective\u2014alleged that probable cause existed to believe that Intercontinental Limited, a company with offices in Baltimore County, and its President, Sigmund Kassap, were engaged in unlawful activities violative of New Jersey criminal statutes relating to conspiracy, theft by deception and unlawful employment under the New Jersey Casino Control Act. The application also set forth detailed allegations from which the affiants concluded that probable cause existed to believe that evidence of such crimes, in the form of various specified records, was located upon Intercontinental\u2019s Baltimore County premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">A District Court judge sitting in Baltimore County issued the search warrant; it recited that probable cause existed to believe that Intercontinental and Kassap were violating the criminal laws of New Jersey and that evidence of such violations was located at Intercontinental\u2019s offices in Baltimore County. The warrant was subsequently executed and resulted in the seizure of Intercontinental\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Intercontinental and Kassap (hereafter collectively referred to as Intercontinental) filed petitions in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking the return of the seized records. The petitions claimed that the search warrant was void because Maryland judges were without power to authorize searches and seizures for evidence of alleged criminal offenses committed in other states. The trial judge (Fader, J.) agreed with Intercontinental and ordered that all records seized under the warrant be returned. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c[T]he legislative directive [is] that it is only Maryland crimes or property subject to seizure under Maryland law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>with which the authority [to issue a search warrant] must be associated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">\u201cNew Jersey law cannot be violated within the jurisdiction of this court. There is no property subject to seizure under the criminal laws of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The State appealed; it contended that nothing in the statute limited the issuance of a search warrant to offenses committed under the law of Maryland. We granted certiorari prior to decision by the Court of Special Appeals to consider the issue of first impression raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">A search warrant is in the nature of criminal process; its primary purpose is to aid in the detection and suppression of crime and to obtain evidence for use in criminal prosecutions. <em>Givner v. State, </em>210 Md. 484, 124 A.2d 764 (1956); <em>People v. York, </em>29 Ill.2d 68, 193 N.E.2d 773 (1963); <em>State v. Buxton, </em>238 Ind. 93, 148 N.E.2d 547 (1958); <em>State v. Bullard, </em>267 N.C. 599, 148 S.E.2d 565 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 917, 87 S.Ct. 876, 17 L.Ed.2d 789 (1967); 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 147 (12th ed. 1974). The issuance of a search warrant is collateral to a criminal prosecution; its execution may or may not result in placing a charge against the individual in whose possession the seized property is found. 1 J. Yaron, <em>Searches, Seizures and Immunities, </em>ch. 5, at 274-75 (2nd ed. 1974); <em>Bevington v. United States, </em>35 F.2d 584 (8th Cir.1929), <em>cert. denied, </em>281 U.S. 721, 50 S.Ct. 237, 74 L.Ed. 1140 (1930); <em>Sugar Valley Land Co. v. Johnson, </em>17 Ala.App. 409, 85 So. 871 (1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Search warrants were recognized at common law; however, their use, as in Maryland, was limited to searching for stolen property. <em>Griffin v. State, </em>232 Md. 389, 194 A.2d 80 (1963); <em>Gattus v. State, </em>204 Md. 589, 105 A.2d 661 (1954); <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 228, </em>54 Md.App. 149, 458 A.2d 820 (1983). Statutory authority was generally required to issue search warrants for property other than stolen goods. <em>Griffin, supra; Givner v. Cohen, </em>208 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>23, 116 A.2d 357 (1955); <em>Sugarman v. State, </em>173 Md. 52, 195 A. 324 (1937); <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 228, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Section 551(a) was enacted by ch. 306 of the Acts of 1939. To ascertain and effectuate the actual legislative intention in enacting any statute is, of course, the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation. <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 481 A.2d 192 (1984). In this regard, the primary source of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. <em>Blum v. Blum, </em>295 Md. 135, 453 A.2d 824 (1983). Where the statutory provisions are unambiguous, no construction is required, <em>In Re Arnold M., </em>298 Md. 515, 471 A.2d 313 (1984), so that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation. <em>Guy v. Director, </em>279 Md. 69, 367 A.2d 946 (1977). But where a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning, construction is required; in such circumstances, courts may consider not only the literal or usual meaning of words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment. <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 458 A.2d 758 (1983); <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 348 A.2d 275 (1975). Considering the particular use and association of words in \u00a7 551(a), we think a doubt or ambiguity exists as to the exact application and reach of the statute\u2019s provisions. Thus, in construing \u00a7 551(a), we may take into account the principles of law in force at the time of the statute\u2019s passage. <em>Lutz v. State, </em>167 Md. 12, 172 A. 354 (1934); <em>Greenwood v. Greenwood, </em>28 Md. 369 (1868). And we may also consider the consequences of a proposed construction and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense. <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265 (1984) [No. 111, September Term, 1983, decided December 26, 1984]; <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 399 A.2d 250 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>We have said that under \u00a7 551(a) a search warrant may issue only to search individuals, places and things \u201cwithin the territorial jurisdiction\u201d of the issuing judge. <em>See Dow v. State, </em>207 Md. 80, 113 A.2d 423 (1955); <em>Asner v. State, </em>193 Md. 68, 65 A.2d 881 (1949); <em>Frank v. State, </em>189 Md. 591, 56 A.2d 810 (1948). To justify the issuance of such a warrant, the statute appears to require that probable cause first be shown that \u201cany misdemeanor or felony\u201d is being committed; that it is being committed by a person, or in a place or thing within the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing judge; and that in connection therewith \u201cproperty\u201d subject or liable to seizure \u201cunder the criminal laws of this State\u201d is located upon the individual or at the place or thing to be searched. <em>See Gattus v. State, </em>204 Md. 589, 105 A.2d 661 (1954); <em>Salmon v. State, 2 </em>Md.App. 513, 235 A.2d 758 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The State maintains that the jurisdictional predicate for the issuance of a search warrant is not the location of the crime alleged, but the location of the person, place or thing, to be searched, which must be within the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing judge. It says that the phrase \u201cwithin the territorial jurisdiction of such judge\u201d in \u00a7 551(a) modifies the individual, place or thing to be searched, rather than the \u201cany misdemeanor or felony\u201d language of the statute. Intercontinental, on the other hand, urges us to conclude, as did the lower court, that \u00a7 551(a) authorizes the issuance of a search warrant only upon a showing of probable cause to believe that the \u201ccriminal laws of the State\u201d have been or are being violated. It says that \u00a7 551(a) \u201cbegins and ends with the laws of this State, and not with the law of any other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In 1939, when \u00a7 551(a) was enacted, the right to search for and seize property under a search warrant was subject to the \u201cmere evidence rule,\u201d which required the State to establish a superior property right in the evidence sought to be seized. <em>See Warden v. Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967); <em>Gouled v. United States, </em>255 U.S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647 (1921). Under this rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the State was only entitled to search for and seize the fruits of crime (i.e. stolen goods), instrumentalities of crime and contraband because, as to these, the State could establish a property right superior to that of the possessor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, as Judge Moylan observed for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>In Re Special Investigation No. 228, supra, </em>54 Md.App. at 170, 458 A.2d 820, the State, in 1939 when \u00a7 551(a) was enacted, could not lawfully seize \u201cmere evidence\u201d of crime, even under a search warrant, because there was no known theory under which the State could assert a superior property right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the Supreme Court abandoned the mere evidence rule in its 1967 decision in <em>Warden v. </em>Hayden,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>think it most likely that the phrase \u201cproperty subject to seizure ... or liable to seizure under the criminal laws of this State\u201d\u2014as used in the 1939 enactment of \u00a7 551(a)\u2014re-flected the legislative understanding of the limits of search and seizure under the criminal law of Maryland, imposed by the then prevailing mere evidence rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Viewing \u00a7 551(a) in its historical context, we think the phrase \u201cunder the criminal laws of this State\u201d is not offense related but rather modifies and refers only to \u201cproperty\u201d subject or liable to seizure. Nothing in the words of \u00a7 551(a), therefore, limits the property subject or liable to seizure to that solely associated with the commission of Maryland offenses. In other words, the only jurisdictional requirement imposed by \u00a7 551(a) is that the property to be seized be located within the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing judge.- It is not essential that, the crime alleged in the application for the search warrant be committed within the judge\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. Were it otherwise, a judge in one Maryland county where property is located and subject to seizure would be powerless to issue a search warrant if the crime was committed in another county of the State. In broadly authorizing the issuance of a search warrant for \u201cany misdemeanor or felony,\u201d the statute did not distinguish between crimes committed within or without the State. To otherwise conclude would unreasonably and illogically ascribe to the legislature an intention to provide a sanctuary within this State\u2019s borders to shelter evidence of crime from search warrant seizure simply because the crime was not committed in Maryland. To permit such a seizure of evidence located within this State is not to violate the rule that Maryland may not enforce the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>laws of another State by convicting a person of crime committed beyond its territorial boundaries. <em>See Bowen v. State, </em>206 Md. 368, 111 A.2d 844 (1955); <em>Worthington v. State, </em>58 Md. 403 (1882). As we earlier observed, a search warrant serves a limited function in aiding in the detection and suppression of crime. The issuance of such process is collateral to a criminal prosecution, usually preceding it, and does not itself result in the conviction of any person of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Most state statutes, like \u00a7 551(a), do not expressly limit the issuance of search warrants to intrastate offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Three states expressly permit search warrants to be issued for evidence of crimes committed in other states.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Only one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>state appears to expressly limit the issuance of a search warrant to intrastate crimes. MontCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46-5-203 and 46-1-201(7) (1983). Consistent with that state\u2019s statute, the court in <em>State v. Kelly, </em>668 P.2d 1032 (Mont.1983) held that if the crime alleged in the search warrant application was committed in another state, \u201cthe Montana magistrate would have been without jurisdiction to issue a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1040. Closer on point is <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>429 A.2d 1339 (D.C.App.1981). There, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld a lower court order authorizing the search for and seizure within the District of bullets lodged in the defendant\u2019s body, which constituted evidence relating to an armed robbery believed to have been committed by the defendant in Maryland. The search warrant statute in that jurisdiction, D.C.Code Ann., \u00a7 23-521(d)(4) (1973), authorized the seizure of property which \u201cconstitutes evidence of or tends to demonstrate the commission of an offense or the identity of a person participating in the commission of an offense.\u201d While no jurisdictional issue was raised in the case, the court held that \u201cthe statute is broad enough to encompass the ruling of the trial court____\u201d 429 A.2d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In the final analysis, we conclude that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 551(a), did not intend to limit its application to evidentiary seizures involving only intrastate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO ABIDE THE FINAL RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-4\">. In <em>Warden v. Hayden, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 303, 87 S.Ct. at 1648, the Court said: \"Historically the right to search for and seize property depended upon the assertion by the Government of a valid claim of superior interest, and that it was not enough that the purpose of the search and seizure was to obtain evidence to use in apprehending and convicting criminals.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>. </em>In <em>Gouled v. United States, supra, </em>255 U.S. at 309, 41 S.Ct. at 265, the Supreme Court held that search warrants \u201cmay not be used as a means of gaining access to a man\u2019s house or office and papers solely for the purpose of making search to secure evidence to be used against him in a criminal or penal proceeding.\u201d It said that warrants \u201cmay be resorted to only when a primary right to such search and seizure may be found in the interest which the public or the complainant may have in the property to be seized, or in the right to the possession of it, or when a valid exercise of the police power renders possession of the property by the accused unlawful and provides that it may be taken\u201d <em>id. </em>(i.e., when the property is an instrumentality or fruit of crime, or contraband).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. The Court said in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cThe requirement that the Government assert in addition some property interest in material it seizes has long been a fiction, obscuring the reality that government has an interest in solving crime____ The requirements of the Fourth Amendment can secure the same protection of privacy whether the search is for \u2018mere evidence\u2019 or for fruits, instrumentalities or contraband. There must, of course, be a nexus\u2014automatically provided in the case of fruits, instrumentalities or contraband\u2014between the item to be seized and criminal behavior. Thus in the case of \u2018mere evidence,\u2019 probable cause must be examined in terms of cause to believe that the evidence sought will aid in a particular apprehension or conviction. In so doing, consideration of police purposes will be required.\u201d 387 U.S. at 306-07, 87 S.Ct. at 1649-50.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b220-5\">.
