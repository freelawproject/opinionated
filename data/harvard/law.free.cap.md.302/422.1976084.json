The first is whether a defendant\u2019s failure to object to the imposition of an illegal condition of probation precludes his raising that issue on direct appeal. The second is whether a trial court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>order a defendant to pay restitution to a victim of a crime of which the defendant was not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On June 15, 1981, petitioner Richard Rondy Walczak and three cohorts allegedly entered the residence of Esther Mary Gardner and Judith Lee Martin and there bound and robbed the two women at gunpoint. A Cecil County grand jury presented a fourteen count indictment charging Walczak with two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon and related offenses. Seven counts of the indictment related solely to the alleged assault upon and robbery of Gardner and seven counts referred solely to the alleged assault upon and robbery of Martin. The robbery counts charged that Walczak stole \u201cthe property listed on the annexed sheet which is made a part hereof.\u201d The annexed sheet, under the heading \u201cProperty Stolen on 6/15/81 from Esther Mary Gardner,\u201d listed numerous items and their corresponding dollar values, which totaled $8,325.00. Beneath the heading \u201cProperty Stolen on 6/15/81 from Judith Lee Martin,\u201d was a second list of items, the total dollar value of which was set at $8,816.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Pursuant to an agreement between Walczak and the State, Walczak was tried on count one only, which charged the robbery of Gardner with a deadly weapon. Walczak pleaded not guilty, elected a nonjury trial, and was tried on an agreed statement of facts. He was found \u201cguilty\u201d on count one, and the State nol prossed counts two through fourteen. A presentence investigation was ordered, and sentencing was scheduled for about two months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Subsequently the circuit court sentenced Walczak to the maximum allowable term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the armed robbery of Gardner. The court suspended the last five years of the sentence and placed Walczak on probation for five years. One of the conditions of probation was that Walczak make restitution of $8,325.00 to Gardner and $8,816.95 to Martin. Although Walczak expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to repay the entire debt in the five year probationary period, he did not other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>wise object to paying restitution to both victims or to the amount ordered. Walczak signed an order of probation which required the restitution payments to both victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Walczak challenged for the first time the authority of the trial judge to order the payment of restitution to a victim of a crime of which he had not been convicted. The Court of Special Appeals declined to reach the issue, holding in an unreported opinion that \u201csince the exception to the order of restitution was not made or ruled upon below, it is not preserved for appellate review,\u201d citing Maryland Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Walczak filed a petition for a writ of certiorari presenting the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cDid the court below err in holding that petitioner had no right to relief from the trial court\u2019s order to him to pay restitution not authorized by statute?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The State filed a conditional cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that the restitution order was not preserved for appellate review and that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the issue had been preserved, the restitution order was not illegal. We granted both the petition and the cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Initially, we address the State\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the restitution order precluded review on direct appeal. The State relies upon the language of Rules 885 and 1085, which provide that this Court and the Court of Special Appeals \u201cwill not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the circuit court .... \u201d The defendant, however, relying on further language in Rules 885 and 1085, to the effect that \u201ca question as to the jurisdiction of the circuit court may be raised and decided in [the Court of Special Appeals or Court of Appeals], whether or not raised and decided in the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>court,\u201d argues that the restitution order was illegal and in excess of the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">At times this Court has declined to review challenges to allegedly illegal sentences when the defendants failed to object to the sentences at the trial level. <em>See, e.g., Putnam v. State, </em>234 Md. 537, 200 A.2d 59 (1964); <em>Bennett v. State, </em>180 Md. 406, 412, 24 A.2d 786 (1942); <em>Simonson v. State, </em>143 Md. 413, 417, 122 A. 362 (1923); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>82 Md. 527, 531, 34 A. 246 (1896). <em>See also Carbaugh v. State, </em>294 Md. 323, 327 n. 3, 449 A.2d 1153 (1982). On the other hand, on numerous occasions, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have reviewed the legality of sentences, including conditions of probation, in the absence of objections in the trial courts. <em>See, e.g., Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 140, 416 A.2d 265 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981); <em>Bird v. State, </em>231 Md. 432, 434, 190 A.2d 804 (1963); <em>Kelly v. State, </em>151 Md. 87, 99-101, 133 A. 899 (1926); <em>Klein v. State, </em>151 Md. 484, 494, 135 A. 591 (1926); <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 388, 393-394, 377 A.2d 588, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977); <em>Laurie v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 609, 349 A.2d 276 (1976); <em>Haynes v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 43, 337 A.2d 130 (1975). Although this Court has sometimes labeled the imposition of an illegal sentence \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and thus reviewable on direct appeal regardless of any objection below, the Court has also strongly criticized the label. <em>See Berman v. Warden, </em>232 Md. 642, 646, 193 A.2d 551 (1963), expressly overruling <em>Price v. State, </em>159 Md. 491, 151 A. 409 (1930), and noting that the use of the doctrine of plain error or reliance on inherent power of an appellate court to correct error is preferable to calling the error jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Obviously the conflict among the appellate decisions in this State should be resolved. We hold that when the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court. Such review and correction of an illegal sentence is especially appropriate in light of the fact that Rule 4-345(a), formerly Rule 774 a, provides that \u201c[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Thus, a defendant who fails to object to the imposition of an illegal sentence does not waive forever his right to challenge that sentence. <em>See Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 303, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981). Moreover, because the defendant would be entitled to post conviction relief if a sentence is clearly illegal although not objected to at trial, interests of expedition and judicial economy support review of the sentence on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Evans, </em>278 Md. 197, 211, 362 A.2d 629 (1976); <em>Walters v. State, </em>242 Md. 235, 238, 218 A.2d 678 (1966); <em>Hickman v. State, </em>242 Md. 91, 94, 218 A.2d 21 (1966); <em>Petrey v. State, </em>239 Md. 601, 603, 212 A.2d 277 (1965); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 293, 206 A.2d 138 (1965); <em>Royal v. State, </em>236 Md. 443, 449-450, 204 A.2d 500 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendant contends that the statutes governing the imposition of restitution as a condition of probation do not authorize a trial court to order restitution to a victim of a crime of which he was not convicted. The State, on the other hand, argues that the statutes provide a trial court with broad authority to order restitution as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The General Assembly has addressed the matter of restitution in criminal cases in several statutory sections. The pertinent provisions in this case are as follows. Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1984 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 486, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cEvery person convicted of the crime of robbery, or as accessory thereto before the fact, shall restore the thing robbed or taken to the owner, or shall pay to him the full value thereof____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Art. 27, \u00a7 488, relating to armed robbery, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cEvery person convicted of the crime of robbery or attempt to rob with a dangerous or deadly weapon or accessory thereto, shall restore to the owner thereof the thing robbed or taken, or shall pay him the full value thereof____\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The subject of restitution is dealt with specifically in Art. 27, \u00a7 640(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\u201c(b) <em>Restitution may be ordered upon conviction of certain crimes; priority of payment.\u2014Upon conviction for a crime </em>where property of another has been stolen, converted, unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased as <em>a direct result of the crime, </em>or where the victim suffered actual medical expenses, direct out of pocket losses, or loss of earning <em>as a direct result of the crime, </em>or if <em>as a direct result of the crime, </em>the victim incurred medical expenses that were paid by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or any other governmental entity, the court may order the defendant to make restitution in addition to any other penalty provided for the commission <em>of the crime. </em>Payment of restitution to the victim under this subsection has priority over payment of restitution to the Department or any other governmental entity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The general power of a court to set conditions on a grant of probation is contained in Art. 27, \u00a7 641A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">\u201c(a) <em>Suspension of sentence; </em>probation.\u2014Upon entering a judgment of conviction, the court having jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. The court may impose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a lesser period be served in confinement, suspend the remainder of the sentence and grant probation for a period longer than the sentence but not in excess of 5 years. However, if the defendant consents in writing, the court may grant probation in excess of 5 years, but only for purposes of making restitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The State has not relied on Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 486 and 488, in this case. It has not been suggested that, under those sections, restitution can be made with respect to property which was not the subject of the robbery of which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Section 640(b) provides that restitution may be ordered <em>upon conviction. </em>The statute repeats three times that restitution depends on damages incurred as a direct result of the crime. It further states that restitution may be ordered \u201cin addition to any other penalty provided for the commission of the crime.\u201d Clearly, then, restitution is punishment for the crime of which the defendant has been convicted. Restitution depends on the existence of that crime, and the statute authorizes the court to order restitution only where the court is otherwise authorized to impose punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The State urges that \u00a7 641A grants courts broader discretion to impose conditions of probation than is provided for under \u00a7 640, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coles v. State, supra. </em>In that case, Coles was convicted of the crime of making false statements in applications for public assistance benefits in violation of Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum.Supp.), Art. 88A, \u00a7 62(a), and was ordered to pay restitution as a condition of probation. Coles contended that, because \u00a7 640(b) authorized a court to order the payment of restitution only upon conviction for certain \u201ccrime(s),\u201d and since under \u00a7 640(a)(2) \u201ccrime\u201d was defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>as \u201can act committed by any person ... which would constitute a crime as defined in Article 27 ... or at common law,\u201d an award of restitution was improper with respect to his Art. 88A offense. This Court rejected that contention, holding that \u00a7 641A vested additional power in the trial court beyond that conferred by \u00a7 640, to suspend Coles\u2019s sentence and impose conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Our holding in <em>Coles, </em>however, does not support the State\u2019s position here. Section 641A, the basis for the decision in <em>Coles, </em>mirrors \u00a7 640(b) in that it grants a court the authority to order the payment of restitution only upon a \u201cconviction.\u201d Unlike Walczak, the defendant in <em>Coles </em>was convicted of the offense for which he was ordered to make restitution. In the instant case the State nol prossed every count charging Walczak with the robbery of Martin. Since there was no conviction for that crime, the trial court was not authorized under \u00a7 640(b) to impose any order of restitution under the counts charging Walczak with the robbery of Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">While this is an issue of first impression in this Court, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Mason v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 1, 415 A.2d 315 (1980), had occasion to consider the scope of a court\u2019s authority to order payment of restitution under \u00a7\u00a7 640(b) and 641A. In that case Delores Marie Mason was \u25a0 charged with and convicted of the embezzlement of $3,949.61 from Mr. and Ms. Bennett. The Bennetts had contracted with Mason to sell their furniture, but received from her a check which was never honored. At trial a police officer who had investigated the case testified that he had spoken to \u201capproximately 50 persons\u201d who had apparently also placed goods with Mason on consignment and still had unpaid claims despite consignment sales. The court also heard testimony from a woman that \u201cshe had lost over $1,000 [to Mason] under circumstances very similar to those involved in the Bennett case.\u201d 46 Md.App. at 3, 415 A.2d 315. The circuit court sentenced Mason to three years imprisonment, suspended the sentence, and placed the defendant on probation on the condition that \u201crestitution be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>made ... in the full amount of $3,949.61 [and] additional payments of restitution to all of the valid claims in this matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 415 A.2d 315. The Court of Special Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Moylan, upheld the order to make restitution to the Bennetts in the amount of $3,949.61 but vacated the order to make restitution in excess of this amount. The appellate court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anh\">\u201cthe clear sense of \u00a7 640(b) ... seems unmistakably to contemplate restitution for the crimes as to which incarceration might otherwise be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 415 A.2d 315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">This is the correct reading of \u00a7 640(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Cases in the federal courts interpreting the federal restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, have reached the same conclusion as we do here. In <em>United States v. Orr, </em>691 F.2d 431, 432-433 (9th Cir., 1982), the court discussed that statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cThe authority for requiring restitution as a condition of probation is contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u2018[The court may] place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">* # * # * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">While on probation and among the conditions thereof, the defendant ... [m]ay be required to make restitution or reparation to aggrieved parties for actual damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">\u201cIn <em>Karrell v. United States, </em>181 F.2d 981 (9th Cir.1950), this court held that the specific limitation, \u2018actual damages ... caused by the offense for which conviction was had,\u2019 governs the general provision for \u2018such terms and conditions as the court deems best.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 987. This court held that restitution could be ordered only for amounts in counts upon which conviction was had and not for amounts set forth in dismissed counts, since a conviction for greater amount could not have been had. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>See also United States v. Follette, </em>32 F.Supp. 953 (E.D.Pa.1940), <em>cited with approval in Karrell, </em>181 F.2d at 987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cThe <em>Karrell </em>construction of section 3651, limiting restitution to amounts for which the defendant was actually convicted, is the majority rule. <em>See United States v.

Because we hold that the trial court exceeded its statutory authorization in sentencing Walczak to pay restitution to the victim of a crime of which he was not convicted, we need not address the issue of whether such an order would violate a defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>See generally Mason v.

Landay, </em>513 F.2d 306, 308 (5th Cir.1975). <em>See also United States v. McLaughlin, </em>512 F.Supp. 907, 908 (D.Md.1981). No such plea agreement was entered into in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. A minority of jurisdictions which have addressed the issue have reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"><em>See People v. Lent, </em>15 Cal.3d 481, 124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545 (1975); <em>People v. Miller, 256 </em>Cal.App.2d 348, 64 Cal.Rptr. 20 (1967); <em>Rose v. State, </em>434 So.2d 1014 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983), <em>cert denied. </em>444 So.2d 418 (1984); <em>People v. Pettit, </em>88 Mich.App. 203, 276 N.W.2d 878 (1979) (distinguishing <em>People v. Becker, </em>supra); <em>Garski v. State, </em>75 Wis.2d 62, 248 N.W.2d 425 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Some state courts have recognized the same exception as the federal courts have, <em>i.e., </em>that an order to make restitution in amounts greater than the amounts involved in the crime of which a defendant has been convicted is permissible when done as part of a plea agreement. <em>See, e.g., Ex Parte Killough, </em>434 So.2d 852 (Ala.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Killough v. Alabama, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 525, 78 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <em>Dent v. State, </em>432 So.2d 163 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983); <em>In Interest of F.D., </em>89 Ill.App.3d 223, 44 Ill.Dec. 834, 411 N.E.2d 1200 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
