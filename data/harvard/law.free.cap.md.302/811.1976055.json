Laws of 1982, Ch. 494. The statute amended by the legislation, Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7 124 further states, in subsection (c)(2)(H), \u201cIf the court does not order a presentence investigation, the State\u2019s Attorney may prepare a victim impact statement to be submitted to the court and the defendant____\u201d At issue in the present case is whether the consideration at sentencing of a supplemental victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>impact statement offered by the State violates \u00a7 124(c) and was prejudicial to the defendant at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">We find such statements to be neither violative of Art. 41, \u00a7 124(c) nor, necessarily, an impermissible consideration for the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Gregory Reid (\u201cReid\u201d) was convicted, on August 10, 1982, of first-degree rape, first-degree sexual offense and robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The victim, a 17 year-old girl, was home alone at the time of the crime. Reid forced his way into her family\u2019s apartment by threatening the victim with a knife. After binding the victim\u2019s hands and eyes and gagging her mouth, Reid ransacked the apartment. He then forced the victim to perform fellatio and raped her. The victim testified against Reid at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">A presentence investigation was conducted by the Division of Parole and Probation following the conviction. The procedure followed in that case, and presumably all such cases in Montgomery County, was that a victim impact questionnaire was sent to the victim by the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney Victim/Witness Program. Since a presentence investigation was required, the completed questionnaire was forwarded to the probation officer in charge of the investigation at his request and used to fill out the Division\u2019s standard-form victim impact statement. In the present case, the Division was also notified by the State that a victim impact statement had been prepared by the victim and that it was forwarded directly to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The Victim Impact Statement submitted by the Division of Parole and Probation as part of its presentence investigation contained four categories: economic loss, physical injury, psychological impact and additional information. Under the heading \u201cPsychological Impact\u201d was the subheading \u201cEffect upon victim\u2019s personal welfare or familial relationships.\u201d The response typed in by the probation officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>stated \u201c \u201c Please see my Victim Impact Statement.\u2019 \u201d A notation to that stated, \u201cStatement not made available to investigating agent.\u201d An additional note at the end of the report stated, \u201cVictim Impact Statement provided by State\u2019s Attorney which will be forwarded directly to court by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement quoted directly from the victim the effects of the crime on her daily life as well as her family\u2019s, the effect of television shows and newspaper articles, and finally the victim\u2019s opinion of the sentence that should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Reid was provided with copies of both statements prior to sentencing and filed a motion to strike the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement or at least those references to sentencing made by the victim. At the sentencing proceeding on November 22, 1982, the judge refused to strike the State\u2019s statement but did state he would not consider the victim\u2019s opinion as to sentencing to be determinative. The court then sentenced Reid to life imprisonment on the first-degree rape conviction, with a consecutive 20-year sentence on the first-degree sexual offense conviction and a consecutive 10-year sentence on the robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported decision upheld the sentence imposed. Citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 336 A.2d 113 (1975), the Court allowed the additional Victim Impact Statement holding it was within the broad discretion of the sentencing judge to consider. The intermediate court, like the trial court, considered Art. 41, \u00a7 124(c) as establishing the minimum standard for information to be obtained from the victim, not the maximum. This Court granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider the important issue raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Reid alleges primarily that the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement is in violation of Art. 41, \u00a7 124 and therefore cannot be considered by the court at sentencing. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>to the Appellant, the only input the victim is allowed is through the Victim Impact Statement submitted by the Division of Parole and Probation. Only if a presentence investigation is specifically not ordered may the State\u2019s Attorney submit a statement as to victim impact. As for the wide discretion granted the sentencing judge in considering such information, Reid claims this is limited by the statute and where such boundaries are exceeded the sentence must be vacated. Reid points to the need for an objective and detached review by the probation officer of the often emotional victim statement as the purpose behind the statute. Such review is allegedly necessary to achieve balance, objectivity and fairness to which the defendant is entitled at sentencing. Reid also claims the \u201cincorporation\u201d of the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement into the presentence investigation statement, sight unseen, compromised that objectivity and fairness. Finally, Reid alleges that the particular statements within the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement were prejudicial and thus require that the sentence be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The State contends that its Victim Impact Statement was merely additional information and it should be left to the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion whether to consider. Section 124(c), the State argues, does not limit the extent of the court\u2019s inquiry but rather ensures that at least a minimum of information on victim impact is provided and will be considered by the court at sentencing. As for the supplemental statement itself, the State contends that no prejudice can be shown and points to the fact that the trial judge specifically refused to consider the victim\u2019s recommendation as to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The stated purposes of Ch. 494 are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">\u201c[Requiring the Division of Parole and Probation to prepare presentence investigations in certain cases; requiring the Division of Parole and Probation to include a Victim Impact Statement within a presentence investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>tion, prior to the sentencing of certain defendants by the circuit courts; authorizing a State\u2019s Attorney to prepare a Victim Impact Statement under certain circumstances; requiring the court to consider the Victim Impact Statement; providing for the contents of the Statement; and generally relating to Victim Impact Statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">In a hearing before the State Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on January 19, 1982, the sponsor of the legislation, Senator Garrity, in a prepared statement, stressed the purpose behind the proposed legislation, victim involvement in the sentencing proceedings. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">\u201cCertainly, I realize that most judges, as a matter of course, will consider the victim impact in determining sentence. This bill asks that every judge make this consideration. Even more important, it provides the mechanism to place at the judge\u2019s disposal all the facts regarding impact of the crime on the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">\u201cEspecially with regard to plea bargaining, the impact report may be the only way the judge can be apprised of the crime\u2019s impact on the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">\u201cI believe in compassionate justice, but I object to the type of one-sided compassion, practiced in many courtrooms. I refer to the tendency to concentrate on seeking out mitigating circumstances and rehabilitative potential as a rationale for meting out less than harsh sentences to offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">\u201cSurely, there should be some place in the sentencing procedure to view the victim with compassion and assess the harm done. And just as surely, the extent of that harm should be a major factor to be considered when sentencing is determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">As stated repeatedly by this Court, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent. <em>Management Personnel Services, Inc. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 478 A.2d 310 (1984); <em>Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007, 1010 (1977). As indicated from the legislative history, the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>of Chapter 494 was to provide the victim access to the sentencing process by ensuring that at least in one way the effects of the crime on the victim will be presented to and considered by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The legislative history shows that the Division of Parole and Probation had urged the sponsor to make any victim impact statement to be prepared by the Division part of its presentence investigation report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Division argued that \u201c[t]he [victim impact] investigation report would have limited value as a sentencing tool if the judge were the only person to utilize this document.\u201d By contrast, a presentence report would be \u201cavailable to classification counselors at intake, the staff of the Parole Commission at parole hearings, and parole agents while under supervision.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also, the Division argued, inclusion of victim impact in the presentence report \u201cwould provide the judge with the victim\u2019s statement and the defendant\u2019s social and criminal background in one comprehensive document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The Division\u2019s second concern was to clarify that the statement should be used in requiring restitution, payable directly to the victim and, ultimately, enforceable as a condition of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The residual benefit of including the mandated statements as part of the presentence reports was that the Division could carry out its duties with no increase in State expenditures. The Division noted, however, that it relied on the existing victim/witness assistance programs continuing their preparation of victim impact statements. The Division stated, \u201c[t]he five major urban counties (Baltimore, Prince George\u2019s, Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Howard) and Baltimore City operate victim witness offices. The staff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>these units have agreed to cooperate with our investigators in preparing victim input.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The negative aspect of including the victim impact statements in presentence reports was that, in 1982, reports were required only in felony cases. While the Division had recognized that presentence reports were not prepared in all cases, the Division stated that, \u201c[pjerhaps the victim\u2019s desire to communicate his/her version of the offense might encourage the judges to request more presentence reports.\u201d However, a representative of the Witness Information Service in the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Anne Arundel County, had testified that, in Anne Arundel, victim impact statement forms were supplied to victims of all crime tried in the circuit court. Furthermore, a representative of the organization Mothers Against Drunk Drivers had faulted the legislation since it was inapplicable to drunk driving cases in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Thus, at one point, the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee considered extending the pending legislation to all misdemeanor crimes, in both the circuit and district courts, where there was a serious injury or death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear that fiscal considerations precluded this action, and the Senate Committee decided to consider district court cases separately.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to circuit court cases, the Senate amended the legislation to mandate that the Division prepare reports\u2014and impact statements\u2014in misdemeanor cases that involved serious injury and death and to permit the State\u2019s Attorney to prepare statements in all other cases. As thus amended, the measure passed the Senate and House.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">This legislative history suggests an intent to establish minimum standards for the information to be provided to judges and to make this information available in as many cases as fiscal constraints allowed. The legislature was, however, aware that some of the victim/witness assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>programs provided services in all cases before the circuit courts, and in some instances, all courts. The legislature also was aware that the Division of Parole and Probation intended to rely on these services, in order to fulfill its duties under the victim impact legislation. Thus, it is clear that the legislature intended to extend, rather than restrict existing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">There is, therefore, no evidence from either the legislative history or the statute itself of an intent to limit the victim\u2019s role to the single Victim Impact Statement of the presentence investigation. In addition, such an interpretation runs contrary to the broad discretion placed in the sentencing judge long recognized by this Court. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. at 540, 336 A.2d at 116; <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 147-148, 328 A.2d 293, 303 (1974); <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 193, 297 A.2d 696, 706 (1972); <em>Purnell v. State, </em>241 Md. 582, 585, 217 A.2d 298, 300 (1966); <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 470-71, 206 A.2d 812, 816-17 (1965); <em>Farrell v. State, </em>213 Md. 348, 355, 131 A.2d 863, 867 (1957); <em>Driver v. State, </em>201 Md. 25, 31, 92 A.2d 570, 573 (1952); <em>Murphy v. State, </em>184 Md. 70, 82, 40 A.2d 239, 244 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">This Court has in the past refrained from placing restrictions on the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion as to information that may be considered. In <em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 425 A.2d 632 (1981), the Court refused to extend the exclusionary rule to the sentencing phase of the trial. Judge Digges writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">\u201cThe widespread acceptance of this conceptual model of the penal function of our justice system has few detractors and has resulted in a paucity of restraints being placed on a judge possessing the responsibility to impose punishment lest he be \u2018forced to bridle himself with mental blinders and thus enter the process of imposing sentence with impaired vision.\u2019 <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 542, 336 A.2d 113, 116 (1975).\u201d 289 Md. at 482, 425 A.2d at 643.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>The only restrictions placed on the judge at sentencing are that the sentence not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or violate constitutional requirements; the judge not be motivated by ill-will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; and that sentence be within the statutory limitation. <em>Teasley v. State, </em>298 Md. 364, 370, 470 A.2d 337, 340 (1980). The sentence is generally challenged on the claim of some impermissible consideration but never has this Court considered a challenge to a statement by the victim. Previous opinions of the Court on impermissible considerations support, however, a finding that such statements are permissible and therefore beyond review absent an actual showing of prejudice to the defendant. In <em>Purnell v. State, </em>241 Md. at 585, 217 A.2d at 300, circumstances relevant to the aggravation as well as mitigation of the sentence were considered permissible. <em>See also Farrell v. State, </em>213 Md. at 355, 131 A.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">In <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 297 A.2d 696 (1972), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">\u201cIn other words, to aid the sentencing judge in fairly and intelligently exercising the discretion vested in him, the procedural policy of the State encourages him to consider information concerning the convicted person\u2019s reputation, past offenses, health, habits, mental and moral propensities, social background <em>and any other matters that a judge ought to have before him in determining the sentence that should be imposed.\u201d </em>267 Md. at 175, 297 A.2d at 706 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 328 A.2d 293, Judge Smith stated, \u201cIt is elementary that in passing sentence in a given case the sentence should be fashioned, to the best of the sentencing judge\u2019s ability, to the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime and the individual then being sentenced.\u201d 273 Md. at 150, 328 A.2d at 304. Certainly the effects of the crime on the victim whether economical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>physical, psychological, or all three fall within these relevant permissible considerations. There is no justification for limiting the broad discretion of the judge with regard to the victim\u2019s role in sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The proper interpretation then of Art. 41, \u00a7 124(c) is that it sets a minimum standard for what the sentencing judge in a circuit court must consider as far as the effects of the crime on the victim. Section 124(c) does not prevent additional statements or comments from being offered whether by the victim, his family or the State\u2019s Attorney. The only difference between the presentence investigation\u2019s Victim Impact Statement and any additional statements offered is that with regard to the latter it is within the judge\u2019s discretion whether to consider them at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">As for the alleged blind \u201cadoption by reference\u201d of the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement within the presentence investigation, there is no evidence that that was indeed the case or that any harm was caused. From the notations made on the report, it is clear that the probation agent had not seen the second Victim Impact Statement and that it was not being incorporated as the actual source of the information was clearly stated. It is also clear that the presentence investigation\u2019s Victim Impact Statement was separate and distinct from the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement and was regarded by the probation agent, the State\u2019s Attorney Office, and the sentencing judge as such. It is, therefore, left to the judge\u2019s discretion whether or not to consider this additional statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Finally, as to whether the State\u2019s Victim Impact Statement was prejudicial to the defendant at sentencing, there is no evidence to support the claim. As stated in <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. at 150, 328 A.2d at 304, when evaluating a statement of a sentencing judge as to whether a statement is prejudicial, the court\u2019s statement must be considered as a whole. In the present case the only questionable comments made by the victim in the supplemental statement were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>those regarding the appropriate sentencing. The sentencing judge, when considering the motion to strike the statement in its entirety or at least that particular portion referring to sentencing, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-5\">\u201cAs I said last time, although there may be under\u2014and apparently is in this report a recommendation of the victim as to the proper sentence that ought to be imposed, the Court is in no sense in any way bound by any such recommendation nor will consider that as being any\u2014the determinative factor in the sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The judge went on at sentencing to refer to portions of the supplemental statement but made no reference to the victim\u2019s view as to the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">\u2018T don\u2019t know whether you really appreciate what you did to that young lady. I don\u2019t know whether counsel showed you the victim impact statement that I had to read. This young girl will never be the same. You have changed her entire life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">\u201cThere is nothing I can do to bring her back. Nothing you can do. Mr. Reid, she\u2019s afraid to walk down the street and see a black man because of what you did. There is no suggestion she ever had that feeling before that date. She\u2019s afraid to be home alone at night. She\u2019s afraid to drive alone. Now, you say you recognize you\u2019re going to spend some time in prison, and of course, you will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">As stated previously, the effect of the crime on the victim\u2019s daily life, particularly when such a personal crime as rape is involved, is a permissible consideration at sentencing. This view is supported by section 124(c), which includes psychological effects as a factor that must be considered by the sentencing judge. We need not, however, consider whether the victim\u2019s opinion as to the appropriate sentence is a permissible consideration since the judge did not actually consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS TO THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">ELDRIDGE and COLE, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Dissenting Opinion by ELDRIDGE, J., in which COLE, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">.

As the majority re-writes this statutory provision, it also means that the State\u2019s attorney may prepare and submit to the court a victim impact statement if the court <em>does order </em>a presentence investigation. The majority, ignoring the plain language used by the General Assembly and purportedly relying on legislative history, deletes the word \u201cnot\u201d from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">We have repeated time after time that \u201cif there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Vallario v.

State, </em>284 Md. 132, 142, 148-149, 395 A.2d 464 (1978). <em>See also </em>Murphy, <em>Plain-Meaning Rule, </em>75 Colum.L.Rev. 1299 (1975); Jones, <em>The Plain Meaning Rule and Extrinsic Aids in the Interpretation of Federal Statutes, </em>25 Washington University Law Quarterly 2 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In the instant case, however, the legislative history relied on by the majority does not shed \u201cconsiderable light on the question before the Court.\u201d It is entirely ambiguous, and does not directly address the issue now before the Court. At best, as the majority states, \u201c[t]his legislative history <em>suggests </em>an intent to establish minimum standards for the information to be provided to judges____\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority relies on a negative, <em>i.e., </em>that there is \u201cno evidence from ... the legislative history ... of an intent to limit the victim\u2019s role to the single Victim Impact Statement of the presentence investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In my opinion, such ambiguous legislative history does not furnish an adequate basis for ignoring clear and unambiguous statutory language. Because the failure to comply with the statutory sentencing procedures is reversible error, <em>Scott v. State, </em>289 Md. 647, 426 A.2d 923 (1981), I would remand this case for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Judge COLE has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
