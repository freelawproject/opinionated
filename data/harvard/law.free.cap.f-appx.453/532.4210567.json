Because precedent forecloses the Williamses\u2019 appeal, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">As part of an IRS investigation into the Williamses\u2019 federal income tax liability, the IRS sent third-party summonses to Wells Fargo and Aurora requesting information relating to the Williamses\u2019 financial dealings with the two institutions. The summonses were sent, respectively, to locations in Oregon and Nebraska. The Williamses filed a petition to quash the summonses in the Northern District of Texas, the district in which they reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">The district court dismissed the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, relying on two, almost factually-identical circuit precedents. <em>See Deal v. United States, </em>759 F.2d 442 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Masat v. United States, </em>745 F.2d 985 (5th Cir.1984). <em>Deal </em>and <em>Masat </em>concerned taxpayer challenges to IRS third-party summonses. Both affirmed dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, reasoning that the Internal Revenue Code vests jurisdiction over such challenges in the district court where the third-party resides. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609(h)(1) (\u201cThe United States district court for the district within which the person to be summoned resides or is found shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any proceeding brought under subsection (b)(2), (f), or (g).\u201d); <em>Deal, </em>759 F.2d at 444 (holding that <em>Masat </em>\u201cprecluded\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s appeal and that jurisdiction was \u201cexclusively in the district where the third-party record keepers reside\u201d); <em>Masat, </em>745 F.2d at 986, 988.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">The Williamses acknowledge the holdings in <em>Deal </em>and <em>Masat </em>and concede that the cases remain good law, but they ask us to overrule our prior precedent and hold that \u00a7 7609(h)(1) is a venue, rather than jurisdictional, statute. The Rule of Orderliness, of course, prevents us from doing so. <em>See, e.g., Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
