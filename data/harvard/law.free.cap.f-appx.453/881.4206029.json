(\u201cDunn\u201d), on his employment discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a) and -3(a), and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>trict court erred by finding that his delayed promotion did not constitute an adverse employment action and that he failed to demonstrate Dunn\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reason for delaying his promotion was pretextual. He also argues that the district court erred by finding that he failed to show that the reason Dunn gave for subsequently demoting him was pretextual. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards used by the district court.\u201d <em>Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Swisher Int\u2019l., Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA mere \u2018scintilla\u2019 of evidence supporting the opposing party\u2019s position will not suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer \u201cto discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a), \u201c[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a). Claims of race discrimination are cognizable under both Title VII and \u00a7 1981, and they \u201chave the same requirements of proof and use the same analytical framework.\u201d <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we address Blue\u2019s Title VII claim with the understanding that the same analysis applies to his \u00a7 1981 claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim through the introduction of direct evidence of discrimination or circumstantial evidence that creates an inference of discrimination. <em>Hinson v. Clinch Cnty., Ga. Bd. of Educ., </em>231 F.3d 821, 827 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an employment discrimination case such as this one, where the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, we apply the <em>McDonnell-Douglas</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 975-76 (11th Cir.2008). Under this analysis, the plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that: (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he was subject to an adverse employment action, (3) his employer treated similarly situated employees who were not members of his protected class more favorably, and (4) he was qualified to do the job. <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006). If the plaintiff satisfies the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>elements of a prima facie case of disparate treatment, and the employer proffers a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment action, the plaintiff must then show that the reason \u201cis a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">We have determined that an \u201cadvei\u2019se employment action\u201d includes \u201ctermination, failure to hire, or demotion.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>529 F.3d at 970. An employer\u2019s conduct falling short of those actions \u201cmust, in some substantial way, alter the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprive him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affect his or her status as an employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted). With regard to the level of substantiality required, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he \u201csuffered a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 970-71 (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">It is uncontested that Dunn\u2019s practice was to place an employee who was being considered for a promotion in an \u201cacting foreman\u201d role for an indeterminate trial period, during which the employee would be evaluated for suitability. An acting foreman is not a salaried employee but is assured of forty hours\u2019 worth of wages regardless of weather conditions, a benefit not given to regular workers. Acting foremen are also entitled to overtime wages, which not even permanent foremen are awarded. Blue remained as an acting foreman for fifteen months and, due to overtime, earned an annual wage higher than that of a permanent foreman. He claims that he was subjected to an adverse employment action because Dunn unreasonably delayed his promotion to permanent foreman on account of his race. In support, Blue presented evidence that two white acting foremen were promoted sooner than he was, one after serving in the acting role for nine months and the other, by Blue\u2019s accounting, for less than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">This circuit has not yet determined whether a delayed promotion can satisfy the adverse employment action prong. <em>See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). Dunn did not have a company policy about the length of the evaluation period, meaning that Blue could not show unreasonable delay in promoting him, based on a deviation from company policy. The length of the trial period depends on the employee\u2019s performance as acting foreman, and Blue was an acting foreman for only a few months longer than the two white acting foremen. Thus, like the <em>Pennington </em>court, we have \u201cconsiderable doubt about whether [Blue] can satisfy ... the adverse employment action prong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that he has established a prima facie case, he did not rebut Dunn\u2019s non-discriminatory reason for the delay. A plaintiff will withstand summary judgment by demonstrating \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Ala. State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] reason cannot ... be a \u2018pretext <em>for discrimination </em>\u2019 unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">As noted by the district court, non-discriminatory reasons supporting Dunn\u2019s decisions to delay the promotion are: (1) Blue\u2019s 2006 performance evaluation, which reflected poor performance in three-out-of-five major responsibility categories and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>showed that he failed to score \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cExcellent\u201d in any of ten overall categories; (2) the fact that the two white acting foremen who were promoted more quickly both scored higher than Blue on their performance evaluations; and (8) Blue\u2019s repeated difficulty in managing his crew, leading his supervisors to keep him as an acting foreman in the hopes of improvement. If anything, Dunn\u2019s decisions to delay promotion seem focused on ensuring that Blue be given an adequate chance to improve his performance and avoid being demoted, rather than seeking to indefinitely prevent a further promotion on account of his race. Blue failed to rebut these nondiscriminatory reasons for delaying his promotion. The district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Next, Blue contends that Dunn subsequently promoted him to permanent foreman, only to demote him back to a regular asphalt worker on account of his race. As discussed above, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discriminatory demotion by showing that (1) he belongs to a protected class, (2) he was subject to an adverse employment action, (3) the employer treated similarly situated employees not of the protected class more favorably, and (4) he was qualified for the job. <em>Burke-Fowler, </em>447 F.3d at 1323. If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for demotion. <em>Id. </em>If the employer identifies legitimate reasons, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the employer\u2019s articulated reason is a mere pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff \u201cmust meet [the proffered reason] head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">If a plaintiff attempts to show pretext by comparing his own treatment to the employer\u2019s treatment of similarly situated employees outside of his class, his comparators must be \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant aspects.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). Employees are \u201csimilarly situated\u201d if they are involved in the same or similar conduct and are disciplined in different ways. <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). We have held that a \u201ccomparator must be nearly identical to the plaintiff to prevent courts from second-guessing a reasonable decision by the employer.\u201d <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1091 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court properly concluded that Blue established a prima facie case of discrimination, Blue still fails to present evidence that could lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Dunn\u2019s stated reasons for his demotion \u2014 poor performance and failure to control his crew \u2014 were pretext for race discrimination. Specifically, Blue did not show that Dunn\u2019s proffered reasons were false. <em>See Hicks, </em>509 U.S. at 515, 113 S.Ct. at 2752. The person who demoted Blue was the same one who had previously promoted him. Also, the evaluation of Blue.\u2019s 2007 performance contained negative remarks about the number of callbacks on his projects, his inability to focus on quality, the low amount of work his crew accomplished in a typical day, his inability to supervise his crew, and the crew taking advantage of his friendly relations with them. Total ratings of less than \u201cacceptable performance\u201d in three of the five major job responsibilities reflected little improvement from 2006. The only other foreman with scores as low as Blue\u2019s was Tim Fallin, who is white and was demoted in 2007, then fired in 2008. The evaluation, which Blue signed after discussing it with his supervisors, noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Blue had \u201cnot significantly improved in 2007. [Dunn] will put someone helping [Blue] with his crew and monitor whether this helps. If it does not, then we have no choice but to make a change and place [Blue] back as an operator.\u201d Blue does not dispute that, in December 2007, General Superintendent Billy Joe Nichols and Blue\u2019s immediate supervisor, Wayne Snell, who is African American, verbally warned him that he faced demotion if he did not take better charge of his crew. Given all this evidence, Blue failed to show that Dunn\u2019s proffered reason for demotion contained \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>405 F.3d at 1289.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Furthermore, Blue failed to show pretext by comparing his own treatment to Dunn\u2019s treatment of similarly situated white employees. <em>See Holifield, </em>115 F.3d at 1562. His performance scores were worse than his comparators\u2019. And while Blue\u2019s comparators had criminal records, had failed drug tests, or had failed to wear their uniforms, none of them had been evaluated as failing to control their crew or producing poor quality work. The \u201cquantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct [must] be nearly identical [to the plaintiffs] to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1999). Here, Blue\u2019s comparators were not charged with the same kind of misconduct that he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">We do not analyze \u201cwhether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful discriminatory animus motivates a challenged employment decision.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.1999). Since there was no unlawful animus, the district court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-10\">. Blue offers no argument with respect to his retaliation claim and his discrimination claim based on the denial of assistance to perform his duties. Those claims are thereby waived, and we decline to address them. <em>See Mize v. Hall, </em>532 F.3d 1184, 1189 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b909-8\">. Even though Blue\u2019s delayed promotion claim was time-barred under Title VII because he filed his EEOC charge more than 180 days after he was promoted, it was nevertheless cognizable under \u00a7 1981 because he filed his charge within four years of his promotion. <em>See Calloway v. Partners Nat'l Health Plans, </em>986 F.2d 446, 448 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-9\">. Because Blue does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that no direct evidence of race discrimination existed, the only dispute is whether Blue presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to avoid summary judgment on his delayed promotion claim under \u00a7 1981. <em>See Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\"><em>. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b912-5\">. Blue also argues that the real reason Dunn demoted him was because a member of Blue\u2019s crew damaged a building with paving equipment. <em>See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that evidence of pretext can include where an employer gives \"shifting\u201d reasons for an employment decision). As the district court noted, such an accident by itself \u201cwould not normally be cause for the demotion of a Foreman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">To support this contention, Blue offered the testimony of Snell and Matt Albright. Snell did discuss the job-site accident at the same time he discussed Blue's demotion, but when Snell was directly asked why Blue was demoted, Snell said, \"Because I don\u2019t think he was \u2014 he didn\u2019t take charge of his crew was the main thing. As far as running his crew</p>\n<p id=\"AOr\">himself. Making all the shot calls and driving and pushing. He wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t doing that.\u201d One of Blue\u2019s crew members had told Al-bright that Blue was demoted because of the accident. Even if the district court could consider this hearsay, <em>see Pritchard v. S. Co. Servs., </em>92 F.3d 1130, 1135 (11th Cir.1996), it does not help Blue\u2019s case because it merely establishes what one of Blue\u2019s own crew members thought about Blue's demotion. It does not provide evidence of why Blue\u2019s supervisors demoted him. <em>See Steger v. General Electric Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1079 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that \"statements made by non-decisionmakers\u201d do not demonstrate discriminatory intent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"A12S\">.
