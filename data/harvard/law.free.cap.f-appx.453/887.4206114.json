Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Palacios was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to conspiracy to launder money and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(2)(A), (h). Palacios filed a section 2255 motion to vacate in which he raised five claims, including that his lawyer was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. Following an evidentiary hearing on this claim, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Palacios\u2019s motion to vacate. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and denied Palacios\u2019s motion on the merits. We granted a certificate of ap-pealability on the question of \u201c[w]hether the district court erred in denying Palac-ios\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with Palacios about filing an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">\u201cWhether counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Thompson v. United States, </em>504 F.3d 1203, 1206 n. 4 (11th Cir.2007). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. Id. </em>To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">It is well-established that a lawyer who disregards his client\u2019s instructions to file a notice of appeal acts in a professionally unreasonable manner. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 1035, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Even when a defendant does not specifically instruct his lawyer to file an appeal, we must determine whether his lawyer consulted with him about an appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Ajdequate consultation requires informing a client about his right to appeal, advising the client about the advantages and disadvantages of taking an appeal, <em>and </em>making a reasonable effort to determine whether the client wishes to pursue an appeal, regardless of the merits of such an appeal.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1206 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">Although Palacios asserted that he specifically asked his lawyer, Gustavo Garcia-Montes, to file an appeal, the district court credited Garcia-Montes\u2019s testimony that Palacios never asked him to do so. Because nothing evidences that the court\u2019s credibility finding was clearly erroneous, we will assume that Palacios never expressly asked Garcia-Montes to file an appeal. <em>See McGriff v. Dep\u2019t ofCorr., </em>338 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cAbsent evidence of clear error, we consider ourselves bound by a district court\u2019s findings of fact and credibility determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Thus, our inquiry turns to whether Garcia-Montes actually consulted with Pa-lacios about his appeal. <em>See Flores-Ortega, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1035. At the evidentiary hearing, Garcia-Montes testified that \u2014 in response to Palacios\u2019s dissatisfaction with his sentence and questions about what to do next \u2014 he told Palacios that nothing could be done because he had waived his right to appeal his sentence and the district court had sentenced him within the guidelines range. Garcia-Montes did not, however, attempt to determine whether Palacios wished to file an appeal or discuss the advantages and disadvantages of filing such an appeal. We have explained that \u201c[sjimply asserting the view that an appeal would not be successful does not constitute \u2018consultation\u2019 in any meaningful sense.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number><em>Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1207. Based on this record, we conclude that Garcia-Montes failed to consult adequately with Palacios about his right to appeal and must determine whether Garcia-Montes had a constitutional duty to do so. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">A constitutional duty to consult with a defendant about an appeal arises \u201cwhen there is reason to think either (1) that a rational defendant would want to appeal ..., or (2) that this particular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he was interested in appealing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the evidentiary hearing, Garcia-Montes testified that after the court announced Palacios\u2019s sentence Palacios asked \u201cwhat\u2019s next? What can we do now? Something along those lines.\u201d After Garcia-Montes told him that nothing could be done, Palacios \u201cwas quiet, [and] ... looked very crushed.\u201d Because Palacios\u2019s conduct reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing, it triggered Garcia-Montes\u2019s duty to consult with him about his appeal. <em>See Thompson, </em>504 F.3d at 1208 (concluding that counsel had a \u201cclear duty to consult\u201d with his client about an appeal when his client expressed that he was \u201cunhappy\u201d with his sentence as compared to that of his codefendants). Garcia-Montes\u2019s failure to fulfill this duty constituted deficient performance under <em>Strickland. See Flores-Ortega, </em>120 S.Ct. at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">To establish prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>Palacios \u201cmust demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Palac-ios immediately expressed dissatisfaction with his sentence and testified that he wished to file an appeal. Thus, he demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have exercised his right to appeal. <em>See id. </em>(stating that evidence that the defendant \u201cpromptly expressed a desire to appeal will often be highly relevant\u201d in determining whether he suffered prejudice). Because Palacios established that his lawyer was ineffective for failing to consult with him, he \u201cis entitled to an out-of-time appeal, regardless of whether he can identify any arguably meritorious grounds for appeal that would fit one of the exceptions contained in his appeal waiver.\u201d <em>See Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 793 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">We vacate and remand with instructions that Palacios be permitted to file a direct appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>225 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
