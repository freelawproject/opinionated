He argues only that this sentence, which falls at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court established a bifurcated process for reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). This court must determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is proeedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jaquez concedes, however, that he failed to object to the sentence following its imposition such that plain error review is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">We have rejected Jaquez\u2019s argument that the use of a conviction both for determining a defendant\u2019s offense level as well as his criminal history score renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We likewise have rejected Jaquez\u2019s contention that a guidelines sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Finally, we are unpersuaded by Jaquez\u2019s argument that the sentence imposed is unreasonable because it fails to give sufficient weight to the facts that he was culturally assimilated in the United States and that he returned to the United States to visit his family. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). He fails to show plain error. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
