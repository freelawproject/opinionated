On appeal, Aguiar argues that the two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B) should not apply to his offense level because a \u201csubstantial\u201d part of his fraudulent credit-card scheme was not \u201ccommitted from outside the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the sentencing statutes and sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B), a two-level enhancement applies to a defendant\u2019s offense level if \u201ca substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States.\u201d This section does not define \u201csubstantial,\u201d nor apparently has any court had occasion to consider the precise definition. However, \u201clanguage in the Sentencing Guidelines is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Further, where the guidelines provide no indication as to a particular application the Court looks to the language and purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines for instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>17 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir.1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Our only previous discussion of the level enhancement at issue in this case was in <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756 (11th Cir.2002), where we held that a defendant need not personally commit a substantial part of the fraudulent scheme from outside of the United States in order to qualify for a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 761-62. Singh, along with his co-conspirators in Kuwait, engaged in a \u201ccall sell\u201d scheme to defraud long distance and local telephone service providers. <em>Id. </em>at 759. Singh would establish telephone service at locations in the United States using false personal and business identities. <em>Id. </em>Meanwhile, Singh\u2019s Kuwaiti contacts would set up telephone banks in Kuwait. <em>Id. </em>Singh would call the phone banks in Kuwait and use his phone\u2019s three-way calling system to route calls from third parties through the phone bank. <em>Id. </em>These third parties would pay Singh\u2019s co-conspirators a fee for the connection service. <em>Id. </em>A portion of this fee was forwarded to Singh, who would move to another location without ever paying his own phone bills in America. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">We held that the level enhancement was not reserved solely to punish telemarketing fraud and that the statute did not require that the scheme originate from outside the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 761-62. We then concluded that the evidence clearly established that a significant part of the conspiracy\u2019s acts occurred outside of the United States, in light of the fact that ninety-nine percent of Singh\u2019s telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>calls were international, that ninety percent of the telephone calls were placed to Kuwait while employing the telephone\u2019s three-way calling feature, and that Singh received a wire transfer in Alabama from someone in Kuwait. <em>Id. </em>at 762. Because these acts were reasonably foreseeable and were taken in furtherance of the conspiracy, Singh was responsible for his Kuwaiti co-conspirators\u2019 actions outside the United States. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">In the current case, Aguiar contends that the commission of the crime was in Miami, where he and several of his co-conspirators would create fraudulent credit cards and use them to purchase goods. We disagree and find that the district court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement. Regardless of the precise definition of \u201csubstantial,\u201d Aguiar\u2019s conduct easily satisfies \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(9)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The sine qua non of his scheme was obtaining stolen credit card account numbers. There is no dispute that these numbers were stolen in Brazil by Aguiar\u2019s co-conspirators, then emailed from Brazil to Aguiar. These acts are imputed to Aguiar himself since they are reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 761-62. Additionally, every time Aguiar and his co-conspirators used the fraudulent credit cards, an approval was sent to Brazil, where Brazilian banks would act by extending credit on the cards. The final step of Aguiar\u2019s scheme \u2014 and indeed the only reason it produced any money \u2014 was to send the fraudulently obtained goods to Brazil and sell them for profit. Occasionally, Aguiar himself would transport the goods to Brazil to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Two of the most important acts (stealing card numbers and selling the goods for profit) occurred in Brazil, as did the extension of credit. That is, parts of the beginning, middle, and end of Aguiar\u2019s scheme took place outside of the United States. The district court\u2019s factual finding that a significant part of Aguiar\u2019s scheme occurred in Brazil does not amount to clear error. <em>See id. </em>at 762. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-8\">.
