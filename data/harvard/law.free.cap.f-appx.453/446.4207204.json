He claims that the Appellees failed to provide him with economic opportunities allegedly guaranteed to him through a public housing redevelopment plan. The district court granted summary judgment to the Appellees. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In the district court, Price pursued a bevy of claims arising out of a memorandum of understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) between HANO and DARC. The MOU states, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">The Authority [HANO] will train residents for all types of economic opportunities, including but not limited to management, entrepreneurship, construction and maintenance. The Authority will hire residents during the planning, reconstruction and re-occupancy of Desire LA 1-14. The DARC will participate with the identification and selection of the Desire residents in hiring programs. The Authority will consider DARC or Desire Residents] for available contracts for any and all phases of planning, reconstruction, evaluation and monitoring of Desire, LA 1-14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Price claimed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that he was denied due process because the Appellees (1) failed to provide him any job training or assistance, (2) failed to allow him to participate in the decisionmaking process regarding the redevelopment, and (3) failed to give adequate notice of their meetings. Additionally, Price alleged an (4) equal protection violation because of the hiring practices of DARC and (5) a Louisiana state-law claim seeking to enforce the MOU as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">On appeal, however, due to the poor briefing of his newly-obtained counsel, Price has waived nearly all of his claims for error. In his brief to this court, Price sets out four \u201cAssignment[s] of Error,\u201d but the brief never puts forth any argument on these points; therefore, they are waived. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 695 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, of the issues that were briefed, one is \u201cA Summary Judgment Fraudulently Obtained Should be Annulled on Appeal.\u201d In this section, the argument seems to be that the Appel-lees committed a fraud on the district court that ought to be corrected under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3). The only authority that Price\u2019s counsel cites is the corresponding Louisiana rule, <em>see </em>La.Code Civ. Proc. art.2004, and a case from this court interpreting that provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such an accusation of fraud without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>any factual or legal support is also deemed waived. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We do find two claims sufficiently briefed so as to preserve them for our review: (1) the district court erred in not finding a property interest for the purposes of Price\u2019s due process claim and (2) the district court erred in finding that Price was not a third-party beneficiary to the MOU under Louisiana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>641 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate where the movant shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a)). In reviewing the record, all facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">A. Section 1983 Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Price argues that 24 C.F.R. pt. 135.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> gave him a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause. He claims that the Appellees failed to provide him job training or assistance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, [a] plaintiff! ] must allege two elements: first, that they were deprived of a right or interest secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and second, that the deprivation occurred under col- or of state law.... [I]n \u00a7 1983 suits alleging a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ... [pjlaintiffs must (1) assert a protected \u201cliberty or property\u201d interest and (2) show that they were deprived of that interest under color of state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-17\"><em>Doe v. Rains Cnty. Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>66 F.3d 1402, 1406 (5th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). \u201cIn order for a person to have a property interest within the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment, he \u2018must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blackburn v. City of Marshall, </em>42 F.3d 925, 936 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"AbJ\">Part 135.1 states the purpose behind the enactment of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701u.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The language of part 135.1, however, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>speak to any particular entitlement, but rather to the goals of Congress in enacting the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. The \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d provisions of part 135.1 is insufficient to support a finding that Price had a property right to anything. <em>Anderson v. Jackson, </em>556 F.3d 351, 356 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Wilson v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>991 F.2d 1211, 1216 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe mere fact that a government program exists does not give a person a property interest in participating in the program.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">B. Third-Party Beneficiary Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Price further argues that he is entitled to enforce the MOU because it includes a stipulation <em>pour autrui; </em>that is, he is a third-party beneficiary. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code art.1978. The Louisiana Supreme Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has laid out a test to determine if a contract intends to create a stipulation <em>pour autrui: </em>\u201c1) the stipulation for a third party is manifestly clear; 2) there is certainty as to the benefit provided the third party; and 3) the benefit is not a mere incident of the contract between the promisor and the promisee.\u201d <em>Joseph v. Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 2 of Parish of St. Mary, </em>939 So.2d 1206, 1211 (La.2006). Neither the benefit nor the beneficiary is manifestly clear in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AUV4\">. It is unclear from the citation, however, to what Price\u2019s counsel is directing this court. Her citation is to <em>\u201cSt. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, </em>224 F.3d 425 (5th Cir.2000), cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>ing Chiarella v. U.S., </em>[445 U.S. 222] 100 S.Ct. 1108[ 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980)] [sic].\u201d Nowhere in our opinion in <em>St. Paul Mercury Insurance </em>do we cite to <em>Chiarella. </em>This is not the only sloppy citation in Price\u2019s counsel\u2019s confusing brief. Earlier, she appears to quote language from <em>Reese v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>210 F.Supp.2d 1324 (S.D.Fla.2002), which does not appear in that opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\">.
