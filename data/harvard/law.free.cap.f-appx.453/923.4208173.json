On appeal, Wanigasekara argues that: (1) even though we have held that an IJ\u2019s determination that an asylum application is time-barred is a non-reviewable discretionary decision, she is appealing the IJ\u2019s legal conclusion that she failed to establish changed circumstances that would excuse her delay in applying for asylum; (2) the BIA erroneously affirmed the IJ\u2019s statement that she was.not \u201cparticularly credible\u201d as an adverse-credibility finding; (3) she clearly and unequivocally demonstrat<em>ed </em>past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Sri Lanka; and (4) she is entitled to withholding of removal because, if returned to Sri Lanka, it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted due to her former husband\u2019s political activities. After careful review, we dismiss the petition in part, and deny it in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we will review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). Because the BIA expressly agreed with the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility determination, we will review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ on this issue. <em>See Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We review factual determinations, which include credibility determinations, under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006). We must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d Id. at 1255 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, in order for us to conclude that a finding of fact should be reversed, we must deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>mine that the record \u201ccompels\u201d reversal. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">First, we lack jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Wanigasekara\u2019s asylum claim. An alien may apply for asylum if she \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the [one-year] period.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We lack jurisdiction to review decisions of the Attorney General regarding whether an alien timely filed an asylum application or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007). Nevertheless, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Applying the law to this case, we lack jurisdiction to consider Wanigasekara\u2019s argument that the IJ erred by considering the date of her separation, as opposed to the date of her divorce, to determine whether she filed her asylum application within a reasonable time period from her changed circumstances, because this was a factual determination. As a result, to the extent that Wanigasekara is challenging the dismissal of her asylum claim, we dismiss her petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Next, we find irrelevant Wanigasekara\u2019s argument that the BIA erroneously affirmed the IJ\u2019s statement that she was not \u201cparticularly credible\u201d as an adverse-credibility finding. To be considered an adverse-credibility determination, the IJ or BIA must make \u201cclean determinations of credibility,\u201d and say expressly that the applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). In <em>Yang, </em>we held that an IJ\u2019s statements that an applicant\u2019s claim was a \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d and that the applicant\u2019s testimony was \u201cextremely inconsistent and [made] absolutely no sense whatsoever,\u201d was not a credibility finding, but rather a comment on the insufficiency of the applicant\u2019s evidence. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAs the trier of fact, the IJ must determine credibility, and this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Once the IJ makes an adverse-credibility determination, the burden shifts to the alien to demonstrate that the determination was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons,\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55 (quotation omitted). If the IJ made no adverse-credibility finding, we are required to accept the petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">In this case, even though the BIA incorrectly construed the IJ\u2019s ambiguous statement that Wanigasekara was not \u201cparticularly credible\u201d as an adverse-credibility finding, this is not dispositive of Waniga-sekara\u2019s claims. As the record shows, the BIA also considered whether she adequately demonstrated past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, which we discuss next.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">Under the INA, the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to any alien determined to be a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of the Act. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). \u201cA refugee is defined as one who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her home country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1202 (quotations omitted) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)). The applicant bears the burden of proof of establishing that she is a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">To establish asylum eligibility based on past persecution, the applicant must prove that she was persecuted and that the persecution was based on a protected ground. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006). Persecution is not defined in the INA, but it is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted) (holding that threatening telephone calls to an asylum applicant and her family member do not constitute persecution). In considering evidence of past persecution, we will consider a threatening act against another as evidence that the petitioner herself suffered persecution if that act \u201cconcomitantly threatens the petitioner.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1009 n. 7 (11th Cir.2008). Examples that we have upheld include the rape of the wife of the petitioner\u2019s friend during the petitioner\u2019s kidnapping, and the severe beating of the petitioner\u2019s son. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Proof of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on the same basis. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1351. However, if the applicant cannot establish past persecution, she may still show a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing \u201ca fear of persecution in [her] country of nationality on account of a protected ground, a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if the applicant returns to that country, and that [she] is unable or unwilling to return because of [her] fear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352 (quotation omitted). \u201cAn applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... if under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">On this record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Waniga-sekara did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. First, Wanigasekara\u2019s descriptions of threatening phone calls and her unproven allegations that her dog was poisoned on account of her former husband\u2019s political activities do not rise to the level of persecution within the meaning of the INA. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, there is nothing to suggest that Wanigasekara would be in danger if returned to Sri Lanka because she is now divorced from her husband and she testified that she no longer has any political ties in Sri Lanka. <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Finally, we reject Wanigasekara\u2019s claim that she is entitled to withholding of removal. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that, if returned to his country, her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232. Accordingly, an alien who fails to establish eligibility for asylum generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">As we concluded above, Wanigasekara could not prove her entitlement to asylum relief. Therefore, the BIA properly determined that she necessarily could not satisfy the higher burden of proof for establishing her eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\">. Moreover, because Wanigasekara failed to raise any arguments on appeal concerning the denial of CAT relief or the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the IJ properly conducted the removal hearing, she has abandoned these issues. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that \"[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-6\">. Nor, based on the record before us, is there any merit to her argument that her family\u2019s alleged decision to sever ties with her on account of her husband's lower caste and political ties or the incident where her husband was allegedly threatened at gunpoint provided legitimate bases for her asylum claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
