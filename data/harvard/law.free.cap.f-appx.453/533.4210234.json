He also appeals his revocation sentence imposed after Islas violated the terms of probation arising from a prior improper entry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Islas contends that, because he argued in the district court that he should receive a lower sentence, plain error review is improper, even though he failed to object on unreasonableness grounds. As Islas concedes, this court has held that an objection to the substantive unreasonableness of a sentence is required to preserve error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999) (holding that a panel of this court cannot overturn a prior panel\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">Islas further challenges the application of the plainly unreasonable standard of review to his revocation sentence although he likewise concedes that this court has held otherwise. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). Because Islas did not object to his revocation sentence, this contention is nevertheless irrelevant, and review of his revocation sentence is also limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-25\">In asserting unreasonableness, Islas first argues that the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically supported and a sentence under that Guideline is therefore unreasonable. But \u201c[a] discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable,\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008), and this court has held that examination of the empirical basis for sentencing guidelines is not necessary before applying the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). This court has also rejected Islas\u2019s argument that the nonviolent nature of illegal reentry warrants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>reversal of the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">As for Islas\u2019s revocation sentence, his sentencing range was 8-14 months, under the policy statements. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7B 1.4(a), (b)(3)(A). The statutory maximum sentence that could be imposed upon revocation of Islas\u2019s parole was a one-year term of imprisonment because the offense resulting in his term of probation was a Class E felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Islas\u2019s violation of his probation was a Grade B violation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), and at the time of his original sentencing to probation, Islas\u2019s criminal history category was III. The 11-month sentence imposed was therefore within the policy statement guidelines range and below the statutory maximum penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Islas contends that all of the goals of sentencing could have been met by a far lower combined sentence. However, \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The record demonstrates that the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Islas\u2019s arguments at sentencing before determining that a within-guidelines sentence was fair and reasonable. The district court pointed out that Islas had been voluntarily returned seven times to Mexico and indicated that further deterrence was necessary under those circumstances. The district court\u2019s comments indicate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the Chapter 7 policy statements. Islas has not shown that the revocation sentence imposed was plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Accordingly, Islas has not offered sufficient reasons to disturb the judgment of the district court, and the sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this Opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
