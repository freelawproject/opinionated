He argues that the district court improperly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Those factors are the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief. The Government argues that, if the district court erred, any error was not clear or obvious at the time Newman was sentenced and the district court\u2019s judgment was thus neither plainly unreasonable nor plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">Because Newman did not object in the district court that the court considered a prohibited factor in setting his sentence, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Newman must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">After Newman was sentenced, while the instant appeal was pending, we decided <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d. 345 (2011). In <em>Miller, </em>we held that \u201cit is improper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term.\u201d 634 F.3d at 844. To the extent that the district court relied on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, such reliance was impermissible under <em>Miller. </em>However, the split amongst the circuit courts of appeals on the issue and the lack of a published opinion from this court at the time of the district court proceedings rendered any consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors neither clear nor obvious legal error. <em>See United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 759 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Gloria, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 362, 364-65 (5th Cir.2011). Thus, Newman has shown no plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Although we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed without further briefing, summary disposition is not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we deny the Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
