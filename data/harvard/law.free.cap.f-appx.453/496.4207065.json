Garcia Lucas argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and resulted in the double counting of his prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense. He also argues that the sentence imposed did not accurately reflect the seriousness of his offense and failed to account for his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-24\">Garcia Lucas\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. See <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). We have also previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. See <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). Finally, Garcia Lucas\u2019s assertions regarding the seriousness of his immigration offense and his motive for reentering the United States do not render his 28-month sentence unreasonable. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
