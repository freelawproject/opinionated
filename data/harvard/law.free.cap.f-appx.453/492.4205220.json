Hernandez argues that the district court erred in imposing a three-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) based on a finding that he had a managerial or supervisory role in the offense. He specifically contends that the enhancement was improper because the evidence demonstrated that he supervised only one other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">Section 3B 1.1(b) authorizes a three-level increase in a defendant\u2019s offense level if the defendant was a manager or supervisor but not an organizer or leader and the criminal activity involved at least five participants or was otherwise extensive. We review the district court\u2019s determination that Hernandez was a manager or supervisor for clear error. <em>United States v. Rose, </em>449 F.3d 627, 633 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">Hernandez does not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that the conspiracy consisted of at least five participants. As Hernandez concedes, the uncontested facts demonstrate that he directed at least one other person in the conspiracy. A defendant need only manage or supervise one other participant in order to qualify for the adjustment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2) (noting that a defendant qualifies for the adjustment if he was the manager or supervisor \u201cof one or more other participants\u201d) (2004); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 720 (5th Cir.2011) (recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ing that the enhancement may be applied even if the defendant supervised only one other culpable participant), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 191, 181 L.Ed.2d 99 (2011). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in imposing the three-level enhancement. <em>See Rose, </em>449 F.3d at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"A23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AhJ\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
