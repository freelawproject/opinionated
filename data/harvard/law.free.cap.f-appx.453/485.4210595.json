She challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We affirm \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Williamson failed to raise the issue before or during sentencing, plain error review applies. See <em>United States v. Flores-Ochoa, </em>139 F.3d 1022, 1023 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The district court did not err in relying upon the timing of Williamson\u2019s plea in making the determination under \u00a7 3E1.1. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 &amp; cmt. (n.l(h) &amp; n.6) (2008); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>39 F.3d 568, 572 (5th Cir.1994). Nor was it error to find her guilty plea untimely for purposes of \u00a7 3K1.1 when she pleaded guilty on the morning of trial after denying responsibility for four months following her arrest. <em>See Diaz, </em>39 F.3d at 572; <em>see also United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1299 (5th Cir.1994) (holding that district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility in reliance, in part, on the timing of the defendant\u2019s plea on the eve of trial not erroneous). We also find no plain error in denying the adjustment despite the early weakness of the Government\u2019s case, as the weakness resulted from Williamson\u2019s concealment of key evidence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. (n.1(E)); <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
