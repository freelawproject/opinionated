(\u201cOffice Depot\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of National Union Fire Insurance Company (\u201cNational Union\u201d) and American Casualty Company (\u201cAmerican\u201d) (collectively, \u201ccarriers\u201d). Office Depot filed for declaratory judgment, seeking coverage under its insurance policy for more than $20 million in legal fees that it incurred while responding to Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cthe Commission\u201d) inquiries. The National Union policy \u2014 providing \u201corganization insurance,\u201d <em>inter alia </em>\u2014 carried $25 million worth of insurance for covered claims, subject to a $2.5 million retention<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a 20% co-insurance provision. The American insurance policy used identical policy language and provided coverage for losses above $25 million.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court determined that most of the legal fees were not covered by the policy and granted summary judgment in the carriers\u2019 favor. After extensive review of the parties\u2019 briefs, the insurance policy, and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">The following dates and occurrences are relevant to the disposition of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ark\"><em>June 2007 </em>\u2014 An article on the Dow Jones Newswire reported that Office Depot may have violated federal securities laws by selectively disclosing nonpublic information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-16\"><em>July 11, 2007 </em>\u2014 Office Depot forwarded a copy of the article to the carriers as \u201cnotice of circumstances\u201d that a claim might be filed against it in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APz\"><em>July 2007 </em>\u2014 Office Depot received an internal letter alleging problems with various accounting practices. That prompted an independent review, which included the use of outside legal counsel and forensic accountants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-17\"><em>July 17, 2007 </em>\u2014 The SEC sent Office Depot a letter advising it that the Commission would begin conducting an inquiry into Office Depot to determine whether Office Depot had violated securities laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-18\"><em>August 6, 2007 </em>\u2014 The SEC asked Office Depot to produce any internal letters regarding accounting irregularities so that it could determine whether securities laws had been violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-19\"><em>October 29, 2007 </em>\u2014 Office Depot announced the findings of its internal review, concluding that certain financial statements would have to be revised and others delayed. It self-reported each problem to the SEC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-20\"><em>November 2007 </em>\u2014 Two shareholder derivative lawsuits and two securities lawsuits were filed against Office Depot and vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>ous officers and directors in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-4\"><em>January 10, 2008 </em>\u2014 The SEC issued a formal order of investigation. It indicated that the Commission had information suggesting that Office Depot had broken securities laws. In the two years following the order of investigation, the SEC issued subpoenas to various officers and directors, and \u201cWells Notices\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> recommending civil action against three officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\"><em>December 2009 </em>\u2014 The SEC filed a formal complaint, and Office Depot announced that it had reached a settlement agreement with the SEC staff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">The standards we use for summary judgment and Florida insurance policy interpretation are well settled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards used by the district court. Thus, summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-12\">Further, we are required to apply Florida law to determine the meaning of the insurance policy. Thus, we look at the policy as a whole and give every provision its full meaning and operative effect. We start with the plain language of the policy, as bargained for by the parties. If that language is unambiguous, it governs. Under Florida law, however, if the relevant policy language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and the other limiting coverage, the insurance policy is considered ambiguous, and must be interpreted liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the drafter who prepared the policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3z\"><em>Hyman v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>304 F.3d 1179, 1185-86 (11th Cir.2002) (alteration omitted) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). We keep these principles in mind when evaluating the instant insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Office Depot presents four arguments for review. We address each below.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Office Depot contends that the first insuring provision under the \u201cOrganization Insurance\u201d section, which provides coverage for Losses<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201carising from\u201d Securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Claims, covers all of the Defense Costs incurred after Office Depot received its first SEC letter on July 17, 2007.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It contends that the definition of Securities Claim in the policy does not explicitly exclude costs associated with SEC investigations, and, even if it does, the \u201ccarve-back\u201d language that completes the definition restores coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Two policy provision are relevant to the disposition of this issue. First, the insuring agreement language provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\">COVERAGE B: ORGANIZATION INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">(i) <em>Organization Liability. </em>This policy shall pay the Loss<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of any Organization arising from a Securities Claim made against such Organization for any Wrongful Act of such Organization ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The policy defines a Securities Claim as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYX\">a Claim, <em>other than an administrative or regulatory proceeding against, or investigation of an Organization, </em>made against any Insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">(1) alleging a violation of any federal, state, local or foreign regulation, rule or statute regulating securities ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">(2) brought derivatively on the behalf of an Organization by a security holder of such Organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term \u201cSecurities Claim\u201d <em>shall include an administrative or regulatory proceeding </em>against an Organization, but only if and only during the time such proceeding is also commenced and continuously maintained against an Insured Person.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3b\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">Office Depot argues that \u201c[t]he Policy does not contain <em>any </em>definition of what is or is not an \u2018administrative or regulatory proceeding.\u2019 It certainly does not contain clear and unmistakable language excluding coverage for SEC investigations.\u201d Therefore, Office Depot argues that the policy should be read liberally and coverage should begin with the issuance of the SEC letter in July 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">While it is true that the policy fails to define \u201cadministrative or regulatory proceedings,\u201d it does not follow that Office Depot is entitled to coverage for all expenses incurred after receiving the SEC letter. The initial portion of the Securities Claim definition creates a clear disjunctive through the use of \u201cor.\u201d Specifically, it eliminates coverage for two types of potential Securities Claims: (1) Claims in the form of administrative or regulatory proceedings against Office Depot and (2) Claims in the form of an administrative or regulatory investigation of Office Depot. The carve-back provision restores coverage for the former under certain circumstances. But it does not restore for the latter. Since we give meaning to each phrase within a policy, <em>see Hyman, </em>304 F.3d at 1186, that omission is dispositive for our interpretation of the policy\u2019s language on this point. Because the SEC\u2019s requests for voluntary cooperation in furtherance of its pre-suit discovery constituted an \u201cinvestigation\u201d rather than an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>\u201cadministrative or regulatory proceeding,\u201d Office Depot\u2019s expenses incurred after the receipt of the SEC letters are excluded from coverage. Accordingly, the district court did not err on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Office Depot next contends, briefly, that the insuring agreement\u2019s indemnification of Insured Persons covers the losses it incurred as a result of the SEC\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The relevant policy language states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-7\">COVERAGE B: ORGANIZATION INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-8\">(ii) <em>Indemnification of an Insured Person. </em>This policy shall pay the Loss of an Organization arising from a Claim made against an Insured Person (including an Outside Entity Executive) for any Wrongful Act of such Insured Person, but only to the extent that such Organization has indemnified such Insured Person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">A Claim is defined, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-10\">(2) a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or arbitration proceeding for monetary, non-monetary or injunc-tive relief which is commenced by: (i) service of a complaint or similar pleading; (ii) return of an indictment, information or similar document (in the case of a criminal proceeding); or (iii) receipt or filing of a notice of charges; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-11\">(3) a civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory investigation of an Insured Person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-12\">(i) once such Insured Person is identified in writing by such investigating authority as a person against whom a proceeding described in Definition (b)(2) may be commenced; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-15\">(ii) in the case of an investigation by the SEC or a similar state or foreign government authority, after the service of a subpoena upon such Insured Person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">Office Depot seems to contend that the SEC letters it received starting in 2007 were sufficient to trigger a Claim as defined by the policy. Generally, in these letters, the SEC asked Office Depot to preserve certain documents and requested that several individuals provide testimony. Office Depot argues that those letters are sufficient to constitute notice that Insured Persons could have proceedings commenced against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">The letters, however, only broadly request information to assist the SEC in determining whether Office Depot committed securities violations. They do not allege that violations have occurred or identify specific individuals that could be charged in future proceedings. In contrast, the Wells Notices, which the carriers concede trigger a Claim, state that the SEC staff \u201cintends to recommend that the Commission bring a civil injunction against [named individual], alleging\u201d that he or she violated specific securities laws. The Wells Notices create a Claim because an \u201cInsured Person is identified in writing by [the SEC] as a person against whom\u201d \u201ca civil ... proceeding for ... injunctive relief\u2019 may be commenced by \u201cservice of a complaint or similar pleading\u201d or by the \u201cfiling of a notice of charges.\u201d After review of the policy and the correspondence at issue, we conclude that correspondence to which Office Depot referred does not trigger a Claim under the relevant policy definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-19\">Office Depot next posits that the district court erred in concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>policy covered only Defense Costs incurred after a Claim is made against the Insured. Specifically, it contends that there is no \u201ctemporal limitation in this definition barring coverage for costs of investigating an anticipated claim or actual claim.\u201d Office Depot\u2019s argument is based mostly on the practical realities of securities litigation. Regarding the text, however, it argues that \u201c[t]here is no \u2018but only after the Claim is actually made\u2019 exclusion or other temporal limitation in [the definition of Defense Costs] barring coverage\u201d for pre-Claim expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The policy defines Defense Costs as \u201creasonable and necessary fees, costs, and expenses consented to by the Insurer ... resulting solely from the investigation, adjustment, defense and/or appeal of a Claim against an Insured.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">We conclude that the text unambiguously limits Defense Costs to those costs incurred after a Claim has been made. Investigation of a Claim necessitates that a Claim exists to investigate. While we agree with Office Depot that the policy does not explicitly exclude the investigation costs for potential claims, we also realize that such a step is not necessary. The plain language demonstrates that the costs must \u201cresult[ ] solely from\u201d a Claim. As the operative facts at issue in this argument do not create a Claim, the costs preceding the Claim cannot \u201cresult from\u201d the Claim. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that expenses constituted only Defense Costs within the meaning of this policy if they were incurred after a Claim was made against Office Depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">We now address Office Depot\u2019s final, and most detailed, argument. It revolves around policy Section 7, entitled \u201cNotice/Claim Reporting Provisions.\u201d It declares that the Insured must give the carrier notice of possible claims that might arise. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-9\">(a) An Organization or an Insured shall, as a condition precedent to the obligations of the Insurer under this policy, give written notice to the Insurer of a Claim made against an Insured ... as soon as practicable: (i) after the Named Entity\u2019s Risk Manager or General Counsel ... first becomes aware of the Claim; or (ii) the Crisis commences, but in all events no later than either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">(1) the end of the Policy Period ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-13\">(2) within 30 days after the end of the Policy Period ... as long as such Claim was first made against an Insured within the final 30 days of the Policy Period....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-14\">(b) If written notice of a Claim has been given to the Insurer pursuant to Clause 7(a) above, then a Claim which is subsequently made against an Insured and reported to the Insurer alleging, arising out of, based on or attributable to the facts alleged in the Claim for which such notice has .been given, ... shall be considered related to the first Claim and made at the time such notice was given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnS\">(c) <em>If during the Policy Period </em>... <em>an Organization or an Insured shall become aware of any circumstances which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a Claim being made against an Insured and shall give written notice to the Insurer of the circumstances, </em>the Wrongful Act allegations anticipated and the reasons for anticipating such a Claim, with full particulars as to dates, persons and entities involved, <em>then a Claim which is subsequently made against such Insured </em>and reported to the Insurer alleging, arising out of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>based upon or attributable to such circumstances or alleging any Wrongful Act which is the same as or related to any Wrongful Act alleged or contained in such circumstances, <em>shall be considered made at the time such notice of such circumstances was given.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The crux of Office Depot\u2019s argument is that Section 7 allows the Claim to \u201crelate back\u201d to the date the insured filed the original notice of circumstances such that any costs incurred between the notice of circumstances and the date a Claim was made so long as they are both based on the same facts. Office Depot contends that the district court erred in ruling that Section 7 does not allow it to recover Defense Costs incurred in connection with the investigation following Office Depot\u2019s submission of the notice of circumstances, which it filed immediately after the Dow Jones article was published.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The carriers, however, contend that \u201cthere is no coverage for any investigatory Defense Costs incurred before the subsequent Claim is \u2018actually made.\u2019 \u201d Office Depot disagrees, pointing out that the policy \u201cdoes not contain any such language barring or limiting coverage for investigatory costs incurred after the date the first notice is submitted. The date of notice is the date on which all related Claims are \u2018considered made\u2019 for purposes of coverage.\u201d Without that express limitation, Office Depot believes its reading of the policy is, at the very least, a reasonable interpretation of the language, and thus the policy should be construed in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">We disagree. After analyzing the policy as a whole, it is clear that Section 7 does not cover the costs incurred between the filing of the initial notice of circumstances and the time a Claim is made against an Insured. Nothing in the language of Section 7 indicates that it extends coverage to Defense Costs incurred after a notice is filed but before a Claim actually exists. Instead, it creates a notification process for Claims filed both inside and outside of the Policy Period. Importantly, Section 5 of the policy, entitled \u201cLimit of Liability (For All Loss-Including Defense Costs),\u201d illuminates the role of Section 7. It states that <em>\u201ca Claim which is made subsequent to the Policy Period ... which pursuant to Clause 7(b) or 7(c) is considered made during the Policy Period ... </em>shall also be subject to the one aggregate Limit of Liability .... \u201d (emphasis added). Since we read the entire policy to determine its meaning, Section 5 provides a clear indication that Section 7\u2019s provisions determine the Policy Period that Claims are \u201cconsidered made,\u201d rather than expand coverage to the costs incurred before a Claim is actually made. Therefore, the policy does not cover the Defense Costs associated with the SEC investigation \u2014 which did not constitute a Claim against Office Depot until events such as the issuance of subpoenas and Wells Notices occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the decision of the district court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">.
