The district court denied Chance\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Chance is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">Chance had not been in post-removal-order detention longer than the presumptively reasonable six-month period set forth in <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). Consequently, the district court did not err in finding that his challenge to his continued post removal detention was premature. <em>See id.; Okpoju v. Ridge, </em>115 Fed.Appx. 302, 302 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Nor did the district court err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Chance\u2019s challenge to the underlying order of removal. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 735-36 (5th Cir.2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">Chance has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, his appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. His motions for stay of deportation and appointment of counsel are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
