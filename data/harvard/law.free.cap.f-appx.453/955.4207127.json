The district court denied this motion without any explanation. One reason for the denial might have been the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to consider the motion given that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern only in civil actions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1 (providing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cgovern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts\u201d); <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that a criminal defendant may not use Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) to challenge a criminal sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">Yet, even if the district court lacked jurisdiction over this motion because of Lee\u2019s procedural error, the district court\u2019s special obligation to <em>pro se </em>defendants required it \u201cto look behind the label\u201d of the motion \u201cand determine whether the motion [was], in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). The district court\u2019s order does not reflect its effort in this regard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand in order that we may have the benefit of the district court\u2019s evaluation of the substance of Lee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-14\">. We recognize the possibility that Lee may have intended to file a separate civil suit seeking an injunction. If the district court construes Lee\u2019s motion to reflect this intent, Lee\u2019s motion could be denied without prejudice to file a civil action seeking injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
