Deering Bey, federal prisoner #38149-019, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. He argues that he warrants application of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA) renders him actually innocent of his crimes of conviction, his conviction constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice, and failure to apply the FSA to his conviction violates the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">As Bey challenges the legality of his sentence, rather than the manner in which it is being executed, the district court did not err in concluding that his claim arises under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). Because he has not shown that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense,\u201d Bey has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AlL\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
