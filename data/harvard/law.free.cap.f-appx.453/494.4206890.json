He argues that the district court erred by granting the Respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment because there existed a genuine factual dispute regarding his claim that he began serving his federal sentence on February 20, 2002. He also argues that he was forced to serve the sentence in installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">Section 2241 is the proper procedural vehicle for Bush\u2019s claims. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Garcia-Gutierrez, </em>835 F.2d 585, 586 (5th Cir.1988). \u201cIn the context of a \u00a7 2241 petition, this court reviews the district court\u2019s determinations of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Royal v. Tombone, </em>141 F.3d 596, 599 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard as the district court. <em>Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Federal Rule of Civil procedure 56(a). The movant need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>negate the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case, however. <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). If the movant meets his burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the nonmovant \u201cmust go beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The nonmov-ant may not satisfy this burden by relying on conclusional allegations and unsubstantiated assertions. <em>Carnaby, </em>636 F.3d at 187. Further, although factual controversies are resolved in favor of the nonmov-ant, this court will not in the absence of any proof, assume that the nonmovant could prove the facts necessary to sustain the complaint. <em>Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">A federal sentence of imprisonment \u201ccommences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation to, or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at, the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a). Subsection (b) of \u00a7 3585 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">A defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">(2) as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed; <em>that has not been credited against another sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u00a7 3585(b)(emphasis added). \u201cCredit [on a federal sentence] for state incarceration is given pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 [now codified at \u00a7 3585(b) ] only when it was exclusively the product of such action by federal law-enforcement officials as to justify treating the state jail as the practical equivalent of a federal one.\u201d <em>United States v. Dovalina, </em>711 F.2d 737, 740 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The Respondent submitted competent summary judgment evidence, including a declaration made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, which established that Bush was in state custody prior to his appearance in federal court on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. Accordingly, his state custody remained uninterrupted. <em>See Causey v. Civiletti, </em>621 F.2d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Cain v. Menifee, </em>269 Fed.Appx. 420, 424 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">We liberally construe Bush\u2019s brief to assert that he pleaded guilty to the state burglary charge pursuant to an agreement with the state wherein he would be transported to federal custody to begin serving his \u201cconcurrent sentence.\u201d He thus suggests that he is entitled to \u201cdouble credit\u201d for his detention time. This argument lacks merit because when it enacted \u00a7 3585(b), \u201cCongress made clear that a defendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 337, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). Finally, Bush asserts that if he had not been in federal custody when he was acquitted of the state murder charge, he would have been free to leave jail on his state bond for burglary because it had never been revoked. We note, however, that Bush pleaded guilty to the state burglary charge on the same day he was acquitted of the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">In sum, Bush has not shown that the district court erred in granting summary judgment and in concluding that he did not begin serving his federal sentence until November 2005. Accordingly, we do not reach his argument that he was forced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>serve his sentence in installments. Bush\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
