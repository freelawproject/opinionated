The Patels now ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>peal the denial of their motion for judgment on the pleadings and the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Bank. The Patels argue that the district court erred in (1) determining that the Bank\u2019s lawsuit was not a claim for a deficiency judgment requiring judicial confirmation under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-161(a); (2) finding that the Bank was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, despite the fact that the Bank did not pierce each of the Patels\u2019 affirmative defenses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and (3) granting the Bank judgment as a matter of law on the Patels\u2019 counterclaim of tortious interference. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Our review is <em>de novo. Huff v. DeKalb Cnty., Ga., </em>516 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cBecause federal jurisdiction over this matter is based on diversity, [Georgia] law governs the determination of the issues on this appeal.\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The facts are set out in the district court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-6\">On or about January 16, 2002, Diplomat borrowed $10,500,000 from Integrity Bank (\u201cIntegrity\u201d). In conjunction with that loan, Diplomat executed a promissory note payable to Integrity. The note was secured by real property which included a hotel located in Fulton County, Georgia. In its complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the defendants personally guaranteed Diplomat\u2019s obligations under the loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-7\">On or about August 29, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) took over Integrity. Later, the FDIC ... sold all of Integrity\u2019s right, title, and interest in the loan and the corresponding loan documents to the [Bank]. On or about March 3, 2009, and after Diplomat had failed to make payments under the loan for a period of several months, the [Bank] notified Diplomat of its intent to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure on April 7, 2009, of the hotel property securing the loan. Prior to the scheduled non-judicial foreclosure, Diplomat filed bankruptcy. The [Bank] alleges at the time the filing of Diplomat\u2019s bankruptcy that Diplomat and, in turn the defendants here, who are alleged to be guarantors of Diplomat\u2019s loan, owed the [Bank] over ten million dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">The [Bank] alleges that because an automatic stay was imposed by Diplomat\u2019s bankruptcy filing that it could not conduct the foreclosure. According to the [Bank], it elected to file this suit on May 12, 2009, against the defendants who allegedly serve as the guarantors of Diplomat\u2019s loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">In November 2009, the bankruptcy court hearing Diplomat\u2019s bankruptcy case entered an order granting relief from the automatic stay, which allowed the [Bank] to exercise its state law and contractual rights and remedies. On December 14, 2009, the [Bank] filed a complaint for the appointment of a receiver in this court. In the receivership case, the [Bank] requested the appointment of a receiver with the authority to market and sell the hotel property securing Diplomat\u2019s loan. Despite Diplo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>mat\u2019s opposition, this court held that a receivership was unnecessary and that the [Bank] should be allowed to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure of its interest in the hotel property securing Diplomat\u2019s loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">Pending the [Bank]\u2019s foreclosure sale of the hotel property, this court entered an order staying this suit. On April 6, 2010, the [Bank] conducted a non-judicial foreclosure sale of the hotel property, and on May B, 2010, the [Bank] filed its verified report of non-judicial foreclosure sale and petition for confirmation of non-judicial sale in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-6\">Because this case was stayed for an extended period of time, this court lifted the stay in this matter on October 26, 2010, and permitted the [Bank] to a file reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment. Prior to the court\u2019s decision to lift the stay in this suit, the defendants argued for the first time that this suit violates O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-161(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The district court then went on to consider the merits of the parties\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">\n<em>Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The Patels argue that the district court should have dismissed the Bank\u2019s complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim because it failed to satisfy a condition precedent to suit. Specifically, the Patels contend that the Bank improperly sued them for breach of guarantees before it confirmed the foreclosure sale it conducted on the collateral securing the loan, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-161(a). The district court disagreed with the Pa-tels, finding \u00a7 44-14-161(a) inapplicable because the action was filed before the non-judicial foreclosure sale and because the Bank was not pursuing a \u201cdeficiency\u201d against the Patels as the term is defined in \u00a7 44-14-161. Thus, the court denied the Patels\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">On appeal, the Patels argue that the district court erred by finding that the Bank\u2019s lawsuit was not a deficiency judgment. Instead, the Patels note that Georgia courts define a \u201cdeficiency judgment\u201d as \u201c\u2018a judgment for that part of a debt secured by a mortgage not realized from a sale of the mortgaged property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Se. Timberlands, Inc. v. Haiseal Timber, Inc., </em>224 Ga.App. 98, 479 S.E.2d 443, 445 (1996) (quoting <em>Hill v. Moye, </em>221 Ga.App. 411, 471 S.E.2d 910, 912 (1996)). The Patels urge us to look to the substance of the action, not its form, to determine whether the action sought a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">The Bank contends that because it had yet to foreclose on the property, and thus had no deficiency to recover, the suit was not a deficiency action. The Bank asserts that \u00a7 14A4-161(a) did not bar it from first suing the Patels on their guarantees and then, eleven months later, conducting a non-judicial foreclosure sale of the collateral. The Bank asserts that \u00a7 14-44-161(a) requires a creditor who has <em>already </em>sold real estate in a non-judicial foreclosure to wait for confirmation before pursuing a deficiency judgment. Indeed, in all of the cases the Patels cite, there had actually been a foreclosure sale, pre-suit, which left a deficiency. <em>See, e.g., Archer Capital Fund v. TKW Partners, LLC, </em>No. 1:08-CV-2747-TWT, 2009 WL 2356072 at *1 (N.D.Ga. July 27, 2009); <em>Redman Indus., Inc. v. Tower Prop., Inc., </em>517 F.Supp. 144, 149 (N.D.Ga.1981); <em>Haiseal Timber, </em>479 S.E.2d at 445 (explaining the pending action was a deficiency action because \u201cHaiseal filed this action only after the property Southeast pledged as security did not bring at the foreclosure sale the amount owed on the note\u201d); <em>Hill, </em>471 S.E.2d at 912 (explaining that the suit sought a \u201cdeficiency judgment because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>property they pledged did not bring at a foreclosure sale the amount of the debt owed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We agree with the Bank. Section 14-44-161(a) provides: <em>\u201cWhen any real estate is sold on foreclosure, </em>without legal process, and under powers contained in security deeds, mortgages, or other lien contracts and <em>at the sale the real estate does not bring the amount of the debt secured by the deed,, mortgage, or contract,\u201d </em>the person instituting the foreclosure proceedings must first get confirmation of the sale before they can try to obtain a deficiency judgment. The plain language of \u00a7 14-44-161(a) requires that the collateral actually be sold at foreclosure before the protections of the statute are triggered. And in the instant case, at the time the Bank filed suit on the guarantees, the Bank had no deficiency to recover because the Bank had not conducted a non-judicial sale of Diplomat\u2019s property \u2014 Diplomat\u2019s pending bankruptcy precluded it from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">We also recognize that under Georgia law, secured creditors are not put to an election of remedies in deciding whether to sue on a note or foreclose on collateral. <em>Brown v. Rooks, </em>240 Ga. 674, 242 S.E.2d 128, 129 (1978) (per curiam); <em>River Farm, LLC v. SunTrust Bank, </em>305 Ga.App. 337, 699 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2010); <em>Jamison v. Button Gwinnett Sav. Bank, </em>204 Ga.App. 341, 419 S.E.2d 91, 91-92 (1992). Thus, the Bank was within its rights to first pursue its contractual remedies against the Patels (the guarantors), and the Bank\u2019s later sale of the collateral did not transform the underlying suit into one that was void <em>ab initio. </em>As we stated previously, the suit was not one to collect a \u201cdeficiency\u201d because there was no deficiency to collect at the time it was filed. Accordingly, the district court properly denied the Patels\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\n<em>Tortious Interference Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Next, the Patels argue that the Bank was not entitled to summary judgment on them tortious interference counterclaim. Essentially, the basis of their claim was that the Bank\u2019s \u201cattempts to enforce the guarantees against [the Patels] by filing [the guaranty action] has caused third-party lenders not to enter into business relations with them.\u201d But the district court held these allegations did not give rise to an actionable claim for tortious interference with business relations. The Patels now argue that the district court improperly construed their tortious interference counterclaim. Rather than challenge the lawsuit, the Patels argue that they were alleging that the Bank tortiously interfered with Diplomat\u2019s efforts to purchase the FDIC\u2019s interest in the note. The Patels assert that, although the lawsuit had been harmful, it was the negative publicity in the business community surrounding the calling in of the guarantees, well before the lawsuit was filed, that caused the problems with Diplomat\u2019s lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">A viable tortious interference with business relations counterclaim requires proof that the counterclaim defendant \u201c(1) acted improperly and without privilege, (2) acted purposely and maliciously with the intent to injure, (3) induced a third party or parties not to enter into or continue a business relationship with the [counter-claimants], and (4) caused [the counter-claimants] financial injury.\u201d <em>See Camp v. Eichelkraut, </em>246 Ga.App. 275, 539 S.E.2d 588, 592 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Under Georgia law, the Bank\u2019s actions in pursuing the guaranty action cannot be considered improper or without privilege. <em>See BKJB P\u2019ship v. Moseman, </em>284 Ga.App. 862, 866 644 S.E.2d 874 (2007) (\u201c[A] claim for tortious interference with contractual relations cannot be predicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>upon an allegedly improper filing of a lawsuit.\u201d) (citing <em>Phillips v. MacDougald, </em>219 Ga.App. 152, 464 S.E.2d 390, 395 (1995)). Although the Patels now try to re-characterize their tortious interference claim, they did recognize that \u201cat its core, the ... counterclaim is based on [the] Bank\u2019s decision to accelerate the Diplomat Loan and call in the guarantees \u2014 and of the fallout associated with that decision.\u201d And Ra-jesh Patel testified in his deposition that the lawsuit was causing problems with their lenders. Simply put, the Bank\u2019s attempts to enforce the guarantees against the Patels, by \u201ccalling in the guarantees\u201d and by filing the guaranty action, cannot form the basis of a tortious interference claim. Accordingly, because we may affirm for any ground supported in the record, <em>Lucas v. </em>W.W. <em>Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir.2001), we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">. The Patels waived this error by not raising it before the district court. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AcGl\">. Even if we were to agree with the Patels and dismiss the instant suit, the foreclosure sale has since been confirmed. Thus, the Bank would be able to re-file suit and receive another judgment against the Patels.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
