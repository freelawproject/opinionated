He violated his supervision by reentering the country illegally within two years of his deportation, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>crime for which he was also separately prosecuted. Gallegos-Olivo argues that his sentence, which is 6 months higher than his advisory guideline sentence, is substantively unreasonable. After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Gallegos-Olivo has the burden of establishing his sentence as unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). He does not claim any procedural defect in his sentencing, so we proceed to review the sentence for substantive reasonableness, using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Applying this standard, we consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We disturb a sentence only when we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">In a revocation case, the court should state its reasons for finding that a defendant\u2019s violation of the conditions of supervised release, and to a limited extent this defendant\u2019s offense and history, are \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d to support a variance. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A 3(b), intro, comment, (stating, in a revocation sentencing, the district court \u201cshould sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">According to Gallegos-Olivo, \u201cthe breach of trust\u201d inherent in the violation of his condition of supervised release is already taken into account in establishing the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>Given that his breach of trust is intended to be the \u201cpri-mar[y]\u201d determinant of his sentence, <em>id., </em>Gallegos-Olivo contends that \u201cthe record is devoid of a reason \u2014 other than [the district court\u2019s] personal opinion about illegal reentry \u2014 for imposing\u201d an upward variance. In particular, he notes that \u201cthere was no explanation\u201d of why his violation was different \u201cthan any other illegal reentry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that it contains sufficient explanation by the district court of why a guideline sentence did not adequately address the facts surrounding Gallegos-Olivo\u2019s violation. During the sentencing hearing, the district court referred to both general and individual considerations in making its sentencing decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">I don\u2019t know what we have to do to deter people like Mr. [GaIIegos-]OIivo. It\u2019s becoming an epidemic. We prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>cute them, we send them to Federal prison, they\u2019re deported and they brazenly come back into our country. You know, in my view, a sentence within the advisory guideline range is just not reasonable, in my view, a sentence of 18 months is reasonable when I look at all the statutory factors in terms of deterring future criminal conduct, protecting the public, when I look at the nature and circumstances of his new criminal activity, when I look at his history and characteristics and all those statutory factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Earlier in the hearing, the district court expressed concern that Gallegos-Olivo was not deterred by the 24-month sentence he received for his original criminal conviction \u201ccause he comes back.\u201d The court also noted a specific aspect of his criminal history \u2014 state officials eschewed prosecuting Gallegos-Olivo in state court for threatening his family members with a gun, instead favoring federal prosecution for the lesser offense of possessing a firearm as an illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The court\u2019s observation of an \u201cepidemic\u201d of illegal reentry did not render its determination substantively unreasonable. Rather, the district court\u2019s reference to a broader national phenomenon shed light on why Gallegos-Olivo\u2019s particular type of breach of trust \u2014 his illegal reentry \u2014 contributed to the \u201cseriousness of the underlying violation\u201d in a way not already incorporated into the applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A 3(b), intro, comment (allowing the court to rely \u201cto a limited degree\u201d on the \u201cseriousness of the underlying violation\u201d in revocation sentencing). A district court judge is certainly permitted to refer to what he has \u201clearned from similar cases over the years,\u201d so long as he ties that observation to the individual he is sentencing. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">The district court also referenced Gallegos-Olivo\u2019s criminal history as a basis for the variance, in light of considerations of deterrence and protecting the public. Specifically, the court expressed concern over Gallegos-Olivo\u2019s alleged involvement in a more serious offense for which he was never prosecuted. The commentary to the guidelines makes clear that Gallegos-Oli-vo\u2019s criminal history may be considered, though only \u201cto a limited degree.\u201d U.S.S.G., Ch. 7, Pt. A 3(b), intro, comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The district court\u2019s explicit reliance on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>i.e. </em>the seriousness of the underlying offense and Gallegos-Olivo\u2019s criminal history, demonstrates that the court has sufficiently \u201cconsidered [the] parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis\u201d for imposing an upward variance of 6 months. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-6\">.
