In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Flores-Quirino argued that Amendment 742 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which changed the way in which criminal history points are calculat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ed by eliminating some recency points, should be applied retroactively to reduce his sentence. He also argued that the district court should consider a reduction of his sentence under <em>18 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The district court determined that the Amendment 742 did not apply retroactively and denied Flores-Quirino\u2019s motion. The district court also denied Flores-Quir-ino leave to proceed IFP and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to Rule 24(a)(4)(B) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Flores-Quirino now argues that the district court erred in concluding that the Amendment 742 could not be retroactively applied and that the district court failed to consider mitigating circumstances under \u00a7 3553(a) when determining whether to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Flores-Quir-ino is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into the litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision \u201cwhether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, its interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Although Amendment 742 to the Sentencing Guidelines eliminated the two \u201crecency points\u201d previously provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e), the amendment is not listed as a retroactive amendment in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a) &amp; (c). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), the district court was not authorized to reduce Flores-Quirino\u2019s sentence based on Amendment 742 because that would have been inconsistent with Sentencing Commission policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>see also United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Further, a district court is required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors only if the court first determines that a prisoner is eligible for a sentence modification. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-92, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Because the district court correctly determined that Flores-Quirino was not eligible under \u00a7 1B1.10 for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court did not err by failing to determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 2691-92. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-94; <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Flores-Quirino\u2019s appeal does not involve legal points arguable on their merits. Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
