He prayed for d rule requiring Eogers to turn over the money so collected. Eogers demurred on the ground that the petition sets forth no cause of action, because it shows on its face that the .relation of attorney and client as between Knight and himself did not exist at the time of the alleged collection, and therefore a money rule could not be maintained-; and that Knight could not be subrogated to the relation held by the plaintiff in fi. fa. sThe court sustained the demurrer and. dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cThe right to rule an attorney for money alleged to be in his hands as such depends upon the existence of the relation of attorney and client, and is limited to the client.\u201d <em>Haygood </em>v.
