The defendant demurred on the ground that no cause of action was set forth; The trial court sustained the demurrer on the ground \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\u25a0contract is contrary to public policy and void, because sales by, executors, unless otherwise provided by the will, must be by public .outcry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Section 4035 of the Civil Code of 1910 declares .that \u201cA private sale of land, under an obligation to perfect by legal formality, is contrary to public policy, and renders such sales always open to review at the option of parties at interest.\u201d. \u201cWhile such contracts are executory, being contrary to public policy, they can not be enforced either at law or in equity.\u201d <em>Campbell Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>142 <em>Ga. </em>434 (83 S.
