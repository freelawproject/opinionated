This was a suit for breach of contract relative to the purchase of real estate. The contract was signed by the prospective purchaser, S. O. Burg, and on the part of the landowner was signed: \u201cB. A. Malone, attorney, in fact for J. M. Williams,\u201d The petition was brought in the name of \u201cB. A. Malone, as attorney in fact for J. M. Williams.\u201d The Civil Code (1910), \u00a7 3609, declares that \u201cGenerally an agent has no right'of action on contracts made for his principal.\u201d One of the exceptions (subsection 5) is \u201cin case of agency coupled with an interest in the agent, known to the party contracting with him.\u201d However, when the petition discloses agency, the agent can not maintain the action in his own name without alleging \u201cthat his agency was coupled with an interest in the agent, known to the party contracting with him.\u201d <em>R. &amp; D. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bedell, </em>88 <em>Ga. </em>591 (4), 592 15 S. E. 676). \u201cWhere one can not, except under special circumstances, maintain a suit in his own behalf or for the benefit of another, it is incumbent upon him to disclose the facts giving him a right to bring the action.\u201d <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>123 <em>Ga. </em>122, 124 (51 S.

The petition in this ease contained no such allegation as is required by these rulings.
