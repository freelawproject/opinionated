AVilmer, her sister, and Mr. AVilmer\u2019s wife, which property Miss Placido had bought about six weeks before from the trustees of her mother\u2019s estate for the sum of $9,000 (hen paid by her to them. AVilmer then answered the bill, claiming the mortgage was overdue and unpaid ; that he had always given proper accounts to Miss Placide, and that she liad no title to the mortgaged property. Thereupon Miss Placide filed in this court her bill against AVilmer, his two sons and the husband of a deceased daughter, asking that the deed of July 28, 1887, be stricken down as not her deed. AVilmer answered this bill, and claimed the deed to be bona fide. The other defendants answered, consenting that the deed be vacated. At the hearing, on the motion of Miss Placide\u2019s solicitors, the two cases were consolidated and a great mass of testimony taken, from which (he court finds the following facts, each of which finding of fact is based upon undisputed oral or written evidence offered, Miss Placide\u2019s testimony not being considered unless when admitted to be true, or corrobora! ed by other and undisputed evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\"1.

(Defendants' Exhibit No. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">3. That by reason of the close relationship between Miss Placide and her brother-in-law, Mr. AVilmer, and on account of her great confidence in liis integrity and business ability, she trusted him implicitly, and gave him full and entire charge of the management of her property, and the collecting of the income therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">4. That by reason of such confidence Miss Placide was in the habit of signing, without questioning or inquiring into their contents, any papers or writings which Mr. AVilmer, her brother-in-law, presented to her for signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">5. On July 28, 1887, by reason of such confidence, and without knowing its contents, and without making any inquiry .about them, and without intending to convey to her sister the property therein named, she signed the deed hereinbefore referred to as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">6.

Placide, which contains the statement that Bliss Placide owns No. 1300 Bladison avenue, in fee, subject to a mortgage of $3,959.89, balance held by E. Bl.

Wilmer, notwithstanding that he then had in his possession the unrecorded deed of the property in which his wife was the grantee (Plaintiff's Exhibit J).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">(e) In July, 1907, he prepared the draft of an intended application for a permit to make minor repairs to No. 1300 Madison avenue, the blanks of which were filled up in his, Wiliner\u2019s, handwriting, and to which he signed the name of Susan E. Placide as owner of that property -(Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit O).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">(f) On November 4, 1910-, he wrote to Miss Placide a letter demanding- that she procure from some new lender a mortgage on the Bladison avenue property for a sum sufficient to pay off the four thousand dollar mortgage debt and an accumulation of more than twelve years\u2019 interest, no part of which had'ever theretofore been demanded or paid; he also stated in that letter that when he had gotten all matters settled he would remove from that property which he had occupied ever since his marriage to his wife, Alice P. \u201cWilmer, a period of about thirty years (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit L).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">10.
