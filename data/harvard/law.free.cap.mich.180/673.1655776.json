A teamster of some 20 years\u2019 experience, he had worked for defendant as a driver upon one of their trucks upon this occasion for about one year and upon a former occasion for about five years. The record discloses that on a Friday morning plaintiff was instructed to take out truck No. 34, which he had not theretofore driven. He used this truck all day Friday and a part of Saturday in carrying machinery to the Stroh Brewery Company. The last load being delivered at the brewery, the plaintiff was instructed by Mr. Newman, defendant\u2019s foreman, to go to the Lake Shore depot and there get and deliver a load of paper. Plaintiff obeyed his instructions and loaded his wagon with about 9,000 pounds of paper and started to deliver it. At the corner of Bates and Woodbridge streets, as he was turning west from the street car track, the left front wheel of the truck came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>entirely off, permitting the axle to fall upon the ground. This tilted the platform of the truck to such an angle that plaintiff was thrown forward and some of the paper was thrown upon him. He was cut somewhat about the head and sustained a fracture of several ribs and was otherwise injured. Plaintiff avers in his declaration that defendant\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-3\">\u201cNegligently and carelessly furnished the said plaintiff with an unsafe truck, and one which the said defendant knew to be unsafe, or should have known in the exercise of that degree of care which the said defendant owed to the said plaintiff in the premises, in that the wheels and axles and the parts around and about the said wheels and axles were unsound and in improper condition, and were not properly maintained and cared for, and which particularly were in dangerous condition by reason of the carelessness, negligence, and neglect of the said defendant, either in the not keeping them in proper repair, or in not properly oiling and greasing them, or in not properly inspecting them.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b701-4\">The following facts may be said to be established by the record: The truck in question had what is known in the business as a flat axle; that is, through use the under part of the axle, where it goes through the boxing, in the hub, had become somewhat worn. This condition is one in the process of making from the first day the truck is run. There is no evidence in the record that such a condition tends to render it unsafe, but it does require to be more frequently greased than an axle that is new and round. It is further established by the uncontradicted testimony that the nut or burr on the end of the axle came off before the wheel came off. The nut was some two inches larger in diameter than the hole in the hub into which the boxing was set. To have permitted the wheel to come off over the nut, an inch of solid wood all the way around on the inside of the hub would have had to be cut away. It is uncontradicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that, though the boxing remained upon the axle after the wheel left it, immediately after the accident the boxing was taken from the axle, replaced in the hub, which was in good condition, and the wheel replaced upon the axle and the load delivered by another driver. It does not appear that the accident occurred by reason of the axle having run dry and heated, although the fact that the boxing remained on the axle might tend to indicate that condition. The man who made the repairs, however, testified that it was not dry. Plaintiff testified in part as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b702-5\">\u201cI drive any wagon they give me. It is all right whether I take wagon No. 1 or 20 or 34.

All the facts surrounding the accident had been detailed to the jury. It was for the jury to draw such legitimate inferences from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>facts as were warranted. It was not a case in which expert testimony was admissible. <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>59 Mich. 618 (26 N. W. 791); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>161 Mich. 168 (125 N. W. 763).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\">The next two assignments of error may be treated together. They raise the controlling question in the case. In our opinion the verdict was properly directed for the following reasons: The only defect shown to exist in the truck at the time of the accident was that the axle on its underside was worn somewhat flat. It is uncontradicted that this flatness did not render the truck unsafe but that its existence\u00bb necessitated a more frequent oiling than otherwise. The record clearly shows that the duty of oiling rested upon the plaintiff himself. It is not even shown that the accident occurred by reason of there being insufficient oiling. From all the testimony, the conclusion is inevitable that the accident and resulting injury was caused by the coming off of the nut or burr which holds the wheel upon the axle. This is an accident which, in turning and backing of wagons, we should suppose to be of no infrequent occurrence. It was such an accident as a casual inspection by the plaintiff would have averted, and, according to the testimony in the record, the duty of inspection rested upon plaintiff himself. Indeed, he himself says, \u201cAny man with a new tool ought to look the tool over before he takes it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">A glance at the alleged defective axle at the depot where plaintiff obtained his last load would undoubtedly have disclosed the condition of the nut. At the time he started from the depot, it must have been very nearly off, as the evidence discloses the fact that in going forward it was so threaded as to become tighter instead of looser through the friction between it and the end of the hub. We think the plaintiff, under the circumstances of this case, must be held to have as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>sumed the risk. <em>Prentiss </em>v. <em>Manufacturing Co., </em>63 Mich. 478 (30 N.
