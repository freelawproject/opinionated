Lettow, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"b457-20\">Before the court in this rails-to-trails takings case is plaintiffs\u2019 notice of partial withdrawal from a nascent, incomplete settlement and motion to create subclasses. The court certified a class in July 2013 totaling 170 landowners in Marshall and Hardin Counties, Iowa whose land was part of the railroad line formerly operated by Iowa River Railroad, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After discovery and trial preparatory proceedings, the court scheduled a trial to occur at Eldora, Iowa and Washington, D.C. in August 2015. Shortly before trial was to begin, the parties represented to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>that they had resolved nearly all of the relevant issues of disputed fact in this case and were endeavoring to complete a settlement agreement. As, a result, the court cancelled the scheduled trial proceedings. Settlement then reportedly was reached on all issues except an interest component. Class counsel now represents that the owners of 21 parcels of the 269 parcels at issue in this case wish to withdraw from the incomplete settlement and proceed to a trial on the merits. To that end, plaintiffs have moved under Rule 23(c)(5) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d) to create two subclasses, a subclass consisting of the owners of the 21 parcels who wish to proceed to trial, which parcels are agricultural lands bisected at an acute angle by the ex-railroad right-of-way (the proposed \u201cangularly-bisect-ed agricultural-property subclass\u201d), and a subclass of the owners of the remaining 248 parcels. Plaintiffs have also asked the court to set a trial date for the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass. The government opposes the creation of subclasses on the grounds that the court should not allow the owners of 21 parcels to withdraw from what it characterizes as a \u201cproposed settlement agreement,\u201d and that doing so will create a conflict of interest between the class counsel in representing the two proposed subclasses. The' court has determined that plaintiffs\u2019 motion to create subclasses should be granted, that no conflict of interest arises, and that a trial should be scheduled for the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The land at issue was previously held as a right-of-way for railroad purposes by Iowa River Railroad, \u201cextending from milepost 243.35 near Marshalltown, Iowa, to milepost 209, outside Steamboat Rock, Iowa, a total distance of 34.35 miles, in Marshall and Hardin Counties, Iowa.\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 4, EOF No. 33. The Iowa National Heritage Foundation filed a Trail Use Request with the federal government\u2019s Surface Transportation Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) on May 17, 2012. Second Am, Compl. \u00b6 177. The Board issued a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment (\u201cNITU\u201d) on August 2, 2012, allowing the general public to use the right-of-way as a trail.

As of October 2014, when plaintiffs\u2019 filed their second amended complaint, the Iowa River Railroad was negotiating a Trail Use Agreement to transfer the right-of-way to the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation as the trail operator. \u2019 Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Plaintiffs contend that under Iowa law, the right-of-way was abandoned when the Iowa River Railroad \u201cceased operation of a railroad ... and took steps demonstrating abandonment.\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 180. At that point, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, they \u201cregained the right to use and possess their property free of any easement.\u201d Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 180. Therefore, plaintiffs claim that by issuing the NITU to convert the right-of-way to a public trail, the government has taken their property interests without compensation in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The court certified a-class in this case on July 10,2013, consisting of \u201c[a]ll persons who ... own an interest in lands constituting part of the railroad line that was formerly operated by the [Iowa River Railroad] in Marshall and Hardin Counties, Iowa.\u201d Class Certification Order at 1, EOF No. 14. In June 2014, after the plaintiffs developed their Claims Book and the government responded, the court adopted a schedule for pre-trial proceedings and trial.

The case proceeded through fact discovery, and at a status conference in January 2015, the parties represented to the court that they had resolved all liability issues such that the trial scheduled for August 2015 would, at most, be a valuation trial. Hr\u2019g Tr. 3:21-4:12, 4:15-19 (Jan. 28, 2015). At a subsequent status conference in June 2015, the parties informed the court that they had virtually resolved all remaining issues of disputed fact and were negotiating a settlement agreement.

Hr\u2019g Tr. 4:7-12 (Oct. 21, 2015). After considering three alternatives presented by the parties to address the last issue, the court agreed to resolve that matter consequent to briefing lay the parties regarding the continued interest rate. Scheduling Order (Oct. 21, 2015), ECF No. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Approximately three weeks later, class counsel notified the court that landowners who collectively own 21 of the 269 parcels at issue in this case were withdrawing from the settlement negotiations.

Class counsel moved under RCFC 23(c)(5) to form two subclasses, one which would proceed with the nearly-complete settlement, supplemented by the court\u2019s decision on continued interest, and the other which would proceed to trial. Pis.\u2019 Mot. .at 2-5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government opposes the withdrawal of some class plaintiffs from settlement negotiations and the formation of two subclasses, invoking two chief grounds: (1) that RCFC 23(a)(4) and 23(e) \u201crequire class counsel to work with federal counsel to finalize the proposed settlement because a supermajority of the class ... supports it,\u201d and (2) that creating subclasses would generate \u201cpotential conflicts of interest\u201d between the class counsel and one or both of the subclasses.

Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6-9. This objection raises an issue of contract law. \u201cA class-action settlement, like an agreement resolving any other legal claim, is essentially a private contract negotiated between the parties.\u201d 5 James Wm. Moore et al., <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 23.161[1] (3d ed. 2012); <em>see also Jeff D. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>Andrus, </em>899 F.2d 753, 759 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cAn agreement to settle a legal dispute is a contract and its enforceability is governed by familiar principles of contract law.\u201d)- Under the principles of contract law, if, as here, there is not an express contract between the parties, there may nevertheless be an implied-in-fact contract \u201cinferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. v. United States, </em>261 U.S. 592, 597, 43 S.Ct. 425, 67 L.Ed. 816 (1923); <em>see also Frankel v. United States, </em>118 Fed.Cl. 332, 335 (2014) (Allegra, J.). For example, in <em>S &amp; T Mfg. Co. v. Hillsborough Cnty., Fla., </em>815 F.2d 676, 678 (Fed.Cir.1987), the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s finding that a settlement contract had been agreed when the parties met in a judge\u2019s chambers, revised previously proposed settlement terms, including attendant drawings, and the result ing complete agreement was transcribed for the record and the drawings were initialed by the parties and counsel. In a class action, once the parties have reached an agreement and have submitted a \u201cproposed settlement\u201d to the court, the settlement is not final until the court has approved the proposal. RCFC 23(e) (\u201cThe claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class may be settled ... only with the court\u2019s approval.\u201d); <em>see also </em>James Wm. Moore, et al, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice Manual for Complex Litigation </em>\u00a7 21.61 (4th ed.2004) (explaining the judicial role in reviewing a class action settlement). Upon being presented with a proposed, agreed settlement, the court will hold a hearing to determine whether the proposal is \u201cfan-, reasonable, and adequate,\u201d at which time \u201c[a]ny class member may object to the proposal.\u201d RCFC 23(e)(2), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The government asserts that because class counsel previously \u201ccommitted himself to [a] proposed settlement,\u201d RCFC 23(a)(4) and 23(e) require this court to force the owners of all 269 parcels to continue with the \u201cproposed settlement\u201d to a fairness hearing, at which time the owners would have an opportunity to object. Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6-8.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the government mischaraeterizes the status of settlement negotiations in this case. A \u201cproposed settlement\u201d is one that has been agreed upon by all parties and submitted to the court for review. <em>See Manual for Complex Litigation </em>\u00a7 21.61; <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 23.160; <em>see also, e.g., Hunneshagen Family Trust of June 25, 1999 v. United States, </em>121 Fed.Cl. 51, 54-55 (2015) (describing the process by which parties in a takings class action submit a proposed settlement agreement to the court for review). Here, the parties advised the court in June 2015 that they were pursuing settlement ne gotiations, but that claims involving certain parcels that were angularly bifurcated by the former rail line were more difficult to resolve. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 4:1-6 (June 30, 2015). And, as of late October 2015, the parties had still not reached a settlement agreement because of the dispute over prejudgment interest beyond February 3, 2016. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 4:7-12 (Oct. 21, 2015) (setting out government counsel\u2019s explanation why the parties were at \u201can impasse\u201d). Therefore, at most, the parties had negotiated a tentative, partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>settlement on all issues but the continuing interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">After the court and the parties agreed that the parties would brief the continuing interest issue for the court\u2019s decision, class counsel notified the government and the court that the owners of 21 parcels no longer wished to settle their claims. Pls.\u2019s Mot. at 2. The government may be disappointed by this turn of events, but without an agreement by the parties, there is no \u201cproposed settlement\u201d for the court to review under RCFC 23(e), notwithstanding the government\u2019s suggestion that such review is the proper way forward. Indeed, the government cannot establish that there now is mutual assent to a settlement agreement between the government and <em>any </em>members of the class because the continuing interest issue remains unresolved, even for those class members who still want to settle the property damages. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 38:6-9 (Dec. 8, 2015) (class counsel acknowledging that briefing on the continuing interest issue is still necessary for the proposed \u201csettlement class\u201d). To be precise, the court cannot force the owners of 21 parcels to continue with settlement negotiations if they no longer wish to do so, nor can it enforce the provisions of a \u201cproposed settlement agreement\u201d that does not exist. The government\u2019s objections to withdrawal of some class members from settlement negotiations are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">B. <em>Requirements for Division of a Class into Subclasses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Next, plaintiffs have moved to divide the existing class of landowners into two subclasses. Before addressing the government\u2019s objections, the court must first examine whether such a subdivision is appropriate under the rules of this court. RCFC 23(c)(5) (\u201cWhen appropriate, a class may be divided into subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This rule allows the court to \u201ctreat common things in common and to distinguish the distinguishable.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. United Gas Corp., </em>400 F.2d 28, 35 (5th Cir.1968). \u201cAccordingly, subclasses may be certified to provide adequate representation to plaintiffs who have interests that are in some respects adverse to one another, <em>see Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 </em>U.S. 815, 856, 119 S.Ct. 2295, 144 L.Ed.2d 715 (1999), or to distinguish groups of plaintiffs by injury sustained, <em>see, e.g., Paxton v. Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>688 F.2d 552, 559 (8th Cir.1982), or ... to isolate common issues of law or fact shared by distinct groups of plaintiffs, <em>see, e.g., Pruitt v. Allied Ch</em>em. <em>Corp., </em>85 F.R.D. 100, 111-12 (E.D.Va.1980).\u201d <em>Haggart, </em>104 Fed. Cl. at 488. Each subclass must satisfy the requirements of RCFC 23(a) and (b), <em>viz., </em>\u201c(i) numerosity, (ii) commonality, (iii) typicality, (iv) adequacy, and (v) superiority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>King v. United States, </em>84 Fed.Cl. 120, 123 (2008); <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>68 Fed. Cl. at 494); <em>see also Manual for Complex Litigation </em>\u00a7 21.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Here, subdivision of the class originally certified in July 2013 is appropriate based on a development in the case, namely the decision by the owners of 21 parcels to withdraw from settlement negotiations. <em>See, e.g., Haggart, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 487 (creating six subclasses due to distinguishing factors identified after certification of the original class). The division of the original class into an acutely-bisected agricultural-property subclass and a settlement subclass will allow the court to \u201cdistinguish the distinguishable,\u201d thus promoting the purpose of RCFC 23(e)(5). See <em>Jenkins, </em>400 F.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">With regard to the numerosity requirement of RCFC 23(a)(1), the proposed subclass of the owners of 21 parcels meets this requirement. As this court noted in <em>Haggart, </em>where it certified classes of 18 and 25 members, \u201ccertification of classes of this listed size is by no means unprecedented.\u201d <em>Haggart, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 489 (citing <em>Douglas R. Bigelow Trust v. United States, </em>97 Fed.Cl. 674, 677 n.6 (2011) (stating that the numeros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ity requirement is a fact-specific determination and certifying a class of twenty-five members); <em>Gaspar v. Linvatec Corp., </em>167 F.R.D. 51, 56-57 (N.D.Ill.1996) (eighteen members); <em>Manning v. Princeton Consumer Discount Co., </em>390 F.Supp. 320, 324 (E.D.Pa.1975) (fifteen members), <em>aff'd, </em>533 F.2d 102 (3d Cir.1976); <em>Dale Elecs., Inc. v. R.C.L. Elecs., Inc., </em>53 F.R.D. 531, 534, 536 (D.N.H.1971) (thirteen members)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, treating these 21 parcels as one class promotes judicial economy because the alternative is multiple suits against the government. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Robidoux v. Celani, </em>987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">With regard to the other four factors, the court previously certified the larger class in July 2013, based on a joint class certification stipulation by the parties. Class Certification Order at 1. In their stipulation, the parties agreed that \u201cthis action should be maintained as a class action under [RCFC 23].\u201d Joint Class Certification Stipulation and Proposed Plan for Providing Notice to the Class at 1, EOF No. 13. Thev proposed subclasses do not change anything with regard to the commonality or typicality of the claims, the adequacy of representation for each subclass,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or the superiority of the proposed class action as compared to individual suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Accordingly, the proposed subclasses meet the requirements of RCFC 23(a), (b), and (c) for subdivision from the class originally certified by this court in July 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">C. <em>Potential Conflict of Interest Between Class Counsel and Subclasses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Notwithstanding this court\u2019s determination that the proposed subclasses meet the requirements of RCFC 23, the government contends that by establishing subclasses, the court will \u201ccreate[] a potential conflict of interest\u201d between class counsel and the subclass members. Def.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 10. As evidence of this conflict, the government points to \u201cclass counsel\u2019s previous billing practice,\u201d which allocates attorney\u2019s fees and costs based upon recovery for the class\u2019s \u201ccommon fund.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 9. The government reasons that by going to trial with the proposed acutely-bisected agricultural-property subclass, class counsel will generate additional fees that will \u201cdisproportionately harm\u201d the settlement subclass because these fees will be withdrawn from the same common fund as the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass. <em>Id. </em>at 10. The government also suggests that by scheduling a trial for the latter subclass, the court will delay the settlement subclass\u2019s receipt of \u201csettlement monies,\u201d when class counsel previously represented that the settlement subclass was interested in payment as soon as possible. <em>Id. </em>at 9; <em>see also </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 21:11-18 (Dec. 8, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The government has not shown that the creation of subclasses will create a conflict of interest with class counsel in representing the two subclasses. Respecting class counsel\u2019s ability under RCFC 23(a)(4) to \u201cfairly and adequately\u201d represent both subclasses, there is no material divergence between the subclasses on issues of law and fact. The government has provided no evidence, other than assertions about class counsel\u2019s past billing practices, that the proposed settlement subclass will be financially disadvantaged by additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in representing the angularly-bi-sected agricultural-property subclass. Each subclass may bear their own fees commencing with the decision to create subclasses. And there is no basis to suppose that the attorneys\u2019 fees to be borne by the settlement subclass will be any greater (or lesser) with the erection of subclasses than they would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>absent that step. If a common fund is created, and attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded out of the fund, the basis for the fees to be payable out of the fund will have been established with legal retention agreements and joinder in the class prior to July 2013. Additionally, because liability was addressed by the parties some time ago in connection with their consideration of the Claims Book and early discovery, any increase in fees attributable to a damages trial for the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass will ultimately be payable by the government under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act Of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c), if the subclass proves damages. In short, the settlement subclass would have no additional exposure .to attorneys\u2019 fees due to the establishment of subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Further, the government has not established that there will necessarily be a time delay in the settlement subclass receiving a judgment or payment. The court can issue a judgment under RCFC 54(b) for the settlement subclass independent of a judgment for the other subclass. <em>See </em>RCFC 54(b) (\u201cWhen an action presents more than one claim for relief ... or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Moore v. United States, </em>54 Fed.Cl. 747, 755 (2002) (ordering the parties to indicate their preference as to whether a judgment under RCFC 54(b) should be entered for certain plaintiffs in a takings class action where liability and valuation had been determined for those plaintiffs but not others), Some delay for the settlement subclass will occur even with that procedural route. Time will be required to complete the judgment for the proposed settlement subclass because the court must still resolve the continuing interest issue currently being briefed by the parties, and then the court must issue notice to the subclass of a completed proposed settlement, receive responses to the notice, and conduct a fairness hearing under .RCFC 23(e)(2). Consequently, a judgment for the settlement subclass will not necessarily be issued much, if any, earlier than a judgment for the subclass that proceeds to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In short, the government\u2019s objections to creating subclasses based upon conflict-of-interest grounds are rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">RCFC 23(c)(1)(B) states that a certification order must \u201cdefine the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses, and must appoint class counsel under RCFC 23(g).\u201d The court certifies' two subclasses according to the specifications set out below. The court divides the overarching class into the following two subclasses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\"><em>Subclass One: </em>Owners of 21 parcels, each comprising an angularly-bisected agricultural property, who wish to proceed to trial to resolve their claims against the government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\"><em>Subclass Two: </em>Owners of the remaining 248 parcels who wish to settle their claims against the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">The primary issue for the overall class, whether the \u201cAugust 3, 2012 [NITU] issued by the Surface Transportation Board ... took [plaintiffs\u2019] property rights to 'possession, control and enjoyment of this rail line or a segment thereof,\u201d Class Certification Order at 1, continues to apply to each subclass. The court also approves Thomas S. Stewart of the law firm Stewart Wald &amp; McCully LLC as the attorney of record for both subclasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">The court will separately issue a scheduling order for the pre-trial and trial proceedings for the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">For the reasons stated, plaintiffs\u2019 motion to establish subclasses is GRANTED. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a trial setting for the angu-larly-bisected agricultural-property subclass is also GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The parties shall continue to follow the scheduling order issued on December 8, 2015 with regard to briefing the issue of continued interest beyond February 3, 2016 for the court\u2019s decision applicable to the settlement subclass. Once this issue is resolved, and once the parties have submitted a proposed settlement agreement for the settlement subclass, the court will review the agreement and consider issuing a notice of settlement to the subclass preparatory to receiving comments from the subclass and holding a fairness hearing under RCFC 23(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The court will separately issue a scheduling order for the pre-trial and trial proceedings for the angularly-bisected agricultural-property subclass.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-21\">.

RCFC 23(a)(4) requires the representative parties in a class action to \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d The government asserts that the only way for class counsel to \"fairly and adequately\u201d represent the owners of all 269 parcels is for counsel to endeavor to complete a negotiated settlement and proceed to a fairness hearing under the provisions of RCFC 23(e)(2).

This may or may not be the case, but in any event, the pertinent decision is one for the government to make, not class counsel. The government has not established that forcing settlement negotiations on unwilling class members is even possible, let alone the only way for class counsel to \"fairly and adequately\u201d represent the class. Indeed, if certain class members no longer wish to settle on terms the parties have discussed, it is difficult to see how class counsel could \"fairly and adequately\u201d represent reluctant class members\u2019 views by continuing with settlement negotiations on their behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">.
