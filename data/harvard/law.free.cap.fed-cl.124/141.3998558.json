(collectively, \u201cOtay Mesa\u201d) filed a motion for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (\u201cURA\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c). Pursuant to the URA, this Court must award a plaintiff who recovers compensation for the taking of property by a federal agency \u201csuch sum as will in the opinion of the court ... reimburse such plaintiff for his reasonable costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney ... fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Plaintiffs brought a successful claim against the Government for its permanent physical taking of an easement over their property in Southern California. On June 10, 2015, this Court entered a final judgment of $802,501.23 in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Otay Mesa requests attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $1,705,631.59 and expenses in the amount of $397,943.01, plus costs of $85,242.82 to be considered separately by the Clerk of Court. The attorneys\u2019 fees are based on 5,725.50 hours billed by two firms. The total attorneys\u2019 fee amount includes a ten percent contingency fee of $80,472.84. Otay Mesa\u2019s requested expenses range from early 2006 through September 30, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The Government objects to Otay Mesa\u2019s requests on multiple grounds and proposes a total award of $965,947.68, including costs. Along with arguing for a six-stage downward percentage adjustment in the number of hours billed, the Government raises no fewer than thirteen separate arguments in its opposition to Otay Mesa\u2019s motion. Although many of the Government\u2019s objections are unwarranted, the Court finds it appropriate to apply a percentage reduction to the number hours billed and expenses incurred during the fust phase of litigation. For the reasons set forth below, Otay Mesa is entitled to recover $1,172,050.34 for attorneys\u2019 fees and $276,134.75 for expenses incurred in this litigation. The Clerk of Court will consider Otay Mesa\u2019s Bill of Costs separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">Otay Mesa\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees comes before the Court after three trials, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>appeals to the Federal Circuit, a stipulation to liability by the Government, and a final judgment awarding Otay Mesa $802,501.23. A detailed factual background and history of this case can be found in the Court\u2019s previous opinions. <em>See Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. United States, </em>779 F.3d 1315, 1327 (Fed.Cir.2015) <em>(\u201cOtay Mesa II\"); Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. United States, </em>110 Fed.Cl. 732, 747 (2013) (\u201cDamages and Interest Decision\u201d); <em>Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. United States, </em>670 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2012) <em>(\u201cOtay Mesa I\"); Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 476, 479-84 (2010) <em>(\u201cDamages De</em>cision\u201d); <em>Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 774, 775-85 (2009) <em>(\u201cLiability Decision\u201d). </em>The Court will provide a brief overview of the factual and procedural history that led to Otay Mesa\u2019s current motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Plaintiffs are businesses owned and operated by various members and associates of the De La Fuente family. Collectively, Plaintiffs own eleven adjoining parcels of land near the Mexican border in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego County, California. <em>Otay Mesa I, </em>670 F.3d at 1360. In 1992, Rancho Vista Del Mar granted the United States Border Patrol a twenty-foot-wide easement along the border with Mexico to enable the Border Patrol to conduct surveillance and respond to illegal alien activity in the area. <em>Liability Decision, </em>86 Fed.Cl. at 775. The easement allowed the Border Patrol to conduct law enforcement on foot, by vehicle, or on horseback. However, in 2006, Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court alleging that the Border Patrol had increased its operations beyond the scope of the easement in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. <em>Id. </em>at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">On March 3, 2006, Plaintiffs Otay Mesa Property, Rancho Vista Del Mar, and Otay Mesa International filed a complaint with this Court to recover just compensation for the Government\u2019s alleged taking. Judge Lawrence Baskir was assigned the ease, and subsequently denied Plaintiffs\u2019 unopposed motion to amend their pleadings to add Plaintiffs International Industrial Park (\u201cIIP\u201d) and D &amp; D Landholdings (\u201cD &amp; D\u201d) to the action. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Plaintiffs IIP and D &amp; D each filed separate complaints with this Court, and the cases were assigned to' Judges Thomas Wheeler and Margaret Sweeney respectively. After additional filings, the cases before Judges Baskir and Sweeney were eventually transferred to Judge Wheeler and consolidated. In the meantime, Judge Baskir had bifurcated the case before him into a liability phase and a damages phase and so the parties continued to move forward with discovery on liability after consolidation. Pis.\u2019 Motion at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Shortly before the liability trial and after extensive fact and expert discovery, the Government stipulated to partial liability for the physical taking of an easement due to its placement of seismic sensors on five of Plaintiffs\u2019 eleven parcels. <em>Liability Decision, </em>86 Fed.Cl. at 775. Consequently, even though Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were-barred by the six-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, based on the Government\u2019s concession, this Court determined that the Government \u201cwas liable for the physical taking of an easement over the five parcels\u201d and awarded Otay Mesa $3,043,051 plus interest in compensation. <em>Damages and Interest Decision, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 734 (citing <em>Liability Decision, </em>86 Fed.Cl. at 790). The parties cross-appealed this Court\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Federal Circuit held \u201cthat the Border Patrol\u2019s blanket easement to install, maintain, and service sensors on Otay Mesa\u2019s property constituted a permanent physical taking,\u201d and remanded the case to this Court to reconsider damages. <em>Otay Mesa I, </em>670 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">In December 2012, this Court conducted a remand trial on damages to identify a valuation method that would \u201cfulfill[ ] the goal of awarding Otay Mesa just compensation\u201d for the Government\u2019s \u201cminimally invasive permanent easement to use undeveloped land that is unilaterally terminable by Otay Mesa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1368-69. On remand, this Court held that Otay Mesa was not entitled to damages for the Government\u2019s taking of an easement over land that could be developed for industrial use, but was entitled to damages for land that could be used for environmental mitigation purposes. <em>Damages and Interest Decision, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 734. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Court determined that the Border Patrol\u2019s easement required Plaintiffs to involuntarily assume the small risk that California authorities may decide the environmentally sensitive land was no longer suitable for mitigation. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that \u201c[a] fair and reasonable outcome is to award the Plaintiffs a five percent reduction in the value of their mitigation land because of the potential denial of a mitigation request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An expert for Plaintiffs testified that the mitigation land carried a fair market value of $9,110,400. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court awarded Plaintiffs $455,520 in damages for the Government\u2019s taking, with interest calculated from the date the Government stipulated to liability, August 28, 2008. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Once again, the parties appealed to the Federal Circuit. On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed this Court\u2019s decision to deny damages for the easement over the development property and award $455,520 in damages for the easement over the mitigation property. <em>Otay Mesa II, </em>779 F.3d at 1317-18. Regarding the interest calculation, the Federal Circuit vacated the decision to compute interest beginning on August 28, 2008, and held that Otay Mesa was entitled to interest from the date the Government first placed the sensors on the property. <em>Id. </em>at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On June 4, 2015, the parties stipulated to the amount of interest accrued through that date, totaling $346,981.23. <em>Joint Stipulation, </em>Dkt. No. 290. Accordingly, this Court directed the Clerk of Court to enter judgment for Plaintiffs in the amount of $802,501.23, representing the value of the taking plus interest. <em>Order for Entry of Final Judgment, </em>Dkt. No. 293. On June 5, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs pursuant to the URA. The parties have fully briefed this motion, and on October 5, 2015, the Court heard closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">I. <em>Recovery Under the URA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Generally, our legal system adheres to the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d whereby each party to a lawsuit bears its own attorneys\u2019 fees regardless of the outcome. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Nevertheless, Congress may authorize courts to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing parties in specific instances. Section 4654(c) of the URA is one such instance. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the taking of private property for public use by the Government without \u201cjust compensation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V, \u00a7 4. Although the term \u201cjust compensation\u201d includes only the value of the property taken, the URA provides for the recovery of costs associated with litigating Governmental-taking cases in certain circumstances. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(a), (c). Pursuant to the URA, a successful litigant in a Fifth Amendment takings ease is entitled to recover \u201chis reasonable costs, disbui-sements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees, actually incurred because of such a proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Courts frequently use the \u201clodestar\u201d method to' determine reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a fee-shifting statute. This method involves multiplying \u201cthe number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation ... by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933. However, strict adherence to the lodestar method is not required. \u201cGenerally, in determining the amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to award under federal fee-shifting statutes, the district court is afforded considerable discretion.\u201d <em>Bywaters v. United States, </em>670 F.3d 1221, 1228 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citing <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct.1933). When a plaintiff has achieved only \u201cpartial or limited success,\u201d the lodestar calculation may lead to an excessive fee award. <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Along with other factors, a court may consider the degree of success obtained by the plaintiff and adjust the calculation accordingly. <em>Id. </em>To make such an adjustment, a court may reduce the number of hours \u201creasonably expended\u201d on the litigation in its initial calculation of the lodestar figure, but it generally may not engage in a wholesale \u201creduc[tion of] the lodestar figure itself.\u201d <em>Bywaters, </em>670 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The party seeking the fees bears the burden of showing that the hourly rate is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>reasonable. Rates are presumptively reasonable when they are in line with the prevailing market rate \u2014 the rate \u201cprevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896 n.11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). One way to determine whether a rate is reasonable in Washington, D.C., is to consult the Updated Laffey Matrix, a billing survey of District of Columbia market rates. <em>Bywaters, </em>670 F.3d at 1235 (citing <em>Salazar v. District of Columbia, </em>123 F.Supp.2d 8, 15 (D.D.C.2000) (explaining that \u201cthe Updated <em>Laffey </em>Matrix has been used by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney fee on several occasions.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">II. <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">a. <em>Reasonable Number of Hours</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Plaintiffs seek reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees based on 5,603.90 hours of work by attorneys from Marzulla Law and 121.60 hours of work by Michael H. Fish, an appellate attorney who assisted with both appeals in this ease. The Government raises no fewer than ten objections to these hours and proposes various adjustments based on the type of work performed as well as a general percentage reduction to the overall number of hours billed. The Court will address the specific requested adjustments before turning to the general percentage reduction,</p>\n<p id=\"AAX\">i. <em>Preliminary Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Otay Mesa requests reimbursement for a $10,000 flat fee paid to Marzulla Law for a litigation strategy memorandum the firm prepared prior to filing the initial complaint in this case. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 13. Otay Mesa argues that the report was a \u201cnecessary initial step in preparing the litigation\u201d because Marzulla Law investigated the applicable facts and law to this case to prepare the report. <em>Id. </em>The Government argues that Otay Mesa should not be reimbursed for this expense because the report covers topics not at issue in this litigation and contends that the $10,000 fee is better characterized as a \u201cclient development expense.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. at 9. The Court agrees. Given that a firm typically would not bill a client for time spent on client development, it would be inappropriate to shift such a fee to the Government. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933 (\u201cHours that are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>client </em>also are not properly billed to one\u2019s <em>adversary </em>pursuant to statutory authority.\u201d (quoting <em>Copeland v. Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880, 891 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en bane)) (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Pursuant to section 4654(c), expenses associated with filing a Fifth Amendment takings claim are reimbursable; expenses incurred prior and not directly related to the filing itself are not. <em>See, e.g., Preseault v. United States, </em>52 Fed.Cl. 667, 671 (2002) (\u201cSection 4654(c) does not provide for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by plaintiffs before their decision to file suit in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d); <em>see also Emeny v. United States, </em>208 Ct.Cl. 522, 527, 526 F.2d 1121 (1975) (holding \u201cthat the plain language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c) precludes the court from including in its award to the plaintiffs any reimbursement for expenses incurred by the plaintiffs before they decided to file suit in the Court of Claims under 28 U.S.C.- \u00a7 1491.\u201d). Although the Court acknowledges that Marzulla Law may have used the factual and legal knowledge it gained by drafting the preliminary report in litigating Otay Mesa\u2019s takings claim, ultimately this fee was not incurred \u201cbecause of such proceeding.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c). As such, it is not within this Court\u2019s purview to award compensation to Otay Mesa for the litigation strategy memorandum. This memorandum may have been a \u201cnecessary\u201d pre-litigation expense, but such expenses are simply not reimbursable under the URA.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">ii. <em>Work by Outside Attorneys</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The Government contends that hours billed by Michael Fish, of Niddrie, Fish &amp; Addams, LLP (formerly known as Niddrie, Fish,&amp; Buchanan, LLP) and Cynthia Eldred, Otay Mesa\u2019s zoning and land use expert who testified in the 2009 damages trial, were unnecessary and therefore are unreasonable. Specifically, the Government argues that it should not reimburse Otay Mesa for Mr. Fish\u2019s work because \u201che merely consulted and/or reviewed work of Marzulla Law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Gov\u2019t Resp. at 12. As to Ms. Eldred\u2019s fees, the Government argues that the Court should reduce the total requested amount by-fifty percent because Ms. Eldred spent \u201ca number of hours consulting on the litigation with the Marzulla Law firm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">In response to the Government\u2019s arguments, Otay Mesa explains that it hired Mr. Fish as a specialized appellate attorney to assist with the two appeals in this case. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 16. With regard to Ms. Eldred, Otay Mesa argues that the Government incorrectly categorizes her expenses as attorneys\u2019 fees. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 19. Otay Mesa submitted Ms. Eldred\u2019s invoices to demonstrate that she consulted with Marzulla Law in her capacity as an expert on land use and zoning in preparation for trial and during post-trial briefing. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 19-20; Ex. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">This Court has explained that \u201cthe costs of having one set of experienced, competent, and highly paid attorneys review the work of another set of experienced, competent and highly paid attorneys is not reasonable.\u201d <em>Preseault, </em>52 Fed.Cl. at 680 (citing <em>Emeny, </em>208 Ct.Cl. at 530, 526 F.2d 1121). The plaintiffs in <em>Preseault </em>had'fourteen different attorneys representing them throughout the case and sought fees and expenses for nine different legal organizations. Here, a single firm represented Otay Mesa throughout the nearly ten years of litigation in this case, with Roger Marzulla serving as counsel of record from the outset. In this context, Otay Mesa\u2019s requests for fees it incurred by hiring a specialized .appellate attorney and an expert on land use and zoning are neither excessive nor redundant. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that the fees incurred for this specialized assistance are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>iii.Paralegal Work</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Government argues that approximately 19.9 of the hours billed by Mar-zulla Law are adpiinistrative in nature and therefore are non-compensable overhead costs. Generally, costs associated with administrative services \u201care more appropriately charged to overhead\u201d and should therefore be included within an attorney\u2019s hourly rate. <em>Hopi Tribe v. United States, </em>55 Fed.Cl. 81, 99 (2002) (quoting <em>Batdorf v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>1990 WL 293394 *2 (Cl.Ct.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, the explanations accompanying the disputed time entries describe the type of \u201crequired legal duties\u201d for which this Court has awarded recovery. <em>Information Sciences Corp. v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 269, 291 (2009) (awarding recovery for time spent \u201corganizing case documents\u201d). As the Court finds that it is reasonable to bill for this type of work at a paralegal rate, the 1.6 hours billed at an associate rate of $295 on March 31, 2015 for time spent \u201csummarizing] billing information for petition on attorneys\u2019 fees and costs\u201d shall instead be billed at the paralegal rate of $85. To account for this adjustment, the Court will deduct $336 before calculating the average hourly rate for the lodestar calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">\n<em>iv.Duplicative Hours</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">The Government also seeks reductions to account for duplicative billing. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 10-11, Tab 6; Gov\u2019t Objections at 84. The Court agrees with Otay Mesa that most of these entries appear to reflect work related to one task, but billed in separate time entries over the course of one day, a best practice in billing at many firms. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Reply at 15. However, four of these entries, accounting for 24 hours, are duplicative and therefore unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court will therefore deduct these entries before calculating the lodestar figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\"><em>v.Motion for Attorneys </em>\u2019 <em>Fees and Closing Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">Generally, fees and expenses associated with filing and litigating attorneys\u2019 fees under section 4654(c) are themselves recoverable under the URA as costs incurred because of the inverse condemnation proceedings. <em>Emeny, </em>208 Ct.Cl. at 532, 526 F.2d 1121; <em>see also Gregory v. United States, </em>110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Fed.Cl. 400, 406 (2013) (billing 10.3 hours for preparing motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was reasonable and reimbursable). Here, Marzulla Law estimates that preparing and litigating Otay Mesa\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses will cost an additional $20,000. Pls.\u2019 Motion at 16. In response, the Government argues that \u201c[t]he URA allows for collection of costs actually incurred, not those that <em>may </em>be incurred in the future,\u201d and alternatively, that $20,000 is an excessive amount to charge for the remaining work in this ease. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 7 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">During oral argument on October 5, 2015, Otay Mesa submitted an invoice from Marzulla Law for $9,360, the cost for the 24 hours the firm spent working on this matter during September of this year. Oct. 5, 2015 Oral Arg. (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 6. The Court has reviewed this invoice and finds that the hours billed are reasonable, particularly in light of the Government\u2019s comprehensive, if not excessive, objections to Otay Mesa\u2019s request for reimbursement. Accordingly, the Government shall reimburse Otay Mesa for the September billing. Additionally, the Court in its discretion awards Otay Mesa an additional $2,500 for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred because of October\u2019s oral argument, for a total of $11,860.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">vi, <em>Contingency Fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In addition to $1,590,213.75 in fees billed by Marzulla Law through September 2015, Otay Mesa also seeks reimbursement for a ten percent contingency fee it paid Marzulla Law. Pis.\u2019 Motion at 2. Otay Mesa and Marzulla Law agreed on this ten percent fee when initially negotiating payment. According to the Government, Otay Mesa is not entitled to reimbursement for the contingency fee because it was not \u201cactually incurred as required by the URA\u201d and \u201ca reasonable fee has already been determined for the hourly rate of Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. at 7. The Government\u2019s argument is flawed for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">First, the Government\u2019s argument \u201cfails to appreciate what a contingent fee is. It is not based on <em>any </em>hours of work, only upon the ultimate result.\u201d <em>Osprey Pacific Corp v. United States, </em>42 Fed.Cl. 740, 743 (1999) (emphasis in original). Here, the Court awarded a judgment of $802,501.23 in Otay Mesa\u2019s favor. With interest, Otay Mesa received $804,728.43 from the Government, $80,472.84 of which it paid to Marzulla Law. Pis.\u2019 Reply at Tab 8. Marzulla Law was only entitled to this amount because the contingency, securing a net recovery for its client, occurred. The fee itself was actually incurred when Otay Mesa made payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Second, the Government\u2019s argument fails to explain why this fee is unreasonable. Combining the contingency fee with the total hourly fee, the average hourly rate is only $296 an hour for legal services, an amount well below the adjusted Laffey rate of approximately $454 an hour. Although a contingency fee is not based on hours billed, this calculation nevertheless demonstrates that the contingency fee itself is reasonable as part of the overall amount paid by Otay Mesa in litigating its takings claim against the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The purpose of the URA is to make the plaintiff in a successful inverse condemnation proceeding whole. <em>See, e.g., Moore v. United States, </em>63 Fed.Cl. 781, 788 (2005) (explaining that \u201cthe URA is uniquely tied to the Fifth Amendment principle of just compensation, It is designed to make plaintiffs whole.\u201d). To effectuate this purpose, the Government must compensate a prevailing plaintiff for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in establishing her rights against the United States. Here, Otay Mesa has actually incurred an $80,472.84 contingency fee. Moreover, including the contingency fee in calculating the average hourly rate still produces a billing rate well below the average market rate in Washington, D.C. Thus, the contingency fee is reasonable and was actually incurred and the Court shall include this fee in calculating the total award.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">vii. <em>Credit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">In 2013, Marzulla Law issued an $85,000 credit to the De La Fuente family to use toward their legal fees after the De La Fuentes disputed a fee they had paid to Marzulla Law in another matter. Tr. at 16. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Otay Mesa applied $42,378.58 of the credit against its legal fees in this case in 2013 and 2014, The Government contends the credit \u201clessens the total fees actually incurred by Plaintiffs\u201d and asks the Court to deduct $85,000 from any fee award. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 8. Otay Mesa disagrees that the credit should affect its award in any way. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 5. As the Court understands the matter, when the De La Fuentes disputed a fee post-payment, Marzulla Law issued the family a credit for the disputed amount rather than writing them a check. Otay Mesa then applied some of this credit toward amounts due in this case. The Court fails to see how using a credit as payment for legal fees makes such fees any less \u201cincurred\u201d than they would be had Otay Mesa paid with a check. The use of a credit provides no basis for adjusting the award in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">viii. <em>IIP Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Government also argues that \u201cnot all Plaintiffs were successful\u201d and asks the Court to deduct an additional $96,412.25 from Plaintiffs\u2019 request. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 19; Gov\u2019t Proposal. The Court disagrees with the Government\u2019s characterization. All of the businesses involved in this case are owned and operated by the De La Fuente family, Marzulla Law has represented this family through its businesses from the outset of this litigation, and the Court considered the claims raised throughout this litigation as belonging to a common entity. All of the De La Fuentes\u2019 business entities shared in the damages award. Accordingly, the Court will not adjust the total fee award in. the ease based on whether hours were billed for work on one family business as opposed to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">ix. <em>Unsuccessful Claims: Percentage Reductions for Limited Success</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Along with its itemized objections to Otay Mesa\u2019s fees and expenses, the Government proposes that \u201cit is entirely appropriate to apply a reduction to the hours expended\u201d by Otay Mesa\u2019s attorneys to account for what the Government characterizes as Otay Mesa\u2019s \u201climited successful claim.\u201d Gov\u2019t Resp. at 18. Specifically, the Government argues that the Court should reduce the requested hours to reflect the fact that Otay Mesa prevailed on only one claim, a claim to which the Government stipulated to partial liability prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Generally, when a plaintiff is successful in litigating pursuant to a federal fee-shifting statute, \u201cthe court\u2019s rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Where the result a plaintiff obtains represents more.modest success, the trial court, in its discretion, may adjust the lodestar calculation by reducing the number of hours reasonably expended in relation to the ultimate outcome. As this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n accounting for the degree of success obtained, adjustments to the lodestar figure itself are proper only in \u2018rare\u2019 and \u2018exceptional\u2019 cases, but the trial court may consider the results obtained by the plaintiff in determining the lodestar figure in the first place.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>110 Fed. at 404 (citing <em>Bywaters, </em>670 F.3d at 1228-29).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In this case, the Government proposes that the Court adopt an approach similar to the methodology it applied when calculating the attorneys\u2019 fee award in <em>Gregory. </em>In <em>Gregory, </em>this Court divided the litigation into separate time periods and applied various percentage reductions to the number of hours billed during each period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Gregory, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 404. Otay Mesa argues that it would be inappropriate to apply the <em>Gregory </em>method in this case. Pls.\u2019 Reply at 9. Specifically, Otay Mesa asserts that the Court entered a single judgment on behalf of all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the Plaintiffs in this ease, whereas in <em>Gregory </em>only a small percentage of the plaintiffs prevailed. <em>Id. </em>The Court agrees with Otay Mesa that the instant case differs from <em>Gregory </em>in significant ways. However, the Government\u2019s reliance on the approach this Court used in <em>Gregory </em>is not entirely misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Here, the Government asks the Court to divide the nearly ten years of litigation in this case into six periods and apply percentage reductions to the number of hours billed in each period depending on the type of work involved. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 16-19. Although the Court agrees it is appropriate to divide the litigation into separate periods, in this case, the Court finds that there are only two relevant time periods. The first period runs from the filing of the initial complaint in this case through the first appeal to the Federal Circuit, and dates from March 3, 2006 through March 19, 2012. Along with the first appeal, this period includes the discovery efforts leading to the Government\u2019s partial stipulation and the first and second trials. The second period covers the remand trial on damages, the second appeal, the calculation of interest, and Otay Mesa\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, and dates from March 20, 2012 through October 5, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">1. <em>Phase One</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In total, Plaintiffs seek reimbursement for 5,725.50 hours billed in this case. After deducting the duplicative hours discussed above, the total hours billed in the first phase amount to 4,602.87, representing 4,528.27 hours by Marzulla Law and 74.6 hours by Mr. Fish. The Government argues that the number of hours in this period should be reduced for various reasons. First, the Government asks the Court to reduce the hours because Otay Mesa prevailed on only one claim, to which the Government stipulated to partial liability prior to trial. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 16. Second, the Government asks the Court to apply a \u201csubstantial discount\u201d to the hours to account for work performed for the \u201cnon-prevailing\u201d plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 17. Third, the Government contends that the Court should substantially reduce the number of hours billed for the first damages trial \u201cto ensure that Plaintiffs are not awarded fees for work spent on their unsuccessful arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. Finally, the Government asks for a reduction to the hours spent on the first appeal given that Otay Mesa was unsuccessful with its claims relating to the time period and scope of the easement. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. In total, the Government proposes approximately a 52 percent reduction in the total number of hours billed during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Otay Mesa objects to the Government\u2019s proposed reductions, arguing that the Government fails to identify specific work it deems unnecessary or unreasonable. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 10. Otay Mesa also contends that the extensive work leading up to the Government\u2019s stipulation was necessary in order to obtain that stipulation. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Lastly, as to the first damages trial and appeal, Otay Mesa points to this Court\u2019s judgment in its favor and the Federal Circuit\u2019s rejection of the Government\u2019s argument in favor of nominal damages to dispute the Government\u2019s limited success argument. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The Court agrees with the Government that a reduction in hours for this time period is appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Gregory, </em>110 Fed. Cl. at 404 (finding it appropriate \u201cto reduce the number of hours to a level that would be \u2018reasonably expended\u2019 in litigating the 26 successful taking claims\u201d). Except for the Government\u2019s stipulation, Otay Mesa\u2019s claims were timed barred and the Court deems it appropriate to reduce the number of hours billed to account for time spent pursuing these stale claims through the first appeal. Nevertheless, the Court allowed recovery for the taking to which the Government stipulated and the Court recognizes the validity of Otay Mesa\u2019s contention that Marzulla Law\u2019s dogged efforts were important in obtaining the Government\u2019s stipulation. Given that there is no feasible way to parse the recorded hours into time spent on successful as opposed to unsuccessful claims, the Court in its discretion reduces the number of hours expended in first phase of litigation by 40 percent. For Phase One, Otay Mesa shall recover fees for 2,761.72 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">2. <em>Phase Two</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Along with each of the proposed reductions in hours outlined above, the Govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>merit requests additional reductions through March 19, 2015. In support of its argument, the Government points to the difference between the damages amount initially sought by Otay Mesa and the amount ultimately awarded. Gov\u2019t Resp. at 2. The Government\u2019s argument fails to consider the effect of its stipulation to liability and the fact that it has challenged nearly every claim and issue raised by Otay Mesa to date. <em>See City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 580 n.11, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986) (cautioning that \u201cthe government cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by the plaintiff in response.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">After the first appeal in this case, the only remaining issue before this Court was to determine the amount Otay Mesa should recover in just compensation, with interest, for the Government\u2019s taking of a permanent easement over Otay Mesa\u2019s property. Given the Government\u2019s stipulation, Otay Mesa is entitled to reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in securing just compensation for the Government\u2019s taking, <em>Cloverport Sand &amp; Gravel Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>10 Cl.Ct. 121, 127 (1986) (holding that when the Government stipulated to liability for a taking, \u201cthe Uniform Relocation Act applied at that point and mandated the award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, even though there [was] limited success on the merits and certainly not the results reached that the plaintiff had -contemplated.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Government stipulated to the taking of an easement over Otay Mesa\u2019s property. Following the first appeal in this case, the remaining litigation was to det\u00e9rmine the correct amount of just compensation. Pursuant to the URA, Otay Mesa is entitled to all reasonable fees and expenses incurred for such proceedings, and the Government should have been on notice of this fact. Except for the duplicative hours discussed above, Otay Mesa is entitled to recover for all hours expended on and after March 20, 2012, for a total of 1,098.63 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">b. <em>Reasonable Billing Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbH\">The Government does not challenge the reasonableness of the hourly rates Otay Mesa paid for legal services in this case. The attorneys from Marzulla Law practice in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Fish is based in San Diego, California. Pursuant to the Updated Laffey Matrix, Marzulla Law\u2019s average hourly rate would be approximately $454. Pis.\u2019 Reply at 6. Instead, Otay Mesa paid an average hourly rate of $282 to Marzulla Law for its work and $287 an hour to Mr. Fish.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Including the contingency fee, Marzulla Law\u2019s average hourly rate becomes $296, still well below the adjusted Laffey rate. The Court therefore makes no adjustments to the billing rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">III. <em>Litigation Expenses and Costs</em></p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">The URA also provides for reimbursement of Plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable costs and expenses. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4654(c). Otay Mesa requests reimbursement of $397,695,30 in expenses for nearly ten years of litigation. These costs were actually incurred by Otay Mesa for items such as couriers, postage, legal research, copying, travel and lodging, and expert witness fees. The Court, in its discretion, finds it reasonable to award expenses in the same proportion as applied to the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. Thus, Otay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Mesa is entitled to recover 60 percent of incurred expenses through March 19, 2012, and one hundred percent of all expenses incurred thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The Court has reviewed the Government\u2019s other objections and proposed reductions to Otay Mesa\u2019s requests and finds that Otay Mesa has met its burden by establishing that the contested expenses are reasonable, supported, and therefore compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The Clerk of Court shall consider the amount due with respect to Otay Mesa\u2019s Bill of Costs separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The Court GRANTS IN PART Otay Mesa\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, with adjustments made for the reasonable number of hours spent litigating Otay Mesa\u2019s successful claim as to the Government\u2019s taking of a permanent physical easement over Otay Mesa\u2019s property. The Court finds that counsels\u2019 rates in this case are reasonable and awards Otay Mesa $1,172,050.34 in attorneys\u2019 fees. The Court also awards $276,134.75 to Otay Mesa for its reasonable expenses. In sum, the Clerk shall enter judgment for Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,448,185.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">.

This Court held that the Government had taken easements on only 26 of the 331 parcels involved. The issue was how much of class counsel\u2019s total fees the successful plaintiffs could recover given that they represented no more than ten percent of the class. This Court found that much of the work involved in litigating the matter \u201crelated to all or many of the claims, and [could] not be parsed into parcel-by-parcel calculations.\u2019\u2019\u2019 <em>Gregory, </em>110 Fed.Cl. at 404. It therefore divided the litigation period into distinct timeframes and applied various percentage reductions to the hours expended in each period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. Going forward, the Government might consider the following advice offered by this Court nearly twenty years ago in a similar case: \u201c[ojnce the Government stipulates to liability, as it did in this case, then it should be well aware and cognizant that it will be liable, in addition to damages in compensation, for all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the plaintiff. Accordingly, the Government should carefully assess each case brought under section 1346(a)(2) or 1491 of Title 28, for the Government's taking of private property, both as to the Government's potential monetary exposure for liability and for its potential exposure as to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\u201d <em>Cloverport Sand &amp; Gravel Co., Inc., </em>10 Cl.Ct. at 127.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-11\">. To calculate Marzulla Law\u2019s average hourly rate, the Court used the total dollar amount billed by Marzulla Law through September, 2015, less $10,000 for the litigation strategy report, $336 for the paralegal rate adjustment, and $7,767.50 for the duplicative billing, divided by the total number of hours billed less the 24 duplicative hours. To calculate Mr. Fish's average hourly rate, the Court simply divided the total dollar amount billed by his firm by the number of hours worked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
