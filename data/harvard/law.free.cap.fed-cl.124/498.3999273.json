While certain pricing information has been redacted, the Court rejects Bra-seth's request for further redactions of certain performance evaluation information because such material is not within the protective order (ECF No. 8), which defines protected information as \"information that must be protected to safeguard the competitive process.\u201d <em>See also Mitter-Holzwarth, Inc. v.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS the government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Corwin Company, Inc. (\u201cCor-win\u201d) but DENIES that motion as to Braseth Trucking, LLC (\u201cBraseth\u201d). Further, because the Court finds that the stated rationales for the agency\u2019s decision in this matter appear to be internally inconsistent, it has concluded that further explanation and clarification by the agency is necessary to facilitate its review of Braseth\u2019s claims. Accordingly, the Court REMANDS this matter to the agency and STAYS the cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record pending the agency\u2019s remand decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-19\">I. The United States Forest Service and its Fire-Fighting Responsibilities</p>\n<p id=\"b512-20\">Founded in 1905, the United States Forest Service (USFS) manages and administers roughly 188 million acres of public lands, mainly in the western states. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.3; <em>About the Agency, </em>U.S. Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency. USFS has divided the lands it manages into nine geographic regions. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 200.2(a). Region 6, the Pacific Northwest Region, includes public lands in the states of Oregon and Washington. Id \u00a7 200.2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-21\">Wildfires are endemic to the public lands in the western states and USFS plays a key role in managing wildfires on the lands it administers. <em>See Fire, </em>U.S. Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land/fire. To prepare for the inevitable fires in Region 6, USFS stocks caches of firefighting equipment across the region. <em>See </em>Administrative Record (AR) Tab 4 at 10 \u00a7 C-l. USFS then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>contracts with local trucking outfits to transport this equipment to the locations where it is needed when a fire erupts. <em>Id.; see also </em>AR Tab 1 at 1 (file memo discussing the region\u2019s transportation needs). Region 6 has historically awarded these contracts on three-year contract cycles. AR Tab 1 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">II. The Solicitation</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On March 11, 2015, USFS issued a pre-solicitation notice regarding an upcoming solicitation for contractors to provide \u201cFire Cache Freight Services\u201d in Region 6. AR Tab 3-at 3-5. These services would include \u201cthe delivery of emergency supplies and \u2022equipment by tractor-trailer for wild land fire suppression and all-hazard emergencies to various locations in the western United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. On March 30, USFS followed up with an official solicitation, numbered AG04H1-S-15-0006. AR Tab 4 at 6-45. The method of solicitation was an \u201cRFQ\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cRequest for Quotations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6, and the government expected to award a \u201cFirm-Fixed Price Multiple Award IDIQ contract\u201d for the freight cache services, <em>id. </em>at 34 \u00a7 1-13. The solicitation requested quotations for three cache locations: La Grande, OR; Redmond, OR; and East Wenatchee, WA. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9. For the La Grande cache (which is at issue in this case), the solicitation indicated that the government intended to award up to three contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The contractors would be required to \u201c[h]ave [a] 24 hour per day, 7 day per week communication system in place to allow the Government to place oral orders\u201d and to \u201c[fjurnish tractor(s) or a tractor(s) with trailer(s) and dollies as required, with driver(s) ... within 1-1/2 hours ... after placement of [an] order by the Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 \u00a7 C-3. In addition, \u201cthe inside of the trailers shall be swept clean.\u201d <em>Id. \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">According to the solicitation, the government would award a contract to \u201cthe responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45 \u00a7 M. The \u201c[b]asis of [the] [a]ward\u201d would be a combination of price and two other factors: past performance and availability of tractor-trailers within 50 miles of the relevant equipment cache. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In terms of price, offerors were to provide quotations for two contract items: transportation services using the company\u2019s own tractor-trailers, and transportation services using \u201cGovernment-owned Cache Vans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-9. For each of these items, offerors were to provide per-mile prices for three distance ranges in each of three years: the base year (July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016) and two option years. <em>Id. </em>The distance ranges were \u201c1 to 100 miles,\u201d \u201c101 to 300 miles,\u201d and \u201c301+ miles.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The solicitation stated that the \u201c[b]asis for determining low, second low, third low etcet-era for ordering purposes\u201d would be \u201cthe average cost per mile\u201d for all three distance ranges over the three-year life of the contract \u201cfor [i]tem 01 for each location.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The solicitation provided the following example of this calculation:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">\n<em>LA GRANDE INTERAGENCY FIRE CACHE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\n<em>BASE Option 1 Option 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">1 to 100 miles $3.00 $3.03 $3.08</p>\n<p id=\"AiPZ\">101 to 300 miles $2.77 $2.80 $2.85</p>\n<p id=\"Axpq\">301 + miles $2.00 $7.77 $2.04 $7.87 $2.08 $8.01 <em>divided by 3 = $7,883</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-29\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-30\">As for the non-price factors, past performance would be considered more important than availability. <em>See id. </em>at 45. Moreover, when assessing an offer as a whole, the non-price factors, when combined, would be considered \u201capproximately equal to price\" in importance. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-32\">In its description of the contract\u2019s specifications, the solicitation set forth a \u201cRotation Schedule\u201d describing how orders would be placed among the successful offerors. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>10 \u00a7 C-2. The schedule divided the contract year into twenty periods of seven to ten days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The solicitation explained that the g-ovemment would \u201cplace orders on a rotation basis with the vendor having the lowest average mileage rate being scheduled first\u201d on the schedule. If a vendor could not perform during its scheduled week, the order would be \u201cplaced with the next scheduled vendor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The solicitation incorporated by reference several provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Agriculture Acquisition Regulations (AGAR). <em>See id. </em>at 6, 19-37. Among these were FAR 52.212-1 (\u201cInstructions to Offerors \u2014 Commercial Items\u201d), FAR 52.212-4 (\u201cContract Terms and Conditions \u2014 Commercial Items\u201d), and AGAR 452.216-73 (\u201cMinimum and Maximum Contract Amounts\u201d), which specifies that that government will not place orders \u201cin excess of $150,000 per year\u201d over the course of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 32 \u00a7 1-9. The solicitation was also \u201cset aside 100% for small business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6 \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">III. Quotations and Awards</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">USFS considered five quotations received in response to the solicitation for freight cache services at the La Grande cache.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> AR-Tabs 5-9 at <em>46-58. These </em>quotations came from two sets of related companies. The first set included A-Secured Properties, LLC (\u201cA-Secured\u201d) and Smith Bros. Moving Services (\u201cSmith Bros\u201d). <em>See </em>AR Tab 5 at 46-48; AR Tab 9 at 55-58 (quotations from A-Secured and Smith Bros, providing the same contact information for both companies). The second set included Braseth, Corwin, and Connie\u2019s Inc. (\u201cConnie\u2019s\u201d). <em>See </em>AR Tab 6 at 49-50; AR Tab 7 at 51-52; AR Tab 8 at 53-54. The quotations from Braseth, Cor-win, and Connie\u2019s simply listed their offered prices for items one and two. <em>See </em>AR Tabs 6-8 at 49-54. In addition to listing prices, the quotations from A-Secured and Smith Bros, each included a \u201cpast performance data sheet\u201d describing each company\u2019s past work performance on government freight services contracts. <em>See </em>AR Tab 5 at 46-48; AR Tab 9 at 55-58. The companies offered the following average prices per mile over the life of the contract:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Connie\u2019s $[. \u2022 \u25a0]</p>\n<p id=\"AiJ\">Braseth $r.</p>\n<p id=\"AD4\">Corwin $r..</p>\n<p id=\"AGJ\">A-Secured. $r,.</p>\n<p id=\"Axz\">Smith Bros. sr.. .1</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">AR Tab 12 at 72.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-18\">After receiving the quotations, USFS convened a Technical Proposal Evaluation Committee (TPEC) in the first week of June 2015 to evaluate the quotations\u2019 non-price factors. AR Tab 12 at 68. The TPEC consisted of the cache manager for the La Grande cache, Cheryl Campbell, along with the cache manager for the Redmond cache and a forest fuels specialist from the region served by the Wenatchee cache. <em>See id. </em>The TPEC ranked proximity and past performance for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>each quotation using the following adjectival rating system: Exceptional (E), Good (G), Satisfactory (S), Marginal (M), and Unacceptable (U). <em>Id. </em>at 69. Notably, the TPEC found that \u201c[t]he quality and completeness of the quote packages was marginal, at best.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But because the TPEC members \u201chad prior experience with all the companies who submitted quotes,\u201d they \u201crelied heavily on their respective knowledge of the companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The TPEC gave the La Grande quotations the following ratings:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Proximity Past Performance</p>\n<p id=\"Ax2U\">Connie\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"ADFj\">Braseth</p>\n<p id=\"Aaz\">Corwin</p>\n<p id=\"AV0f\">A-Secured</p>\n<p id=\"A06F\">Smith Bros.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">M<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">After the TPEC assigned these ratings, it met with the CO to review the quotations. <em>Id. </em>In a June 16, 2015 Memorandum of Negotiation, the CO reported that the TPEC gave \u201csatisfactory\u201d past performance ratings to Connie\u2019s, Braseth, and Corwin because of \u201cissues [in] the past two years dealing with untimely invoicing, late deliveries, and having to reject a truck since it arrived at the cache full of junk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. The CO noted that \u201calthough these are separate companies, all three are owned by the same person, utilize the same personnel, and use each other\u2019s[] tracks interchangeably,\u201d and agreed that \u201cConnie\u2019s satisfactory rating was appropriate due to the recent performance concerns.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 70. At the same time, though, he stated that Braseth and Corwin \u201clacked recent past performance with the agency,\u201d and that, under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), \u201can of-feror without a record of relevant past performance ... may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, he left their satisfactory past performance ratings in place, because \u201cit was considered a neutral rating.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">The CO then evaluated the quotations based on price. <em>Id. </em>at 70-75. For the La Grande cache, the variance between the high bid and the low bid was only [\u00b6]... ] percent, which the CO described as \u201cvery tight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">Finally, in consultation with the TPEC, the CO made award recommendations. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. For the La Grande cache, he first noted that \u201c[t]he three lowest priced quotes\u201d \u2014 Braseth\u2019s, Corwin\u2019s, and Connie\u2019s\u2014 \u201cwere also the lowest rated technically.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. \u201cKeeping in mind the combination of past performance and proximity were considered of equal importance to price,\u201d the CO recommended awarding contracts to A-Secured, Smith Bros., and Connie\u2019s. A-Secured and Smith Bros., though higher priced, were considered \u201creliable providers\u201d who had \u201cconsistently met their delivery schedules,\u201d and their prices were considered \u201ccompetitive and reasonable:\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CO also determined that Connie\u2019s would be \u201csuitable for award\u201d because it was \u201clowest in price.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But because of its past performance issues, he noted that Connie\u2019s would \u201crequire additional monitoring and scrutiny during the performance of [the] contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-20\">Braseth and Corwin were not recommended. <em>Id. </em>at 75. The CO reiterated that the TPEC expressed \u201cthe same concerns with Corwin as it did with Connie[\u2019]s\u201d and had \u201cidentical concerns\u201d for Braseth; but also stated that the companies were each \u201cconsidered a new company without a recent record of past performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the CO noted that Braseth\u2019s and Corwin\u2019s prices were higher than Connie\u2019s, but not substantially lower than Smith Bros,\u2019 or A-Secured\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, on June 16, 2015, the CO \u201cdetermined to make award\u201d to the three recommended companies: A-Secured, Smith Bros., and Connie\u2019s. <em>Id.) see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>also </em>AR Tab 13 at 76-109 (IDIQ Award No. AG-04H1-C-15-9934 to A-Secured); AR Tab 14 at 110-43 (IDIQ Award No. AG-04H1-C-15-9935 to Smith Bros.); AR Tab 15 at 144-77 (IDIQ Award No. AG-04H1-C-15-9936 to Connie\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">IV. Post-Award Debriefing</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On June 17, the day after USFS awarded the contracts, Braseth and Corwin sent identically worded letters to the CO requesting debriefing. <em>See </em>AR Tabs 16-17 at 178-79. Both companies stated that they had \u201ca long history with your agency\u201d and that they had \u201calways performed to the highest standard and with the upmost [sic] speed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, both companies represented that they had not \u201creceived any written complaints\u201d nor been \u201ccontacted with any issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The companies requested information about \u201cwhat the evaluation process and standards [we]re and how the awards were determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Braseth\u2019s letter was signed by Cory Braseth, AR Tab 16 at 178, while Cor-win\u2019s letter was signed by Josh Braseth, AR Tab 17 at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u2022 On June 18, the La Grande cache manager, Cheryl Campbell, emailed a document titled \u201cPerformance Issues: Connies/Corwin/Braseth INC\u201d to the CO. AR Tab 11 at 66-66.1. In the document, Ms. Campbell listed several incidents of Connie\u2019s subpar performance within the past two years, including late deliveries from the cache, trailers arriving that were not empty or swept clean, late invoicing after services, and, on one occasion, \u201cduring Fire Camp unloading, a pallet jack wheel fell through a weak spot in the floor.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 66.1. Ms. Campbell also noted that, \u201c[i]n regards to Braseth and Corwin,\u201d while \u201cthe last contracts that they were awarded [were in] 2009-2010 ... we had the same problem with the billing invoices in regards to being submitted in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the cover email, Ms. Campbell wrote that she was \u201c[s]orry that this is happening\u201d and that \u201cif push comes to shove, I can deal with him having 2 of the contracts, and will just keep detailed records of every issue that we have with them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">On June 25, the CO sent debriefing letters to Braseth and Corwin. AR Tabs 18-19 at 180-85. The letters were substantially similar. <em>See id. </em>In each letter, the CO explained that \u201c[t]he Government used a rating matrix that considered Past Performance, Proximity to the Base, and Price,\u201d with \u201cpast performance ... considered more important than proximity and when combined ... approximately of equal importance to price.\u201d AR Tab at 180; AR Tab 19 at 183. The letters each included a table showing the past performance and proximity ratings given to the successful offerors as well as the ratings given to the disappointed offeror \u2014 i.e., showing that A-Secured and Smith Bros, received ratings of \u201cExcellent\u201d for both past performance and proximity, while Connie\u2019s and each disappointed offeror received a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating for past performance and an \u201cExcellent\u201d rating for proximity. AR Tab 18 at 180; AR Tab 19 at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The CO then explained that, for both companies, \u201c[y]our past performance was considered satisfactory overall, but several issues were noted during the evaluation including: late arrival at the cache, trailers arriving with pallets/dunnage that had to be sent back, and delays with submitting your invoices.\u201d AR Tab 18 at 180; AR Tab 19 at 183.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The CO also explained that Braseth\u2019s price proposal \u201cranked 2nd out of 5\u201d and \u201cwas only $[...], or [...]%, less than A-Secured or Smith Bros,\u201d AR Tab 18 at 182; and that Corwin\u2019s price proposal \u201cranked 3rd out of 6\u201d and \u201cwas only $[...], or [...]%, less than A-Secured or Smith Bros,\u201d AR Tab 19 at 185. Accordingly, because \u201cthe government determined it was in its best interests to award to the higher non-price rated companies,\u201d it did not award contracts to Braseth or Corwin. AR Tab 18 at 182; AR Tab 19 at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">V. Agency Protests</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">On July 3, nine days after the debriefing, Braseth and Corwin filed letters with the CO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>protesting the award decision. AR Tabs 21-22 at 192-99. The letters disputed both the debriefing\u2019s references to the companies\u2019 past performance issues and the CO\u2019s pricing evaluation. <em>See id. </em>Braseth\u2019s letter, which was signed by Lois Braseth, pointed out that when USFS had contracted with Braseth between 2006 and 2011, \u201c[a]ny issues that did arise were resolved in a timely manner and did not reoccur.\u201d AR Tab 21 at 192. \u201cIf there were complaints,\u201d Braseth wondered, \u201cwhy have we not seen them in the three years since our last contract?\u201d Id. In terms of pricing evaluation, Braseth argued that \u201c[i]n comparing the contract to your debriefing[,] it looks like the rates should only be based on Item 1.\u201d Id. Were that the case, Braseth stated, its Item 1 price rating of $[,..] would be $[...] lower than A-Se-eured\u2019s and Smith Bros.\u2019 rating of $[...], rather than just $[...] lower. Id. Braseth requested that the CO provide it with documentation of its past performance issues and re-evaluate the price factor based on its reading of the contract order. Id. at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">As with Braseth\u2019s letter, Corwin\u2019s letter (signed by Cory Braseth) questioned both the CO\u2019s past performance evaluation and pricing evaluation. AR Tab 22 at 196-97. Corwin claimed that between 2006 and 2011, it \u201cdid not receive any written documentation or verbal reprimands to indicate any performance issues,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ny time there was any type of situation, it was rectified immediately.\u201d Id. at 196. In terms of the price evaluation, Corwin also argued that \u201c[i]n reading the contract order, it looks like only Item 1 should be considered.\u201d Id. Cor-win stated that it wished to \u201csee all of the past performance evaluations and other documents that were used\u201d in the past performance determination, and that it \u201cwould also like an explanation on why none of this was brought to [its] attention before now.\u201d Id. at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The CO denied both agency protests as untimely under FAR 33.103(f)(3), which mandates that the disappointed offeror file an agency protest within five days of a debriefing. AR Tabs 23-24 at 200-01. Because the protests were untimely, the CO did not consider the merits of Braseth\u2019s and Corwin\u2019s claims. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">VI. Proceedings in This Court</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Braseth filed its complaint against the United States in this Court on August 6, 2015. No. 15-cv-837, ECF No. 1 (\u201cBraseth Compl.\u201d). Corwin filed its complaint the next day. No. 15-cv-844, ECF No. 1 (\u201cCor-win Compl.\u201d). The complaints are nearly identical. In them, Braseth and Corwin alleged that the solicitation and award were marred by several deficiencies related to USFS\u2019s handling and evaluation of the offer-ors\u2019 past performance information. Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-51; Corwin Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-52. In particular, the companies alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\u2022 That USFS relied on incorrect information in assessing the companies\u2019 past performance (i.e., by imputing information about Connie\u2019s recent past performance to Braseth and Corwin), as the compa-mes had neither recent relevant past performance nor any history of negative past performance, Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-22, 29, 32; Corwin Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-23, 29, 33;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u2022 That USFS improperly faded to consult \u25a0 the government\u2019s Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or its Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) when evaluating the companies\u2019 past performance, Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; Corwin Compl. \u00b6 31-33;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u2022 That USFS\u2019s use of an adjectival rating system to evaluate past performance was improper because the solicitation did not specify how past performance would be evaluated, Braseth Compl. 33-35; Cor-win Compl. 34-36;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">\u2022 That USFS improperly failed to give Braseth or Corwin the opportunity to respond to their negative past performance evaluations, Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-38, 40, 43; Corwin Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, 41, 45;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">\u2022 That USFS lacked a sufficient factual basis to assign the companies a past performance rating of \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-42; Corwin Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">\u2022 That USFS scored their quotations less favorably than it should have because of the incorrect past performance evaluation, Braseth Compl. 45-49; ' Corwin Compl. 46-50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In addition to their allegations of error related to USFS\u2019s evaluation of past performance, Braseth and Corwin also alleged that USFS did not evaluate the offerors\u2019 prices using the method specified in the solicitation. Braseth Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-51; Corwin Compl.- \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. Thus, they contended, USFS\u2019s final ranking of the offerors was improper because it relied on both flawed past performance rankings and an improper price evaluation. Braseth Compl. 52-53; Corwin Compl. 53-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Finally, the companies alleged that USFS breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by improperly evaluating their past performance and by refusing to acknowledge or respond to their statements regarding that improper evaluation. Braseth Compl. \u00b6 54; Corwin Compl. \u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Court consolidated the cases on August 11, 2015. <em>See </em>Order, No. 15-cv-844, ECF No, 7. Following a status conference, the government filed the administrative record on August 13, 2015. No. 15-cv-837, ECF No. 10. On August 31, Braseth and Corwin filed a combined Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record. ECF No. 14. In it, the companies\u2019 pressed their claims regarding USFS\u2019s failure to properly evaluate their past performance. However, they made no arguments regarding their claims that USFS improperly evaluated their quoted prices, or that the agency breached the implied duty of good faith and fair deal-. ing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The United States then filed a Motion to Dismiss and Cross-Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record on September 16.

Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">A. <em>Bid Protest Jurisdiction and Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 bid protest jurisdiction is defined by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1), which grants the Court jurisdiction to \u201crender judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to ... a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d Thus, only an \u201cinterested party\u201d has standing to invoke the Court\u2019s bid protest jurisdiction. <em>CGI Fed. Inc. v. United States, </em>779 F.3d 1346, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2015); <em>Myers Investigative and Sec. Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>275 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201c[Standing is a threshold jurisdictional issue.\u201d). According to the Federal Circuit, an \u201cinterested party\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) is \u201can actual or prospective bid der ... whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract.\u201d <em>CGI Fed., </em>779 F.3d at 1348 (quoting <em>Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO v. United States, </em>258 F.3d 1294, 1299 (Fed.Cir. 2001)); <em>see also Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>316 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2003). In a post-award bid protest, the protester does not have a \u201cdirect econom ic interest\u201d unless it had a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of winning the award \u201cbut for the alleged error in the procurement process.\u201d <em>Tinton Falls Lodging Realty, LLC v. United States, </em>800 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2015); <em>see also Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2005). That is to say, the protestor\u2019s chance of securing the award \u201cmust not have been insubstantial,\u201d <em>Info. Tech., </em>316 F.3d at 1319; or, put differently, the protester must have been \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the alleged error, <em>Tinton Falls, </em>800 F.3d at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">When determining whether the protester has standing, the Court \u201cmust accept the well-pled allegations of agency error to be true.\u201d <em>USfalcon, Inc. v. United States</em>92 Fed.Cl. 436, 450 (2010) (citing <em>Info Tech, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>316 F.3d at 1319).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And the protester \u201cis not required to show that but for the alleged error, the protester <em>would </em>have been awarded the contract.\u201d <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1996) (emphasis added). Rather, standing exists if there was a \u201creasonable likelihood that the protester would have been awarded the contract\u201d but for the alleged error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review in Bid Protest Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The Court reviews challenges to a contract award under the standards for evaluating agency actions set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4). Accordingly, to successfully challenge an agency\u2019s procurement decision, a plaintiff must show that the agency\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see also Bannum, Inc., </em>404 F.3d at 1351. To meet this standard in a bid protest, the protester must demonstrate either that \u201cthe procurement official\u2019s decision lacked a rational basis\u201d or that \u201cthe procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.\u201d <em>Centech Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>554 F.3d 1029, 1037 (Fed.Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This standard is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d <em>Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1058 (Fed.Cir.2000), and the protester \u201cbears a heavy burden\u201d in attempting to challenge the procuring agency\u2019s decision, <em>Impresa Construzioni, </em>238 F.3d at 1338. Moreover, \u201c[t]he protestor\u2019s burden is greater in [a] negotiated procurement, as here, than in other types of bid protests because \u2018the contracting officer is entrusted with a relatively high degree of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glenn Defense Marine (ASIA), PTE Ltd. v. United States, </em>720 F.3d 901, 907 (Fed.Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Galen Med. Assocs., Inc. v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 1324, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Accordingly, the court must determine only \u201cwhether \u2018the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Impresa Construzioni, </em>238 F.3d at 1332-33 (quoting <em>Saratoga Dev. Corp. v. United States, </em>21 F.3d 445, 456 (D.C.Cir.1994)). Even if the agency\u2019s explanation is \u201cof less than ideal clarity,\u201d the court will uphold the decision if \u201cthe agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (quoting <em>Bournum Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">C. <em>Standard for Judgment on the Administrative Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Pursuant to Rules of the Court of Federal Claims 52.1, the Court reviews an agency\u2019s procurement decision based on the administrative record. <em>Bannum, Inc., </em>404 F.3d at 1354. The Court makes \u201cfactual findings ... from the record evidence as if it were conducting a trial on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357. Thus, \u201cresolution of a motion respecting the administrative record is akin to an expedited trial on the paper record, and the Court must make fact findings where necessary.\u201d <em>Baird v. United States, </em>77 Fed. Cl. 114, 116 (2007). The court\u2019s inquiry is \u201cwhether, given all the disputed and undisputed facts, a party has met its burden of proof based on the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>A &amp; D Fire Prot., Inc. v. United States, </em>72 Fed.Cl. 126, 131 (2006). Unlike a summary judgment proceeding, genuine issues of material fact will not foreclose judgment on the administrative record. <em>Bannum, Inc., </em>404 F.3d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">II. Application of Standards</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1j\">A. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">The Court concludes that Braseth has standing to protest USFS\u2019s decision, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that Corwin does not. As described above, to determine standing, the Court must accept as true the alleged errors in the procurement process \u2014 here, that the CO\u2019s decision was internally inconsistent and, to the extent the CO imputed Connie\u2019s past performance issues to Braseth and Corwin, that his decision to do so was improper. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mot. for J. on the Admin. R. (Pls.\u2019 Mot.) at 10-11, 18-19, ECF No. 14; Pls.\u2019 Resp. To Def.\u2019s Cross-Mot. for J, on the Admin. \u25a0 R. at 7-8, ECF No. 16-1. Because of these errors, Braseth and Corwin contend, the CO treated their quotations as differing from Connie\u2019s only in price. Pis.\u2019 Mot. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">As the CO acknowledged, neither Braseth nor Corwin had relevant past performance of their own within three years of the contract award. AR Tab 12 at 70; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Mot at 20 (conceding that neither company had \u201crelevant and recent past performance information with the Forest Service\u201d). And under FAR 15,305(a)(2)(iv), \u201c[i]n the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance ... the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\u201d Thus, accepting as true Braseth and Corwin\u2019s allegations of error, the CO should have treated Braseth and Corwin\u2019s quotations as differing from Connie\u2019s in both price <em>and </em>past performance \u2014 that is, in addition to comparing prices, he should have assessed whether the risks associated with dealing with an entity with no performance record at all (Braseth or Corwin) outweighed the benefits of choosing one that could be rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d -but still had known weaknesses (Connie\u2019s). <em>See Metcalf Const. Co. v. United States, </em>53 Fed.Cl. 617, 641 (2002) (\u201cOnce all the bidders have the same adjectival rating, in order to reasonably and rationally rank them, the [CO] must go beneath those ratings to show specifically where it finds advantages in one ... offer over another ... offer, notwithstanding the sameness of the ratings.\u201d); John Cibinic, Jr. et al., <em>Formation of Gov\u2019t Contracts </em>856-58 (4th ed. 2011) (discussing evaluation of offer-ors with no relevant past performance). The Court concludes that, had he done so, Bra-seth\u2019s chances of being selected over Connie\u2019s were not \u201cinsubstantial.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The government\u2019s argument to the contrary \u2014 that Braseth and Corwin had no substantial chance because they would have received the same \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating even if the CO had not imputed Connie\u2019s past performance to them \u2014 is unavailing, for \u201cproposals awarded the same adjectival ratings are not necessarily equal in quality.\u201d <em>Blackwater Lodge &amp; Training Ctr., Inc. v. United States, </em>86 Fed.Cl. 488, 514 (2009). Indeed, adjectival ratings are simply \u201cuseful as guides to decision-making\u201d and are not intended to be outcome-determinative. <em>See Redstone Tech. Servs., </em>B-259222, 1995 WL 153633, at *6 (Comp.Gen. Mar. 17, 1995) (rejecting a CO\u2019s \u201cmechanical\u201d application of adjectival ratings). Thus, even if \u201csatisfactory\u201d was the only available adjectival rating to describe \u201cneutral\u201d past performance, the CO could properly \u201clook beneath\u201d the rating to understand why the offeror was given the rating and, more importantly, to assess how those reasons might affect the offeror\u2019s performance of the contract. <em>Metcalf Const., 53 </em>Fed.Cl. at 640-41; <em>see also Blackwater Lodge, </em>86 Fed.Cl. at 514. Thus, Braseth or Corwin might still have had a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of securing the award even though they had the same adjectival past performance rating as Connie\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Corwin, however, faces an additional hurdle: as the Federal Circuit has made clear, if \u201cbids materially differ only as to price ... only the second-lowest bidder has a direct economic interest in the award of the contract.\u201d <em>United States v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machines Corp., </em>892 F.2d 1006, 1011 (Fed. Cir.1989). Even accepting Braseth and Cor-win\u2019s allegations of error as true, Corwin\u2019s quote was equivalent to Braseth\u2019s in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>past performance, and its quoted prices were higher. <em>See </em>AR Tab 12 at 72. Therefore, Corwin has no direct economic interest at stake, for both Braseth and Corwin could only compete for the award that eventually went to Connie\u2019s. Corwin thus does not have standing to protest the award, and the Court lacks jurisdiction over its claims. Accordingly, Corwin\u2019s complaint must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">B. <em>The Merits of Braseth\u2019s Bid Protest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Based on its review of the administrative record, the Court concludes that it is not possible to determine whether the CO\u2019s decision to make an award to Connie\u2019s rather than Braseth represented a reasonable exercise of his discretion. Most notably, the CO did not supply a consistent rationale regarding how Braseth\u2019s past performance (or lack thereof) affected his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Thus, as recounted above, at one point in the negotiation memorandum the CO stated that Braseth \u201clacked recent past performance with the agency,\u201d noting too that, under PAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), \u201can offeror without a record of relevant past performance ... may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.\u201d AR Tab 12 at 70. Yet later in the memorandum, when conducting the trade-off analysis required by PAR \u2022 15.308, the CO stated both that Braseth was \u201cconsidered a new company without a recent record of past performance\u201d and that there were \u201c[identical concerns as Connie\u2019s\u201d \u2014 i.e., concerns about past performance. <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">These contradictory statements within the award decision itself simply cannot be reconciled. It is not logically possible to treat Braseth in a neutral fashion, as a new company without a record of past performance, and also to impute to it concerns about Connie\u2019s past performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Further, the remaining documents in the administrative record only deepen the confusion. For instance, the \u201cperformance document\u201d -written by the cache manager mainly describes issues with Connie\u2019s past performance; but the document\u2019s cover email also states that she \u201ccan deal with <em>him </em>having 2 of the contracts,\u201d indicating that the concerns about Connie\u2019s past performance apply equally to Braseth. AR Tab 11 at 66-66.1 (emphasis added). And in Braseth\u2019s debriefing letter, the CO clearly ascribes Connie\u2019s past performance to Braseth (albeit without explicitly stating that he was doing so), asserting that \u201c[y]our past performance was considered satisfactory overall, but several issues were noted during the evaluation including: late arrival at the cache, trailers arriving with pallets/dunnage that had to be sent back, and delays with submitting your invoices.\u201d AR Tab 18 at 180. This statement (which the Court observes is a post hoc explanation of the decision to select Connie\u2019s and therefore entitled to less weight) appears to flatly contradict the portion of the negotiation memorandum stating that Braseth would not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably based on its past performance because it \u201clacked recent past performance with the agency.\u201d <em>See </em>AR Tab 12 at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Beyond this internal incoherence, it is clear to the Court that, to the extent that the CO intended to treat Braseth as \u201can offeror without a record of relevant past performance [who] may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance,\u201d ascribing Connie\u2019s past performance \u201cissues\u201d to Bra-seth (as the debriefing memorandum clearly did) would have been arbitrary and capricious. There is simply no rational way to frame the attribution of performance weaknesses to Braseth as anything other than a relatively \u201cunfavorable\u201d evaluation of its performance, even if the adjectival rating it was ultimately assigned for past performance was \u201csatisfactory.\u201d The government\u2019s contrary argument \u2014 that such an evaluation was not \u201cunfavorable\u201d in this case because it resulted in a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating, which was considered \u201cneutral\u201d \u2014 is circular and unconvincing. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 30-31; Def.\u2019s Reply in Supp. of its Mot. to Dismiss and Cross-Mot. for J. upon the Admin. R. at 14, EOF No. 19. As discussed above, adjectival ratings serve as a means to an end, not an end in and of themselves. <em>See Metcalf Const., </em>53 Fed.Cl. at 640-41. If the CO in this ease did in fact ascribe Connie\u2019s performance weaknesses to Braseth, then he did not treat Braseth in a neutral fashion (i.e., as though it had no past performance history at all), even if he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>both Connie\u2019s and Braseth the same adjectival rating.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">To be clear, the Court is not suggesting that the CO would have been <em>required </em>to select Braseth over Connie\u2019s if he compared the former\u2019s lack of a performance history against Connie\u2019s identified weaknesses. For example, the CO might reasonably have decided that Connie\u2019s identified weaknesses were not significant enough to justify paying the slightly higher price quoted by Braseth. Or, he might have determined that it would be best to go with a known entity, rather than one with no relevant performance history. But either way, the CO must provide an explanation for his exercise of discretion that is coherent and not internally inconsistent so that the Court has a basis for reviewing its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Finally, because the actual basis for the CO\u2019s decision is not discernible from the administrative record, the Court does not at this time address Braseth\u2019s argument that the contracting officer\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it imputed Connie\u2019s past performance to Bra-seth (rather than treating Braseth as having no relevant past performance).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, because the administrative record does not make it clear whether or not the CO intended to treat Braseth as an entity with no past performance history, the Court does not at this time address Braseth\u2019s arguments that USFS was required to consult PPIRS or CPARS when evaluating its past performance or that it violated the FAR by failing to give Braseth the opportunity to respond to its .negative past performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In summary: the CO\u2019s explanation for choosing Connie\u2019s over Braseth lacks sufficient clarity to permit this Court to exercise its review function. Accordingly, the Court will remand the matter back to the agency for it to provide a coherent explanation for its decision consistent with the concerns expressed in this opinion. <em>See PlanetSpace, Inc. v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 520, 549 (2010) (\u201c[I]f the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d (quoting <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, </em>470 U.S. 729, 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 84 L.Ed.2d 643 (1985))). The Court will further stay resolution of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record, pending receipt of such explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">For the reasons stated above, the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Corwin but DENIED as to Braseth.

Accordingly, that quotation is not included in the administrative record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-23\">.The Court notes several apparent errors in a table found in the government\u2019s undated abstract of offers. AR Tab 10 at 62. These errors make Braseth\u2019s quotation appear to be slightly more expensive than Corwin\u2019s, and make Smith Bros.\u2019 appear more expensive than A-Secured\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>However, the table in the Government's negotiation memorandum (AR Tab 12 at 72) contains accurate numbers, and the Court will rely on those numbers throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\">. The TPEC initially assigned Braseth, Connie\u2019s, and Corwin a \u201cG\u201d rating for proximity; but after reviewing the rationale for the ratings, the contracting officer raised them to \"E\u201d as all three were located within ten miles of the cache. <em>See </em>ARTab 12 at 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">. Unlike the negotiation memorandum, the debriefing letters did not state that Braseth and Corwin were considered \"new companies] without a recent record of past performance.\u201d <em>See </em>ARTab 12 at 70, 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. Accordingly, these claims have been waived, and are not discussed further below. <em>See Brooks Range Contract Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>101 Fed.Cl. 699, 708 (2011) (\"[A] party waives issues not raised in its opening brief.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. If standing exists, the question of prejudice may arise again if the court determines on the merits that the agency has, in fact, erred as alleged. <em>See, e.g., Line Gov\u2019t Servs., LLC v. United States, 96 </em>Fed.Cl. 672, 695 (2010) (discussing the difference between \"allegational prejudice\u201d for purposes of standing and \u201cAPA prejudice\u201d for purposes of the court\u2019s determination on the merits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b520-5\">. Even accepting Braseth\u2019s and Corwin\u2019s allegations as true, the Court concludes that neither company had a substantial chance of receiving the awards given to A-Secured and Smith Bros., which both received past performance ratings of \"Excellent.\" <em>See </em>AR Tab 12 at 69. As mentioned above, the CO described the variance in pricing among all the quotations as \"very tight,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 74, and nothing in the record leads the Court to believe, given the tight variance, that there was a substantial chance that the CO might have chosen a company with no relevant past performance over a company with an excellent past performance rating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\">. In that regard, the record does not support the government\u2019s argument that the CO based Bra-seth\u2019s satisfactory rating on \"alternative bas[es]\u201d: one grounded in the attribution of Connie's performance to Braseth and another under which Braseth received a truly \"neutral\u201d evaluation based on its lack of any relevant performance history. <em>See </em>Pls.' Mot. at 13-14. Thus, if the contracting officer intended to rely on alternative grounds, he would have conducted two different trade-off analyses. The first analysis would have been one which treated Connie's and Braseth as completely indistinguishable in terms of their past performance, and which would have awarded the contract to Connie\u2019s because of its lower price. The second analysis would have compared the pluses and minuses of choosing a competitor with some demonstrated performance weaknesses and a lower price (Connie's) to the pluses and minuses of choosing a competitor with a slightly higher price and without any performance history, positive or negative (Bra-seth). Nor may the Court fill the gap left by the CO and thereby determine that the CO made \"alternative\u201d choices. <em>See Bowman, </em>419 U.S. at 285-86, 95 S.Ct. 438 (1974) (holding that a court \"may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given\"); <em>OMV Med., Inc. v. United States, </em>219 F.3d 1337, 1344 (Fed.Cir.2000) (applying the <em>Bowman </em>rule in a bid protest).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\">. The Court notes, however, that FAR 15.305(a)(2)(h) permits the government to \u201ceval-uat[e] the offerorfs] past performance\u201d based on information obtained not only from the offeror, but also from \"any other sources\u201d at its disposal; and it expressly commits the determination of \"the relevance of similar past performance information\u201d to the CO. Moreover, the regulations state that the CO \"should take into account\" past performance information regarding \"predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement\u201d as long as that information \"is relevant to the instant acquisition.\u201d FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
