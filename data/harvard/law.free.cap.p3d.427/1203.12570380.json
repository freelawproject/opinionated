Witness One drank three beers, Witness Two drank one cocktail, and Witness Three drank one beer and one cocktail. At one point, the friends stepped into an alley behind the bar to smoke a cigarette. Although it was dark outside, there was ambient lighting in the alley from a nearby lamppost and a few \"parking lights.\" The alley was designed so that vehicles had to enter and leave by the same route, and there were no surveillance cameras in the alley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Approximately ten minutes after the friends went outside, an \"older, four-door, ... dark-green Honda\" with tinted windows drove into the alley and made a U-turn. The driver and the person in the passenger seat were both females. The driver stopped the car approximately thirty feet from the friends, angling the car toward the alley's exit. Two men then got out of the back seat of the car and started to approach the friends. As they approached, one of the men asked the friends, \"Does this place ID?\" Witness One responded, \"Yes, it's a bar. They will ID.\" One of the men (Robber One) stopped approximately three to five feet from Witnesses One and Two. The second man (Robber Two) stopped less than two feet from Witness Three, who was separated from Witnesses One and Two by a \"big, metal thing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Both robbers pulled out guns and told the friends to \"[g]ive us all your shit.\" Witnesses One and Two remembered Robber One's gun as having a long barrel-approximately eight to ten inches long. Witness One stepped slightly in front of Witness Two to stop Robber One from getting any closer to Witness Two. Witness One gave Robber One his wallet and cell phone, and Witness Two gave Robber One her purse. Witness Three gave Robber Two a small amount of cash. During this time, Robber One did not point his gun at Witnesses One or Two, instead keeping it by his side. The robbers then returned to the car, dropping Witness One's cell phone in the alley on the way. Once the robbers were in the back seat of the car, the female driver \"sped\" out of the alley. The whole event lasted approximately two to three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Shortly thereafter, Witness One called 911. When the responding officer arrived, he took a description of Robber One from Witnesses One and Two; Witness Three had already left the scene. Witness One described Robber One as a twenty-nine-year-old Hispanic male, with a \"thin build,\" weighing 160 pounds, with a shaved head and no facial hair. He stated that Robber One was heavily tattooed, with tattoos on his arms, legs, neck, and face. Witness One specifically reported that Robber One had a teardrop tattoo on his face. Witness One stated that the robbers left in a two-door car with tinted windows and that the car was occupied by two females and two males. Witness Two reported that the car had four doors. A detective took over the case the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Three days later, a different detective was looking for Defendant on an unrelated matter. The relevant car in that matter was a 1997 green Honda Accord. The detective located the car and later observed Defendant driving it with a female passenger. When the detective investigating the alley robberies heard about Defendant and the car, he suspected that Defendant might have participated in the alley robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The investigating detective put together a photo lineup, using a photo of Defendant and five photos of other men with similar characteristics, including facial tattoos and no hair (or a shaved head). The photos were in color and were the same size. The investigating detective asked another detective to administer the photo lineup to Witnesses One and Two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Six days after the robberies, the other detective conducted a photo lineup with\n   Witness Two while she was at work. The detective explained the photo lineup procedure and told Witness Two that she should not feel obligated to pick anyone. The detective then showed the photos to Witness Two, and she identified Defendant as Robber One. When the detective asked about Witness Two's confidence level in her choice, she stated it was \"very high.\" Four days later, the same detective repeated the photo lineup procedure with Witness One at the police station. Witness One also picked Defendant's photo as the person who robbed them at gunpoint. He later testified that he was \"very confident\" in his identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Thereafter, the State charged Defendant with three counts of aggravated robbery, first degree felonies, with each count enhanced to \"an indeterminate prison term of not less than five years in addition to the statutory minimum prison term for the offense, and which may be for life\" under the Group Crime Enhancement provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-3-203.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-3-203.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(e) (LexisNexis 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, Witnesses One and Two both identified Defendant as Robber One and discussed their observations from the night of the robbery. Defendant's trial counsel focused on attacking the eyewitnesses' identifications of Defendant through cross-examination and in closing argument. He also presented evidence that, shortly after the robbery occurred, Defendant's picture \"was blasted all over the news online, on TV, [and] in print\" in connection with an unrelated matter. Trial counsel suggested to the jury that the eyewitnesses \"made the mistake of subconsciously seeing that information, and they recognized that face from online, and that's why they picked [Defendant] ... out of the lineups.\" The jury was also given an instruction advising them about various factors that affect the reliability of eyewitness identifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Defendant contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to challenge the admissibility of the eyewitnesses' identifications of him. \"An ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant concedes that he did not preserve these arguments, and he seeks review under the plain-error and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel exceptions to the preservation requirement. A \"trial court plainly errs if it submits the case to the jury and thus fails to discharge a defendant when the insufficiency of the evidence is apparent to the court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Witness One was \"face-to-face three feet away\" from Robber One, and Witness Two was \"four to five feet away\" from Robber One. Witness Two clarified that even though Witness One had stepped between her and Robber One, Witness One was not directly in front of her and she could still \"see [Robber One's] full body.\" Robber One's face was not obstructed during the crime. Although the robberies occurred outside at night, the eyewitnesses testified that the alley was \"not pitch black\"-there was \"some ambient light\" from lampposts and a \"few ... parking lights.\" Witness One testified that \"even though it was a little bit dark in the alley, [he] could see tattoos on [Robber One's] face just fine.\" He further stated that \"[t]here was enough light\" for him to see the color, make, and model of the getaway car, and he could see that the car's windows were tinted. These facts indicate that the eyewitnesses had an adequate opportunity to view Robber One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B. Degree of Attention\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 The second factor contemplates \"the witness's degree of attention to the actor at the time of the event.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n    at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). The record indicates that the eyewitnesses first began paying attention to the robbers when the robbers exited the car and started to approach them. Witness One testified that the robbers started talking to the eyewitnesses from about thirty feet away and that he thought the robbers' question about whether the bar checked IDs \"was a really strange question.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b63. As the robbers continued their approach, \"they were trying to ... make small talk\" with the eyewitnesses, and Witness One became \"more on alert and concern[ed]\" as the robbers got closer. Witnesses One and Two testified that Robber One pulled out a gun and told them to \"[g]ive us all your shit\" or \"[g]ive me everything you've got.\" They both remembered the gun as having a long barrel. Witnesses One and Two further testified that, during the robberies, Robber One held the gun \"in his right hand down by his side\" and \"didn't point it directly\" at them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Witness Two testified that she \"had been looking at [Robber One's] face\" until he pulled out the gun, at which point her focus shifted to the gun. But she also stated that she looked at Robber One's face again after he brought out the gun. Both eyewitnesses observed that as Witness One was reaching for his wallet, Robber One was \"getting a little flustered\" and was \"really nervous.\" Witness One further testified that although he had a \"sense of what was going on\" with Witness Three and Robber Two, he was \"focused on what was happening in front of [him]\" with Robber One. While the presence of the gun and Robber Two necessarily diverted some of the eyewitnesses' attention from Robber One, overall, the facts indicate\n   that Robber One was the focus of their attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C. Capacity to Observe\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 The third factor is \"whether the witness had the capacity to observe the actor during the event.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n    817 P.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, we think the eyewitnesses' fear in this case would be typical of any armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833822\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/954/225/#p228\">\n    954 P.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (Utah Ct.

And we agree with the State that \"nothing in the circumstances surrounding the robbery and nothing about the [eyewitnesses] themselves suggests that they suffered such a heightened degree of stress that it interfered with their capacity to observe and identify.\" Although Robber One had a gun, he kept it down by his side and never pointed it at the eyewitnesses. Moreover, the eyewitnesses were able to observe the robbers as they approached the eyewitnesses-before the guns came out and before the eyewitnesses had reason to be overly fearful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b627 There is no evidence that the eyewitnesses harbored any personal motivations, bias, or prejudice against Robber One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n    817 P.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding the eyewitnesses' vision, Witness One testified that he had 20/20 vision, and Witness Two testified that she was wearing her contacts on the night of the incident and was therefore able to see corrected to 20/20. Although there was no evidence of \"fatigue, injury, [or] drugs,\" both eyewitnesses had been drinking that night.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Witness One had consumed three beers, but he testified that he drank beer \"[f]airly regularly\" and was \"well enough aware of the situation to know what was going on.\" Witness Two testified that she had consumed one cocktail before the incident. On these facts, the eyewitnesses' alcohol use was not enough to seriously impair their capacity to observe Robber One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   D. Spontaneity, Consistency, and Suggestibility of the Identifications\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 The fourth factor is \"whether the witness's identification was made spontaneously and remained consistent thereafter or whether it was a product of suggestion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This factor includes consideration of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   the length of time that passed between the witness's observation at the time of the event and the identification of [the] defendant; the witness's mental capacity and state of mind at the time of the identification; the witness's exposure to opinions, descriptions, identifications, or other information from other sources; instances when the witness or other eyewitnesses to the event failed to identify [the] defendant; instances when the witness or other eyewitnesses gave a description of the actor that is inconsistent with [the] defendant; and the circumstances under which [the] defendant was presented to the witness for identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b629 Here, Witness Two identified Defendant in a photo lineup conducted at her workplace six days after the incident.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the record shows that Witness Two was stressed or that she had diminished mental capacity at the time she identified Defendant. The procedure was \"double-blind,\" meaning that the detective who administered the identification procedure did\n   not know which of the pictured men was the suspect. The detective showed Witness Two six color photos: one of Defendant and five of other men who shared Defendant's physical characteristics-no hair (or with very short hair) and facial tattoos. The photos were the same size and showed each person's head, face, and upper chest. Before administering the photo lineup, the detective explained to Witness Two that he would show her six photos, one at a time. The detective asked Witness Two to tell him if she saw the person who robbed her, but he explained that he \"would continue to show her the rest of the photos\" even if she did identify someone. The detective urged Witness Two to focus on physical characteristics that did not change, such as \"eyes, cheek bones, nose, [and] ears.\" He also explained to Witness Two that she was not obligated to pick anyone from the photo lineup and that the investigation would continue if she did not pick anyone. Witness Two picked Defendant's photo. The detective asked her if she was sure, and Witness Two stated that she was \"not a hundred percent sure, but it's very high.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b630 Four days later, i.e., ten days after the crime, the same detective repeated the same procedure with Witness One at the police station. Similar to Witness Two, nothing in the record demonstrates that Witness One had diminished mental capacity at the time of the identification. The detective followed the same format he used with Witness Two, but he showed Witness One the photos in a different order. Witness One picked Defendant's photo. He testified at trial that he \"was very confident\" in his selection. Overall, these facts demonstrate that the identifications were not the product of a suggestive photo lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 Nevertheless, Defendant asserts that Witnesses One and Two had \"opportunities to see Defendant's picture\" on the news before looking at the photo lineup and that the eyewitnesses' identifications of Defendant were \"the product of suggestion.\" Specifically, Defendant observes that in September 2012, his photo was \"displayed on various online, print, and television news stories\" regarding an unrelated matter. According to Defendant, these opportunities to view his picture \"likely influenced\" the eyewitnesses' identifications during the photo lineups. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b632 The record indicates that in September 2012, a picture of Defendant appeared in various print, online, and television news stories on an unrelated matter. However, both eyewitnesses testified that they had not seen any news reports whatsoever containing Defendant's picture before the photo lineups. Witness Two testified that although she worked at a restaurant that had televisions, the restaurant \"[n]ever [showed] the news, just sporting events.\" She further testified that she does not watch the news or look at the news online, including social media. She stated that she was \"not interested\" and that the news is \"just very negative.\" When specifically asked if she remembered seeing any news stories on September 11, 2012, about a man with facial tattoos \"being apprehended by the Salt Lake City Police Department,\" Witness Two replied, \"No.\" Witness One testified that he had seen Defendant's picture in the news, but only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the photo lineup. On this record, Defendant's assertion that the eyewitnesses' identifications were the product of suggestion is entirely speculative and does not undermine the reliability of the eyewitnesses' photo identifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 Defendant also asserts that \"the eyewitnesses' initial description of the robbers ... did not accurately identify [him]\" and that this discrepancy is best explained by \"the impact of [the eyewitnesses] seeing [his] picture on the news right after the robbery.\" Specifically, Defendant asserts that the eyewitnesses' height estimates did not match his height of 5'7? and that Witness One told the responding officer that Robber One had a teardrop tattoo on his face, which tattoo Defendant does not have. Again, we are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634 We agree with the State that, \"[w]hile none of the witnesses accurately guessed the robber's exact height, their estimates fit [Defendant].\" Witness Two, who is 5'6?, told officers at the photo lineup that Robber One was around 5'8? or 5'9?. Witness One, who is 5'10?, stated that Robber One was \"a little bit shorter\" than he is and that he \"could see over the top of [Robber One's] head.\" These descriptions of Robber One's height relative to that of Witnesses One and Two are generally\n   consistent with Defendant's height of 5'7?. Defendant expressly points to Witness Three's statement, which was given to a detective over the phone, that \"one of the robbers [was] 5'10? and the other suspect [was] 5'2?.\" But Witness Three was approximately ten feet away from Robber One during the crimes, and Witness Three testified at trial that he could not give an accurate description of Robber One. In any event, we ultimately agree with the State that \"the accuracy of Witness Three's estimate has no bearing on the accuracy of [Witnesses One and Two's] descriptions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 Defendant also observes that Witness One told a responding officer that Robber One had a teardrop tattoo on his face. Defendant does not have a teardrop tattoo on his face, but he does have a tattoo under the outside corner of his left eye that the State characterizes as \"an arrow pointing upwards.\" We agree with the State that, \"in the lighting described by the witnesses, the mark could readily be mistaken for a teardrop.\" Moreover, the \"teardrop\" tattoo was only part of the basis for Witnesses One's identification of Defendant. Indeed, despite the discrepancy regarding the \"teardrop\" tattoo, Witness One's initial description of Robber One, while not overly detailed, was otherwise generally consistent with Defendant's appearance-male, Hispanic, thin build, approximately 160 pounds, shaved head, no facial hair, and \"heavily tattooed\" on his arms, legs, neck, and face. Under the totality of the circumstances, the relatively minor inconsistency in Witness One's description of Robber One does not render his entire identification unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   E. The Nature of the Event\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 The fifth and final factor considers \"the nature of the event being observed and the likelihood that the witness would perceive, remember and relate it correctly.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n    817 P.2d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Considerations under this factor include \"whether the event was an ordinary one in the mind of the observer during the time it was observed, and whether the race of the actor was the same as the observer's.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12049871\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/817/774/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified). Here, the eyewitnesses described the robber as \"Hispanic\"; however, nothing in the record indicates the eyewitnesses' race, and Defendant does not address this consideration on appeal. The record indicates that while the eyewitnesses did not initially recognize the situation as a robbery, the eyewitnesses were nonetheless paying attention to, and interacting with, the robbers as they approached the eyewitnesses. Once Robber One brandished his gun and demanded that Witnesses One and Two \"[g]ive us all your shit,\" there can be little doubt that the eyewitnesses were aware that a robbery was occurring. The lighting conditions in the alley allowed the eyewitnesses to view Robber One's unobstructed face, relative height, multitude of tattoos, and gun. Overall, these circumstances \"tended to focus\" the eyewitnesses' attention on what was occurring and suggest that the eyewitnesses were likely to perceive, remember, and relate the robbery correctly to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Upon entering the alley, the unidentified female made a U-turn and positioned the car so that it was facing the alley's only exit, reasonably suggesting that she anticipated the need to leave the alley quickly and, by extension, that she knew of the robberies in advance. The car's proximity to the robberies and the presence of ambient lighting in the alley support an inference that the unidentified female was aware of the ongoing criminal activity. She made no attempt to leave the car or the alley during the robberies, reasonably suggesting that she was waiting for the robbers to return. And indeed, she did wait for the robbers to return, at which point she \"sped\" out of the alley, helping the robbers to flee from the crime scene.
