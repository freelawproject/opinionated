A member of the group hit Victim on the side of the head with a beer mug and pushed her over a table. Victim may have blacked out as she was kicked on the ground. A security video showed Gallegos eventually being pulled from the brawl. Victim sustained a broken nose, broken toe, a torn ear, and scrapes and bruises. The State charged Gallegos for her involvement in the beating, and a jury convicted her as an accomplice to assault. Gallegos appeals, contending that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support her conviction and that the conviction should be reversed for prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Gallegos and a group of her friends were at a dance club celebrating Gallegos's birthday. Victim happened to be at the same club that evening. As Victim and her friend exited the restroom, the door swung open and bumped one of Gallegos's friends. A member of Gallegos's party warned Victim's friend to \"watch yourself.\" Victim's friend apologized, but Gallegos's friend repeated her warning. Victim interjected,\n   and Gallegos and her friends began to focus their aggression on her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Gallegos and three other women stood up and formed a semicircle around Victim. They shouted profanities at Victim, who testified that she felt threatened by the group's verbal attacks. Gallegos's friend eventually shoved Victim, and Victim retaliated with a punch. A security video shows the group, including Gallegos, converging on Victim, advancing forward, and forcing Victim backward several feet toward a wall. One of the women hit Victim on the side of the head with a beer mug. Victim was eventually thrown over a table and toppled to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The women kicked and hit Victim and pulled her hair while she lay on the ground in a fetal position. Others joined the fight, but Victim could not see anyone's face because of her position. Victim testified that she \"might have lost consciousness\" during the brawl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Security personnel eventually broke up the fight. The security video shows Gallegos being yanked from the fray. Victim was treated for a broken nose, a torn ear, and many scrapes and bruises. Three years after the attack, Victim still reported difficulty breathing as a result of her broken nose and doctors have recommended nasal surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After the beating, Victim identified Gallegos as \"one of the girls.\" Victim's friend and other club patrons also identified Gallegos as one of the people involved in the skirmish. Police detained Gallegos at the scene and the State eventually charged her with assault, which was enhanced to a third degree felony for having acted \"in concert with two or more persons.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-3-203.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-3-203.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a) (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 At trial, Gallegos moved for a directed verdict. She argued, \"The State did not make a prima facie case that [she] assaulted the victim\" and that \"there's been no evidence that her activity led to the substantial bodily injury, or that there was any meeting of the minds, no testimony of people saying jump her, no party liability to attach- that to.\" The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Also at trial, the defense called Gallegos's friend (Witness), who was present during the altercation, to testify. Witness testified that she believed Gallegos jumped in to break up the fight rather than to assault Victim. However, Witness testified that Gallegos was hit in the face and eventually began throwing punches. Witness testified that the fight did not seem to be directed at a particular person, but rather was \"all amongst themselves. ... just arms flying and hitting whoever was the closest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Finally, during rebuttal on closing argument, the State explained accomplice liability and argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   This is the same theory applied at a robbery. The getaway driver is just as guilty as the person who's inside. They may treat it differently in sentencing, but again you guys don't worry about sentencing. All you guys are there to determine is whether ... she's guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State also offered during closing argument,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This is, like I said, just a gang beating. In my opinion, not in a street gang sense of the term, but they are ganging up on her and attack her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gallegos did not object to either statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The jury returned a guilty verdict. Gallegos appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Gallegos raises two issues on appeal. First, she contends that the State presented insufficient evidence to support her assault conviction, and particularly that the evidence does not support that Gallegos \"acted as an accomplice to the assault by 'intentionally aid[ing]' the principal actor in its commission.\" \"We will reverse a jury conviction for insufficient evidence only when the evidence is sufficiently inconclusive or inherently improbable that reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of which [she] was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Shumway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368589\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/63/94/\">\n    2002 UT 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9368589\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/63/94/\">\n    63 P.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Second, Gallegos contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during the State's closing rebuttal argument. Gallegos concedes that this challenge is unpreserved,\n   and thus asks that we review it for plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel. \"The plain error standard of review requires an appellant to show the existence of a harmful error that should have been obvious to the district court. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ringstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2066\">\n    2018 UT App 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569376\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/1052/\">\n    424 P.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 We first address the State's threshold argument that Gallegos's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was unpreserved. After reviewing the record we are satisfied that Gallegos's contention was adequately preserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 An issue is preserved if it is \"presented to the trial court in such a way that the trial court has an opportunity to rule on that issue.\"\n   <em>\n    438 Main St. v. Easy Heat, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152843\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/99/801/\">\n    2004 UT 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152843\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/99/801/\">\n    99 P.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). \"For a trial court to be afforded an opportunity to correct the error (1) the issue must be raised in a timely fashion, (2) the issue must be specifically raised, and (3) the challenging party must introduce supporting evidence or relevant legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152843\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/99/801/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up). \"Further, where a motion for a directed verdict makes general assertions but fails to assert the specific argument raised on appeal, the directed verdict motion itself is insufficient to preserve the more specific argument for appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bosquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984012\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/275/1032/\">\n    2012 UT App 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984012\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/275/1032/\">\n    275 P.3d 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Patrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997028\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/217/1150/\">\n    2009 UT App 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997028\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/217/1150/\">\n    217 P.3d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a specific defense of habitation argument was not preserved by argument on a separate claim of self-defense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Here, Gallegos \"moved to dismiss,\" saying \"the State did not make a prima facie case that defendant assaulted the victim\" and \"there's been no evidence that her activity led to the substantial bodily injury, or that there was any meeting of the minds, no testimony of people saying jump her, no party liability to attach that to.\" On appeal she rephrases her argument, contending that the evidence does not support the finding that her activities \"amounted to intentionally aiding in the commission of the assault that caused [Victim] to suffer substantial bodily injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 First, there is no question that Gallegos made a timely directed verdict motion. Second, we are satisfied that the issue was specifically raised. On the surface, Gallegos's argument on appeal appears to shift its focus to challenge the State's evidence regarding intent. However, Gallegos's motion and arguments below are not so tangential that they do not mirror the specific arguments on appeal. Though worded differently and cursorily, the argument below was that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to meet the elements of the offense, and particularly that there was no \"meeting of the minds.\" The same is being argued here with more flesh on the bone. Third, we are also satisfied that Gallegos adequately supported her motion with appropriate legal authority. Although Gallegos phrased her motion as a motion to dismiss, there is no question, in context, that she made a motion for a directed verdict based on the sufficiency of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Accordingly, we are satisfied that Gallegos preserved her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. We thus consider the challenge on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Gallegos contends that the evidence presented by the State at trial was insufficient to support her conviction as an accomplice to assault. She argues that the evidence at trial could not establish that she \"intentionally aided in the commission of the assault.\" Because there was an \"absence of direct evidence,\" she asserts that the jury could only reasonably infer her \"passive presence\" during the brawl, it being equally likely that her motive was to break up the fight as it was to join it. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 On appeal, Gallegos does not dispute that the trial evidence established that the underlying assault occurred. Nor does she challenge the group enhancement. We therefore examine only the law as it pertains to liability for accomplice to assault. \"Every\n   person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense who ... intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable as a party for such conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Because the statute governing assault does not include a prescribed mental state,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-102, the mental state applied to assault is \"intent, knowledge, or recklessness,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-2-102. Thus, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gallegos intentionally aided another in committing assault and that she intended, knew, or was reckless that her conduct would result in the commission of the assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Jeffs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991879\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/243/1250/\">\n    2010 UT 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 44-45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991879\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/243/1250/\">\n    243 P.3d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the mental state required for accomplice liability for a rape charge).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 Intent is subjective and thus is rarely established by direct evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Holgate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11224122\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/10/346/\">\n    2000 UT 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11224122\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/10/346/\">\n    10 P.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It is well established that intent can be proven by circumstantial evidence. When intent is proven by circumstantial evidence, we must determine (1) whether the State presented any evidence that [the defendant] possessed the requisite intent, and (2) whether the inferences that can be drawn from that evidence have a basis in logic and reasonable human experience sufficient to prove that [the defendant] possessed the requisite intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence for the jury to reasonably infer that Gallegos acted with the requisite intent. The jury heard testimony that Gallegos joined her friends in forming a semicircle around Victim while shouting profanities at her. Victim testified that all of the women were \"aggressive\" towards her. The security video showed Gallegos and her friends advancing in unison toward Victim, forcing her backward several feet, and corralling her near a wall where Victim was eventually thrown over a table. Gallegos's friend testified that Gallegos began swinging her arms during the ensuing melee. The security video also showed security personnel throw Gallegos from the fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b622 This evidence does not show that Gallegos was merely present, as she claims. Gallegos relies on\n   <em>\n    In re M.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8216769\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/198/1007/\">\n    2008 UT App 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8216769\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/198/1007/\">\n    198 P.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant as an accomplice to burglary \"based on his mere passive presence in the passenger seat of the getaway car.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. In that case, a witness saw two men late one night, one climbing out of the back of her truck's camper shell and another exiting through the truck door while carrying a stereo and CDs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. When the two men returned to their car parked across the street, the dome light revealed a third man, the defendant, \"[j]ust sitting\" in the passenger seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendant was adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court for vehicle burglary and theft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Under those circumstances, this court reversed the defendant's adjudication, reasoning that the State had not presented evidence suggesting that the defendant \"actually behaved as a lookout or otherwise aided or encouraged the crimes of vehicular burglary and theft.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b623 The facts in this case are dissimilar. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    In re M.B.\n   </em>\n   , Gallegos was not just sitting at the club during the altercation. Instead, Gallegos helped form a semicircle around Victim and aggressively shouted profanities at her. Victim was pushed and then retaliated, at which point Gallegos and her group simultaneously advanced on Victim, forcing her back several feet and onto the ground. Gallegos threw punches during the brawl and had to be pulled away by security. The jury could reasonably infer that Gallegos was more than passively present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624 This court has made clear that, \"while mere presence at the scene of a crime affords no basis for a conviction, presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense are circumstances from which one's participation in the criminal intent may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    American Fork City v. Rothe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172876\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/12/108/\">\n    2000 UT App 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172876\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/12/108/\">\n    12 P.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). The evidence here supports an inference that Gallegos intentionally aided another in committing assault and intended, knew, or was reckless that her conduct would result in\n   commission of an assault by another. As explained, Gallegos acted aggressively toward Victim, advancing with the group while forcing Victim backward toward a wall. Gallegos's aggression continued as she swung her arms and was pulled away from the fight. The only evidence proffered supporting the theory that Gallegos attempted to break up the fight was the testimony of Witness. But the jury was not obligated to believe that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 In light of the evidence, we conclude that the jury could reasonably infer that Gallegos intended to aid in the assault of Victim. Therefore, the jury's verdict was supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 Gallegos next contends that her conviction should be reversed based on inappropriate comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument. Particularly, Gallegos argues that the State's reference to a \"gang beating\" and suggestion that an accomplice might be treated differently at sentencing improperly \"encouraged the jurors to consider matters outside the evidence.\" We disagree that the State's reference to a \"gang beating\" was improper. Although we agree with Gallegos that the State's reference to sentencing was improper, we disagree that it was so prejudicial that it warrants reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 Gallegos concedes that her prosecutorial-misconduct contention was not raised at trial. She therefore requests that we review her contention in the context of plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel. To establish plain error, Gallegos must demonstrate that an error exists, the error should have been obvious to the trial court, and the error is harmful.\n   <em>\n    State v. Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189643\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/95/276/\">\n    2004 UT 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189643\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/95/276/\">\n    95 P.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, when analyzing prosecutorial misconduct for plain error, we analyze not only whether the prosecutor's remarks were improper, i.e., whether an error exists, but also whether the prosecutor's remarks were \"so egregious that it would be plain error\n   <em>\n    for the district court\n   </em>\n   to decline to intervene\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State's Reference to a Street Gang\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 The State said the following during closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   This is, like I said, just a gang beating. In my opinion, not in a street gang sense of the term, but they are ganging up on her and attack her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b630 To be sure, no evidence was presented regarding street gangs. However, the facts of the case are that a group of women ganged up in a colloquial sense against Victim. Thus, the evidence presented at trial could be characterized as a gang or group beating. The State used the term \"street gang\" only to clarify that its use of the term \"gang beating\" was not meant to suggest that the crime was gang-related but instead referred only to the manner in which the group ganged up on Victim. Because the evidence supported a finding that the group \"ganged up\" on Victim, we conclude that the reference did not call attention to matters that the jurors would not be justified in considering. Therefore there was no error and this argument fails under plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B. The State's Reference to Sentencing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 The State's reference to possible differences in sentencing is another story. The State made the following reference to sentencing during its closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   This is the same theory applied at a robbery. The getaway driver is just as guilty as the person who's inside. They may treat it differently in sentencing, but again you guys don't worry about sentencing. All you guys are there to determine is whether ... she's guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b632 \"Possible punishment ... is usually not a proper matter for jury consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Cude\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10394348\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/784/1197/#p1202\">\n    784 P.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202-03 (Utah 1989). The State had no business bringing up sentencing at all; the reference added nothing to help jurors understand a hypothetical about a robber and a getaway driver or how those facts pertain to this case. And while the State reiterated the law, saying \"you guys don't worry about sentencing,\" the fact of the matter is that the remark \"call[ed] to the attention of the jurors matters which they would not be justified in considering in determining their verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude that even if the trial court erred by not intervening, and even if defense counsel was deficient for not objecting, Gallegos was not prejudiced because there is no reasonable likelihood that without the statement she would have received a more favorable outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ringstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2066\">\n    2018 UT App 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569376\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/1052/\">\n    424 P.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing prejudice without deciding whether an error occurred).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b634 We think it highly unlikely that, absent the comment, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome for Gallegos.

The State's comment about sentencing was a single sentence, which it recanted immediately after uttering it. Further, the court properly instructed the jury not to consider what punishment could result from\n   a guilty verdict, and \"we presume that the jury follows such instructions,\" absent evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    State v.
