On appeal, Sosa contends the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress because the police violated her Fourth Amendment rights by unreasonably extending a routine traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 A police officer (Sergeant) initiated a traffic stop after witnessing a vehicle's driver make an improper right turn. Sergeant approached the vehicle and asked the driver for her identification. While speaking with the driver, Sergeant recognized the passenger, Sosa, from a prior arrest for a weapons offense and asked if she had any weapons on her. She responded that she did not. Three minutes into the traffic stop, Sergeant took the driver's information back to his patrol vehicle and ran a records check. At the same time, he requested a police dog unit to assist him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 A second officer (Officer) arrived with his police dog within five minutes of the request-just eight minutes after Sergeant initiated the stop. Sergeant was still running the records check when Officer arrived, and at that point, Sergeant asked Officer to run his dog around the vehicle to sniff for controlled substances. The dog alerted to the presence of a controlled substance during the exterior sniff and alerted again on two items within the vehicle during the interior sniff. Officer found what appeared to be controlled substances and drug paraphernalia inside Sosa's purse and a camera bag. During a search incident to arrest, Sosa informed a third officer that she had methamphetamine and \"a dollar bill with powder cocaine\" on her person. The substances field-tested positive for cocaine and methamphetamine, and eleven tablets were identified as hydrocodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The State charged Sosa with three counts of possession of a controlled substance and one count of use or possession of paraphernalia. She filed numerous motions to suppress the evidence obtained during the search, alleging violations of both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 14 of the Utah Constitution. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied all of Sosa's motions to suppress. It found that the dog sniff of the exterior of the vehicle \"lasted only approximately 30 seconds,\" and it concluded that this \"did not result in any delay at all in [Sergeant's] preparation of the citation\" and \"did not extend the scope of the traffic stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Following the denial of her motions to suppress, and after this court denied her petition for interlocutory appeal, Sosa entered a\n   <em>\n    Sery\n   </em>\n   plea to two counts of third-degree felony possession of a controlled substance, reserving her right to appeal the denial of her motions to suppress. Sosa appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 \"We review a denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact and will disturb the district court's factual findings only when they are clearly erroneous, but we afford no deference to the district court's application of law to the underlying factual findings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The officer then requested to search the vehicle, and after Rodriguez refused to consent, the officer detained Rodriguez and the passenger\n   until the police dog unit arrived and conducted the sniff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court determined that the \"critical question\" \"is not whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket, ... but whether conducting the sniff prolongs-i.e., adds time to-the stop.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    at 1616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Because this detainment prolonged the traffic stop, the Court remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to determine whether there was reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, independent from the initial traffic stop, to justify prolonging the stop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    at 1616-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , the Utah Supreme Court held that \"the officers impermissibly detained [a passenger]\" to conduct a dog sniff after the purpose of the initial traffic stop had ended, \"which was to investigate and then arrest the vehicle driver.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993443\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/229/650/\">\n    2010 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9, 58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993443\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/229/650/\">\n    229 P.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 This case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   , because the request for a dog sniff and the resulting alert occurred during the traffic stop, not after its completion. And based on the record before us, we cannot agree with Sosa's argument that \"instead of processing the legitimate tasks of a traffic stop,\" Sergeant added \"more time than necessary\" to complete the mission of the stop. There is no evidence to suggest that Sergeant was ever distracted to the point that he delayed completing the traffic stop for even a few seconds. At best, Sergeant testified that he was not doing \"two things at the same time\" when he requested the dog sniff. But without more, we do not know whether Sergeant's multi-tasking caused an actual delay. For instance, Sergeant may have been waiting for police dispatch to relay to him the results of the records check when he made the request for the dog sniff. We wonder whether a few-second distraction from an officer's focus on resolving the traffic offense would violate the Fourth Amendment even if it could be shown to have caused a corresponding few-second delay in the overall duration of the traffic stop, but we need not directly answer that question here, because there is no support for that factual conclusion in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Instead, this case aligns more closely with\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Caballes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    543 U.S. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    160 L.Ed.2d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). In\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   , the officer who initiated the stop radioed police dispatch to record the initiation of the stop, and a police dog unit arrived on the scene without a request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Sergeant initiated the traffic stop, and while he continued to complete the mission of the stop, he requested the police dog unit. Officer arrived and used the dog to conduct the sniff before Sergeant had completed the records check. Although Sergeant requested the sniff, unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   , Sosa and the driver were similarly \"lawfully seized for a traffic violation\" at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5902584\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/405/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The sniff lasted thirty seconds and indicated the presence of a controlled substance.
