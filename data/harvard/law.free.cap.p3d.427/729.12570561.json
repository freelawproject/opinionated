Their divorce decree directed that their jointly owned Sinclair, Wyoming home would remain in Mr. Weeks' possession, subject to a trust for their minor son, Shawn Weeks. Mr. Weeks retained possession of the Sinclair property, but the required trust was never formed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In 2012, Shawn Weeks died at the age of thirty-three, and in 2015 Jack Weeks died. In 2016, the Estate of Jack Winford Weeks filed a quiet title action against Ms. Weeks-Rohner, asserting adverse possession of the Sinclair property. Ms. Weeks-Rohner counterclaimed, contending that the 1984 divorce decree governed disposition of the property and asking that the district court enforce the decree by quieting title to the property in Shawn Weeks and/or his heirs. On dispositive motions, the district court ruled generally in favor of Ms. Weeks-Rohner, and the Estate appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] We restate the issues on appeal as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Did the district court err in ruling that the Estate failed to make the showing required for an adverse possession claim against Ms. Weeks-Rohner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Did the district court err in ruling that Ms. Weeks-Rohner's counterclaim for enforcement of the decree was timely?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Did the district court act within its authority to enforce the 1984 divorce decree when it ordered the parties to place the Sinclair property in a trust for the benefit of Shawn Weeks and subject to his probate proceedings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. Did the district court err in ruling that a motion to dismiss filed by the Estate was untimely?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Jack Weeks and Judy Weeks-Rohner were married on February 16, 1982 and divorced on February 28, 1984. When they divorced they had one child, Shawn Daniel Weeks. Their 1984 divorce decree awarded Ms. Weeks-Rohner custody of Shawn Weeks during the school year, and Mr. Weeks had the child during the summer, with each having liberal visitation when the other had custody. The decree ordered Mr. Weeks to pay $175 per month for child support, including during the summer months, with those payments due on the first day of each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 5] The divorce decree also addressed disposition of the parties' property, both real and personal. The provision central to the present dispute directed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. The following property, real and personal, shall be subject to a trust established for the parties' minor child, Shawn Daniel Weeks:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a. Savings bonds;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b. Shaughnessy's;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   c. Colorado property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   d. Residence located at [street address omitted], Sinclair, Wyoming, including other half lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A professional trustee shall be named to administer said trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant [Mr. Weeks] shall have possession of the Sinclair residence beginning February 1, 1984 and shall be responsible for making all mortgage payments on the property for so long as the property remains subject to the trust. In the event that the Sinclair property is rented to a third party, and the rental payments do not cover the mortgage payments, the defendant shall be responsible for making up the difference. In the further event that the rental payments exceed the amount of the mortgage payments, any monies in excess of the mortgage payment shall be placed in the trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The trustee, plaintiff [Ms. Weeks-Rohner] and defendant shall comprise a management board to manage Shaughnessy's. The trustee has an absolute veto over votes cast by plaintiff and defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant shall be responsible for maintaining the Sinclair property in good repair for so long as the property remains subject to the trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 6] In 1986, Ms. Weeks-Rohner, through her divorce attorney, asked a Cheyenne bank to set up the trust and serve as trustee. The bank declined through its trust officer, stating that administrative expenses would annually reduce the corpus of the trust, and that the real estate in the trust would have expenses for taxes, insurance and maintenance making the administration of the trust difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b6 7] Neither Mr. Weeks nor Ms. Weeks-Rohner ever attempted to set up the trust again, and it was never established. On March 30, 2012, Shawn Weeks died, and on March 23, 2015, Mr. Weeks died. Mr. Weeks retained possession of the Sinclair property until his death, and the property remained titled in the names of both Mr. Weeks and Ms. Weeks-Rohner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 8] In 2014, Shawn Weeks' estate filed suit against Jack Weeks (before Jack Weeks died), making claims about the same real estate. Shortly thereafter those parties stipulated that the case would be dismissed pursuant to WRCP 41(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 9] A year later, in January 2016, Mr. Weeks' estate filed a quiet title action against\n   Ms. Weeks-Rohner asserting a claim for adverse possession of the Sinclair property. Ms. Weeks-Rohner responded with an amended answer and counterclaim which asserted claims for quiet title, constructive trust, promissory estoppel, and declaratory judgment. With each claim, Ms. Weeks-Rohner sought enforcement of the 1984 divorce decree and to quiet title to the Sinclair property in Shawn Weeks and/or his estate and heirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 10] Mr. Weeks' Estate then filed a motion for summary judgment on its adverse possession claim and a motion to dismiss Ms. Weeks-Rohner's counterclaims. By its motion to dismiss, the Estate asserted: (1) Ms. Weeks-Rohner's quiet title claim was barred by the ten-year statute of limitations for recovery of real property; (2) the divorce decree's trust provision was an unenforced child support judgment that was dormant and could no longer be revived or enforced; (3) Ms. Weeks-Rohner could not establish the elements of a constructive trust; (4) Ms. Weeks-Rohner could not establish the elements of promissory estoppel; (5) Ms. Weeks-Rohner lacked standing to bring a declaratory judgment action; and (6) Ms. Weeks-Rohner's declaratory judgment action was barred by the four-year statute of limitations on such actions. Ms. Weeks-Rohner opposed the motion to dismiss and filed her own summary judgment motion on her quiet title and declaratory judgment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 11] Because the Estate attached materials outside the pleadings to its motion to dismiss, the district court converted it to a summary judgment motion. In ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found that: 1) after their divorce, Mr. Weeks and Ms. Weeks-Rohner owned the Sinclair property as tenants in common; 2) Ms. Weeks-Rohner was not in possession of the Sinclair property and therefore could not bring a quiet title action; 3) the Estate failed to make the elevated showing required for a cotenant adverse possession claim; 4) neither party's claims were time-barred; 5) the divorce decree's trust provision was not a child support judgment and therefore not a judgment subject to statutory dormancy and revival requirements; 6) the district court had jurisdiction to enforce the 1984 divorce decree; and 7) questions of fact precluded the Estate's motion for summary judgment on Ms. Weeks-Rohner's constructive trust and promissory estoppel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Based on those findings, the district court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Decedent and Defendant have never been relieved from their agreement and court-ordered obligation to place the Sinclair residence into a trust for the benefit of their son. The relevant provisions of the 1984\n   <em>\n    Decree of Divorce\n   </em>\n   remains [sic] enforceable, and declaratory judgment at this summary judgment stage is appropriate in Defendant's favor to enforce the pertinent provisions of the divorce decree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court will quiet title to the Sinclair property with Decedent (now his estate) and Defendant each owning an undivided one-half interest as tenants in common.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Choman v.

Additionally, the Court will declare the 1984\n   <em>\n    Decree of Divorce\n   </em>\n   is not dormant and order the parties to abide by the provisions governing the Sinclair residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant's request for summary judgment on her declaratory judgment claim is granted, and the Court will enforce the portions of the 1984 Decree of Divorce requiring the parties to place the Sinclair property into a trust for the benefit of Shawn Daniel Weeks (and now becoming subject to Shawn Weeks' probate action).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 13] Ms. Weeks-Rohner's remaining claims for constructive trust and promissory estoppel were set for a bench trial scheduled for May 2, 2017. On the morning of May 2, 2017, however, the Estate filed another motion to dismiss. This motion asserted Ms. Weeks-Rohner's counterclaims must be dismissed because she failed to join an indispensable party, Shawn Weeks' estate. The motion also asserted that Ms. Weeks-Rohner's counterclaims were barred by res judicata and laches. The district court continued\n   the trial and took the Estate's second motion to dismiss under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Shortly thereafter, the district court issued an order denying the Estate's motion to dismiss. It found the motion to be untimely, but it also addressed the merits and denied it on that basis as well. The parties then filed a stipulated motion to dismiss Ms. Weeks-Rohner's claims for constructive trust and promissory estoppel with prejudice, and the district court issued an order granting the stipulated dismissal. The Estate filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 15] The dispositive issues in this matter require that we review the district court's summary judgment rulings.

First, the district court found that following their divorce, Mr. Weeks and Ms. Weeks-Rohner each owned an undivided one-half interest in the Sinclair property as tenants in common. Second, the district court rejected the Estate's adverse possession claim and instead quieted title to the Sinclair property in the Estate and Ms. Weeks-Rohner as tenants in common. Third, the district court found the 1984 divorce decree enforceable and enforced the decree by ordering the parties to place the Sinclair property in a trust for the benefit of Shawn Weeks, with the understanding that the property would then be subject to the Shawn Weeks probate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b6 17] Neither party challenges the district court's finding that Mr. Weeks and Ms. Weeks-Rohner owned the Sinclair property as tenants in common following their divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   What the Estate challenges on appeal is the court's rejection of its adverse possession claim and the court's enforcement of the 1984 divorce decree.

The district court observed that \"nothing in [Mr. Weeks'] possession of the Sinclair residence would imply that it was anything other than pursuant to the divorce decree.\" The Estate contends the district court erred in this conclusion because the divorce decree permitted Mr. Weeks' possession of the property only while the property and any rental profits were subject to the required trust. Because the required trust was never formed, the Estate argues Mr. Weeks' continued possession of the property, and his retention of all rental profits, was necessarily hostile to Ms. Weeks-Rohner's interest in the property. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   [\u00b6 20] The divorce decree required that certain jointly owned property, including the Sinclair property, be placed in a trust. The decree did not, however, set a deadline for the creation of the trust. The record contains no evidence that either party refused to establish the trust or interfered with establishment of the trust. The record shows only that, in the opinion of one potential trustee, the nature of the property to be placed in the trust would have made it difficult to administer. Under these circumstances, Mr. Weeks' continued possession of the property without establishing the trust may not have been in keeping with the divorce decree's requirements, but we cannot attach to it the level of clear hostility required to establish adverse possession against a cotenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b6 21] We also reject the Estate's claim that Mr. Weeks' retention of all rental proceeds from the Sinclair property was evidence of his hostile intent to claim sole ownership of the property. The Estate submitted no evidence detailing when Mr. Weeks rented out the Sinclair property, the amount of any rental payments Mr. Weeks received, the amounts by which the rental payments exceeded the mortgage payments, or the length of time Mr. Weeks received profits from any rentals. The record is simply devoid of evidence to support a claim that for a period of at least ten years Mr. Weeks earned rental profits from the Sinclair property and retained those profits in a manner adverse to Ms. Weeks-Rohner's interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b6 22] Finally, the Estate made no showing that Ms. Weeks-Rohner was involuntarily denied possession of the Sinclair property. Instead, the record shows the following exchange between the district court and Ms. Weeks-Rohner during the 1984 proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE COURT: Now, Mrs. Weeks, is this your agreement? You heard it recited in Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [Mrs. Weeks]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Do you consider this agreement to be fair to you, Mrs. Weeks?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [Mrs. Weeks]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 23] The record is clear that Ms. Weeks-Rohner agreed to the divorce decree terms, including the provision that allowed Mr. Weeks possession of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Estate's evidence thus showed no more than that Mr. Weeks had sole possession of the Sinclair property following his divorce from Ms. Weeks-Rohner, which was insufficient to support an adverse possession claim against a cotenant. To prevail on summary judgment, or to preclude summary judgment in favor of Ms. Weeks-Rohner, the Estate was required to present admissible evidence that Mr. Weeks acted to disclaim Ms. Weeks-Rohner's title in a clear, positive and continuous manner, and that Ms. Weeks-Rohner's lack of possession was not voluntary.\n   <em>\n    Osborn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10419644\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/694/730/#p733\">\n    694 P.2d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Estate's argument is fully dependent on its premise that the divorce decree's trust requirement was the equivalent of a child support obligation.

The trust requirement is in that section of the decree. The decree then separately addresses custody of the parties' child, and follows custody with specific orders about child support. A specific provision, far removed from the property distribution requiring the trust, imposed monthly child support payments, and directed when those payments were to begin and how long they were to continue. Based on the decree's structure, we find it untenable\n   to suggest the trust was a form of child support. The trust requirement is included in the decree's property division because it is directed to disposition of the parties' property, not child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b6 27] Additionally, the trust requirement does not bear any indicia of a child support obligation. \"Child support payments are court-imposed obligations based on the parent's ability to pay and [are] designed to meet the needs of the children....\"\n   <em>\n    Plymale v.

After the Estate sued Ms. Weeks-Rohner, she filed an amended counterclaim requesting that the district court declare \"ownership of the Subject Property in Shawn Daniel Weeks and/or his heirs.\" Eight months later, the district court issued a scheduling order. The order set a trial date of May 2, 2017, and set February 28, 2017, as the deadline for filing dispositive motions, such as the Estate's motion to dismiss. On February 28, 2017, the district court extended the dispositive motions deadline to March 7, 2017. On March 6, 2017, the Estate submitted its motion for summary judgment on its claims and its motion to dismiss Ms. Weeks-Rohner's claims. On that same day, Ms. Weeks-Rohner submitted a motion for summary judgment on her quiet title and declaratory judgment (enforcement of decree) claims. On April 18, 2017, the district court issued its order on the dispositive motions, which dismissed Ms. Weeks-Rohner's quiet title claim, granted summary judgment on her decree enforcement claim, and ordered that questions of fact required a trial on her constructive trust and promissory estoppel claims.

We can conceive of no reason the Estate could not have asserted each of these defenses before the dispositive motions cutoff or in the first round of dispositive motions. The claims of Ms. Weeks-Rohner were known to the Estate for more than a year before these defenses were raised. Moreover, while W.R.C.P. 12(h)(2) may permit these defenses to be raised at trial, as the Estate argues, Ms. Weeks-Rohner's enforcement\n   claim was not the claim being tried.

It further provided that any rental proceeds in excess of the mortgage were to be placed in the trust. Beyond that, the decree provided no direction concerning the trust. It did not specify when the trust was to terminate, when or if Shawn was to obtain possession of or title to the property, whether Shawn's interest in the property, if any, would vest if he predeceased his father, or who was to be the successor or contingent beneficiary(ies) in the event Shawn were to die before the trust terminated, or as it happened, before the trust was created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [\u00b6 51] Although the record contains affidavits attesting to Mr. and Mrs. Weeks' intentions with respect to the trust and how it might operate, those intentions are not material to this inquiry.

Not only is the divorce decree itself silent with respect to the vesting of interests in the Sinclair property, nothing in the contemporaneous proceedings offers clarification. The discussion of the property during the 1984 divorce proceedings was sparse, consisting of only one on-the-record exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   [Counsel for Mr. Weeks]: There is real estate in Sinclair. This property would be put in trust for the boy, with Mr. Weeks making the monthly payments thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Mr. Weeks will have possession of the property from today through 6:00 p.m., the day after Christmas, December 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , at which time Mrs. Weeks will have possession of the property until she leaves for Colorado or February 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , 1983, whichever should occur first-excuse me, 1984, or whichever would occur first. From that time forward, Mr. Weeks would have the right to maintain possession of the house. Should he decide to vacate the premises, the house would be rented and Mr. Weeks would make up the difference in payments between the rent and the mortgage payment, if there was. If there were to be a surplus in the rent over the mortgage payment, that money would go into the trust account for the son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [Counsel for Ms. Weeks-Rohner]: * * * Your Honor, the only other things that I'm not sure were mentioned is Mr. Weeks, I understand, will be responsible for the upkeep of the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   [Counsel for Mr. Weeks]: Right.

It ordered no more than placement of the Sinclair property in a trust with the rental income to benefit Shawn Weeks. It contained no terms to address circumstances like those now before this Court, and nothing in the original court's contemporaneous discussion with counsel suggests that the court contemplated the present scenario when it ordered the trust, or that the court intended to address such circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   [\u00b6 54] I would thus conclude that under the present circumstances, the divorce decree offers no basis on which the district court could order the creation of a trust and the placement of the Sinclair property in that trust. Creation of a trust requires a definite beneficiary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-10-403\">\n    Wyo. Stat.

The only beneficiaries contemplated by the decree were Shawn Weeks, as an income beneficiary, and Mr. Weeks, as a possessory beneficiary. Both were deceased when the district court issued its enforcement order, which forced the court to create a new beneficiary, the Shawn Weeks estate. The difficulty there, of course, is that the decree did not identify the Shawn Weeks estate as a beneficiary under the trust, and, as we have explained, a court's action to enforce a divorce decree must find support in the decree's language and intent.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Crayk's formula is inconsistent with the language of the divorce decree. Crayk's formula awards her the benefit of any income increases Glover received after the first seventeen years of his military career. Crayk supports this formula by simply stating that it is fair and equitable. The validity, let alone the \"equity,\" of Crayk's formula is not the issue. The real issue is\n   the intent of the divorce decree. Nowhere does Crayk present her formula within the context of the language of the decree. Upon review, we find no indication that the divorce decree anticipated Glover's retirement calculation to be based upon sums yet to be accrued. Instead, the divorce decree speaks of sums already accrued. Indeed, the decree expressly defines the time frame for accrual as the first seventeen years of Glover's military service. Under these circumstances, we hold that the district court erred in adopting Crayk's formula\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8901588\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/122/955/\">\n    122 P.3d at 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   [\u00b6 55] In creating a new beneficiary, the district court substantively altered the 1984 divorce decree and exceeded its enforcement authority. Additionally, as a practical matter, I am not convinced that the creation of a trust and placement of the Sinclair property in the trust achieved any finality in the dispute over the property. The new trust is as sparsely defined as the 1984-ordered trust. We are again left with the unanswered questions of: the type of interests the estate or Shawn Weeks' heirs and beneficiaries hold in the property; how long the trust is to last; the events that will trigger the trust's termination; and how the property is to be disposed of upon the trust's termination. The ordered trust appears to do little more than place a cloud on the property's title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   [\u00b6 56] Under these circumstances, I would reverse that portion of the court's order that directed the parties to place the Sinclair property in a trust for Shawn Weeks, subject to his probate.

The problem, of course, is that there is no way to tell if that would be proper or not. At this point, it is clear that a trust is unnecessary to protect a minor's interest in the property, as that minor has reached adulthood and passed on.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Because neither party filed a partition claim in this proceeding, the question of where this resolution would leave them is not a question presently before the Court, and I would offer no comment on the question of partition. It seems that litigation is unavoidable-under the district court's order there will be a dispute over what the trust terms are, and under my proposed resolution, there will be a partition action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
