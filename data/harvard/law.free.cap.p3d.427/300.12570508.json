The court concluded that, while the Schlegers had successfully complied with the prelitigation claims-review requirements of the Utah Health Care Malpractice Act (the HCMA), their suit was nevertheless time-barred under the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah (the GIA). The Schlegers maintain that the court erred in its interpretation of the applicable statutes. We disagree and therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 This appeal comes to us in the wake of the tragic events surrounding the death of the Schlegers' twenty-nine-year-old daughter (Decedent). In May 2013, after a long battle with mental illness, Decedent was admitted to the Utah State Hospital for long-term inpatient treatment. Upon her arrival, she was immediately placed on suicide watch. Soon thereafter, Decedent's roommate alerted hospital staff that Decedent had begun making strange noises. Rushing into Decedent's room, staff members found her sitting next to her bed, with shoelaces wrapped tightly around her neck. Although staff members acted quickly in an attempt to save her, she had already lost consciousness by the time they managed to cut the laces off. Sadly, after spending three days on life support, Decedent was pronounced dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Following Decedent's death, the Schlegers decided to assert claims against the State for medical malpractice and wrongful death. Given that they wished to pursue a lawsuit against the government, however, they could not file their action without first satisfying certain procedural prerequisites arising under the GIA. Thus, consistent with section 63G-7-401 of the GIA, the Schlegers served a notice of their claims on the Utah Attorney General\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on May 21, 2014, the last possible day in the one-year period in which they could do so. When the State failed to respond by July 20, 2014, the Schlegers' claims were deemed denied by operation of statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-403(1)(b) (LexisNexis 2016). At that point, barring a tolling of the GIA's limitations period, the Schlegers had one year in which to commence their action against the State lest they lose their right to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 63G-7-403(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 But as of late July 2014, the Schlegers still had several procedural hurdles to surmount before they could file suit. Specifically, because they sought to assert claims for medical malpractice, they were required to comply with the prelitigation claims-review requirements set out in the HCMA. They did not begin this process until May 19, 2015-some ten months after the State was deemed to have denied their claims-when they served the State with a notice of their intent to sue for medical malpractice.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-412(1)(a) (LexisNexis 2012). Several weeks later, on July 17, 2015, the Schlegers took the next step in the claims-review process by submitting a formal request for prelitigation panel review to the Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (the Division).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(2)(a). On January 6, 2016, the Division provided the Schlegers with a certificate of compliance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-418(1)(a)-(b). With that, the Division documented that it had finished its review and that the HCMA's prelitigation claims-review process was complete, leaving the Schlegers free to sue on their malpractice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Schlegers then brought this action in district court,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-412(1)(b), nearly two months later, on March 4, 2016. In response, the State filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Schlegers' complaint was untimely under the GIA's one-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing oral argument on the motion, the district court agreed with the State and dismissed the Schlegers' suit with prejudice. The Schlegers appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The Schlegers argue that the district court erred in concluding that the GIA's one-year statute of limitations is not subject to the HCMA's provision for tolling limitations statutes during the prelitigation claims-review process. \"Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law that we review for correctness,\" without according deference to the district court's decision.\n   <em>\n    In re R.B.F.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982183\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/278/143/\">\n    2012 UT App 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982183\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/278/143/\">\n    278 P.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The Schlegers contend that the GIA's one-year statute of limitations was tolled while the HCMA's prelitigation claims-review process was underway. We agree with the district court that the limitations period continued to run and that the Schlegers' suit was therefore barred by the GIA's statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 \"[T]he law of sovereign immunity is set forth in the Governmental Immunity Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Craig v.

Nevertheless, they maintain that their action should be allowed to proceed because the GIA's statute of limitations must be read in conjunction with the tolling provision set out in the HCMA. That provision states that \"[t]he filing of a request for prelitigation panel review ... tolls the applicable statute of limitations until ... 60 days following the Division's issuance of ... (A) an opinion by the prelitigation panel ... or (B) a certificate of compliance[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338299\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/389/423/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(a)(i) (LexisNexis 2012). To conclude that the GIA's statute of limitations is not subject to this provision would lead to an absurd result, they argue, because it would otherwise be \"impossible\" for litigants in their situation \"to comply with both [the GIA and the HCMA] at the same time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 The question before us is one of statutory interpretation. \"When interpreting statutes, our primary goal is to evince the true intent and purpose of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tooele County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n    2002 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n    44 P.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And \"[t]o discern the legislature's intent and purpose, we look first to the best evidence of a statute's meaning, the plain language of the act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Upon examining the plain language of the HCMA, it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to deprive the State of the benefit of the GIA's one-year limitations period when it enacted the HCMA. Indeed, the HCMA contains a provision that speaks directly to the issue. Section 78B-3-415 of the HCMA provides that \"[t]his part may not\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   affect the requirements for filing notices of claims ... [or] times for commencing actions ... under the Utah Governmental Immunity Act.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-3-415 (LexisNexis 2012). Given this unambiguous language, the task of discerning legislative intent in this case is straightforward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 To be sure, under the regime created by the GIA's and the HCMA's statutory schemes, litigants seeking to assert medical malpractice claims against a governmental entity have a short window in which to satisfy the conditions precedent to filing suit. Nevertheless, by proceeding diligently and planning ahead, it is not impossible for litigants in the Schlegers' position to overcome the procedural challenges they face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 To demonstrate, we offer the following timeline, which assumes that the Schlegers were obliged to proceed as they did, sequentially, with the GIA-required claim first and the HCMA-required notice and request tendered only after the notice of claim was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have explained, under the GIA's statute of limitations a claimant has one year following the government's denial of her claim in which to file her complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-403(2)(b) (LexisNexis 2016). Thus, assuming she does not begin the process of complying with the HCMA until after the government denies her claim, the claimant has one year from the denial date to satisfy the HCMA's conditions\n   precedent to suit. To comply with these conditions, the claimant must (1) \"give[ ] the prospective defendant ... at least 90 days' prior notice of intent to commence an action,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-412(1)(a) (LexisNexis 2012); (2) \"file a request for prelitigation panel review with the division,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(2)(a); and (3) \"receive[ ] a certificate of compliance from the division,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-412(1)(b). Once the claimant has filed her panel-review request, the \"division shall ... complete a prelitigation hearing ... within ... 180 days,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(b)(ii)(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"[t]he panel shall render its opinion in writing not later than 30 days after the end of the proceedings,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-418(2)(a). If the panel determines that the claims are meritorious, \"[t]he division shall issue a certificate of compliance to the claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9422531\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/44/680/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-418(3)(a). Thus, if a claimant begins the process of satisfying the HCMA's conditions precedent on the day after the government denies her notice of claim, she can complete that process in 210 days, with some time to spare before the GIA's one-year limitations period expires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 We recognize that the timeline we have outlined is a daunting one, allowing little room for delay and minimal opportunity for reflection or consultation. But given section 78B-3-415's clear statement that no provision in the HCMA may be construed to affect the GIA's timeliness rules, we can only conclude that this was the intent of the Legislature, harsh though the result may seem in this case. That said, the Schlegers waited almost an entire year after the State denied their notice of claim before submitting a request to the Division for a prelitigation panel review. Because we are bound to give effect to the plain meaning of the Legislature's enactments, we are powerless to rescue the Schlegers from the consequences of their decision to proceed at an unhurried pace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the GIA's statute of limitations is not subject to the HCMA's tolling provision. We therefore affirm the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   APPENDIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The following chart contains three columns: Simultaneous Compliance, Sequential Compliance, and The Schlegers.

Their argument is unavailing, especially because the rules of construction contained in the Utah Code expressly state that \" '[m]ay not' means that an action is not authorized and is prohibited.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2084\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 68-3-12(1)(h).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    We are far from certain that this sequential process is required. Both the GIA and the HCMA require\n    <em>\n     pre-suit\n    </em>\n    actions, but nothing in either statute leads us to believe that the GIA notice of claim must precede the HCMA-required filings. If both pre-suit requirements can be pursued simultaneously, with appropriate transparency and cross-referencing, then the ability to hold the sovereign responsible for its medical malpractice is even less problematic, as illustrated in the first column of the chart appended to this opinion. Indeed, at oral argument counsel for the State represented that simultaneous pursuit in such cases is not only a theoretical possibility; it is the norm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The HCMA also provides avenues for bypassing the prelitigation hearing requirement when \"the prelitigation hearing has not been completed within\" the prescribed 180-day period.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(c) (LexisNexis 2012). For instance, when a claimant believes \"that the respondent [healthcare provider] has failed to reasonably cooperate in scheduling the hearing,\" she may \"file an affidavit with the division\" alleging facts to that effect.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2084\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(c)(ii). \"If the claimant files an affidavit\" in accordance with that procedure, \"within 15 days ... the division shall determine whether ... the respondent ... failed to reasonably cooperate[.]\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2084\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(d)(i). Finally, \"if the determination is that the respondent failed to reasonably cooperate in the scheduling of a hearing, and the claimant did not fail to reasonably cooperate, the division shall, issue a certificate of compliance for the claimant[.]\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2084\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-3-416(3)(d)(ii)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The second column in the chart contained in the appendix to this opinion illustrates the timeline we have just explained.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Schlegers also contend that if the GIA's statute of limitations is not subject to the HCMA's tolling provision, then the GIA's application in their case violated the Open Courts Clause of the Utah Constitution. However, the Schlegers correctly point out that statutes that do not abrogate a previously existing remedy are not unconstitutional under the Open Courts Clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Petersen v. Utah Labor Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2087\">\n     2017 UT 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 26,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567077\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/583/\">\n     416 P.3d 583\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, the statutes in question did not abrogate a remedy; instead, they merely imposed time deadlines within which certain types of claims must be brought. Imposition of time deadlines to bring a cause of action generally does not violate the Open Courts Clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Payne v. Myers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10401722\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/743/186/#p190\">\n     743 P.2d 186\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 190 (Utah 1987). Indeed, we have concluded that the Schlegers were not precluded from bringing suit had they been more expeditious in pursuing their claim, and therefore the Schlegers' arguments under the Open Courts Clause are without merit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
