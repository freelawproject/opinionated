The divorce decree awarded the parties joint legal and physical custody of their minor daughter (Child). Gustafson was designated as Child's primary physical caretaker, and Lay was granted six out of every fourteen overnights for parent-time. Around 2011, the parties informally agreed to a new parent-time schedule due to conflicts with Lay's work schedule and Child's need for more stability. Under their agreement, Lay would have Child only on alternating weekends, Friday night through Sunday night. Although Lay's scheduling conflict was eventually resolved, the parties continued to operate under the revised parent-time schedule for approximately five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 2015, the parties-for different reasons-each asked the district court to modify the divorce decree. The district court ordered that the parent-time schedule originally established in the divorce decree be followed during the summer months. For the school year, the court ordered that Lay would have Child only on alternating weekends but that his parent-time \"should be Friday and Saturday nights only, not Sunday nights, to better accommodate school attendance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Lay appeals, raising two main challenges. First, Lay contends that the district court misinterpreted the statute that provides for increased parent-time for the noncustodial parent and erred by not adopting the optional schedule described in that statute. Second, Lay contends that the district court exceeded its discretion and made legally inadequate findings regarding its decision to grant him \"only alternating Friday and Saturday overnights during the school year instead of alternating Friday, Saturday, and Sunday overnights\" and its decision to deny him midweek parent-time during the school year. We affirm with respect to Lay's first contention, but because we agree with Lay that the district court's findings are inadequately detailed, we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 We generally will not disturb the district court's parent-time determination absent a showing that the court has abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wight v.

The Statutory Optional Parent-Time Schedule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Lay first contends that the district court misinterpreted Utah Code section 30-3-35.1, which sets forth an optional parent-time schedule that provides more parent-time for the noncustodial parent than the default minimum amount. According to Lay, he satisfied his evidentiary burden under that statute, and the district court was therefore\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to adopt that statute's optional parent-time schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Each divorced parent \"is entitled to and responsible for frequent, meaningful, and continuing access with the parent's child consistent with the child's best interests.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b)(ii) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017). To that end, Utah Code section 30-3-35 sets a default minimum parent-time schedule \"to which the noncustodial parent and the child [who is between five and eighteen years old] shall be entitled,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-35(2), unless \"the court determines that Section 30-3-35.1 should apply\" or a parent can establish \"that more or less parent-time should be awarded,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-34(2). Under the default minimum schedule in section 30-3-35, the noncustodial parent is entitled to parent-time with the child during one weekday evening and on alternating weekends, which include Friday and Saturday overnights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-35(2)(a)(i), (2)(b)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The Utah Code also provides an alternative statutory parent-time schedule for children between five and eighteen years old.

Under this schedule, the noncustodial parent has parent-time for one weekday overnight and, on alternating weekends, three overnights (Friday through Sunday nights), resulting in the noncustodial parent having approximately 145 overnights with the child during a calendar year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-35.1(1), (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The statute directs that \"[t]he parents and the court\n   <em>\n    may consider\n   </em>\n   \" the increased parent-time schedule under section 30-3-35.1\"as a minimum\" in two circumstances: when \"the parties agree,\" or when \"the noncustodial parent can demonstrate\" the existence of certain factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-32\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-3-35.1(2) (emphasis added).

Lay acknowledges the statute provides that the court \"may consider\" the increased parent-time schedule upon such a showing, but he asserts that \"[t]he word\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   in the statute should be construed ... as\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   .\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610 \"When we interpret statutes, our primary objective is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

With regard to the weekend overnights schedule, Lay asserts that the district court's findings did not adequately explain its decision to grant him parent-time \"only alternating Friday and Saturday overnights during the school year but not Sunday overnights,\" when Child \"had been thriving under a schedule with Sunday overnights.\" Lay concedes that \"the district court mentioned the accommodation of school attendance as a justification,\" but he asserts that \"there are no findings about a need to better accommodate [Child's] school attendance.\" With regard to midweek parent-time, Lay contends that \"the district court's decision not to allow the midweek visits required by the minimum parent time statute is supported by inadequate findings.\" To buttress this position, Lay asserts that the \"statutory minimum schedule requires midweek visits,\" that he had regularly exercised his midweek parent-time by spending lunchtime with Child, and that \"this case [does] not fall under any of the exceptions to the statutory minimum schedule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b622 The district court made the following findings regarding the parent-time schedules that the parties had followed since their divorce. The parties' divorce decree was entered when Child was under the age of three and provided that, in a two-week period, Lay would have Child for six overnights and that Gustafson would have eight overnights. In 2011, after Child finished kindergarten, the parties informally agreed to change the parent-time schedule such that Lay would not have midweek parent-time and instead would have parent-time with Child only every other weekend from Friday night through Monday morning, amounting to three overnights during every two-week period. This informal agreement was driven by Lay's work schedule and by Child's need for stability given that \"the number of transfers between parents [had] interfered with [her] well being.\" With rare exceptions, the parties lived by this parent-time schedule, even during the summers, for five years. The parties cooperated well under that agreement until shortly before the parties petitioned to modify the decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b623 The court also made findings related to Child's schooling. Child attends a school roughly equidistant from Lay's and Gustafson's residences. Gustafson takes Child to school and has a work schedule that \"allows greater flexibility as to getting [Child] to and from school than does [Lay].\" In 2014 and 2015, Lay regularly would have lunch with Child during recess. At school, Child has\n   shown that she is \"doing better\" and \"getting more used to transition[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624 As for Child's overall well-being, the district court found that she is \"well adjusted and happy and doing well, and doing better as she gets older.\" Although she \"still demands lots of structure and routine,\" Child's behavior is \"getting better,\" and Child responds better to changes when she is given advance notice and explanation. On the whole, Child is \"making good progress,\" \"getting more resilient,\" and is \"more content now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 Ultimately, the district court modified the parent-time schedule. Although the parties had operated under a schedule for the past five years where Lay had parent-time every other weekend, Friday through Sunday nights, the court ordered that, for the non-school months, Lay's parent-time would remain as under the divorce decree, that is, Lay would have six overnights and Gustafson would have eight overnights in each two-week period. During the school year, however, the court ordered that Lay would have only two overnights on alternating weekends. The court explained that Lay's parent-time every other weekend \"should be Friday and Saturday nights only, not Sunday nights, to better accommodate school attendance, with a return of [Child] by [Lay] to [Gustafson] on Sunday evening at 7:00 pm during school months.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 We agree with Lay that the district court's findings were not sufficiently detailed \"to disclose the steps\" the court took to reach its ultimate conclusion to adjust Lay's alternating weekend parent-time from three overnights to two overnights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rayner v.

The court found that under the working parent-time schedule, which included Sunday overnights, Child was \"well adjusted\" and \"doing well.\" Yet the court ordered a change to that schedule on the basis of \"better accommodat[ing] [Child's] school attendance.\" And the court's factual findings do not explain why having Lay return Child to Gustafson on Sunday evenings, as opposed to dropping Child off at school on Monday mornings, would \"better accommodate [Child's] school attendance.\" The court did find that Gustafson drives Child to school and generally has more flexibility than Lay to take Child to and from school. But the court did not say, for instance, that Lay is incapable of taking Child to school on Monday or that his Sunday overnights under the existing schedule contributed to school absences or tardiness on Child's part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b627 We thus conclude that the district court's factual findings fail to support its conclusion that Sunday overnights with Lay did not accommodate Child's school attendance at least as well as Sunday overnights with Gustafson. Moreover, at oral argument before this court, Gustafson could not identify any specific findings or record evidence that could support the court's decision that Child spending Sunday nights with Gustafson better accommodated Child's school attendance; thus, we cannot conclude that the court impliedly relied on any particular evidence to so conclude.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fish v.

The district court specifically found that Child was \"doing well\" under the existing parent-time schedule, so therefore its decision to change Lay's alternating weekend parent-time from three to two overnights is inconsistent with that finding and requires explanation so that we can ensure on review that that decision was rationally based.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785082\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/882/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re S.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11953762\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/928/393/#p398\">\n    928 P.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (Utah Ct.

It is possible that the district court so concluded because Lay did not have midweek parent-time under the existing schedule or because the court did not want to increase the number of Child's transfers in light of her need for stability. But the court did not provide any such explanation. And given that the court ordered a change to the existing schedule for Sunday nights-a change that is inconsistent with its finding that Child was \"doing well\" under that schedule-we are unable to simply infer the court's reasoning or its evidentiary basis for denying midweek parent-time. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court's decisions to adjust Lay's weekend parent-time and to deny him midweek parent-time are not supported by adequate findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b629 The district court did not err in declining to adopt Lay's proposed interpretation of the statute providing for an optional parent-time schedule. The district court's factual findings, however, do not contain sufficient detail for us to ensure that its discretionary determination regarding the parent-time schedule was rationally based. Accordingly, we remand this case with the instruction that the district court make additional findings with respect to (1) whether Lay's weekend parent-time during the school year should include a Sunday overnight and (2) whether Lay should have midweek parent-time during the school year.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In the alternative, Lay contends that the court should have adopted the parent-time schedule under Utah Code section 30-3-35.1 because it is in Child's best interest.
