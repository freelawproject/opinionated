Studtmann, of Wichita, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1985.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 22, 2016, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a motion to continue the formal hearing. The motion was granted by an order filed November 29, 2016. On July 21, 2017, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against the respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). The respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed stipulations on August 16, 2017. The respondent filed an answer on August 17, 2017, an amended answer on September 5, 2017, and a proposed probation plan on October 20, 2017. The respondent and the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a second set of stipulations on November 2, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on November 2, 2017, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.2(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 290) (scope of representation); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.7(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 302) (conflict of interest); 1.8(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 309) (accepting compensation for representation of client from one other than client); and 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"12. This complaint arose out of the respondent's representation of H.S. and T.C. in a criminal matter involving a fatality automobile accident in July 2015. The respondent's representation began on July 23, 2015, and ended on July 29, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"13. On Saturday, July 18, 2015, a pedestrian was killed in ... a hit-and-run accident in Ellis County, Kansas. The Ellis County Sheriff's Department quickly determined that the pedestrian was hit by a newer-model Dodge Ram pickup truck. That evening, the Ellis County Sheriff's Department issued a press release seeking the public's help in locating the Dodge Ram pickup and the missing driver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"14. On Sunday, July 19, 2015, an Ellis County Sheriff's Officer contacted T.C. at his residence to determine whether his white 2014 Dodge Ram pickup truck had damage consistent with the accident scene. T.C. told the officer that his pickup truck was located at a well site in Rawlins County, Kansas, and gave the officer a description of the location of the truck. The officer contacted the Rawlins County Sheriff's Department and asked them to locate the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"15. After an extensive search, the Rawlins County Sheriff's Department was unable to find the truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"16. Ellis County Sheriff's Detective Bradley Ricke then made several unsuccessful attempts to contact T.C. by phone and by stopping [by] his residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"17. At 9:00 a.m. on July 23, 2015, Detective Ricke contacted T.C.'s girlfriend, H.S., at Lewis Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Hays, where she worked. The detective explained to H.S. how important it was that he find T.C. in order to locate his 2014 Ram pickup truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"18. After stepping outside to talk with the detective, H.S. told the detective that she had been driving T.C.'s pickup truck and she struck the pedestrian. H.S. told the detective the truck was at a friend's house in Broomfield, Colorado.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"19. T.C.'s pickup truck was located parked outside a residence in Broomfield, Colorado. Although it had been recently repaired, it was clear the truck had sustained damage consistent with the circumstances of the hit-and-run accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"20. H.S. called T.C. that morning and told him she was about to be arrested. H.S. was arrested and taken into custody that morning. T.C. remained under investigation, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"21. T.C. looked online for an attorney and located the respondent's website. T.C. called the respondent. During his conversation with the respondent, T.C. told him he was working out-of-town and he was concerned that he would be arrested when he got back to Hays. T.C. told the respondent that he wanted to retain counsel before he got back to town. The respondent agreed to represent both H.S. and T.C. The respondent did not discuss with T.C. the potential for a conflict of interest by representing both H.S. and T.C. Additionally, the respondent did not discuss the issues of client confidentiality and attorney-client privilege with H.S. and T.C. if he were to represent both of them. The respondent did not obtain informed consent, confirmed in writing from H.S. and T.C. regarding issues of conflict of interest or confidentiality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"22. On July 23, 2015, the respondent wrote to the Ellis County Attorney informing him that he would be representing H.S. The respondent faxed a second letter to the Ellis County Attorney informing the county attorney that the respondent would also be 'assisting [T.C.] regarding any questions involving this accident on July 18, 2015.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"23. The respondent then sent a letter to H.S.\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   fax to the Ellis County Jail. In that letter the respondent stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   'Dear [H.S.]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   'I just visited with you by phone and I will be representing you on the charges that are filed by the Ellis County attorney. The judge will set a bond in your case and it's been my understanding that that information is often available by 4 PM as of today's date. There will be a first appearance in front of the District Court Judge once the complaint is filed with the court. I do not know when the first appearance will be but these will be things we will find out very soon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   'What happens when you have an attorney is that all the legal matters that pertain to this case will go through my office. We will communicate with you as this is your case that involves your life and it's my job [to] be your advocate at all times. We don't take action unless we first get your permission. What I'm specifically doing at this time is attempting to find out when they anticipate charges being filed and there will be a first appearance set. However, before that occurs they will have a bond set and I want to see if this is an affordable bond or if we need to seek a possible reduction. Sometimes I can do that by an agreement with the County attorney and the Judge. Sometimes there has to be a brief hearing about a bond reduction or a bond modification and this is all up to the District Court Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   'Hopefully [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] will have you out shortly after you read this brief letter. I'll be in touch shortly.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"24. The respondent then sent a letter to T.C. by email. When the respondent sent the letter to T.C., he attached a copy of the letter he had faxed to H.S. In the respondent's letter to T.C., he said, in part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   'Dear [T.C.]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   'I had a nice visit with [H.S.]. I also gave her mom a call to let her know what's going on. I should know very shortly some more details regarding the bond and some details regarding the first appearance etc. I am also enclosing a copy of a letter I sent over to her so she would have something to look at if friends or family called and asked who the attorney was so I prepared this brief letter going over very superficially what is going on in the case without getting into any kind of detail. I certainly did not go into any details over the phone as I will not do that. The state would never try to admit a phone call between a client in [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] an attorney into evidence, however, I don't go over details unless I'm there in person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   'I am also enclosing a copy of the contract. Let's touch base tomorrow about the initial $10,000 payment on the retainer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   'I have also written the County attorney letting them know that I would be representing you in case there's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] any questions that they have of you. I don't know what she may have advised them about your knowledge of the accident or not, but that's what I need to visit with her in person about. She does know not to talk unless I'm there and only if it's something that we have talked about and made a decision about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   'You are smart in getting this done quickly as nothing is more important than hiring an expert as soon as an event like this occurs. I do appreciate your confidence in my office and I look forward to working with you and [H.S.].'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The respondent also spoke with H.S.'s mother, K.S., that day regarding H.S.'s case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"25. Sometime before 5 p.m. on July 23, 2015, the court entered an order setting bond at $50,000. Later that evening T.C. found out bond had been set. T.C. had gathered $10,000 in cash for the respondent's retainer and/or the bond. T.C. gave the cash to K.S. K.S. used $5,000 for the surety bond and H.S. was released on bond around 10 p.m. on July 23, 2015. After being released from jail, H.S. called the respondent from her mother's cell phone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"26. One of the bond conditions required H.S. to report to the community corrections office at 10 a.m. the next morning, July 24, 2015. H.S. did not report to the community corrections office at 10 a.m., as required by her bond. After realizing that she missed the appointment, H.S. called the community corrections office and rescheduled the meeting for 1 p.m. However, the court had already issued a bench warrant after H.S. failed to report to the community corrections office. Officers from the sheriff's department arrested H.S. and took her back to jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"27. The respondent requested a bond modification hearing before the court. The court granted the respondent's request and held a bond modification hearing at 3 p.m. The respondent appeared on behalf of H.S. by phone. The court denied the respondent's request to modify H.S.'s bond and she remained in jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"28. The respondent sent a letter by email to T.C. that day. In that letter, the respondent told T.C., 'It is also my understanding that [the county attorney or assistant county attorney] may want to have contact with you which makes sense as you're the owner of the vehicle so they may have some questions about your whereabouts when that accident occurred.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"29. The respondent's brother, John Studtmann, was working as an assistant in the respondent's office during this time. On July 24, 2015, John called Crystalyn Oswald, the assistant county attorney, and talked with her about whether the county attorney wanted to speak with T.C. After that conversation, John sent an email to the respondent and to the respondent's other assistant, Araseli Hernandez, informing them of the conversation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   'The main detective on this case is Detective Brad Ricke, and he does wish to speak with [T.C.] Crystaline [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] is going to just have him call our office to schedule a time to try and reach you, and then we can schedule an appointment if appropriate. He will call us on Monday to try to reach Mike and to see about getting something scheduled. Crystaline [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] did tell me that they have some rather large concerns about [T.C.] and the things that they have heard so she wanted to make you aware that there could be a conflict in representations, but she would leave that up to you and let you talk to client [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and everyone first.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"30. As of Friday, July 24, 2015, the respondent had not met with H.S. in person. The respondent's phone records show that the respondent had spent approximately 10 minutes on the phone with H.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"31. Despite his lack of contact with H.S. throughout the day on Friday, July 24, 2015, the respondent had telephone calls with H.S.'s parents, K.S. and P.S. The respondent did not obtain informed consent from either T.C. or H.S. to disclose information relating to the representation [to] H.S.'s parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"32. On Monday morning, July 27, 2015, K.S. called the respondent's office and made an appointment to meet with the respondent the next day, July 28, 2015. The respondent's assistant, Ms. Hernandez, sent an interoffice email to the respondent and his brother documenting the conversation with K.S.:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   '[K.S.] called this morning and made an apt. for tomorrow at 11:15 to meet with Mike, pay retainer and discuss her daughters [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] case. She said she called MS cell phone this morning and left him a vm. She said she does not want to sign a bond for [H.S.] anymore. She doesn't feel like [H.S.] will follow through with what she is supposed to if bonded and she said that [H.S.] was very hateful towards her and her husband this past weekend and they just don't want to be responsible for her bond and wanted to discuss that further with Mike.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"33. Later, on July 27, 2015, the respondent called P.S. and visited with P.S. regarding the representation. The next day, Tuesday, July 28, 2015, the respondent met with K.S. in person and P.S. participated in the meeting by telephone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"34. During that meeting, K.S. gave the respondent $10,000; $5,000 came from T.C. and $5,000 came from P.S. On behalf of H.S., K.S. signed an agreement titled, 'Receipt of Minimum Initial Fee Payment and Agreement for Legal Representation.' The agreement erroneously stated that the retainer was paid by K.S. and P.S. The agreement was for the representation of H.S. only. The agreement contained no references to T.C. The respondent did not obtain H.S.'s informed consent to accept compensation from a third party for her representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"35. During the meeting, the respondent discussed information relating to the representation of H.S. and T.C. with K.S. and P.S. K.S. told the respondent how upset H.S. was that the respondent had contact with K.S. The respondent did not obtain either H.S.['s] or T.C.'s informed consent to disclose information relating to the representation to K.S. and P.S. During the meeting with H.S.'s parents, and in prior telephone conversations with them, they provided the respondent with background information about H.S.'s previous addiction issues. The respondent told K.S. and P.S. that he was going to make 'addiction' part of his plan in her representation. K.S. was concerned about that because H.S.'s addiction issue was years in the past and K.S. knew this was not what H.S. would want because her prior addiction issues had nothing to do with the current case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"36. Also during the July 28, 2015 meeting, it became apparent to K.S. that the respondent was focusing on the idea that T.C. may have been to blame for the situation and that H.S. was covering for him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"37. While the respondent was meeting with H.S.'s parents, Ms. Hernandez had a phone conversation with Detective Ricke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Ms. Hernandez sent the respondent an email documenting the conversation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   'Informed him that we have been waiting on the State to file charges so that a motion can be filed for [H.S.]. Once that is done, Mike will be traveling out to Ellis County and hope to coordinate something with him if needed at that time. Det. Ricke said that would work. ... he will arrange his schedule as needed to talk to Mike when he goes to Hays. ... he also wanted me to let you know if there is any evidence we want him to look into on [T.C.] or [H.S.]'s behalf he would be glad to do that and if either of them want to speak to him he will also make arrangements to make that happen.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"38. Later that afternoon, the respondent sent a letter to the Ellis County Attorney:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   'I will be representing [H.S.] regarding charges resulting from the auto accident that occurred on July 18, 2015. I understand that this accident resulted in a fatality and I also understand that the occurrence is still under investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   'Detective Ricke had contacted my office asking for an opportunity to schedule a meeting with a person of interest by the name of [T.C.] I am assisting [T.C.], at least temporarily, but have explained to the parties that a conflict of interest is likely to develop in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   'I will visit with [T.C.] regarding Detective Ricke's request and get back with him promptly. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns and I would greatly appreciate it if you would advise me when charges are filed.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"39. The respondent had not 'explained to the parties that a conflict of interest is likely to develop in this case.' Further, the respondent did not obtain T.C.'s written informed consent to a limited scope representation. At the hearing on the formal complaint, the respondent testified as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   'Q. So, is that what you had with [T.C.], was a limited scope representation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   'A. Yes. When I sent that letter out stating that I'm representing him regarding not wanting to talk, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   'Q. Which letter is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   'A. I didn't get to the letter. We didn't have time. I was discharged before a week had even taken place in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   'Q. But you had informed consent to that limited scope of representation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   'A. I had told him. I hadn't put it in writing, though, like I said.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"40. Because H.S. and T.C. were dissatisfied with the respondent's representation, on Wednesday, July 29, 2015, H.S. and T.C. each obtained new counsel to represent them. H.S. retained Kurt Kerns and T.C. retained Paul Oller.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"41. After learning that H.S. and T.C. had each retained new counsel, the respondent sent H.S. a letter by fax that stated, in part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   'I've been told, just since finishing dictating this letter on Thursday afternoon, that the Sheriff called us and indicated that she [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] you did not desire to talk to us any further, and this is because you have new counsel. I have now verified with Kurt Kerns' office, the [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] he will be entering on your behalf and handling your case moving forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   'Your mother had been in to pay part of the retainer this week and she had indicated how upset you were that I had contact with her. I want you to understand you are free to hire anyone you please and I wish you the very best of luck, but your mother simply came in to my office so I could actually be paid part of my retainer so I could continue to work on your case. I will take no further action on your case but I would appreciate just a written verification that you're no longer desiring my office to represent you.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The respondent provided T.C. with a copy of the letter he sent to H.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"42. The respondent's characterization of his meeting with K.S. was misleading. K.S. was not 'in to pay part of the retainer.' Rather, K.S. met with the respondent\n   regarding H.S. and her case. The respondent's time records bear this out, 'Appointment with [K.S.] to go over case, and with client's brother [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"43. That same day, July 30, 2015, the respondent sen[t] a letter to T.C.\n   <em>\n    via\n   </em>\n   email:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   'My assistant Araseli spoke to you yesterday via phone and gave you an update on our contact with Detective Brad Ricke regarding the matter in Ellis County. Detective Ricke had been informed that I represent you and we would be coordinating a time to meet with him where we would both be present. That was to be scheduled on the same day as [H.S.]'s bond hearing when I was planning to be present with her in Ellis County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   'As of a few minutes ago, my assistant John spoke to you on the phone and it is my understanding that you have retained separate legal counsel. I will take no further action on your case and this is to confirm that I am no longer representing you.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"44. Shortly after the respondent sent that email to T.C., P.S. called the respondent's office for an update on H.S.'s case. Ms. Hernandez told P.S. that H.S. had hired another attorney. Ms. Hernandez emailed P.S. a copy of the respondent's letter to H.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"45. On July 31, 2015, the Ellis County Attorney charged H.S. with three felonies, including vehicular homicide. The Ellis County Attorney charged T.C. with two counts of felony obstruction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"46. After H.S. fired the respondent, in an email on July 30, 2015, P.S. asked for an accounting of the fee to date and a partial refund of the $10,000 retainer. Ms. Hernandez replied on July 31, 2015: 'A billing of Mr. Studtmann's time will be done and provided to you. Once that billing is done I believe that whatever is left on the retainer will be reimbursed.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"47. Over the next two months, K.S. and P.S. each contacted the respondent's office repeatedly for an itemized statement of services and a refund of unearned fees. They were told the respondent was not available. K.S. and P.S. left multiple messages. The respondent never returned the calls. By October 1, 2015, the respondent had not provided an itemized statement of services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \"48. On October 1, 2015, K.S. and P.S. filed a complaint against the respondent with the disciplinary administrator's office. In November 2015, as part of his response to the complaint, the respondent provided the investigator with an itemized statement of his time in representing H.S. and T.C. The statement showed a total of 38 hours for a total fee of $8,875.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \"49. The respondent submitted a check in the amount of $1,125 payable to K.S. to the investigator. The investigator returned the check to the respondent because he did not believe he had the power to resolve a fee dispute as part of his responsibility as an investigator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \"50. Later in the investigation, on March 25, 2016, the respondent provided a detailed response to the complaint filed by K.S. and P.S. Additionally, the respondent submitted a revised invoice. In ... his response, the respondent explained some changes he made to the invoice. The March 2016, statement showed a total of 33 hours for a total fee of $7,625; a reduction of $1,250.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \"51. The respondent's itemized billing shows that time was billed in minimum quarter-hour increments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"52.

The hearing panel, however, does not find clear and convincing evidence to support a violation of KRPC 1.6. The hearing panel does not find a violation of KRPC 1.6 because insufficient evidence was presented to establish that the respondent disclosed confidential information. Accordingly, the hearing panel dismisses the allegations that the respondent violated KRPC 1.6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \" KRPC 1.2\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"55.

The next rule for the hearing panel to consider is whether or not the respondent charged an unreasonable fee. Nearly three months after the respondent's representation was concluded, the respondent provided an invoice to the investigator in this case. According to the response and [in]voice, he earned nearly $9,000 of the $10,000 paid. Approximately six months later, the respondent provided a second invoice which reflected a reduction of the fee in the amount of $1,250.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"57.

The hearing panel concludes that charging a $20,000 fee to handle this case from beginning to end would not be unreasonable. However, those are not the facts before the hearing panel. The respondent charged $7,625 for preliminary work on this case which included writing a few letters, meeting with his client's mother and father, and appearing by telephone at a bond hearing during an eight-day period of time. During that eight-day period of time, the respondent did not meet with his client, H.S. The hearing panel concludes that $7,625 is not a reasonable fee for the services rendered and, as a result, concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \" KRPC 1.7\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   '60.

Thus, in order for the respondent to represent both clients he was required to take certain steps. The respondent failed to take the steps required by KRPC 1.7(b).

Respondent was also given adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this court. He filed no exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing report. With no exceptions before us, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). Furthermore, the evidence before the hearing panel establishes the charged misconduct in violation of KRPC 1.2(c) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 290) (scope of representation); 1.5 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.7(a) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 302) (conflict of interest); 1.8(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 309) (accepting compensation for representation of client from one other than client); and 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation) by clear and convincing evidence and supports the panel's conclusions of law. We therefore adopt the panel's findings and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. At the hearing before this court, at which the respondent appeared, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the respondent serve a 90-day suspension from the practice of law. The Disciplinary Administrator advised that respondent had refunded the entire retainer amount of $10,000 and had provided a copy of a proposed engagement letter. The Disciplinary Administrator expressed his willingness to review the letter and advise the respondent regarding any proposed changes. Finally, the Disciplinary Administrator requested an order allowing his office to audit the respondent's trust account. The respondent expressed his belief that the hearing panel's recommendation of published censure was \"in order.\" He orally indicated that he would work with the Disciplinary Administrator regarding an engagement letter, and he agreed to an audit of his trust account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   A majority of the court agrees the hearing panel's recommendation of published censure is the appropriate discipline. While the hearing panel's finding that the respondent's testimony was deceptive and misleading suggests a more severe sanction might be warranted, the majority accords deference to the panel's judgment regarding respondent's credibility and to its assessment of whether that credibility determination warrants a suspension of respondent's license to practice law. A minority would impose the 90-day period of suspension recommended by the Disciplinary Administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that MICHAEL J.
