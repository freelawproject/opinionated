(Child). For the reasons explained below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Child's Removal and the Initial Permanency Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b62 In an April 2015 shelter proceeding, the juvenile court determined that Child's removal from Father and Child's mother (Mother) was necessary and in Child's best interest due to both parents' incarceration. The court thereafter adjudicated Child neglected as to both Father and Mother, and it placed Child in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS). DCFS created a family plan for both Father and Mother and recommended reunification as the primary permanency goal, with Child's adoption as the concurrent goal. The court accepted the proposed plan as well as the stated goals and ordered DCFS to make \"reasonable effort to finalize the permanency goal.\" In November 2015, given Father's and Mother's respective lack of progress, the court granted temporary custody and guardianship of Child to his maternal grandparents (Maternal Grandparents), subject to DCFS supervision. Child remained with Maternal Grandparents from then on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 The court thereafter terminated reunification services for both parents and, accordingly, in a September 2016 permanency hearing, changed the permanency goal to adoption, with the concurrent goal of permanent custody and guardianship with Maternal Grandparents. The court also determined that Child's best interest required a petition for termination of parental rights to be filed, and it ordered that such a petition be filed, and a pretrial hearing held, within forty-five days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 Following the permanency order, the State filed a petition for termination of parental rights (the TPR) as to both parents. In it, the State recited the case history, which included the fact that both parents had \"serious\" substance abuse problems and that neither parent had remedied the circumstances that led to Child's out-of-home placement. The State asserted that it would be in Child's best interest for Father's and Mother's parental rights to be terminated, that Child was in need of permanency, and that Child needed to be available for adoption to achieve that permanence. The court ordered the parents to participate in mediation and set the TPR for a pretrial hearing on November 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The November 2016 Pretrial Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 At the pretrial hearing, rather than proceeding with the TPR, the State moved to change the temporary custody in Maternal Grandparents to permanent custody and guardianship and to dismiss the TPR. The State declared that \"there are some burdens of proof ... that would be very difficult to be able to carry forward\" and that its request \"would be in the child's best interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 In response, the court noted that adoption was the permanency goal in the case, and it heard from those present regarding the State's request to grant permanent custody and guardianship to Maternal Grandparents. The State, the Guardian ad Litem, and the parents agreed that permanent custody and guardianship would be in Child's best interest. Maternal Grandparents stated that their desire was to adopt Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 After hearing from those present, the court expressed concern that granting the State's request to \"set the goal at permanent custody and guardianship\" would only delay the proceedings and increase the uncertainty in Child's life. The court then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I]n this particular case I'm not ready to name permanent custody and guardianship as the permanency goal. We have a young child here of tender age and young age, and I appreciate everything that's been said in this matter, but it's the Court's decision what the permanency goal should be. It very well may end up being permanent custody and guardianship, but I don't have the evidence before me and I feel like I need to hear that evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68 Mother objected, stating that the court did have evidence and knew \"almost everything\" about the case. The State also objected, asserting that it did not think it could \"carry the burden of proof\" if it went to trial on the TPR. In response, the court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]he Court set the permanency goal of adoption, and we'll hear the evidence that's involved. Whether you think the burden is there or not, that's the job for the Court to decide; and very well it may not be, and I'll make a decision for permanent custody and guardianship, but there isn't a stipulation in this matter. The grandparents have voiced their concerns and I want to hear the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 The court therefore denied the State's request to dismiss the TPR and order permanent custody and guardianship in Maternal Grandparents, and it set the case for a termination trial in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    The Pretrial Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 Before the termination trial began, both the State and the parents filed additional documents with the court. First, the State filed a notice to withdraw the TPR. Next, Father and Mother filed a joint rule 60(b) motion, asking the court to set aside its November 16 order denying the State's oral request to dismiss the TPR. Father and Mother argued that the court should set aside its order because the State conceded that it could not meet its burden of proof at trial. The parents contended that the State, not the court, decides which cases to file, litigate, and prosecute. The parents also argued that requiring the State to proceed with the termination trial effectively forced it to violate rule 3.1 of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct, which provides that a lawyer \"shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b611 In the alternative, the parents argued that the court should treat the State's November 16 oral motion to dismiss the TPR as a rule 41 notice of dismissal under the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The parents claimed that, because the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the TPR, the court lost jurisdiction over the petition while still retaining jurisdiction to enter an order of permanent custody and guardianship in line with the court's concurrent goal. The parents also noted that Maternal Grandparents would be free to file their own termination petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b612 On January 17, 2017, the court denied the parents' rule 60(b) motion and struck the State's notice of withdrawal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    The Termination Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 The case proceeded to the termination trial. On the second day of trial, Mother advised the court that she wished to relinquish her parental rights to Child to allow Maternal Grandparents to adopt Child. The court took Mother's voluntary relinquishment\n   under advisement. The State thereafter clarified that, given Mother's voluntary relinquishment, it had \"no misgivings about going forward with and putting on whatever evidence was necessary to establish [Father's] unfitness.\" The State explained that, although it had asserted in the November 2016 hearing that it did not have enough evidence to proceed with a termination trial, its reservation applied only to the evidence with respect to Mother, not to Father. The State asserted that it had \"never questioned the evidence with respect to [Father],\" that Father had \"never done anything\" to establish his fitness as a parent, and that he accordingly was unfit. The State ultimately contended that it was in Child's best interest for the court to grant the TPR with respect to Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 In February 2017, the court entered a termination order, terminating both Mother's and Father's parental rights as to Child. The court accepted Mother's voluntary relinquishment of her parental rights. As to Father, the court determined that he was an unfit parent and that it would be in Child's best interest to terminate Father's parental rights. In doing so, the court noted that, while having Child \"in a permanent custody and guardianship arrangement may be convenient for Father, ... it is not in [Child's] best interest.\" The court observed that Child instead needed \"the certainty and benefits that come with being adopted.\" Accordingly, the court determined that it was \"strictly and absolutely necessary to terminate parental rights so Maternal Grandparents can adopt [Child],\" and it ordered Child to remain in Maternal Grandparents' custody until he was adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Father appeals the juvenile court's denial of his rule 60(b) motion and the court's termination of his parental rights as to Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I. Failure to Accept the Parties' Stipulation about the Permanency Goal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 Father first argues that the juvenile court erred \"in applying the law by failing to accept [the parties'] stipulation\" that it would be in Child's best interest to change the permanency goal from adoption to permanent custody and guardianship with Maternal Grandparents. In particular, Father claims that the juvenile court was \"bound by the parties' stipulation\" and that the court erred in disregarding it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 Father's request that the juvenile court honor the parties' stipulation appeared in his joint rule 60(b) motion for relief from the court's November 2016 oral ruling, which the court denied and later incorporated into the termination order. We generally review both a court's denial of a rule 60(b) motion and a refusal to accept an alleged stipulation for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher v. Bybee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040193\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/104/1198/\">\n    2004 UT 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040193\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/104/1198/\">\n    104 P.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing a denial of a rule 60(b) motion);\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

And here, we conclude that the court did not exceed its discretion when it declined to adopt the proffered stipulation. Father's overall argument-that the juvenile court was bound by the parties' stipulation-is at odds both with precedent establishing a juvenile court's inherent discretion to disregard stipulations that intrude upon its core responsibilities and with the overarching purpose of juvenile courts in protecting a child's best interest throughout child welfare and permanency proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 The Utah Supreme Court has explained that, while \"the law favors the settlement of disputes\" through agreements between parties, there are circumstances in which it is appropriate for a court to disregard such agreements and stipulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re E.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416031\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/809/\">\n    2006 UT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416031\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/809/\">\n    137 P.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, a court may, pursuant to its fact-finding responsibility, disregard agreements regarding certain facts and instead \"compel the parties to present evidence for the court to weigh and evaluate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 ;\n   <em>\n    In re D.A.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873353\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/347/430/\">\n    2015 UT App 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873353\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/347/430/\">\n    347 P.3d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (per curiam) (same).

Nevertheless, because that stipulation was necessarily predicated upon a determination by the parties regarding what was in Child's best interest, the court was not bound by it or obligated to accept it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re E.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416031\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/809/\">\n    2006 UT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21-28, 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416031\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/809/\">\n    137 P.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Father has not shown, for example, that in these circumstances it was reasonably likely that another interested party-such as Maternal Grandparents or the Guardian ad Litem-would have failed to file a termination petition pursuant to the court's permanency order, had the State's petition been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339702\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/196/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-504(1) (2012) (providing that \"[a]ny interested party, including a foster parent, may file a petition for termination of the parent-child relationship with regard to a child\").

To make that decision, the court would have had to consider the evidence relevant to that question, just as it had pursuant to its decision to terminate Father's parental rights.

We also reject Father's challenge to the juvenile court's refusal to dismiss the TPR on the basis of rule 41 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, we affirm the termination of Father's parental rights as to Child.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Utah Code provides that \"[i]f the final plan for the minor is to proceed toward termination of parental rights, the petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed, and a pretrial held, within 45 calendar days after the permanency hearing.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-314(9) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Father contends that the juvenile court erred when it rejected the parties' stipulation based on Maternal Grandparents' stated desire to adopt Child, because Maternal Grandparents, although involved on a practical level with the proceedings, were nevertheless nonparties to the case. We reject the premise underlying this contention. While the court noted Maternal Grandparents' disagreement with the stipulation, our review of the November 2016 hearing persuades us that the court did not reject the stipulation in deference to Maternal Grandparents' wishes. Rather, the record demonstrates that the court's decision was driven by its determination that it did not \"have the evidence\" at that time to change the permanency goal from adoption to permanent custody and guardianship. We therefore do not address this contention further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Father also argues that the court erred in rejecting the stipulation because the scope of the juvenile court's authority to determine a permanency goal in light of a child's best interest is necessarily usurped by the ethical rules prohibiting an attorney from pursuing a frivolous proceeding and by the separation of powers between the State, as a representative of the executive department with authority to decide which cases to prosecute, and the court. We reject both contentions. Father has not demonstrated that rule 3.1 of the Utah Rules of Professional Conduct\"usurps\" the juvenile court's authority to proceed with termination proceedings, particularly in light of the juvenile court's unique purpose and authority to protect a child by making permanency orders in light of the child's best interest.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-102(5) (LexisNexis 2012);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11389991\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/53/968/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78A-6-314(4), (9) (Supp. 2017). Similarly, Father has failed to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the juvenile court's unique purpose and authority, requiring the case to proceed with termination hearings violated the separation of powers doctrine.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
