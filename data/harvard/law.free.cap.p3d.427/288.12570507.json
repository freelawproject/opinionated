Burnett contends on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial, because his attorney failed to object to the testimony of the State's expert psychiatrist. After review, we conclude that much of the expert's testimony was proper, and that objection to most of it would therefore have been futile. However, we agree in part with Burnett's arguments, and conclude that his trial counsel was indeed ineffective for failing to object to that part of the expert's testimony in which the expert inappropriately bolstered the victim's credibility. Accordingly, we reverse Burnett's convictions and remand the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In 2010, after sixteen years of marriage, Burnett and his wife (Mother) divorced, and Mother was awarded sole legal custody of their three teenage children: Victim, her sister (Sister), and her brother (Brother). The divorce decree granted Burnett parent-time with all three children. In May 2011, less than a year after the divorce, Burnett raised the possibility of increasing the quantity of his parent-time with the children. Within days of Burnett broaching that subject, then-fifteen-year-old Victim disclosed to Mother that Burnett had sexually abused and raped her for many years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 After investigating the matter, the State charged Burnett with committing various crimes upon Victim, including five counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, first degree felonies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-404.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (LexisNexis 2017); two counts of rape of a child, first degree felonies,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-402.1; and two counts of sodomy upon a child, first degree felonies,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-404.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-403.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At trial, Victim testified that Burnett first started abusing her when she was \"about three or four years old\" and that the abuse continued until she was \"[a]bout 11.\" She did not \"remember every single incident,\" but could recall several incidents with specificity. Victim described Burnett digitally penetrating her vagina and anus. She further described Burnett forcing her to manually and orally stimulate him. And she also testified that Burnett raped her on more than one occasion, both vaginally and anally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Victim testified that, during the years Burnett abused her, she often felt physically ill, even when the abuse was not actually happening. She experienced headaches, nausea, upset stomach, occasional vomiting, and memory loss. These symptoms progressed over time, and Victim later experienced fainting, pseudo-seizures, hallucinations, and age regression. Eventually, Victim was diagnosed with conversion disorder, a condition \"where a person takes psychological distress and expresses it in physical symptoms or ways.\" Victim started cutting herself when she was thirteen, and she also experienced suicidal ideations that continued throughout the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 When asked if she had told anyone about the abuse while it was ongoing, Victim stated that she had not. She explained that she \"didn't know any different,\" and that she did not initially tell anyone about the abuse because she was \"scared.\" She stated that Burnett told her that bad things would happen to her family if she disclosed the abuse, and that she \"wasn't supposed to tell anyone, that it was normal.\" Eventually, Victim told Mother, as well as Victim's psychologist, that Burnett had sexually abused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The State called Dr. David Corwin (Expert) as an expert witness at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Expert is a psychiatrist, and is the director of forensic services for the pediatrics department at the University of Utah, and is board certified in psychiatry, child psychiatry, and forensic psychiatry. He described his practice as focused on working with individuals who had been sexually abused as children, and described for the jury several publications he had authored on child sexual abuse, as well as several awards he had received for his work with victims of child sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Expert readily acknowledged that he had not treated, interviewed, or examined Victim, and that he was not offering any opinion about whether Victim had actually been abused. Instead, the State explored two main subjects with Expert. First, the State asked Expert about how he, as a trained expert, endeavors to tell the difference between cases in which the victim is advancing truthful claims of sexual abuse, and cases in which the abuse allegations are fabricated. Second, the State asked Expert whether, in his experience, he was aware of certain signs or symptoms that might alert him that a particular child may have been sexually abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 With regard to the first subject, Expert began by testifying that it is \"most common\" for abuse victims to delay disclosure of the abuse, and offered many reasons for this phenomenon. For example, a child might not know that he or she should disclose instances of sexual abuse; a child might feel loyal to the abuser or feel affection for the abuser; or the abuser might warn or threaten the child. He testified that disclosure is more common in adolescents than in children because adolescents \"are beginning to psychologically separate themselves from their parents, and they can begin to conceive of surviving apart from their parents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, \"[v]ery young children are really one with their parents and totally dependent upon their parents.\" Significantly, he stated that divorce, and its attendant changing family dynamics, is one event that can \"release[ ]\" children from their previous reluctance to disclose, although he acknowledged that there exists a \"small percentage\" of cases in which children from divorced families \"fabricat[e]\" abuse allegations. He stated that those are \"the most difficult cases of all,\" and that it is part of his professional duties to \"try to figure out which\" instances are the ones that involve fabricated allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Indeed, during re-direct examination, the State asked Expert what he looks for in \"making those evaluations\" in cases \"where there is a custody dispute and there are allegations of child sexual abuse.\" In response, the following colloquy occurred between the prosecutor and Expert:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. I look at a lot of things, because those are the most difficult cases that a forensic expert like myself is asked to look at. And that's because the rate of both disclosure of actual sexual abuse goes up when a family breaks up, because the dynamics that keep it secret are gone, but also the possibility of a misperception, either by a child or more commonly an adult attributing it to a child ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I]n a small percentage of cases there are either children who have lied or parents who somehow get their kids to say things that are false. And even though that's a very small percentage in\n   most studies of this topic, it's very troubling, because sexual abuse is such a serious thing. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. Now, in-you said that that's a small percentage of these cases. In those cases are the children typically younger?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Yes. Yeah, the hardest cases are the three-, four-[or] five-year-olds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. So ... to clarify, in these cases where there is an allegation like a child sexual abuse that's false, it would involve children that are younger on the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Well, in terms of the divorce custody and the possibility of influence, it's easier to do that with a very young child, because they are more susceptible to being misled, in terms of interviewing or what adults say to them. In older kids, they are more capable of making outright false allegations, to actually make something up. And in the studies that have been done, those are usually kids with an ax to grind. They are trying to influence where they are living. And they usually allege garden-variety sexual intercourse, vaginal intercourse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. So what do you mean by garden variety?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Really simple, straightforward, as opposed to more strange, more elaborated, more detailed accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. So, for example, just a disclosure that he touched my private part, without any more details, or he put his penis in my vagina, without any additional details?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Well, that would be sort of vaginal intercourse, put his penis in my vagina. The touching-you know, when the allegations are less severe, when I am trying to look at these various hypotheses, in my mind I think, well, if this is a false allegation why not go ahead and make a, you know, full-blown, culpable sort of clear description than something that's a little hard[er] and less easy to interpret.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. So [Defense counsel] asked you about false allegations of child sexual abuse. Based on your training and your experience and your knowledge of the literature in your field, are those common or are they rare?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. I have to be a little more specific in terms of false by the parent, false by the child. I think the general experience is that false allegations initiated by the children are less common than actual allegations, ... but they do occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b611 With regard to the second subject, the State asked Expert whether and to what extent warning signs exist that alert a medical professional to the possibility of sexual abuse. Expert testified that there are a \"variety\" of \"symptoms\" and \"disorders\" that are \"more common among sexually abused and traumatized children than among other children,\" including \"dissociation\" (the ability \"to compartmentalize and keep these very difficult experiences apart from the rest of one's awareness\"), increased anxiety, sleep problems, nightmares, depression, self-mutilation, hallucinations, panic disorders, and suicidal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 Expert also testified about \"conversion disorder,\" and explained that there are a \"continuum of symptoms\" common in patients suffering from conversion disorder, including \"pseudo-seizures,\" and specifically noted that \"pseudo-seizures\" are \"one of the most highly correlated among the conversion symptoms\" with sexual abuse. Expert conceded that the symptoms of conversion disorder are \"not exclusive\" to sexual abuse victims, but when asked whether \"a diagnosis of conversion disorder\" is \"consistent with sexual abuse,\" Expert responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   It would-it's consistent with it, and in my view I think consistent with is a pretty low bar, because a lot of things are consistent with things. But it's an indicator, it's not definitive, it doesn't in and of itself prove things like sexual abuse, again because it's correlated with other stressors and traumas as well. Um, but it's-it's-it's an indicator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b613 The State asked Expert a hypothetical question: \"If you had a patient that had been diagnosed with conversion disorder, was manifesting symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucination, self-mutilation and suicidal ideations, would you be concerned about sexual abuse?\" Expert answered, \"Yes, very concerned, ... [b]ecause all of the things you have listed are known ... to exist at increased\n   frequency among victims of child sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b614 Burnett testified in his own defense at trial, and generally denied all of the allegations against him, the thrust of the defense strategy being that Victim manufactured the allegations against him in an effort to influence the then-pending custody dispute with Mother. Burnett explained that he and Mother divorced in 2010. He stated that Mother and Mother's sister drafted the divorce decree, to which Burnett stipulated, and that Mother \"had full legal custody\" of Victim. Burnett described Mother taking Victim to various doctors and medical professionals \"at least 30 times\" in 2010 and 2011 and between twenty and thirty times in 2012, and that Mother did not inform him what the visits were about. Burnett stated that Mother waited until the end of each year before informing him about the medical bills, which were \"in the thousands of dollars.\" Describing Victim's doctor visits, Burnett testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [T]hey would see her, they would do tests. There would be nothing wrong with her, and so they would say, well \"If such and such happens bring her back and we'll look at her again.\" And sure enough, she's back in in a couple of days with \"X\" symptom that they ... suggested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Burnett stated that Victim \"would follow through with whatever [Mother] wanted\" and that he \"never saw\" any of Victim's symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b615 Under the terms of the divorce decree, Burnett was not permitted to be involved in Victim's doctor visits. After consulting with a divorce attorney, Burnett decided that he wanted to amend the decree, and arranged to meet with Mother to discuss amendment on May 11, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Burnett received a phone call that same day from a detective explaining that Victim had leveled sexual abuse allegations against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b616 During closing argument, Burnett's counsel highlighted the timing of Victim's disclosures, and argued that the case boiled down to an assessment of Victim's credibility. Counsel specifically argued that the allegations against Burnett were \"outright falsehoods,\" and that Victim's allegations were fabricated in an effort to prevent Burnett from modifying the divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b617 In its rebuttal argument at closing, the State also focused on Victim's veracity. The prosecutor argued that Expert's testimony \"corroborates\" Victim's testimony, stating that Victim had \"no ax to grind\" and could therefore be considered truthful. The prosecutor emphasized Victim's conversion disorder diagnosis and pseudo-seizures, and specifically reminded the jury that Expert \"told you that [conversion disorder and pseudo-seizures are] consistent with the trauma of being sexually abused.\" The prosecutor also referenced Expert's testimony about how one can separate a truthful accuser from a lying one, and stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Dr. Corwin also said that-[c]ounsel talked about, you know, false allegations in child custody cases. And he also-he said that ... specific and unusual disclosures were more reliable. In other words, disclosures where there is simply, oh, he touched my private part, that in the rare cases when there are false allegations, that's what you have. You don't have that in this case. You have a really unusual and specific disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b618 The jury convicted Burnett on three counts of aggravated sexual abuse of Victim, two counts of rape of Victim, and one count of sodomy of Victim, but acquitted Burnett of two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of Victim and one count of sodomy of Victim. Burnett appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b619 On appeal, Burnett argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly object to Expert's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   When\n   a criminal defendant raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for the first time on appeal, there is no trial court ruling to examine.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, Burnett asserts that Expert, based on his experience in attempting to discern truthful allegations from false allegations, improperly suggested that Victim's testimony was believable. We disagree that Expert's testimony about symptoms constituted improper profiling, but we agree that Expert's testimony about statistics and methods for discerning whether an abuse victim is truthful had the\n   effect of improperly suggesting to the jury that Victim was telling the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b624 Burnett argues that Expert's testimony improperly suggested to the jury \"that a collection of symptoms like [Victim's] were likely, if not conclusively, caused by sexual abuse.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b625 \"[A] witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Utah R.

The jury heard testimony that Expert had published papers and articles on the subject, and that he had presented at conferences all over the country. Expert told the jury, at least four times, that it is only in a \"small percentage\" of cases that children lie about sexual abuse, and he explained to the jury some of the things he looks for in judging an accuser's credibility:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   In older kids, they are more capable of making outright false allegations, to actually make something up.

The State suggests that Burnett's trial counsel could have had tactical reasons for not objecting to Expert's testimony: in the State's view, counsel could have decided not to object because Expert's testimony supported, at least in part, defense's theory that Victim fabricated her allegations against Burnett. The State asserts that Expert\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   repeatedly testified that the types of physical and psychological symptoms [Victim] happened to exhibit were common among people who experience severe childhood trauma, not just sexual abuse. And trial counsel drew out testimony that divorce could be one such trauma. Even though [Expert] testified that child sexual abuse was a more likely cause than divorce, [Expert's] testimony supported the defense at least in part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   We are not persuaded, chiefly because this tactical reason could only possibly apply to the first portion of Expert's testimony, discussed above, in which Expert testified that certain symptoms were more common in sexual abuse victims than in the general population. Any tactical advantage in allowing Expert to so testify would have been realized by Expert's admissible testimony; the State's proffered tactical reason therefore offers no possible reason for counsel not to have objected to the second (inadmissible) portion of Expert's testimony. We simply cannot imagine any convincing tactical reason for counsel to have consciously decided not to raise a\n   <em>\n    Rammel\n   </em>\n   objection to Expert's testimony regarding credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b638 And we think it rather evident that Expert's testimony regarding credibility was prejudicial to Burnett. Indeed, we have already determined that the potential for unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value the testimony might have had. In order \"[t]o prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, [Burnett] must demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance was prejudicial-i.e., that it affected the outcome of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In discussing the evidence in the record that might corroborate Victim's account, the prosecutor referred the jury to Expert's testimony about credibility, and reminded the jury that Victim had \"no ax to grind\" and that she had offered \"specific and unusual disclosures\" that Expert had indicated were \"more reliable.\" This argument was the last thing the jury heard before beginning its deliberations. The prosecution's emphasis in closing argument of Expert's testimony regarding credibility is not only an indicator that the State considered that testimony important corroborative evidence, but also that the testimony was important enough to make a difference.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In so doing, experts\n   may offer an opinion that symptoms are \"consistent with,\" or even \"an indicator of,\" sexual abuse. In this context, it is not necessarily impermissible for hypothetical questions to be asked of such an expert about whether the expert would be \"concerned about\" sexual abuse if a patient exhibited certain symptoms, since this is simply a different way of asking whether symptoms are \"consistent with\" abuse. Thus, the part of Expert's testimony that discussed symptoms in this way was proper, and Burnett's trial counsel was not ineffective by not objecting to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b643 However, not even properly qualified experts are permitted to offer statistical evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, that informs the jury, even indirectly, that a witness is more or less likely to be telling the truth on a particular occasion. Such evidence constitutes improper comment on a witness's credibility, and \"invites the jury to focus upon a seemingly scientific, numerical conclusion rather than to analyze the evidence before it and decide where truth lies.\"\n   <em>\n    Rammel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409004\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/721/498/\">\n    721 P.2d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The part of Expert's testimony in which he informed the jury that only a \"small percentage\" of sexual abuse allegations are fabricated, and in which he discussed some of the techniques he uses as an expert to distinguish between cases involving true allegations and cases involving fabricated allegations, was categorically inadmissible. Counsel had no conceivable tactical reason not to object to that testimony, and there is at least a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the testimony been excluded.

Second, Burnett contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate the case. In addition to these claims, Burnett also filed a motion under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure in support of additional claims that his counsel was ineffective.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R.

As explained in this opinion, we agree, at least in part, with Burnett's initial contention that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by not properly objecting to portions of Expert's testimony. We remand the case for a new trial on that basis, and therefore have no occasion to address Burnett's additional challenges on appeal.
