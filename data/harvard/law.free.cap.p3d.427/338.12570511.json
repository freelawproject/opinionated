True and Melissa L. True appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), dismissing on the basis of governmental immunity their claim that injuries they sustained in a traffic accident resulted from UDOT's negligence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Accident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 In June 2009, a construction project was underway in Ogden, Utah, to install a water main line under a certain intersection. Because the project involved \"digging or excavating\" on a state highway, the project's general contractor had been required by law to obtain a permit from UDOT before beginning construction. The contractor had duly submitted the permit application before starting construction, which included submission of a traffic control plan. UDOT approved the traffic control plan and then issued the contractor the appropriate permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 The permit \"granted [the contractor] permission to encroach on [the] state highway\" and \"identified the what, when and where of [the contractor's] authorization.\" It also required the contractor to notify a UDOT permit inspector twenty-four hours before starting the work and generally provided that \"[a]n inspector may be required at permittee's expense, with 48 hours notice.\" Failure to comply with the \"regulations, specifications, or instructions pertinent to [the] permit\" could result in UDOT either suspending or \"stopping all or any part of the work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 UDOT assigned a transportation technician to perform inspections of the project, as provided in the permit. The technician \"regularly inspected the job site and supported [the contractor] in its efforts to implement and comply with the traffic control plan.\" The technician's duties included inspecting the traffic control at the site, making sure that it conformed to the traffic control plan, and generally monitoring the construction's effect on the highway. However, the technician was not present at the project site every day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 19, 2009, the Trues were riding a motorcycle together in Ogden. As they rode through the intersection undergoing construction, they were struck by a truck turning left into the intersection. Both Trues were injured, and they brought a negligence action against UDOT, the contractor, and the\n   truck driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trues asserted that UDOT was negligent on three grounds: (1) \"approving an unsafe traffic control plan\"; (2) \"failing to maintain a safe intersection\"; and (3) \"failing to properly monitor the traffic control to ensure it was being carried out in accordance with the plan.\" In particular, the Trues asserted that UDOT was negligent in \"allowing the removal of a no-left-turn sign days before the collision took place, contrary to the traffic control plan,\" and that, had the sign remained in place, the truck driver would have been prevented from turning left into their path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 UDOT moved for summary judgment. For purposes of its motion, UDOT conceded that the Trues' injuries were \"proximately caused by a negligent act or omission\" sufficient to waive its immunity, but it argued that it nonetheless retained immunity from suit through the permit exception to the waiver of immunity provided in section 63G-7-301(5)(c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah (the Act). Specifically, UDOT contended that it retained immunity because the Trues' injuries \"arose out of, in connection with, or resulted from\" the issuance of the permit to the contractor. At the time UDOT filed and argued its motion, the Utah Supreme Court had interpreted the \"arose out of, in connection with, or resulted from\" language as establishing a \"but-for\" causation standard. Accordingly, UDOT argued that all of the Trues' allegations were connected to the issuance of the permit and that \"but for\" the permit's issuance, no accident or injury would have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Trues argued, in contrast, that their claims of negligence \"arose not from issuance of the permit, but from UDOT's own negligence in failing to ensure that the intersection was safe during construction.\" They contended that UDOT \"had a duty to maintain the intersection in a safe condition independently from the issuance of the permit for the construction work\" and that UDOT had breached that duty by approving the unsafe traffic control plan, failing to maintain a safe intersection, and failing to properly monitor the traffic control situation at the intersection. They also argued that UDOT's negligent actions could not \"be characterized as formal, official acts,\" as required for the permit exception to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The district court orally granted UDOT's summary judgment motion during the hearing on the motion, and it directed counsel for UDOT to prepare an order. The court determined that issuing the permit to the contractor constituted a formal, official act and stated that UDOT would retain immunity for actions \"related to[ ] [or] arising out of the issuance of the permit.\" The court further concluded that the specific actions complained of by the Trues-approving the traffic control plan, failing to maintain a safe intersection, and failing to properly inspect the intersection-arose from, were related to, and \"came as a result of UDOT issuing the Permit.\" Consequently, the court determined that but for the issuance of the permit, the injuries would not have occurred, and that UDOT therefore retained immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Issuance of\n   </em>\n   Barneck\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court held the summary judgment hearing on June 11, 2015. One day later, the Utah Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Barneck v. Utah Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    2015 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    353 P.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that decision, the supreme court repudiated the \"but-for\" causation standard that had previously been applied to determine whether an injury \"arises out of, in connection with, or results from\" the exceptions listed in Utah Code section 63G-7-301(5), including the permit exception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. In its place, the court adopted a proximate cause standard for determining whether an injury was sufficiently related to an enumerated exception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 38, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 On June 16, 2015, counsel for UDOT sent the court a letter advising the court of\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   UDOT's counsel explained his belief that the court's oral ruling was still correct even under the new causation standard, but he requested an opportunity to brief the issue if the court chose to revisit its summary judgment decision. UDOT's counsel copied the Trues' counsel on the letter. The Trues did not respond to the letter or otherwise ask the court to reevaluate its summary judgment decision in light of the new causation standard established in\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   . UDOT filed its proposed order on July 27, 2015, which the Trues approved as to form, and the district court entered its written order granting summary judgment on July 29, 2015, approximately fifty days after the court issued its oral ruling during the hearing. The case remained pending for nearly another year, during which time the Trues settled their claims against the other defendants. The district court entered final judgment as to all parties and claims on July 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Trues timely appealed the district court's July 29, 2015 summary judgment order in favor of UDOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Trues argue on appeal that the district court improperly granted UDOT's motion for summary judgment, challenging the district court's determination that UDOT retained immunity under the permit exception to immunity waiver. Specifically, they contend that UDOT's issuance of the construction permit did not proximately cause the accident and their injuries; therefore, UDOT did not have immunity under the permit exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 \"We review the district court's decision granting summary judgment de novo, affording it no deference,\" and in doing so, \"we determine whether UDOT has established that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Barneck v.

On appeal, the Trues argue for the first time that UDOT was not immune from suit under the permit exception of the Act because UDOT's issuance of the permit did not proximately cause the accident and their injuries. In particular, they contend that, through its negligent actions, UDOT waived its immunity, and that no waiver exception applied to effectively reinstate its immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 \"We typically apply a three-part test to determine whether a governmental entity enjoys immunity under the Act for the challenged activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Winkler v.

UDOT concedes that\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   changed the causation standard applicable to whether immunity could be reinstated pursuant to a waiver exception and that all of the \"litigation preceding [the district court's verbal summary judgment] ruling, including the summary judgment briefing and the extensive discovery conducted[,]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ... proceeded under what was then the governing pre-\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   standard.\" However, UDOT contends that, despite having ample opportunity to raise the new causation standard as a basis for revisiting the summary judgment motion, the Trues failed to do so.

The change in the applicable law announced in\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   occurred one day after the district court orally announced its summary judgment decision, and approximately fifty days elapsed between the time\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   was decided and when the district court entered the written summary judgment order. The Trues were apparently aware of\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   within days of its issuance, yet they did not ask the district court to revisit its summary judgment decision.

The Trues assert that\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that, in addition to causation, \"two elements ... must be satisfied\" for the permit exception to apply. First,\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   states that the governmental entity must have the legal authority, derived through \"legislative or executive enactment,\" to issue, deny, suspend, or revoke permits (and thereby \"give legal authority\" to the entity requesting the permit).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (quotation simplified). Second,\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   states that the actions complained of must be \"formal\" and \"official\" in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13-15 (explaining that the language of the permit exception \"can be separated into two categories of terms: those relating to the governmental action,\" such as \"issuance, denial, suspension, or revocation,\" and \"those relating to the object of that action,\" such as \"permit, license, certificate, [or] approval,\" and concluding that the permit exception \"applies only to formal, official, regulatory authorizations by a governmental entity empowered to issue, deny, suspend, or revoke\" permits (quotation simplified) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 44 Here, the district court determined that the issuance of the permit was itself a formal and official action, that UDOT was immune \"with respect to any injury\" caused by issuing the permit, and that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the specific actions alleged by the Trues as negligent and ultimately harmful-\"approving an unsafe traffic control plan, failing to maintain a safe intersection, and ... failing to properly monitor the traffic control [at the site] to ensure it was being carried out in accordance with the plan\"-were caused by the issuance of the formal, official permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 45 The Trues \"concede that UDOT had the statutory authority to approve the traffic control plan, monitor traffic control, restrict access to roads at the construction site, and supervise others at the site.\" They also apparently do not challenge the district court's determination that the issuance of the permit itself was a formal, official action. But they contend that UDOT's decisions \"\n   <em>\n    regarding traffic safety at the construction site\n   </em>\n   cannot be characterized as formal, official authorizations,\" because there was \"no formal official action taken ... when UDOT failed to maintain the intersection in a safe condition and failed to adequately supervise others at the scene by allowing the removal of the no-left-turn sign.\" (Emphasis added.) As a result, the Trues assert that the permit exception does not apply, and UDOT therefore does not retain immunity. They request reversal on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 46 However, apart from contending that UDOT took no formal, official actions related to the worksite's safety and inspection itself, the Trues have not explained why, given the district court's overall determination that all of the complained-of actions arose from a formal, official permit issuance, it is appropriate for us to nonetheless separately analyze the formality of certain allegedly negligent worksite actions. Under the law in effect at the time of the summary judgment hearing, this conclusion aligned with precedent on the issue of causation and the extent to which the issuance of a license or permit, and other actions flowing from issuing a permit, may be properly characterized as causing certain harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moss v.

The district court did not sign its summary judgment order dismissing the claims against UDOT until July 29, 2015, and because the Trues possessed claims against other parties in the case that were not finally adjudicated until July 20, 2016, some thirteen months elapsed between the issuance of\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   and the issuance of a final appealable order in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 55 The majority appears to fault the Trues for failing, during that thirteen-month period, to bring the matter back to the attention of the district court by way of a motion\n   for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39 &amp; n.5.

For instance, if the change in the law occurs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the notice of appeal is\n   filed, appeals proceed normally, and there has never been any suggestion, in such a case, that the matter should be returned to the district court so that the district court could consider the matter anew in light of the change in the governing law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985833\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/828/\">\n    2011 UT 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 &amp; n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985833\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/828/\">\n    266 P.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that appellate courts \"routinely consider new authority relevant to issues that have properly been preserved,\" and stating that \"we have always allowed parties to supplement an argument with new cases or relevant legislative history that they did not raise in the district court\"). Indeed, our rules of appellate procedure specifically contemplate situations where a party to an appeal may, for various reasons, need to bring new authority to the appellate court's attention after briefing or oral argument but before an appellate court has issued its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. App. P. 24(j) (\"When authority of central importance to an issue comes to the attention of a party after briefing or oral argument but before decision, that party may file a notice of supplemental authority.\"). In this case, if\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   had been issued after the filing of a notice of appeal (rather than while the case was still pending before the district court), I suspect that UDOT would not even have argued that the issue was unpreserved. But there is no practical reason-at least not one related to the capability of appellate courts to consider such an issue-that counsels in favor of treating the Trues' situation any differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 58 Third, I see line-drawing problems with the majority's resolution of the preservation issue, which problems may not be present here but will undoubtedly be present in future cases. There are, to be sure, aspects of this case that could give a person reason to question the Trues' decision not to bring the matter back to the attention of the district court after\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   . After all, under the unique circumstances of this case, they had thirteen months to do so, and thirteen months is a long time. Moreover, the change in the law articulated by\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   was a fairly clear one. But these factors present in the Trues' situation will not always be so clearly present in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 59 The first line-drawing problem I perceive is a temporal one. A party who is given thirteen months to bring the matter back to the district court for reconsideration is certainly capable, as a practical matter, of doing so. But what about a party who is given two months? One month? Two weeks? One week? One day? At some point, a party will not have enough time to bring a motion to reconsider, let alone have that motion adjudicated, before final judgment enters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   I see no way to draw a temporal line that makes any principled sense, and I do not think we should engage in the effort. I would much rather fall back to a clear line that is defensible on something other than an ad hoc basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 60 The second line-drawing problem I perceive is a legal one, involving the definition of what would be considered a \"change in the law\" momentous enough to require the filing of a motion to reconsider, as distinguished from minor statutory or common-law tweaks that have little effect on the litigation of a case and would not, even under the majority's analysis, present a preservation problem. Diligent attorneys who might not be certain where that line might lie will have no choice but to pre-emptively file motions for reconsideration, because failure to do so might result in loss of the right to appeal an issue. We should not create requirements that incentivize the filing of additional motions to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 61 When applying our prudential, discretionary doctrine of preservation, we should err in close cases-if err we must-on the side of allowing parties to bring claims and on the side of adjudicating claims on their merits. Accordingly, I think it an unwise exercise of our discretion to require parties to file motions to reconsider in order to\n   preserve issues that have been squarely presented to the district court under the law in effect at the time those issues were briefed, argued, and decided. I do not think that the Trues had an obligation to file any such motion, and in my view the Trues did everything they needed to do in order to preserve the issue for appellate review. I would therefore reach the merits of the question presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 62 On the merits of the governmental immunity question, in my view the district court correctly ruled that UDOT is immune from the Trues' lawsuit based on the Act's immunity-invoking exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 63 The Act, as formulated in 2009,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated as a general proposition that \"each governmental entity and each employee of a governmental entity are immune from suit for any injury that results from the exercise of a governmental function.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-201(1) (LexisNexis 2008). However, the Act waives governmental immunity in certain circumstances, and some of the waivers contain exceptions. Thus, in cases where a governmental entity asserts that it is immune from suit pursuant to the Act, we apply a three-part test to determine whether immunity exists.\n   <em>\n    Thayer v.

In\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   , however, our supreme court \"repudiated the language of some of [its] prior decisions\" and held that \"an immunity-invoking condition\" (such as the issuance of a permit or license) \"must be a\n   <em>\n    proximate\n   </em>\n   cause of the plaintiff's injuries in order to sustain the reinstatement of immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    2015 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    353 P.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, after\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   , the dispositive question in the case is whether UDOT's conduct associated with its issuance of the permit, and with its inspections conducted\n   thereunder, was a proximate cause of the Trues' injuries. In my view, that dispositive question must be answered in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 66 UDOT's involvement in this matter began in May 2009 when it issued a formal permit allowing the project contractor to begin road work on the state highway in question. Indeed, the Trues conceded, at the district court, that there was no evidence that the state highway was unsafe before the construction project began. By issuing the permit, UDOT allowed the work to proceed, but it imposed a number of conditions and requirements upon the contractor, including the following: (a) that, before beginning any work, the contractor \"shall notify\" UDOT's permit inspector; (b) that commencement of the work \"is understood to indicate that the [contractor] will comply with all [of UDOT's] instruction and regulations\"; and (c) that UDOT may inspect the work at any time, with 48 hours' notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 67 The Trues complain that UDOT was negligent by \"approving an unsafe traffic control plan and then subsequently failing to make sure the plan was carried out.\" But UDOT correctly points out that its involvement in approving (or not approving) any traffic control plan for the project, or in following up by way of inspection to make sure that any such traffic control plan was in fact followed, was involvement that stemmed entirely from UDOT's permit and, specifically, from the authority it retained, pursuant to the terms of the permit, to inspect the work and to require the contractor to comply with UDOT's \"instruction and regulations.\" UDOT's only involvement with this project was because of its permit. Everything UDOT did on this project was because of its role as permittor and inspector of the project. If a UDOT permit had not been required, UDOT would have had no involvement with this project whatsoever, and would not have been in a position to approve any traffic control plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 68 The district court, on these facts, correctly determined that there was at least a \"but-for\" causal relationship between UDOT's permit and the Trues' injuries, and therefore the \"permit exception\" applied to render UDOT immune from suit. The Trues do not directly challenge this determination on appeal; instead, they rely upon the new \"proximate cause\" standard articulated by\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   , and argue that proximate cause is not present here. Because it decided the matter prior to\n   <em>\n    Barneck\n   </em>\n   , the district court was not asked to consider whether a causal link stronger than \"but-for\" causation existed on these facts. But I have no trouble reaching this conclusion on the undisputed facts set forth in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 69 This court has defined \"[p]roximate cause\" as \" 'that cause which, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new cause, produced the injury, and without which the injury would not have occurred.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dee v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980328\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/286/22/\">\n    2012 UT App 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980328\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/286/22/\">\n    286 P.3d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bunker v.

There are two components of \"proximate cause\": but-for causation, and foreseeability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. (stating that \"foreseeability is an element of proximate cause\" (quotation simplified) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Model Utah Jury Instructions 2d (MUJI) CV209 (2016), https://www.utcourts.gov/resources/muji/inc_list.asp?action=showRule &amp; id=2#209 [https://perma.cc/KV6J-LF4Q] (stating that the first element of \"cause\" is that \"the person's act or failure to act produced the harm directly or set in motion events that produced the harm in a natural and continuous sequence,\" and that the second element of \"cause\" is that \"the person's act or failure to act could be foreseen by a reasonable person to produce a harm of the same general nature\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 70 The first element of proximate cause is unquestionably present here. As the district court determined, there is at least a \"but-for\" causal link between UDOT's issuance of the permit and the Trues' injuries. If UDOT had not issued the permit, the project would never have taken place, traffic would never have been diverted or controlled to facilitate the project, and the Trues' injuries would not have happened. As noted, the Trues do not mount any kind of serious argument that \"but-for\" causation is not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 71 But it is no less clear that foreseeability, and therefore proximate causation, is also\n   present. UDOT's approval of any specific traffic control plan was given pursuant to its authority under the issued permit. In addition, UDOT's authority to inspect the premises to make sure that any traffic control plan it approved was actually being followed was also authority that it possessed by virtue of its permit. It is certainly foreseeable, as a matter of law, that UDOT's actions in approving and monitoring traffic control plans pursuant to that permitting and inspection authority, if carried out negligently, might injure motorists whose traffic was affected by the control plan. Thus, in my view, both elements of proximate cause are present here, and the causal link between UDOT's permitting and inspection actions and the Trues' injuries is therefore strong enough to constitute \"proximate cause,\" and not just \"but-for\" causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holmstrom v.

The Trues correctly assert that, in order for the \"permit exception\" to apply, two requirements must be met: authority and formality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winkler v. Lemieux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931825\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/329/849/\">\n    2014 UT App 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931825\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/329/849/\">\n    329 P.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that there are two requirements for invocation of the \"permit exception\": \"authority and formality\"). The Trues \"concede that UDOT had the statutory authority to approve the traffic control plan, monitor traffic control, restrict access to roads at the construction site, and supervise others at the site.\" They argue, however, that UDOT's actions were not sufficiently formal to meet the formality requirement. Their arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b6 73 With regard to UDOT's decision to issue the permit in the first place, there is no question that the formality requirement is met. In this case, a permit from UDOT was required by statute before the contractor could \"dig or excavate\" on the state highway in question,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2072-7-102\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 72-7-102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2008), and UDOT had an institutional procedure for consideration and approval of requests for such permits. There is no dispute, on the facts of this case, that UDOT considered and issued the permit pursuant to that formal procedure, or that the permit is a formal document bearing the signatures of UDOT officials. At a minimum, UDOT's issuance of the permit was a formal, official act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 74 The Trues argue, however, that UDOT's decisions after issuance of the permit-such as, for instance, approving and monitoring specific traffic control plans-were not formal enough to satisfy the formality requirement, but these arguments are unconvincing. In this case, the traffic control plan was created by a consultant, and was a three-page written document with maps and charts that called for the specific placement of signs, barrels, and other traffic control devices. Moreover, UDOT's approval of the plan was an act carried out pursuant to authority granted to UDOT by the terms of a formal written permit. In my view, UDOT's actions in approving this particular traffic control plan differ from governmental actions deemed potentially too informal to qualify for immunity pursuant to the \"permit exception.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Thayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20UT%2031\">\n    2012 UT 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4, 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982584\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/285/1142/\">\n    285 P.3d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that school administrators' approval of the use of a firearm in a school play was insufficiently formal);\n   <em>\n    Winkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931825\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/329/849/\">\n    2014 UT App 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6931825\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/329/849/\">\n    329 P.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the record was \"insufficient to support a legal conclusion that [a] flagger's [traffic] signal\" was sufficiently formal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 75 Moreover, I do not need to grapple with the question of whether UDOT's alleged failure to monitor implementation of the approved traffic control plan was sufficiently formal, because the district court determined that UDOT enjoys immunity-on a ground other than the \"permit exception\"-from the Trues' claims that it failed to properly monitor traffic control plans for the construction site, and the Trues have failed to appeal that portion of the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 76 Under the Act, UDOT is also immune from suit if the Trues' injuries were proximately caused by UDOT's \"failure to make an inspection or making an inadequate or\n   negligent inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-301(5)(d) (LexisNexis 2008).

The Trues' failure to challenge the district court's independent ground for decision is fatal to their appeal of the district court's decision in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
