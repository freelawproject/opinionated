The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sanpete County, ruling that the county did not owe Brady a duty of care. Because we conclude that the public duty doctrine applies and that Sanpete County did not form a special relationship with Brady, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 After a motorist hit and killed a deer on SR-89 outside of Gunnison, Utah, she called Sanpete County's dispatch center at 6:21 a.m. to report the incident and notify authorities that the deer was lying in the middle of the road. Unfortunately, Utah Highway Patrol-the agency responsible for responding to such calls-never received notification of this dangerous road condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 At approximately 6:50 a.m., a second motorist, who was driving northbound on SR-89, hit the deer carcass, causing her vehicle to cross the center line and collide head-on with Brady's vehicle. Both drivers died as a result of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Simonses sued Sanpete County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [b]ut for the negligence of [Sanpete County], the Second Motorist would not have hit the dead deer carcass, would not have lost control of her vehicle, would not have crossed over into Brady's lane, and would not have collided with Brady resulting in the Accident and serious injuries which took Brady's life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Sanpete County filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the public duty doctrine bars the Simonses' negligence claims as a matter of law. In granting summary judgment, the district court concluded that the public duty doctrine applies in this case because Sanpete County's obligation to maintain its highways extends to anyone who may travel on them, and its failure to remove the deer carcass was an omission that did not\n   contribute to the danger that otherwise existed. In addition, the district court determined that no special relationship had been created by statute or by Sanpete County's conduct. Accordingly, the court concluded that \"the public duty doctrine prevents [the Simonses'] recovery in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The Simonses timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The Simonses contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Sanpete County. Specifically, the Simonses argue that (1) the public duty doctrine is inapplicable because Sanpete County performed an affirmative act when the dispatcher answered the warning call and (2) upon learning of the dangerous road condition, Sanpete County formed a special relationship with Brady making it reasonable to impose a duty of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 We review a district court's legal conclusions and grant of summary judgment for correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orvis v.

It is undisputed that the Simonses' theory of liability rests upon a public duty; the question is therefore whether Sanpete County failed to discharge that duty by omission or whether it engaged in affirmative acts outside the scope of the public duty doctrine. Because we conclude that Sanpete County's conduct (or lack thereof) was an omission, we next consider whether the special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I. Sanpete County's Alleged Negligence Constituted an Omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 The Simonses contend that the public duty doctrine is inapplicable to this case because Sanpete County performed an affirmative act when it \"worked to become the designated\n   911 call center\"; therefore, according to the Simonses, the dispatcher had a duty to act reasonably when answering the warning call and receiving detailed information about the dangerous road condition. In response, Sanpete County contends that the public duty doctrine applies to this case because \"the alleged failure to report the deer carcass to Utah Highway Patrol is an omission by Sanpete County, not an affirmative act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Utah Supreme Court has determined that the public duty doctrine applies only to a government actor's omissions, not its affirmative acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cope v.

In other words, \"a negligent affirmative act leaves the plaintiff positively worse off as a result of the wrongful act, whereas in cases of negligent omissions, the plaintiff's situation is unchanged; she is merely deprived of a protection which, had it been afforded her, would have benefitted her.\"\n   <em>\n    Faucheaux v.

In the complaint, the Simonses claim that Sanpete County failed to notify Utah Highway Patrol of the dangerous condition, remove the deer carcass from the highway, or warn motorists. According to the Simonses, Sanpete County should be held liable for its inaction because, \"by taking the warning call and receiving specific information about a specific accident in a specific location, [Sanpete County] put its figurative 'hand to the plow' such that it had a duty to go forward.\" The Simonses' argument is based on the Utah Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the Simonses contend that \"[j]ust as Utah Valley State College assumed a duty to act reasonably when it took the affirmative action of offering a ballroom dance class and hiring a dance instructor, once Sanpete County determined to be the 911 call center ... and hired dispatchers to take calls and dispatch them in emergency situations, it took on the specific affirmative duty to act reasonably.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 The lawsuit in\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   arose when a student sued her college because she was injured after a ballroom dance instructor encouraged her to perform a lift that she and her partner had never successfully completed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889854\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/342/243/\">\n    2014 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889854\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/342/243/\">\n    342 P.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In concluding that the college's conduct amounted to an affirmative act, the court determined that the college's actions \"had advanced to a stage where it had a duty to act in a reasonable manner to prevent injuries caused by participation with the dance team.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Sanpete County's conduct is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Cope\n   </em>\n   .
