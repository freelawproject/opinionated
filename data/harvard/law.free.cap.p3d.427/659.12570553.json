We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   KASSNER'S PLEA AND SUBSEQUENT MOTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Russell Kassner allegedly began sexually abusing one of his adopted sisters when he was 10 and she was 4. The sexual abuse allegedly continued until Kassner was 17 and his adopted sister was 11. While law enforcement investigated, Kassner turned 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In late November 1995, the State charged Kassner in adult court with one count of first degree child molestation, related to when he was 10, and one count of second degree child rape, related to when he was 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In March 1996, the parties reached a plea deal. Kassner agreed to plead guilty to the older first degree child molestation charge, and the State agreed to dismiss the more serious rape charge. The State also agreed to recommend a special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) and to bring no further charges against Kassner arising from the underlying investigation. That month, Kassner pleaded guilty to the older charge and the State dismissed the more serious charge. In May 1996, the trial court sentenced Kassner consistent with the State's SSOSA recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In June 2017, Kassner moved to vacate his 1996 first degree child molestation conviction. Kassner argued that the trial court failed to conduct a hearing, as required by RCW 9A.04.050, on whether he had sufficient capacity to commit the crime when he was 10. The trial court denied Kassner's motion. It reasoned, \"the defendant was charged in adult court after he became an adult, he was represented by counsel, and he negotiated a beneficial plea agreement that conveyed clear benefit to him.\" Clerk's Papers at 49. The trial court also found that Kassner's motion to vacate his conviction was not brought within a reasonable time, and that granting the motion would work an injustice against the State in having to prosecute a second degree child rape charge that was previously dismissed through negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Kassner timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   KASSNER'S MOTION TO STRIKE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Kassner filed a motion to strike \"Attachment A\" to the State's brief. Attachment A is a presentence investigation report. Kassner argued that the report was not part of the record considered by the 2017 trial court. The State responded that the report was filed in the confidential portion of the clerk's record, but the report was lost when the record was scanned years ago. The report contains an admission by 18-year-old Kassner that he had begun molesting his adopted sister when he was 14 or 15, and she was 7 or 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 In denying Kassner's motion, our court commissioner ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Kassner pleaded guilty before the report was compiled, but the court did not enter its judgment and sentence on that plea until after the report. The report is relevant to whether Mr. Kassner had the capacity to commit the crime under RCW 9A.04.050, even though he was an adult when convicted. Its timing may or may not be material and is subject to argument before the panel that decides this appeal. But for our purpose here, this Court has determined that the ends of justice are served by adding the report, whether or not it satisfies all the requirements of RAP 9.11(a) for additional evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In adopting Washington Constitution, article IV, section 6, the people of this state granted the superior courts original jurisdiction \"in all criminal cases amounting to felony\" and in several other enumerated types of cases and proceedings.
