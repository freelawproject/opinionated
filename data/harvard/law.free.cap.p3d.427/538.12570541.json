Jones's abuse continued until Victim was eleven years old and ranged from showing Victim pornographic images to sodomizing and raping her. The State charged Jones with child rape, as well as other crimes. The case proceeded to trial where defense counsel objected to the child rape elements in the jury instructions, asserting that the child rape statutes were unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. The trial court denied\n   Jones's motion and he now appeals. We reject his arguments in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Victim had an unstable childhood. Due to her parents' continued physical abuse and drug use, she went to live with an aunt and uncle. Unfortunately, the instability continued in her new home. Beginning when Victim was just eight years old, Jones, who was living in the same home as Victim, began sexually abusing her and continued to do so until she was eleven years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The abuse began with Jones touching her breasts and vagina, then escalated to digital penetration, mutual masturbation, oral sex, and vaginal and anal intercourse. Jones also showed Victim pornographic material online and took \"photographs of her lying on his bed with her clothes off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In August 2014, after multiple incidents of child abuse and drug abuse at the home of the aunt and uncle, Victim was removed from that home permanently. Several months later, Victim began seeing a Division of Child and Family Services therapist. Over the course of several sessions, Victim disclosed the sexual abuse Jones had inflicted on her. Upon disclosure, Victim was interviewed by a Child Protection Services investigator and once again, Victim revealed that she had been sexually abused by Jones. Officers then obtained search warrants for Jones's home, cell phone, and computers, where they discovered more than six pornographic images of children under the age of eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Jones was arrested and the State charged him with eighteen counts in total: three counts of child rape; three counts of child sodomy; three counts of aggravated child sexual abuse; six counts of sexual exploitation of a minor; and three counts of dealing in material harmful to a minor. At trial, Victim's testimony on the rape charges alleged not only touching, but also penetration. A nurse corroborated Victim's statement, testifying that Victim had disclosed that Jones had put his penis \"into\" her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 During trial, the parties discussed jury instructions. Defense counsel objected to the elements instruction on the child rape charges, asserting that the child rape statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel alleged that Utah Code section 76-5-407\"only requires touching,\" rather than penetration, which meant that the conduct \"merged\" with \"aggravated sexual abuse of a child.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State responded that the distinction between child rape and aggravated child sexual abuse was the body parts involved-\"for child rape, it had to be genital-to-genital contact; for aggravated child sex abuse, it could be genital contact with other body parts.\" Ultimately, the trial court rejected Jones's argument and overruled his objection to the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The jury convicted Jones on one count of child rape, one count of child sodomy, three counts of aggravated child sexual abuse, two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, and three counts of dealing in material harmful to a minor. Jones timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On appeal, Jones raises two issues. First, he argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that Utah Code section 76-5-402.1 (Rape of a Child), as modified by Utah Code section 76-5-407(2)(b)(v) (Applicability of Part), is not unconstitutionally overbroad. Second, Jones contends that the trial court incorrectly ruled that Utah Code section 76-5-402.1, when read in conjunction with Utah Code section 76-5-407(2)(b)(v), is not unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 \"Constitutional challenges to statutes present questions of law, which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Provo City Corp. v.

Certainly there is no constitutional right to touch a child's genitals as part of sexual intercourse, no matter how sexual intercourse might be defined.
