As part of this venture, Young Resources Limited Partnership agreed to contribute real property to PPLR to serve as the site of the landfill, subject to certain restrictions. When the property was conveyed to PPLR, however, the warranty deed failed to reflect those restrictions. PPLR then sold the unencumbered property to Promontory Landfill LLC in 2004. Nearly twelve years later, Young Resources brought this lawsuit, which the district court dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations and the merger doctrine. Because we agree with the district court that Young Resources' claims are barred by the statute of limitations, we affirm on that basis without reaching the alternative ground for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Young Resources, Samuel N. Chournos, and Kerry Zundel formed PPLR for the purpose of developing a landfill in Box Elder County, Utah. They agreed that Zundel would act as manager and provide the necessary capital, and that Chournos and Young Resources would contribute real property that they separately owned to serve as the site of the landfill (the Landfill Area). Under PPLR's Operating Agreement, Zundel did not have authority to \"[e]ncumber or do anything affecting the use of Company Property without prior consent of all Members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Before conveying the real property to PPLR, Young Resources and Chournos entered into an Amended Operating Agreement with Zundel. Young Resources and Chournos agreed to contribute equal property acreage to PPLR for the Landfill Area, reserving the \"appurtenant water or mineral rights.\" In addition, the Amended Operating Agreement provided that Young Resources and Chournos would retain a reversionary interest in the property, which entitled them to the return of their property if the Landfill Area had not been developed within five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 To facilitate the transfer of Young Resources' property to PPLR, Zundel provided Young Resources with a warranty deed (the First Warranty Deed). Contrary to the terms of the Amended Operating Agreement, the First Warranty Deed purported to transfer all of Young Resources' interest in the property without any reservations or conditions. Young Resources executed the First Warranty Deed, and Zundel recorded it in April 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In 2004, PPLR transferred the Landfill Area to Promontory Landfill, another company managed by Zundel. According to Young Resources, Zundel made this transfer \"without notice to [PPLR's] members and without receiving authority from all members.\" Like the First Warranty Deed, the deed transferring the Landfill Area to Promontory Landfill (the Second Warranty Deed) did not contain a right of reverter or the reservation of water and mineral rights. The Second Warranty Deed was recorded in April 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In 2016, Young Resources sued Promontory Landfill and PPLR (collectively, Defendants), alleging that Zundel lacked authority to transfer the property and that any transfer was subject to the conditions contained in the Amended Operating Agreement. The Claims 1, 2, 3, and 7 are at issue in this appeal. In Claim 1, Young Resources seeks a declaratory judgment derivatively on behalf of PPLR\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   quieting title against Promontory Landfill on the ground that \"Zundel did not have authority to convey the Young Resources Property to Promontory Landfill without the consent of Young Resources.\" If the court grants relief on Claim 1, Claim 2 seeks a judgment against PPLR that Young Resources is entitled to the return of the property not developed within five years, as provided by the Amended Operating Agreement. In the alternative, Claim 3 seeks a declaratory judgment that Promontory Landfill is not a bona fide purchaser but took the property from PPLR subject to the right of reverter in the Amended Operating Agreement. Claim 7, also in the alternative, seeks a\n   declaratory judgment that PPLR's rights and duties with respect to the Landfill Area were nonassignable and could not be transferred to Promontory Landfill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In response to these claims, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted the motion to dismiss, ruling that the claims were barred by both the merger doctrine and the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On appeal, Young Resources challenges the dismissal of Claims 1, 2, 3, and 7 based on the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss admits the facts alleged in the complaint but challenges the plaintiff's right to relief based on those facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Oakwood Village LLC v.

While there are several different statutes of limitations that could arguably apply to Young Resources' claims, the longest would be the seven-year statute of limitations for actions founded upon title to real estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Young Resources brought this action in 2016, nearly twelve years had elapsed since PPLR conveyed the property to Promontory Landfill, and nearly thirteen years had elapsed since Young Resources signed the First Warranty Deed that failed to reflect the intended restrictions. Thus, Young Resources' claims would appear to be time-barred even under the most generous statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Young Resources presents two arguments for holding otherwise. First, Young Resources argues that no statute of limitations applies to Claims 1 and 2 because they are \"true quiet title\" claims. Second, Young Resources argues that the statute of limitations on Claims 3 and 7 did not begin to run until the date its declaratory judgment claims \"became ripe,\" and that date cannot be determined from the pleadings. We examine each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I. Claims 1 and 2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Young Resources challenges the dismissal of its first two claims, arguing that no statute of limitations applies to Claim 1 because it seeks only to quiet title in\n   PPLR, and the specific performance sought in Claim 2 is dependent on prevailing on Claim 1. When \"the action is purely one to remove a cloud or to quiet the title to real property, the statute of limitations has no application.\"\n   <em>\n    Bangerter v.

Instead, Young Resources seeks to void the transfer to Promontory Landfill in order to\n   <em>\n    vest\n   </em>\n   title in PPLR.\n   <em>\n    See Hoopiiaina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463082\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/1129/\">\n    2006 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8463082\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/144/1129/\">\n    144 P.3d 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . PPLR has no colorable claim to title or ownership of the property without first establishing that Zundel lacked authority to transfer the property to Promontory Landfill. Consequently, Young Resources is seeking affirmative relief, not the removal of a cloud on existing title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Relying on the Utah Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hoopiiaina\n   </em>\n   , Young Resources nonetheless argues that \"a quiet title claim that involves only a question of authority to make a transfer of property is a 'true quiet title action' that has no statute of limitations.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) In\n   <em>\n    Hoopiiaina\n   </em>\n   , the property at issue had been conveyed to two irrevocable trusts to which the plaintiffs were beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Many years later, the grantor drafted a holographic will in which he purported to bequeath the same property to the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The plaintiffs sued to quiet title in the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. In its ruling, the Utah Supreme Court explained that because the property was placed in an irrevocable trust, the plaintiffs were immediately vested with equitable title in the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. And because the grantor could not bequeath something he did not own, the defendants held nothing more than an adverse claim to the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. As a result, the plaintiffs' quiet title claim was \"simply an action to remove an adverse claim to real property to which plaintiffs already [held] equitable title-in other words, a true quiet title action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616\n   <em>\n    Hoopiiaina\n   </em>\n   hinged not on whether the transfer to the defendants was authorized but on who held title to the property. After placing the property in an irrevocable trust, the grantor no longer owned the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32 -33. Our supreme court characterized the deed defendants recorded as no more than a \"wild deed,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32, that is, a deed \"executed by a grantor who does not have record ownership of the property,\"\n   <em>\n    Pioneer Builders Co. of Nev. v.

Contrary to Young Resources' argument, the controversy was not merely theoretical until PPLR and Promontory Landfill took the position that its rights had been extinguished. \"An accrued state of facts as opposed to a hypothetical state of facts\" arose when the Second Warranty Deed, by its very terms, did not reflect a right of reverter.\n   <em>\n    Alternative Options &amp; Services for Children v.

And, considering the record in this case, it is unnecessary to resolve that issue here. Once Defendants raised the statute of limitations defense in the motion to dismiss, Young Resources did not invoke the discovery rule in any way. Young Resources did not seek to amend its complaint, did not respond to the motion to dismiss with factual allegations that would\n   support application of the discovery rule, did not move to convert the motion to one for summary judgment so that it could present evidence regarding the timing of its discovery, and-most tellingly-did not even argue that the discovery rule applied. By any standard, Young Resources' failure to so much as mention the discovery rule is surely insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss where the complaint otherwise establishes that the limitations period has expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b634 Because it was plain from the face of the complaint that the statute of limitations began to run no later than the transfer of the property to Promontory Landfill in 2004, these claims were long since time-barred when Young Resources sued in 2016. Consequently, the district court properly granted Defendants' motion to dismiss Claims 3 and 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b635 The district court did not err in ruling that Claims 1, 2, 3, and 7 were barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    For purposes of the motion to dismiss, Defendants have not challenged Young Resources' right to bring a derivative action on behalf of PPLR.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Because the motion could be resolved without considering matters outside the pleadings, the district court deemed it unnecessary to convert the motion to one of summary judgment under rule 12(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Young Resources also contends that the district court erred in ruling that the merger doctrine barred these claims and that the collateral acts exception did not apply.
