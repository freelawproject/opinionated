Specifically, he argues that he did not receive his constitutionally guaranteed right to the effective assistance of counsel because his counsel had a conflict of interest, failed to object to certain testimony, and failed to move for a directed verdict with regard to two of the charges. We conclude that Defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice resulting from the alleged conflict of interest or hearsay testimony. But we agree that Defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to move for a directed verdict on two of the seven charges. We therefore vacate his convictions for those two charges but affirm in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A police officer (Officer), responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle, discovered Defendant and Defendant's fianc\u00e9e (Fianc\u00e9e) in the back seat of the vehicle. Officer asked Defendant for his identification, and Defendant handed over a California driver license with the name Victor Payan. Officer also asked Defendant for the vehicle's registration, and Defendant stated that he could not find the registration and that the vehicle belonged to a friend. A check of the vehicle's license plate showed that the vehicle had been reported stolen nine days earlier. Officer then arrested Defendant and Fianc\u00e9e and began an inventory search of the vehicle. Later, while being booked at the jail, Defendant admitted that he was not Victor Payan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 After night fell, the vehicle was taken to the sheriff's building's garage to be impounded, and several officers finished the inventory search that had been started earlier. In the course of the search, the police found \"a small white bindle container, plastic container, sitting on the passenger seat between where [Defendant and Fianc\u00e9e] were located.\" The police also found a binder containing \"several birth certificates,\" utility bills, and immunization records bearing the names of people who were not present. And the police found Defendant's wallet, from which he had taken the California driver license; the wallet also contained a Utah driver license with the name Victor Payan and two debit cards with other names. The police noticed holes in the vehicle's headliner fabric but apparently did not search that area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The police returned the vehicle to its owner. Several days later, the vehicle's owner discovered a package containing nearly one pound of methamphetamine inside the headliner and reported the find to the police. The package's street value was estimated at $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 A few days later, staff at the jail where Defendant was held searched the belongings of another inmate as part of the normal release procedures. In his belongings, staff found a jail request form with Defendant's signature on the front. The back of the form contained a note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Her name is Janet, Enrique's sister, tell her I got arrested and to go [to] my room and look for my address book. And download\n   the What's Up app,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and call my conecta,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   his name is Marcos and let him know I and my girlfriend got arrested with a stolen motor vehicle. Cops didn't find the dope and when car was released to the owners, they found out the dope, one and a half pounds of crystal in which they raise my bail to $50,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jail staff then reviewed surveillance tapes and reported finding a segment showing Defendant writing the note and giving it to the inmate being released. However, the staff failed to preserve the tape and instead recorded over it. In lieu of introducing the tape into evidence, the staff who watched the tape testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The State eventually charged Defendant with possession of a stolen motor vehicle, a second-degree felony,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1a-1316 (LexisNexis 2014) ; possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a second-degree felony,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37-8 (LexisNexis 2016); two counts of forgery, third-degree felonies,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-501(2)(a) (LexisNexis 2012); two counts of unlawful possession of a financial transaction card, third-degree felonies,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-506.3(1); and unlawful possession of another's identification documents, a class A misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-1105(2)(a)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 At trial, the State sought to show that Defendant knew that he was not entitled to possess the identification documents in the binder. To this end, the State elicited testimony from Officer that he had contacted the individuals to whom the documents belonged and that those individuals had denied giving Defendant permission to have the documents. Defense counsel did not object to this testimony on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The State also sought to show that Defendant had been in possession of the methamphetamine package. The State elicited testimony from the officer (Sergeant) who had retrieved the package from the vehicle's owner. Sergeant testified that he responded to a call about the package the owner found in the vehicle and recounted several things the vehicle's owner told him about how her son had discovered the package. Again, defense counsel did not object on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Defense counsel also represented Fianc\u00e9e, who was not tried at the same time as Defendant. Nevertheless, defense counsel argued that Fianc\u00e9e was responsible for the identification documents in the binder and therefore there was at least a reasonable doubt that Defendant had possessed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 With the exception of the second forgery count (count four), which was dismissed at trial, the jury convicted Defendant of all charges, and he timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Defendant first contends that his counsel had a conflict of interest as a result of also representing Fianc\u00e9e and that this conflict prejudiced Defendant. He raises this contention as a matter of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant also contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to object to Officer's and Sergeant's testimony on either Confrontation Clause or hearsay grounds. Finally, Defendant contends that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move for a directed verdict as to two of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Layton City v.

Concurrent Representation of Fianc\u00e9e\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Defendant first contends that defense counsel labored under a conflict of interest in that he also served as counsel for Fianc\u00e9e and that Defendant suffered prejudice therefrom. He asserts that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was thereby violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant's right to the assistance of counsel that is free from conflicts of interest.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1990). But counsel's representation of two or more codefendants does not necessarily violate the Sixth Amendment. Rather, to establish that his or her constitutional right to conflict-free counsel was violated, a defendant must show (1) \"that an actual conflict of interest existed\" that (2) \"adversely affected [his or her] lawyer's performance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380169\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/790/65/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 73 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It follows that failure to prove either element is fatal to an appeal predicated on an alleged violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Here, we proceed directly to the second element-whether defense counsel's concurrent representation adversely affected Defendant's case. In other words, we consider whether defense counsel actually elevated Fianc\u00e9e's defense interests above those of Defendant to his detriment, not merely whether defense counsel had the opportunity to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Defendant concedes that his defense counsel \"tried to show through questioning that [Fianc\u00e9e] was the one actually in possession of the identification documents\" and that defense counsel \"hammered that point home for the jury, claiming that it created reasonable doubt on the document charges.\" But with regard to the other charges against Defendant, he argues that defense counsel \"had to limit the forcefulness of his attacks lest [he] build the case against [Fianc\u00e9e] while he created reasonable doubt for [Defendant].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant identifies only one example of the alleged adverse effect of counsel's dual representation: \"[W]hile [Fianc\u00e9e] was made out to be responsible for the identification documents, no effort was made to put blame on her for the drugs.\" Defendant thus implies that defense counsel's decision not to argue to the jury that the drugs belonged to Fianc\u00e9e was a product of defense counsel's split loyalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The evidence, however, does not support this implication. The note recovered by jail staff and presented at trial had Defendant's name written on one side and, on the other side, \"I and my girlfriend got arrested with a stolen motor vehicle,\" \"[c]ops didn't find the dope,\" and \"when car was released to the owners, they found out the dope, one and a half pounds of crystal.\" Additionally, with regard to the bindle of methamphetamine initially found in the stolen vehicle, Officer wrote in his report that Defendant \"stated the drugs belonged to him,\" and Officer presumably would have testified to the same at trial had defense counsel tried to assign responsibility for the drugs to Fianc\u00e9e. In light of this evidence connecting Defendant to the drugs, defense counsel could have reasonably decided that claiming Fianc\u00e9e was responsible for both the drugs and the identification documents would have backfired and caused the jury not to credit either assertion. It was apparently counsel's consideration of the evidence, not his concurrent representation of Fianc\u00e9e, that motivated his decision not to try to blame her for the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Defendant does not identify any other concrete examples of the alleged adverse effect that concurrent representation had on his defense at trial. Instead, he speculates (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   that defense counsel \"couldn't make any decision on how to investigate without impugning his separate obligations to keep [Fianc\u00e9e's] confidences, to advance her interests without regard to others, and to avoid conflicts,\" (2) that \"any argument that [defense counsel] might have advanced on [Defendant's] behalf would almost certainly be colored by knowledge he had gained as [Fianc\u00e9e's] attorney,\" and (3) that \"there are arguments and actions [defense counsel] should have made but didn't.\" Defendant does not identify any evidence that any of these concerns materialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Speculation is insufficient to demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected Defendant at trial. To show that his right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated by a conflict of interest, a defendant \"must demonstrate as a threshold matter that the defense attorney was required to make a choice advancing [another's] interests to the detriment of [the defendant's] interests.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He asserts that counsel could have prevented the introduction of this testimony by raising hearsay and/or Confrontation Clause challenges.

Rather, the affidavit noted only defense counsel's strong belief that the owners were not\n   <em>\n    actually present\n   </em>\n   at trial. There is no affidavit from the owners indicating that they would have been unwilling or unable to travel to and testify at trial.

Thus, counsel was faced with a choice between allowing Officer and Sergeant to testify indirectly or delaying trial to allow the owners to testify directly. According to the State, counsel's election to have the testimony come to the jury indirectly, rather than directly, was an objectively reasonable trial strategy. We cannot disagree; the impact of direct testimony from a physically present crime victim may carry more weight with a jury than a law enforcement officer's secondhand statement of the same fact.

And because the evidentiary picture would not have differed, we will not presume prejudice; that is, where the evidence would have been of the same caliber, we cannot conclude that there was a reasonable likelihood of a result more favorable for the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b632 Consequently, we conclude that Defendant has not demonstrated that his counsel's failure to raise hearsay or Confrontation Clause objections to the testimony of Officer and/or Sergeant constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   III. Charges Regarding Debit Cards\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b633 Defendant contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the two charges of unlawful possession of a financial transaction card. Specifically, he argues that his counsel should have moved to dismiss those charges on the ground of insufficient evidence or should have objected to an erroneous jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b634 Two lengthy statutes are relevant. The first criminalizes the fraudulent use of a financial transaction card (the Fraudulent Use Statute) while the second criminalizes the unlawful acquisition, receipt, or possession of a financial transaction card (the Unlawful Possession Statute). The Fraudulent Use Statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   It is unlawful for any person to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (1) knowingly use a false, fictitious, altered, counterfeit, revoked, expired, stolen, or fraudulently obtained financial transaction card to obtain or attempt to obtain credit, goods, property, or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (2) knowingly, with the intent to defraud, use a financial transaction card, credit number, personal identification code, or any other information contained on the card or in the account from which the card is issued, to obtain or attempt to obtain credit, goods, or services;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (3) knowingly, with the intent to defraud, use a financial transaction card to willfully exceed an authorized credit line by $500 or\n   more, or by 50% or more of the line of credit, whichever is greater;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (4)(a) knowingly, with the intent to defraud, make application for a financial transaction card to an issuer and make or cause to be made a false statement or report of the person's name, occupation, financial condition, assets, or personal identifying information; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (b) willfully and substantially undervalue or understate any indebtedness for the purposes of influencing the issuer to issue the financial transaction card; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (5) knowingly, with the intent to defraud, present or cause to be presented to the issuer or an authorized credit card merchant, for payment or collection, any credit card sales draft, if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (a) the draft is counterfeit or fictitious;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (b) the purported sales evidenced by any credit card sales draft did not take place;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (c) the purported sale was not authorized by the card holder; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (d) the items or services purported to be sold as evidenced by the credit card sales drafts are not delivered or rendered to the card holder or person intended to receive them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-506.2\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-6-506.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2012). The Fraudulent Use Statute is extensively referenced by the immediately following statute, the Unlawful Possession Statute, which outlines five variants of the crime:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Any person is guilty of a third degree felony who:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (1) acquires a financial transaction card from another without the consent of the card holder or the issuer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (2) receives a financial transaction card with intent to use it in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (3) sells or transfers a financial transaction card to another person with the knowledge that it will be used in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (4)(a) acquires a financial transaction card that the person knows was lost, mislaid, or delivered under a mistake as to the identity or address of the card holder; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (b)(i) retains possession with intent to use it in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (ii) sells or transfers a financial transaction card to another person with the knowledge that it will be used in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (5) possesses, sells, or transfers any information necessary for the use of a financial transaction card, including the credit number of the card, the expiration date of the card, or the personal identification code related to the card:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (a)(i) without the consent of the card holder or the issuer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (ii) with the knowledge that the information has been acquired without consent of the card holder or the issuer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (b) with intent to use the information in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-506.3\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-6-506.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b635 The State charged Defendant with violating the Unlawful Possession Statute. The State prepared a jury instruction that appears to track the fifth variant of that statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The elements of Unlawful Possession of a Financial Transaction Card as charged in this case are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   1.

He also argues that the State failed to present any evidence of his intent to\n   use the card fraudulently. We address the latter of Defendant's arguments and, because we find it persuasive, decline to address the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b637 Defendant notes that \"[t]he only potential evidence the State had\" of his intent \"was that the circumstances under which [Defendant] possessed the card were sufficient to raise an inference that [he] had the intent to use the card\" in violation of the Fraudulent Use Statute. He asserts that this evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b638 The State responds that it only had to prove either (1) that Defendant acquired the card without the consent of the card holder or the issuer or (2) that he received the card with intent to use it in violation of the Fraudulent Use Statute. The State argues that \"[s]atisfying either subsection (1) or (2) is sufficient to prove a defendant's guilt.\" But the State did not seek to have the jury instructed on either of these variants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b639 The State elected to have the jury instructed on the possessing variant of the crime but not the acquiring or receiving variants. On appeal, the State indirectly implies that the verbs have the same meaning or effect. But pursuant to a well-recognized canon of statutory interpretation, \"we presume that the legislature used each word advisedly\" and \"that a difference in word choice is to be assigned a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Bylsma v. R.C. Willey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2085\">\n    2017 UT 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 64 n.115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567078\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/595/\">\n    416 P.3d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). The legislature used different words to describe the variants and in fact attached different mens rea elements to them. Accordingly, we will not presume that a jury finding of possession without consent is the equivalent of a jury finding of acquisition without consent. Indeed, it is not hard to imagine a situation in which a defendant acquired a card with consent but retained and possessed it after such consent was rescinded. Because the State only asked the jury to find possession without consent, we cannot speculate as to whether the jury might have found acquisition without consent. Our analysis is bounded by how the jury was actually instructed and the evidence before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b640 We next consider whether there was sufficient evidence of Defendant's intent to violate the Fraudulent Use Statute. The State does not point us to any evidence of such intent. And we are unable to identify any direct evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that Defendant intended to use the debit cards fraudulently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b641 In the absence of direct evidence, we turn to circumstantial evidence. \"We recognize [that] proof of a defendant's intent is rarely susceptible of direct proof and therefore the prosecution usually must rely on a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence to establish this element.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But the intent element for that crime is intent to possess the contraband, rather than intent to use it in a particular way; the State may secure a conviction by proving that the defendant \"knowingly and intentionally ... possess[ed]\" the drugs, without necessarily having to show that the defendant intended to use the drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-37-8\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a)(i) (LexisNexis 2016). In contrast, to secure a conviction for unlawful possession of a financial transaction card under the possession-with-intent variant, the requisite mens rea is \"intent to use the information in violation of [the Fraudulent Use Statute].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2058-37-8\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-506.3(5)(b) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b644 The question before us is therefore whether mere possession of a stolen financial transaction card is sufficient evidence to infer the possessor's intent to violate the Fraudulent Use Statute. We conclude that it is not, because a defendant may plausibly have a debit card, knowing it is stolen, but lack the intent to fraudulently use it as a debit card. For example, a defendant may have taken a wallet to steal the currency therein but lack the intent to use the debit and credit cards owing to the additional risk of apprehension. Or the defendant may possess stolen cards with the intent to sell or barter them. While such acts are criminal, they are not barred by the Fraudulent Use Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the possession variant outlined in section 76-6-506.3(5), with which Defendant was charged, requires the State to show not just any criminal intent, but the specific criminal intent to violate the Fraudulent Use Statute. Mere possession of another's financial transaction cards without more does not give rise to a permissible inference that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the possessor intends to use the cards to commit fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b645 A conviction for unlawful possession of a financial transaction card requires proof of the defendant's intent to violate the Fraudulent Use Statute. Here, the State did not present evidence of Defendant's intent other than the fact that Defendant had the cards in his possession. Because the State failed to present nonspeculative evidence of an essential element of the crime charged, defense counsel's failure to move for a directed verdict on the relevant charges amounted to prejudicial deficient performance. In other words, Defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel when defense counsel failed to move for a directed verdict regarding charges whose elements the State failed to present evidence of.

Nor has Defendant shown that defense counsel's failure to raise hearsay or Confrontation Clause objections resulted in the admission of evidence that otherwise would have been excluded. Defendant has, however, demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when defense counsel failed to move for a directed verdict on the two charges of unlawful possession of a financial transaction card, because the State had not presented sufficient evidence of an essential element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b647 We vacate Defendant's two convictions for unlawful possession of a financial transaction card but affirm his other five convictions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    This may be a reference to the encrypted messaging platform WhatsApp.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The State informs us that \"conecta\" is a slang term indicating a drug dealer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The court's internal style guide has adopted the parenthetical \"quotation simplified\" in the spirit of the nascent \"cleaned up\" parenthetical.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.
