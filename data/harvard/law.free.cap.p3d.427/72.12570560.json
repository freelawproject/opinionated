Water Court case 40M-230 is made up of forty-six stock and wildlife claims filed by the BLM on twenty-three reservoirs, all located on federal land. The claims were filed for each reservoir as multiple uses of the same historical appropriation, specifically for stock and wildlife uses. Appellants Ron and\n   Maxine\n   Korman (the Kormans) objected to all forty-six BLM claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Kormans were assigned the Hammond Brothers' interests in grazing permits and range improvements on the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs in 1977. In 1960, the Hammond Brothers had filed a Range Improvement Application to construct the Chevy Reservoir on lands they occupied by permit. The BLM approved this application and a second application in 1966 to construct the Poker Reservoir. The reservoirs were constructed for the purpose of watering livestock on the federal range. However, the BLM also considered the impacts on wildlife, as reflected in 1973 job inspection records. In 1982, the BLM and Kormans executed a Cooperative Agreement for Range Improvements, which replaced the 1977 assignment. A provision within the Agreement states \"Title to the said improvements with all labor and materials furnished by either party and used in the construction and maintenance thereof, shall be in the United States of America.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On August 11, 2015, the Water Court issued an Order Granting Partial Summary Judgment to the BLM on thirty-four of the forty-six claims and dismissed the Kormans' objections. The remaining claims were either dismissed or remanded to the water master for further proceedings. The Kormans appealed the Water Court's dismissal of those objections to this Court.

In\n   <em>\n    Barthelmess\n   </em>\n   , we held that there is \"no basis in fact or in law to assign ownership of the BLM [water-rights] claims\" to holders of federal grazing permits who use federal reservoirs for livestock watering.\n   <em>\n    Barthelmess\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The\n   <em>\n    Korman I\n   </em>\n   case returned to the Water Court for further proceedings on the remaining open claims by the BLM. The Kormans withdrew two of their objections, leaving only claims to the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs at issue. On July 14, 2017, the BLM filed a motion for summary judgment on these claims. On December 18, 2017, the Water Court granted the BLM's motion for summary judgment, and denied the Kormans' objections. The Water Court held that any interest the Kormans had in water rights for stock use in the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs was forfeited pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-226, MCA, because they failed to file statements of claim. The Water Court held that because the BLM owns the reservoirs, it can claim ownership of the water rights diverted by the reservoirs. Further, the wildlife claims made by the BLM on the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs were held as valid\n   because the BLM had the ability to add a second purpose to the original appropriations, which did not expand its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 On appeal, the Kormans no longer challenge the United States' ownership of the reservoirs and associated water rights for stock watering purposes. However, the Kormans contend that the Water Court erred (1) in stating that the Kormans forfeited the ability to assert their own water rights in the reservoirs, and (2) in holding that the United States possesses rights to store water in the reservoirs for wildlife purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 \"This Court applies the same standards of review to the Water Court as it does to an appeal from a district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Heavirland v.

Section 85-2-221, MCA. Owners of existing water rights were required to file claims with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (Department) by June 30, 1983. Section 85-2-221(1), MCA. The Legislature later extended this deadline to July 1, 1996. Section 85-2-221(3), MCA. The Act states that the \"[D]epartment and the district courts may not accept any statements of claim\" for existing water rights submitted after July 1, 1996. Section 85-2-221(4), MCA. The failure to file a claim creates a conclusive presumption of abandonment of that claim. Section 85-2-226, MCA. However, claims \"for livestock and individual uses as opposed to municipal domestic uses based upon instream flow or\n   ground water sources ...\" are exempt from the filing restrictions in \u00a7 85-2-221, MCA. Section 85-2-222(1), MCA. These exempt rights, however, must be filed with the Department by June 30, 2019. Section 85-2-222(2)(a), (7), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Kormans argue that the Water Court erred when it held that the Kormans abandoned any interest they may have had for stock use from the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs. The Kormans allege that they have an exempt right and therefore have until June 30, 2019, to file their claim. Conversely, the BLM argues that the Kormans' alleged exempt right was not at issue in the Water Court nor in this Court because the Water Court only addressed rights to impound and use water in the reservoirs, which are not exempt rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Water Court correctly held that the Kormans forfeited any stockwater rights claims associated with the Chevy and Poker Reservoirs. The Kormans have not filed a claim for stockwater rights with the Department, and the deadlines for the filling of water rights claims have passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 85-2-221, MCA.

The Water Court did not address such an exempt, instream water right. Rather, the Water Court addressed the Kormans' reservoir storage rights, which are not exempt.
