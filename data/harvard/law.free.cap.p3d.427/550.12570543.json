Torres Jr. of one count of aggravated assault (Count 1), a felony, and one count of assault (Count 2), a misdemeanor, stemming from violent acts that he committed during an argument with the victim, his then-girlfriend. Torres appeals his conviction on Count 1, arguing that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not move for a directed verdict and did not object to the admission of instant messages in which Torres admitted to prior acts of abuse against the victim. Because the State produced sufficient evidence to justify submitting the case to the jury, trial counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to raise a futile motion. In addition, given the strong evidence of guilt, any error in admitting the contested messages at trial did not prejudice the defense. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Torres and the victim had been involved in an on-again-off-again relationship for several years. Late one evening, the victim planned to spend the night with Torres at his father's apartment, but the couple began arguing. Torres eventually \"tossed\" his cell phone at the victim, hitting her in the chin. After exchanging \"fuck you[s],\" Torres told the victim to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 As the victim gathered her belongings, Torres punched her in \"the back of [the] head.\" The victim began crying and told Torres not to hit her. In response, Torres said, \"Stop fucking crying, I didn't hit you that hard.\" The argument moved into the kitchen where Torres hit the victim with his hand \"next to her left eye\" before he walked out of the apartment. According to the victim, although Torres's father, sister, and the sister's children were asleep in the apartment at the time, no one stirred during the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After the victim finished gathering her belongings, she walked out to the parking lot where she noticed Torres crouched down next to the rear passenger tire of her vehicle. Assuming that Torres was letting air out of her tire, the victim yelled, \"[W]hy are you doing this?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The victim moved toward the driver's side of her vehicle, but Torres blocked the door and refused to budge. The victim went around to the rear passenger door and crawled through her car to the driver's seat while Torres climbed into the passenger seat beside her. She begged Torres to let her leave, but he responded, \"[F]uck you bitch.\" When the victim then attempted to start the ignition, Torres grabbed her keys, got out of her car, and got into his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In response, the victim walked to the driver's side of Torres's vehicle and asked him to return her keys and to \"just leave her alone.\" Torres refused and started his vehicle. To prevent Torres from leaving with her keys, the victim stood in front of his vehicle. Undeterred, Torres shifted his vehicle into drive and, without accelerating, let it roll forward. The victim began moving backward, but Torres's vehicle hit the top of her legs several times. Torres then told the victim that \"[she was] going to fuckin' die tonight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The victim repeatedly yelled at Torres to return her keys. Instead of complying, Torres slowly accelerated his vehicle, hitting the victim and causing her to fall backward. The victim testified that Torres's vehicle rolled over her until its front bumper was positioned just below her chest. At trial, Torres argued that it would have been physically impossible for his vehicle to roll over the victim in the manner that she described without causing significant injury because the vehicle, which was equipped with a customized air suspension system, was lowered and sat a mere seven-and-a-half inches off the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 When the victim stood up, she was \"hysterical,\" yelling at Torres to return her keys and let her leave. However, Torres accelerated and hit the victim again, sending her onto the hood of his vehicle. After the victim rolled off hood and landed on the ground, Torres said, \"Fuck you bitch,\" threw her keys to her, and drove off. At trial, Torres's sister testified that she had looked through her bedroom window and had seen the couple arguing face-to-face. And, according\n   to his sister, when the victim asked for her keys, Torres threw them into the air, got into his car, and drove off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The victim contacted police later that afternoon to report the altercation. During the 911 call, the victim told the dispatcher that Torres hit her with his vehicle, but she did not say that the vehicle had rolled over her. According to the victim, she \"was just trying to be ... short and simple\" during the 911 call because she knew that she would go into more detail with an officer when she made a full report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 That same day, the victim met with an officer, who interviewed her and took photos of her injuries: bruising to both legs and her left eye. Ten hours after that initial interview, the officer drafted a report, which indicated that the victim said that she had been standing behind Torres's vehicle, not in front of it. This report differed from the victim's statement to the 911 dispatcher. It also differed from a written statement that she filled out several days after the altercation in which she reported that she had been standing in front of Torres's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Approximately one week later, Torres and the victim exchanged a series of Facebook instant messages. In those messages, Torres said that he was \"really sorry,\" that the way he treated the victim was \"uncalled for,\" and that he wanted to turn himself in. In addition to expressing remorse about the altercation, in several of the messages, Torres acknowledged that he had previously abused the victim. Specifically, the messages included statements, such as \"I beat you every day ... I'm such a[n] abusive person,\" \"all I do is beat u,\" and \"sorry for all the hurt and abuse.\" The district court admitted all of the messages at trial without objection from Torres's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 A jury convicted Torres of one count of aggravated assault, a third degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis 2017), and one count of assault, a class A misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-102. Prior to jury deliberation, Torres did not move for a directed verdict or otherwise challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for aggravated assault. Torres timely appeals, asking this court to reverse his conviction on Count 1 and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Torres raises two issues on appeal. First, he contends that \"the State presented insufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] assaulted [the victim] with his car.\" Recognizing that this claim is unpreserved, Torres asks that we review this issue under the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel exception to the preservation requirement. Second, Torres contends that \"[c]ounsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the admission of Facebook messages, which contained inadmissible and prejudicial character evidence.\" \"We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the first time on appeal for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Torres first contends that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to move for a directed verdict or otherwise challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his aggravated assault charge. In particular, Torres argues that \"the State offered only inconclusive and inherently improbable testimony that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the\n   State, did not establish that he assaulted [the victim] with [his vehicle].\" Because we conclude a motion for directed verdict based on the sufficiency of the evidence would have been futile, counsel's performance was not objectively deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

None of the messages suggested that Torres had previously assaulted the victim with a vehicle or any other dangerous weapon. As a result, the messages had no potential to bolster the victim's credibility with respect to the disputed issues.
