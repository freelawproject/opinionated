She contends that the trial court and the State committed errors related to the impeachment of the key defense witness. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Events at the Campsite\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 York, her boyfriend (Boyfriend), and a female friend were camping in a small camper trailer at a campground in Weber County. On the day the group was due to check out, the campsite's manager inquired whether they would be staying or leaving. The group informed the manager that they intended to leave. However, that evening, the manager observed that they had not packed up their campsite or departed. The manager called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Two officers from the Ogden police department responded. When they arrived, Boyfriend did not appear to be at the campsite. One of the officers, Officer Bryner, approached York and her female friend and asked them to leave. The women began to pack their belongings and load them into the camping trailer, leaning inside its doorway multiple times. The manager informed the officers that Boyfriend had been part of the group and that he believed Boyfriend was inside the trailer. When Officer Bryner walked back to his patrol car and ran York's information on his computer, he \"found a link\" between York and Boyfriend, and he showed the manager a photograph of Boyfriend to verify it was the same man the manager had observed. During the records search, he also discovered that Boyfriend had an outstanding felony arrest warrant. During this time, Officer Bryner had a clear view of the trailer's door and kept his eye on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Once he discovered the warrant and Boyfriend's connection to York, Officer Bryner returned to York and asked if she knew Boyfriend's whereabouts. York responded that while Boyfriend had been \"down by the river just a few minutes prior,\" she did not know where he was. Officer Bryner asked if Boyfriend was inside the trailer, and York said, \"No, he's not.\" Officer Bryner then informed York of the active warrant for Boyfriend's arrest and asked her again whether Boyfriend was inside the trailer. Again, York responded that he was not. Finally, Officer Bryner asked York for permission to look inside the trailer, but York told him it was not her trailer and she could not give permission to search it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Immediately after that exchange, Officer Bryner obtained from York's friend permission to search the trailer. When Officer Bryner and the other responding officer, Officer Taylor, looked into the trailer, they saw Boyfriend lying on the bed with his feet right at the door due to the small size of the trailer. Both officers described their view of Boyfriend as completely unobstructed and noted that they could see Boyfriend's entire body from the trailer's doorway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Officer Bryner arrested Boyfriend. He also arrested York for obstruction because she \"had lied and helped conceal [Boyfriend] during [the] investigation.\" Officer Taylor transported York to jail. During transport, York yelled at Officer Taylor that \"she didn't give permission to [Boyfriend] to be in the trailer,\" that \"she wasn't helping him hide in the trailer,\" and that she \"didn't open the door for him. He was there the whole time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Boyfriend's Testimony at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The State charged York with obstruction of justice, and York's case proceeded to trial. Boyfriend was the sole witness for the defense. Boyfriend testified that, on the evening in question, he had been near the river and observed the police talking to York and her friend as he approached the campsite. He\n   stated that he snuck into the trailer when the officer talking to York and York's friend walked back to the patrol vehicle and that he did this to hide from the police because of the warrant for his arrest. Boyfriend claimed he could not see York when he snuck into the trailer, thereby suggesting that she did not see him at that time. He testified that he was in the trailer approximately three to five minutes before he was discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 During cross-examination, the State questioned Boyfriend about two previous convictions. First, the State questioned Boyfriend about a 2010 conviction of tampering with evidence. Boyfriend admitted he had been convicted of that crime. Defense counsel did not immediately object, but subsequently argued that the conviction was inadmissible under rule 609 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, contending that it was not a crime of dishonesty. Defense counsel also brought to the court's attention that the conviction had been reduced from a felony to a class A misdemeanor upon Boyfriend's graduation from drug court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 On the overall issue of whether the tampering with evidence conviction could be used to impeach Boyfriend, the court determined that, even as a class A misdemeanor, the conviction was admissible for that purpose. In particular, the court concluded that the conviction was a dishonest act under rule 609(a)(2). After it ruled, the court asked the parties how they intended to present the conviction to the jury. Defense counsel suggested that the parties could stipulate that the conviction was a class A misdemeanor, and the State agreed. Defense counsel also indicated that he preferred the State to notify the jury of the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State subsequently advised the jury that the parties had \"stipulated to information\" about Boyfriend's conviction for tampering with evidence and that, although he was convicted of a third degree felony, the conviction was reduced to a class A misdemeanor. Defense counsel objected that the State misstated the stipulation. The court recognized that the stipulation was that Boyfriend had been \"convicted of a misdemeanor, ultimately,\" and determined that it would allow the evidence. In doing so, the court noted that the conviction was \"only being allowed in as impeachment\" of Boyfriend and that \"it has no implication directly or indirectly on [York].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Second, the State questioned Boyfriend about one other alleged conviction-giving false information to a police officer in 2006. During cross-examination, Boyfriend stated that he had been charged with that offense but denied that he had been convicted. When the State attempted to produce a \"rap sheet,\" defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection. The next day, the State supplied the court with a document from the South Ogden Justice Court allegedly establishing that Boyfriend had been convicted of the crime. Defense counsel objected, asserting that it was not a judgment of conviction because it looked more like a minute entry, the judge had not signed the document as to the conviction, and the only court signature on the document was as to its later authentication. The court concluded, over defense counsel's objection, that the document represented a judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Finally, the State questioned Boyfriend about his relationship with York. Boyfriend testified that York was his girlfriend and agreed that he \"wouldn't want her to get in trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 The jury convicted York, and she appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 York argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to impeach a defense witness with what she characterizes as \"two inadmissible convictions\" and that the admission of those convictions prejudiced her case. \"[W]e grant a trial court broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence and will disturb its ruling only for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Daines v.

Impeachment Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 York argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence under rule 609(a)(2) of the Utah Rules of Evidence that Boyfriend previously had been convicted of two offenses. York asserts that Boyfriend's first conviction-tampering with evidence under Utah Code section 76-8-510.5 -\"is not an inherently dishonest act\" as required for admissibility under rule 609(a)(2). And she asserts that the evidence provided by the State to prove Boyfriend's second conviction-false information to a police officer under Utah Code section 76-8-506 -was insufficient to establish that Boyfriend had actually been convicted of that crime. We address each contention below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Tampering with Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 York argues that Boyfriend's tampering with evidence conviction \"was not a crime of dishonesty\" as required for admissibility by rule 609(a)(2) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 Rule 609(a)(2) provides that \"for any crime regardless of the punishment, the evidence must be admitted if the court can readily determine that establishing the elements of the crime required proving-or the witness's admitting-a dishonest act or false statement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Utah R.

The statute does not criminalize concealment committed for the sake of concealment alone, nor does it criminalize impairment of an item's availability apart from the purpose undergirding the concealment. Rather, the statute requires that the act of concealment occur in a particular context and for a particular purpose before conviction may result. Specifically, the statute requires the affirmative act (e.g., concealment) to occur in the context of a pending or an official investigation that the actor believes or knows to be afoot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-510.5\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-8-510.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). And it requires that the affirmative act be tethered to a specific purpose-one that, in the variant focused upon by York, is purposefully aimed at deceiving investigators about whether an item is available to serve as evidence in the proceeding or investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-510.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In our view, an affirmative act of concealment that occurs in this context and for this purpose is an act of deceit and, like the other variations of evidence tampering that may be taken under the statute, constitutes a dishonest act that bears on a witness's ability to be truthful during an official proceeding such as a trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, our ruling is confined to convictions under the evidence tampering statute. We do not conclude that an act of concealment committed in some relation to a crime transforms that crime into a crime of deception that would make the conviction impeachable under the rule; we conclude only that a conviction for tampering with evidence under section 76-8-510.5 constitutes a dishonest act as contemplated by rule 609(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 27 Second, it may be true that many, if not most, crimes are committed with some element of deception or concealment. But not every crime includes elements that require the State to prove, and the fact-finder to find, that the actor committed a dishonest act or a false statement before conviction may result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 609 advisory committee notes to 2006 amendments (explaining that evidence of a conviction must be admitted under subsection 609(a)(2) \"only when the conviction required the proof of ... an act of dishonesty or false statement\"; that evidence of \"all other convictions is inadmissible under this subsection, irrespective of whether the witness exhibited dishonesty or made a false statement in the process of the commission of the crime of conviction\"; and, providing as an example, \"evidence that a witness was convicted for a crime of violence, such as murder, is not admissible under Rule 609(a)(2), even if the witness acted deceitfully in the course of committing the crime\"). As a result, prosecutors will not be able to avoid the probative weighing required under subsection (a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as York contends, simply by asserting that a prior crime was committed in some manner involving deception. Rather, to fall within rule 609(a)(2), prosecutors are required to readily demonstrate that a previous conviction required the fact-finder to find as an integral element of the crime that the actor committed a dishonest act or made a false statement. And, in our view, this is the pertinent point of\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of rule 609(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 28 Accordingly, we conclude that Boyfriend's tampering with evidence conviction is \"a dishonest act\" for purposes of rule 609(a)(2). The trial court therefore did not exceed its discretion in admitting the evidence of that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B. False Information\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 York also argues that the trial court erred in admitting Boyfriend's purported conviction of providing false information. In particular, she contends that the document supplied by the State was insufficient to prove that conviction. We agree with York but conclude that the trial court's error in\n   admitting the conviction for impeachment purposes was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30 York asserts that the document \"does not clearly attest that [Boyfriend] was convicted of the offense of false information.\" She contends that it is not clear from the face of the document that it is a judgment of conviction and that, at best, the document indicates that Boyfriend was merely charged. She points out, for example, that Boyfriend indicated with his signature that he understood his rights, but she contends that the document does not clearly indicate what plea Boyfriend made or whether he was convicted. And she points out that the document \"does not contain a judge's signature to the conviction\"-that the judge's signature merely certifies after the fact that the document is \"a true copy of the original on file.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 We agree that the document contains several ambiguities that preclude it from serving as evidence of a conviction. While the document contains some details that suggest Boyfriend was convicted-such as the case number, the charge listed as \"False info,\" a notation of \"GP\" in the plea section, and the reference to an order to pay $402 under the heading \"Sentencing\"-the document on its face does not identify itself as a judgment of conviction, and there is no signature from a judge memorializing a conviction. Indeed, the document does not even provide a place for a judge's signature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It was undisputed that Boyfriend was discovered hiding in the trailer shortly after the officers arrived, and the transporting officer testified that York stated that she \"didn't open the [trailer] door for [Boyfriend],\" because Boyfriend \"was there the whole time\"-statements that, in context, would have permitted the jury to infer that York essentially admitted that she knew Boyfriend was hiding in the trailer when Officer Bryner questioned her at the campsite. In addition, Officer Bryner testified that after he informed York and her friend that they had overstayed their welcome, the women began to pack things inside the trailer, \"leaning all the way into [it] to put things inside,\" and that they continued to do so between the time he checked his vehicle's computer for information about them and shortly before he went back to York to question her about Boyfriend's whereabouts. Both officers also testified that, when they did look in the trailer, nothing obstructed their view of Boyfriend-that Boyfriend was in full, plain view, and that due to the small size of the trailer, Boyfriend's feet were literally at the trailer door. And the officers discovered Boyfriend mere minutes after checking York's information, during which time Officer Bryner kept a clear view of the trailer. All of this evidence taken together would have permitted the jury to infer that York had observed Boyfriend hiding inside of the trailer before Officer Bryner questioned her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 34 Moreover, to the extent the alleged conviction might have affected the jury's perception of Boyfriend's credibility and thereby influenced its verdict, the alleged false information conviction was cumulative of the more recent evidence tampering conviction, which suggested that Boyfriend might be less than credible and which we have affirmed as admissible for impeachment purposes under rule 609(a)(2). Also, the alleged conviction was not the only evidence before the jury that would have drawn Boyfriend's credibility into question. The State elicited testimony suggesting that, because York and Boyfriend were involved in a relationship and Boyfriend admitted that he did not want York to get in trouble, Boyfriend had a motive to lie. The jury also had before it the overall narrative of the events that occurred at the campsite, including Boyfriend's testimony that he purposely hid from the police because he knew there was a warrant for his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 35 As a result, given the overall circumstances and evidence in the case, we conclude that the court's error in admitting evidence that Boyfriend had been convicted of false information was \"sufficiently inconsequential that there is no reasonable likelihood that it affected the outcome of the proceedings,\" and that the error was therefore harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6788071\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/376/1089/\">\n    2016 UT App 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6788071\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/376/1089/\">\n    376 P.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).

The State's Felony Reference\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 36 Finally, York argues that the State improperly referred to Boyfriend's tampering with evidence conviction as a felony rather than a misdemeanor. She contends that the parties \"had agreed that the State could tell the jury [that Boyfriend] was convicted of a misdemeanor,\" not that the crime had originally been charged and convicted as a felony but was later reduced to a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 37 As an initial matter, we are not convinced that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct by telling the jury that the conviction was initially a felony but was later reduced to a misdemeanor. The parties stipulated that the conviction was ultimately a class A misdemeanor, but the parties' stipulation did not address whether the State could mention that the crime was originally charged and convicted as a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 38 Nevertheless, for a reversal on this basis, York must persuade us that the felony reference was prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The tampering with evidence conviction was admitted only to impeach Boyfriend, and it is unlikely that the jury's view of York's guilt was influenced in a substantive way by hearing that Boyfriend's conviction was originally a felony conviction before being reduced to a misdemeanor conviction. Regardless, the conviction still suggested that Boyfriend might be less than credible, and it strains credulity to believe that the jury convicted York because it perceived Boyfriend as a felon. Moreover, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, the felony reference was cumulative of other evidence bearing on Boyfriend's credibility, and there was ample evidence from the testimony provided at trial to support York's conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    2014 UT App 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    318 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
