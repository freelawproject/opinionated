He argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give a cautionary instruction to the jury about accomplice testimony.

We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A jury convicted Padilla of felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice based on his involvement in events that led to the death of a rival gang member (Victim). One evening in July 2013, Padilla, a member of the 18th Street gang, and five others left his apartment to go tagging.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They took two cars. While driving, one of Padilla's cohorts recognized someone from a rival gang standing with a group in front of a house. The two cars circled back around and another of Padilla's cohorts shot and killed Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The State charged Padilla with murder, felony discharge of a weapon, and obstruction of justice, all first degree felonies. He was initially tried with two codefendants, both of whom were involved in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During trial, the State established Padilla's involvement in Victim's death largely based on the testimony of two of Padilla's other companions, both of whom were present in one of the vehicles during the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the third day of the trial, one of those companions testified that, shortly before the shooting, Padilla said that they were going to return to the house where they had spotted Victim, \"ask him which gang he belonged to,\" and, depending on Victim's answer, shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Based on this testimony, defense counsel for Padilla and the two codefendants moved for mistrial on confrontation grounds, arguing that they could not confront Padilla's out-of-court testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    391 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126, 136-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1767670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/391/123/#p126\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968) (holding that the petitioner's constitutional right to confrontation had been violated, notwithstanding curative instructions, when a codefendant's confession was admitted and inculpated the petitioner). As to Padilla in particular, defense counsel acknowledged that Padilla's \"position is weaker\" than the other two codefendants, but nonetheless argued that if the other codefendants \"are suddenly gone and [Padilla] is alone then it is perhaps prejudicial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The court granted the motion for mistrial as to Padilla's codefendants but denied it as to Padilla. In doing so, the court gave a curative instruction to the jury, addressing how the jury should view the codefendants' dismissals:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial will proceed tomorrow morning, but it will only involve one of the defendants. Two of the defendants, there are\n   legal reasons that we cannot proceed against them, so we are only going to proceed against [Padilla].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I want to instruct you and admonish you that you are not to draw any conclusions from that at all. It doesn't mean that the Court determined that the other defendants lack responsibility for anything. It doesn't mean that the Court determined that they do. It doesn't mean that they entered pleas. It doesn't mean anything other than the fact for legal reasons we cannot proceed against them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   So that's not something you should hold against [Padilla]. It doesn't mean anything with respect to his role in this versus anyone else's role. And so no conclusions really can be drawn one way or the other with respect to the fact we are only proceeding with regard to one of the defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court asked Padilla's counsel if this instruction was satisfactory, and counsel responded that it was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 The next day, the court again addressed the jury, stating that the bailiff \"told [the court] ... that [the jury] had asked questions of him whether there was any testimony or evidence that [it] needed to disregard from yesterday.\" The court continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [O]ther than what I instructed you about at the time, the answer is no. And I gather from your questions that you posed to him that people are kind of wondering about what happened yesterday and why we're proceeding the way that we are. I told you not to worry about that. I recognize it's a little bit late telling you not to think about a pink elephant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   So what I can tell you-and I don't think that this would offend counsel-is that there was a legal irregularity, it's fairly complicated, that occurred yesterday, that just requires that we handle those other two cases separately from this case. Doesn't have anything to do with the strength or weakness of the State's claims or case against this defendant versus the other two. Doesn't have anything to do with what's going to happen ultimately with those two other cases. They just have to be handled separately from this one. Don't speculate as to why, and don't worry about it beyond that, if you can, but that's what occurred yesterday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 The testimony of his two companions also prompted Padilla to request that the court give a cautionary accomplice testimony instruction to the jury. Referencing, among other things, Utah Code section 77-17-7(2), Padilla asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   An accomplice is someone who joined with another person in committing a crime, voluntarily and with common intent. The testimony of an accomplice may be received in evidence and considered by you, even though it is not supported by other evidence. You may decide how much weight it should have. You are to keep in mind, however, that accomplice testimony should be received with caution and considered with great care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   You should not convict a defendant based on the unsupported testimony of an alleged accomplice, unless you believe the unsupported testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 During review of these instructions, the State argued that the instruction was improper. In particular, the State argued that neither companion was an accomplice to the crimes Padilla had been charged with because neither was charged as such. The State also argued that instructing that the testimony was \"unsupported\" was improper because it was \"suggestive of some sort of conclusion that the Court has reached,\" and it asserted that there was nothing in the proposed instruction that was not already covered in the general instruction about how much weight to give a witness's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610 Padilla argued, on the other hand, that the two companions were accomplices because the status of being an accomplice depends on conduct, not on whether \"the prosecution elects to charge people in different ways or elects to not even choose to prosecute someone.\" He therefore asserted that the definition of accomplice \"is accurate,\" and he stated that \"the instruction should be given.\" Padilla also contended that the instruction correctly stated the law \"with regard\n   to not convicting an individual simply because of an unsupported statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b611 In response to the State's objections, the court modified the proposed instruction. First, the court added an introductory sentence, explaining that the defense contended the companions were accomplices. The court also completely omitted the sentence advising the jury to receive the accomplice testimony \"with caution.\" Finally, the court edited the proposed language so as not to opine that the accomplice testimony was \"unsupported.\" Thus, the court instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   You have heard testimony from witnesses the defense contends were accomplices in the offense. An accomplice is someone who joined with another person in committing a crime, voluntarily and with common intent. The testimony of an accomplice may be received in evidence and considered by you, even if you find it is not supported by other evidence. You may decide how much weight it should have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   As with any evidence, you should not convict a defendant based solely on the testimony of an alleged accomplice, unless you believe the testimony beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to the addition of the introductory sentence. Counsel did, however, lodge a general objection to all of the other changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b612 The jury convicted Padilla of felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I. The Jury Instruction Issue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b613 Padilla first argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give the jury the cautionary instruction about accomplice testimony under Utah Code section 77-17-7. After establishing that a defendant may be convicted \"on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice,\" that statute provides that, \"[i]n the discretion of the court, an instruction to the jury may be given to the effect that such uncorroborated testimony should be viewed with caution, and such an instruction shall be given if the trial judge finds the testimony of the accomplice to be self contradictory, uncertain or improbable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-17-7\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-17-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Padilla argues that the court erred by refusing to give this instruction \"because the accomplice testimony was uncorroborated and was self-contradictory, uncertain, or improbable,\" and he contends that under these circumstances the court was \"statutorily required to warn the jury to view accomplice testimony with caution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b614 Ordinarily, this is an alleged error we might review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Malaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427156\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/132/703/\">\n    2006 UT App 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427156\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/132/703/\">\n    132 P.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Padilla has not established that he preserved this issue, and as a result, we do not reach its merits. \"An issue is preserved for appeal when it has been presented to the trial court in such a way that the trial court had the opportunity to rule on it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    2015 UT App 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    354 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that the \"party asserting error on appeal must have (1) raised the issue in a timely fashion in the lower court, (2) specifically raised the issue, and (3) introduced supporting evidence or relevant legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Baby Girl T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980247,6978047\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ut/2012/78/\">\n    2012 UT 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980247\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/298/1251/\">\n    298 P.3d 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). \"[A]n objection at trial based on one ground ... does not preserve for appeal any alternative grounds for objection.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the first, if the accomplice's testimony is uncorroborated, a court\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   , in its discretion, give the jury a cautionary instruction about the accomplice's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-17-7\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-17-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).

Guzman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189779\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/95/302/\">\n    2004 UT App 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189779\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/95/302/\">\n    95 P.3d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that under section 77-17-7(2)\"a cautionary instruction\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be given if the accomplice testimony is uncorroborated and\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be given if the trial judge finds the accomplice testimony self-contradictory, uncertain or improbable\" (quotation simplified) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b616 Padilla argues on appeal that the trial court erred by failing to give the mandatory instruction. He claims that the record demonstrates that the \"accomplice testimony was uncorroborated and unreliable.\" However, because the statute describes two potential scenarios for providing a cautionary instruction-one discretionary and one mandatory-to preserve the issue he asserts on appeal, Padilla needed to afford the court the opportunity to determine whether the instruction was mandatory as opposed to discretionary. To do this, it was incumbent upon him to specifically alert the trial court that the circumstances fell within the mandatory, and not merely the discretionary, scenario.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    2015 UT App 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    354 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b617 He did not do so. First, in the requested jury instruction itself, Padilla only generally referenced section 77-17-7(2), and he made no suggestion that he considered the instruction to be mandatory on the basis that the companions' testimonies were \"self contradictory, uncertain or improbable.\" Second, in argument before the trial court, while Padilla asked that his proposed cautionary instruction be given, he did not argue that such an instruction was required by statute under the circumstances of the case. Much of his substantive argument on the matter focused on refuting the State's contention that the two companions were not accomplices. Beyond that, he only generally asserted that the instruction he proposed was legally correct as to an accomplice's unsupported testimony and, apart from stipulating to the court's addition of the introductory sentence, he lodged only a general objection to the court's other modifications. He did not argue to the court that the instruction was required because the companions' testimonies were self-contradictory, uncertain, or improbable. Indeed, he did not request the court to make findings as to the quality of the companions' testimonies for instruction purposes at all. As a result, the trial court made no findings about the two companions' testimonies, and it made no ruling regarding whether, given the companions' testimonies, the instruction was mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b618 Therefore, at best, Padilla's request for the instruction and arguments at trial invoked the court's discretionary authority to give the proposed instruction under section 77-17-7(2). Indeed, nothing in Padilla's assertion that the companions were accomplices and his otherwise general objection to the court's modifications to his proposed instruction could have sufficiently alerted the court that Padilla believed, and was asking the court to specifically find, that his proposed instruction was mandatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He acknowledged that Padilla's position with regard to a mistrial was \"weaker\" than Padilla's codefendants. Nevertheless, as a basis for mistrial, Padilla's counsel contended, \"If the codefendants are suddenly gone and my client is alone then it is perhaps prejudicial.\" The court denied Padilla's mistrial motion, and it gave the jury a curative instruction, at Padilla's request, which advised the jury not to draw any conclusions from the codefendants' dismissals and not to hold the dismissals against Padilla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b624 The next day, the court addressed the jury again, stating that the bailiff informed it that the jury had asked \"whether there was any testimony or evidence that [the jury] needed to disregard from yesterday.\" The court then re-instructed the jury, advising that the codefendants' dismissals should have no bearing on its assessment of the case against Padilla. Padilla's counsel did not thereafter renew his motion for mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b625 Padilla argues that trial counsel performed deficiently when it became apparent that the \"jury was so confused that curative instructions could not provide an adequate remedy.\" As evidence of the jury's confusion, he points to the fact that the jury apparently attempted to resolve its confusion about the \"procedural abnormalities\" by resorting \"to improper conversations with court staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b626 We are not persuaded. \"Curative instructions are a settled and necessary feature of our judicial process and one of the most important tools by which a court may remedy errors at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although Padilla cites the procedural abnormalities and the jury's questioning of the bailiff regarding whether to disregard evidence, Padilla has not explained why it was objectively deficient for his counsel to conclude that the court's second curative instruction-which occurred after the jury apparently queried the bailiff-was insufficient to remedy any residual confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12145982\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/387/618/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed,\n   Padilla cites no evidence demonstrating that, after the second curative instruction, the jury still remained confused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court's limited recounting of the jury's inquiry to the bailiff indicated that the jury was concerned about whether it was still proper to consider evidence admitted before Padilla's codefendants were dismissed. Padilla's attorney may have reasonably inferred from the jury's inquiry that the jury was concerned about fairly considering Padilla's case and, in light of that, may have \"concluded that the possibility of a less sympathetic jury outweighed any marginal benefit his client might receive from a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7261113\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/968/\">\n    2013 UT App 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7261113\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/968/\">\n    317 P.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that counsel was not deficient for not moving for a mistrial where, among other things, \"a successful mistrial motion would have meant a new jury\").

And because Padilla has not established an exception to our preservation requirement, we do not reach the merits of that issue. Further, we conclude that Padilla has not established that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to renew the mistrial motion. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    One of Padilla's companions testified that \"tag\" in this context meant graffiti.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The two companions who testified were not the two codefendants tried with Padilla. The State charged both companions with obstruction of justice, a first degree felony, and they were granted immunity for their testimony. The State agreed to dismiss the obstruction charges against both companions if, after the trial, it believed they \"testified truthfully.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Padilla briefly suggests that the jury's interaction with the bailiff was \"an independent ground for mistrial\" that impermissibly tainted the proceedings. He asserts that trial counsel should have moved for a mistrial on this basis or, \"at the very least, ask[ed] for a contemporaneous in camera review.\" But Padilla does not develop this argument as an independent basis for reversal on appeal. Rather, it appears to be part of his overall argument that the jury was so confused that counsel should have renewed his motion for a mistrial. As a result, we do not address this argument separately.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Padilla also argues that we should reverse \"because the cumulative effect of the errors was prejudicial.\" However, we have not concluded that the trial court committed any error related to this appeal.
