We restate the issues on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by partially denying Frey's pre-trial motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior bad acts?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence about Frey's ability to see?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    3.

During the years from 2001 to 2006, Frey was alleged to have sexually assaulted three females who were then between the ages of five and fourteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Prior to trial, Frey moved in limine to prohibit the State from presenting evidence of his seven prior criminal convictions and to exclude any reference to earlier investigations into alleged child sexual abuse committed by Frey. The State objected to the exclusion of evidence pertaining to Frey's 1991 convictions for false reporting to law enforcement, which it intended to introduce during cross-examination as bearing upon Frey's truthfulness, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 608(b), if Frey chose to testify. In a pre-trial written order, the District Court denied Frey's motion as to his convictions for false reporting for purposes of the State's use of the evidence under M. R. Evid. 608(b), reasoning that, \"[t]he Court has no additional information regarding the conviction for false reports to law enforcement, but it is inclined to allow the inquiry on cross-examination.\" The District Court granted Frey's motion to exclude evidence concerning other prior bad acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 At the January 2015 trial, Frey appeared using a walking cane and wearing dark glasses. As his appellate briefing acknowledges, Frey presented in the courtroom \"as a blind man.\" Frey testified his eyesight began deteriorating in the late 1990s and that he began walking with a cane in 2010. Frey indicated in a pre-trial motion that in October of 2013, he had \"recently gone blind\" and enrolled in an eyesight rehabilitation program in Boise, Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 In its case-in-chief, the State solicited testimony from witnesses about Frey's eyesight during the years of the alleged abuse-between 2001 and 2006. Victim K.B. testified that, during the time of her abuse, Frey \"had the ability to see and drive.\" K.B. recalled Frey recreating, swimming, roasting marshmallows, catching a snake, and target shooting with a gun while he was on a camping trip with K.B.'s family. When asked about whether Frey could see at that time, another witness stated, \"Yes, he could see. I sure hope so. He drove us around a lot.\" Other witnesses described Frey working as a maintenance supervisor, driving, shopping, watching movies, camping, swimming, and picking up the victims from school. Frey did not object to this questioning by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 As the final witness in its case-in-chief, the State called Detective Kipp Tkachyk, the lead investigator in this case. Detective Tkachyk described interviewing Frey in 2010 after advising Frey of his Miranda rights and receiving a signed consent form from him. When asked if Frey appeared to have any difficulty reading the form, Detective Tkachyk\n   responded, \"No. He was able to sign right on the signature\n   line, and then I actually asked him if he would date it, he went back and dated it on the date line.\" Frey made no objection to this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Detective Tkachyk then testified about an occasion, sometime after the 2010 interview, when he escorted Frey to an eye examination in Salt Lake City, Utah. The State asked whether Frey made \"any statements that he could see while you were with him on that trip.\" Frey then offered a non-specific objection \"to this line of questioning,\" to which the State responded that the questions would \"speak to Mr. Frey's credibility.\" The court overruled the objection. Detective Tkachyk testified that, at the beginning of the trip, \"it appeared that [Frey] had a difficult time seeing,\" but that, after further observation, he determined that Frey \"actually could see\" and therefore, \"didn't feel it was necessary to hold his hand or arm as we walked to-across the tarmac to the airplane, and he was able to do that on his own.\" Tkachyk recalled how Frey walked around the waiting room of the hospital before his eye exam, occasionally looking out the window. Tkachyk stated that Frey, while at the window, \"commented to me that he could see a cement pump truck which was, my recollection, easily three blocks away,\" and that Frey described the orange boom that was attached to the truck and how it was being used to pump cement. Tkachyk then completed his testimony and the State rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After presenting the testimony of two witnesses, defense counsel advised the court that Frey was going to testify. The jury was dismissed from the courtroom to allow counsel and the court to discuss a cautionary jury instruction related to Frey's 1991 convictions for false reporting, during which defense counsel stated, \"Here is the deal. I'm going to offer it.... I'm not letting you talk about it before I talk about it.\" Counsel continued, \"[T]he court has stated that that subject can be brought up by the State regarding the false reports to law enforcement, it's certainly something that I'm going to ask my client on direct and have him explain the circumstances of that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 At the point in Frey's direct testimony when he intended to address the 1991 convictions, the court read the cautionary instruction to the jury, which instructed that the evidence was to be used only \"for the purpose of referring to the Defendant's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\" Frey then testified about his false reporting convictions. In closing, defense counsel argued that, although a defendant does not have to testify, \"Mr. Frey did testify, he wanted you to hear his side of this story, he wanted you to hear it from him, not from me just cross-examining the State's witnesses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The jury found Frey guilty of committing three counts of Sexual\n   Assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA.

First, Frey argues the District Court erroneously denied his pre-trial motion in limine to prohibit the State from admitting evidence of his convictions for false reporting. Second, Frey argues the\n   court erroneously admitted testimony regarding his ability to see. Based upon these asserted evidentiary errors, Frey asserts he was \"forced to testify\" to \"explain his version of the events\" and \"counter the attack on his credibility\" by offering evidence of his own prior convictions before the State cross-examined him. Further, Frey argues a \"blatant violation of the Rules of Evidence\" permitted the State to attack his credibility through extrinsic evidence of his eyesight, thus implicating his fundamental right not to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Though intertwined in Frey's arguments, the District Court's denial of Frey's motion in limine was a separate ruling from the admission of trial testimony by the State witnesses, and we undertake review of the issues separately for the sake of clarity and to accurately reflect the District Court's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15\n   <em>\n    1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by partially denying Frey's pre-trial motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior bad acts?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Frey argues the District Court erred by denying his motion to prohibit the State's use of his 1991 false reporting convictions. Citing\n   M. R. Evid. 403, Frey argues these prior convictions were \"too remote and prejudicial,\" outweighing their probative value, and notes the convictions occurred twenty-four years before trial and many years before the alleged offenses in this case occurred. The District Court permitted the convictions to be used under M. R. Evid. 608(b), explaining that \"a specific instance of conduct may be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness but only if it is probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness,\" and concluding it was \"inclined to allow the inquiry on cross-examination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 M. R. Evid. 608(b) generally prohibits use of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of conduct of a witness, \"for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility.\" However, as the Rule provides, and this Court has recognized, a court \"possesses the discretion whether to admit specific instances of conduct to show a witness's credibility,\" i.e., their character for truthfulness, which is to be \"inquired into on cross-examination of the witness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753960\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/260/\">\n    2012 MT 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753960\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/260/\">\n    366 Mont. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753960\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/366/260/\">\n    286 P.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; M.

We held the district court's exclusion of the forgery charge evidence was not an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Frey contends that his twenty-four-year-old convictions were too remote and therefore their prejudicial effect substantially outweighed their probative value under M. R. Evid. 403, and that the outcome in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   -exclusion of the evidence-should control the outcome here. However, regarding remoteness, we \"consistently have declined to establish an arbitrary time limit for admitting other acts or crimes as evidence where such a cut-off would exclude probative evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The false reporting\n   convictions involved dishonesty to law enforcement and thus were relevant to Frey's credibility for truthfulness. We conclude the District Court, in denying Frey's motion, did not \"act[ ] arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[ ] the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting testimony about Frey's ability to see?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 Frey contends the District Court erred by overruling his objection to Detective\n   Tkachyk's testimony about his eyesight, leading to an improper attack upon his credibility that constituted \"a blatant violation\" of M. R. Evid. 608(b). He also argues the evidence was irrelevant and, ultimately, contributed to his being \"forced to testify\" in violation of his right to remain silent. However, initially, Frey's broadly stated arguments fail to accurately capture the handling of this issue as reflected in the trial record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 During trial, the State offered witness testimony regarding Frey's ability to see during the years in which the offenses were alleged to have occurred. No objection was offered to this testimony. Then, Detective Tkachyk offered his observations about Frey's ability to see during the 2010 investigative interview of Frey, several years after the time of the alleged offenses. Again, no objection was offered to this testimony. Only near the end of the State's case-in-chief, when the State asked Detective Tkachyk about his observations regarding Frey's ability to see on a subsequent trip to Utah, did Frey object. Frey's objection was non-specific, stating only an objection \"to this line of questioning,\" to which the prosecutor responded that \"these questions will speak to Mr. Frey's credibility.\" After Frey's objection was overruled, the State elicited Tkachyk's testimony about Frey's apparent ability to see on the Utah trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 24 On appeal, Frey argues broadly that all of the State's testimony about his ability to see was extrinsic evidence improperly offered by the State to prove specific instances of conduct in violation of M. R. Evid. 608(b), was irrelevant, and forced him to testify in violation of his right to remain silent-all premised on his non-specific objection made near the end of the State's case. As the State argues in its briefing, \"Frey now makes all manner of objections about this isolated testimony out of all the evidence that was presented without objection at trial about Frey's ability to see-none of which he raised at trial.\" The State is correct that almost all of the \"ability to see\" evidence was admitted prior to any objection. As this Court has held, objections \"must be made at trial in a timely manner and upon\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   grounds\" in order to \"preserve an appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

This evidence was properly admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26 Frey's Rule 608 argument on appeal, premised upon the State's response to his non-specific objection that it was offering extrinsic evidence to \"speak to ... Frey's credibility,\" is correct on a theoretical level; that is, had Frey made a proper Rule 608 objection at trial, the State's response would have been unavailing, and the District Court would have erred by admitting the testimony in the State's case-in-chief. However, any such error was harmless. As explained above, much of the contested evidence became relevant at trial and was properly admitted. To the extent that the evidence concerning the subsequent Utah trip would have been improper under Rule 608(b), it constituted trial error under\n   <em>\n    State v.

Section 46-18-232(2), MCA prohibits the court from imposing costs on a defendant \"unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them.\" In determining what costs to impose, \"the court shall take into account the financial resources of the defendant, the future ability of the defendant to pay costs, and the nature of the burden that payment of costs will impose.\" Section 46-18-232(2), MCA. The State concedes this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 30 Additionally, Frey contests the $30 technology fee imposed on him, arguing that it was improper for a $10 fee to be imposed for each of his three charged offenses.
