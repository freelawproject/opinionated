Williams of sexually abusing his three daughters. After Defendant was convicted, the district court sentenced him to multiple prison terms, several of which are potentially for the remainder of his life. Because we conclude that irregularities occurred in the State's juror examination,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   we reverse his convictions and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant's three daughters, Oldest, Middle, and Youngest, accused Defendant of sexually abusing them repeatedly over a five-year period. During this time, the alleged abuse included, but was not limited to, touching his daughters' breasts and pubic areas; showering with them; and on one occasion, forcing his daughters to undress and smear body paint on each other as Defendant watched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The State charged Defendant with six counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and six counts of forcible sexual abuse. During juror examination, the trial court asked potential jurors about their personal and professional lives before allowing counsel for the State and Defendant to conduct additional juror examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During trial, the jury heard testimony from Defendant's daughters, who detailed the abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury also heard testimony regarding the daughters' difficulties in school, their depression, Oldest's habit of cutting herself, and Oldest and Middle's joint overdose on antidepressants and subsequent hospitalizations. The State's expert testified that these behaviors were consistent with symptoms exhibited by sexual abuse victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Oldest's trial testimony conflicted with her testimony at Defendant's preliminary hearing in some respects. She initially testified that Defendant showered with her once or twice a month before the family moved, but at trial she said it happened only once, total, in the family's first house. At the preliminary hearing, she testified that she could not recall Defendant touching her in the shower, but at trial she said he \"cupped\" her breasts and buttocks and washed her body. Oldest testified at the preliminary hearing that Defendant touched her breasts and vaginal area five to ten times at the first house; but at trial she could not recall him touching any of her body parts at the first house. Shortly after her assertion at trial that Defendant had not touched her in the first house, she testified regarding an incident in the first house during which Defendant had touched her inappropriately while wrestling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Middle originally testified at length at the preliminary hearing about Defendant's abuse of her sisters, but later admitted at trial that she had never seen him inappropriately touching Oldest or Youngest. When Middle initially reported Defendant's abuse, she denied that he had ever inserted his finger into her vagina. But at trial, she testified that he did so on multiple occasions, explaining that she originally denied this behavior because she wanted to minimize the trouble Defendant would be in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Youngest's testimony that Defendant left \"white gooey stuff\" on her legs after a back rub was a detail reported for the first time at trial. Youngest explained that she only recalled that fact as she was testifying. At trial, on cross-examination, Youngest frequently answered that she could not recall the information she was asked to provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 All three daughters' stories regarding the body-painting incident differed from one another. Oldest testified that she and Middle had been painting a picture when the sisters started painting each other. Defendant then instructed them to remove their clothing, and he stripped down to his underwear, before they all painted one another. When she was asked about this incident at the preliminary hearing, she denied that it occurred; only at trial did she allege that it took place. Middle testified that Defendant had told them he ordered the paints online. When he produced them, they all removed their clothes and started painting each other. Youngest also testified that Defendant bought the paints online and explained that he made them remove their clothing. Middle and Youngest testified that after they painted each other, all four showered together. Oldest made no such claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Defendant testified in his own defense and denied sexually abusing any of his daughters. The jury convicted Defendant as charged. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Defendant argues that we should reverse his convictions for any one of five reasons. First, he asserts that the jury instructions given at trial were inadequate. Second, he asserts that during the State's closing argument, the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by (1) impermissibly bringing to the jury's attention facts not in evidence, (2) arguing that Defendant lied, (3) disparaging the integrity of defense counsel, and (4) appealing to the jury's fears by seeking a verdict to protect society. Third, he asserts that the State violated rule 608 of the Utah Rules of Evidence by improperly bolstering the credibility of its witnesses. Fourth, he asserts\n   that the State offered inadmissible evidence of his invocation of his right to counsel. And fifth, he asserts that during his testimony, he was improperly asked to opine on the veracity of other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Defendant did not raise any of these arguments before the trial court. Instead, he brings his claims under the doctrines of ineffective assistance of counsel and plain error. To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Defendant must:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) identify specific acts or omissions by counsel that fall below the standard of reasonable professional assistance when considered at the time of the act or omission and under all the attendant circumstances, and (ii) demonstrate that counsel's error prejudiced the defendant, i.e., that but for the error, there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

To demonstrate plain error, Defendant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   must show the following: (i) An error exists; (ii) the error should have been obvious to the trial court; and (iii) the error is harmful, i.e., absent the error, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome for the appellant, or phrased differently, our confidence in the verdict is undermined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366314\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/850/1201/#p1225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366314\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/850/1201/#p1225\">\n    at 1208-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 Although Defendant raises many potential grounds for reversing his convictions, we are persuaded by his arguments regarding the irregularities and impropriety that occurred during juror examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we reverse on that ground and remand for a new trial, we need not consider the other issues raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude that an error occurred and that the error should have been obvious to the trial court. Because Defendant's challenge is best understood by experiencing the flow of the State's juror examination in its odd entirety, we quote at length from it. Any emphasis is our own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 The prosecutor began by sharing, \"My experience has been that jurors want to do a good job. They want to do a good job. They just want to make sure they understand all the evidence, and they want to do a good job.\" She then assured the prospective jurors, \"So as I talk to you right now, just understand there are not right or wrong answers. I'm just trying to find out how you view life, how you view your job as a juror, things of that nature,\n   <em>\n    and maybe what your thoughts are on child sex abuse\n   </em>\n   .... So please feel free to raise your hand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 After encouraging members of the venire to \"just be honest,\" she initiated a discussion about child sex abuse:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Prosecutor]: How do you know children are sometimes sexually abused?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Prospective Juror]: Well, I can think of three friends that have either had someone in their family sexually abused or themselves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Were these close friends?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Prospective Juror]: Well, they're friends. I-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Friends, okay. That you're aware-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Prospective Juror]: They're not my closest friends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Yeah, but you-\n   <em>\n    they shared with you the fact that they've had children in their family abused and so on and so forth\n   </em>\n   . So how is it that society sort of proves or becomes aware of child sex abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Prospective jurors provided answers, such as, \"Well, the person that has done that to the child has said that they did,\" and \"Or it is medically proven.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b617 Apparently not hearing the answer she wanted, the prosecutor continued, \"So let's say someone decides to be really brave and say, 'Okay, okay, okay, I've been touching a kid.' That may happen.\n   <em>\n    I've never seen it\n   </em>\n   , but-I'm only kidding. But how else?\" An inaudible response was given, and then the prosecutor stated, without getting an answer from any member of the jury pool, \"So a child may be acting weird or they may say something, and then an adult gets wind of that and then they report that. Is that generally what happens? In the end, what is it that causes it?\n   <em>\n    Isn't it\n   </em>\n   that the child says ... something is bothering me.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b618 Next, the prosecutor asked, \"So you as jurors in a case like this,\n   <em>\n    are you going to\n   </em>\n   require anything more in terms of physical evidence or other corroboration necessarily?\" After receiving an inaudible response, she began talking about \"CSI or Law and Order or Boston Legal\" regarding \"physical evidence\" and asserted, \"I'm just going to tell you that I think you know this, but it's actually an important concept to realize that we are not required to do CSI investigations or work. We just have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\" She asked, \"\n   <em>\n    Would any of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   require that type of evidence in order to convict someone of this type of crime?\" When she saw \"some brow furrowing\" she followed up with one of the prospective jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Prosecutor]: What are you thinking up there, Ms. [K.]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Ms. K.]: I'm thinking maybe so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Okay, maybe so. Okay, tell me about that. That's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Ms. K.]: I mean I don't know that it would need to be D-I don't know. I'm not sure what evidence[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Eventually the prosecutor elicited from Ms. K. that she would likely expect to see more evidence than solely \"a child's report in and of itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b619 With this understanding, the prosecutor switched course and began discussing \"general rule[s]\" about child sexual abuse. She asked, \"[I]s a child abused in secret or somewhere where it is not secret?\" Without pausing for an answer, she stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    So that's kind of a no brainer, right\n   </em>\n   ?\n   <em>\n    Everybody\n   </em>\n   understand[s] ... who is usually there? The perpetrator and the child, right? Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   So who are the only two people in the world who really know what really happened?\n   <em>\n    Just those two\n   </em>\n   . If a child is touched, and it isn't reported immediately, is that something that we're necessarily going to have physical evidence of? Does that mean it didn't happen?\n   <em>\n    No. Okay.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b620 Next came a conversation about delayed reporting and why that might occur. Some prospective jurors provided answers-fear, guilt, and grooming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the answer \"grooming\" was given, the prosecutor replied, \"Grooming, okay. Okay. Very good. Very good.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b621 Changing tack, the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Now I sometimes do this, and it's really awful, but ... I sometimes say-who do I want to pick on? I wonder if you would turn to Ms. [M.] there and-is it [M.]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Ms. M.]: Uh-huh.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Okay. If you would just\n   <em>\n    tell her about the very last sexual experience you had\n   </em>\n   , and if you could be very detailed, okay? Please make sure you don't (inaudible) the body parts and where everybody put everything and all of that. Would you mind just turning and just sharing that with her?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Meaning to use this as a demonstration of how the court system often asks victims in child sexual abuse cases to testify as to \"some pretty embarrassing things,\" she ended the inquiry without actually requiring the venire to engage in such an intimate conversation. She said, \"I'm not going to ask you do that. Why do I ask that? Why do I ask that?\" And when someone gave the answer she was looking for, she replied, \"There we go. There we go.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b622 The discussion shifted to the topic of changed stories and why someone might give different accounts of the same story. The prosecutor frequently replied to prospective jurors' answers by saying things like, \"Yeah, exactly,\" or, \"That's exactly right.\" Then she discussed with the venire whether we can \"tell who touches children by looking at them.\" Receiving no answers from individual members of the jury pool, the prosecutor presented a string of questions, the answers to which were implied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Can we tell by how much money they make? Can we tell by how old they are? Can we tell by how they look?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   What about their personality? What about if they're very charming? Does that tell us?\n   <em>\n    Do charming people touch children\n   </em>\n   ? Do you think?\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b623 Finally, the prosecutor ended with what we consider standard juror examination questions regarding prospective jurors' willingness to \"sit in judgment of another person,\" whether they would feel \"uneasy about having to hear about sexual abuse,\" whether anyone \"just doesn't want to be here,\" and whether there was \"anything that [they could] think of that makes [them] feel like\" they should not sit on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b624 Defendant now argues that the prosecutor's juror examination was \"more of a Socratic lecture on why the jurors should believe the [victims], despite and even because of the inconsistencies in their claims.\" He complains that \"rather than asking questions designed to skillfully cull [honest] attitudes from the jurors, the prosecutor asked the panel of prospective jurors a number of rhetorical questions designed to indoctrinate the jurors on the State's theor[ies]\" of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b625 The State responds that the juror examination simply involved \"friendly responses to juror answers,\" and suggests that because \"none of these questions or comments related to any particular witness or testimony,\" juror examination was \"merely designed to ferret out biases among the jurors that might predispose them to disbelieve children.\" For several reasons, we cannot agree that the prosecutor's juror examination was as innocuous as the State asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b626 First, the prosecutor posed \"hypothetical questions closely approximating the facts of the case ... and delivered a lecture.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814041\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/877/859/#p860\">\n    877 N.W.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (Iowa 2016) (reviewing this and more concerning behavior in a prosecutor's juror examination but refusing to grant a new trial \"[i]n part because [the defendant] did not object in the district court to all the statements he challenge[d] on appeal\"). Such questions, and the relevant fact scenarios, included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 \"If a child is touched, and it isn't reported immediately, is that something that we're necessarily going to have physical evidence of? Does that mean it didn't happen? No. Okay.\" Defendant's daughters delayed reporting, and there was no physical evidence of their abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 \"Do charming people touch children?\" The prosecutor later described Defendant as \"charming.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 \"So let's say someone decides to be really brave and say, 'Okay, okay, okay, I've been touching a kid.' That may happen. I've never seen it, but-I'm only kidding.\" Defendant never wavered on his position that he had never touched his daughters inappropriately, and by presenting denial as an inference of guilt during juror examination, the prosecutor improperly indoctrinated the jury to react favorably to the same argument at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b627 Additionally, the prosecutor devoted much of her juror examination to making statements and posing rhetorical questions rather than inquiring into the prospective jurors' thoughts and attitudes, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 Making proclamations about the general pattern of sexual abuse, such as, \"[I]s a child abused in secret or somewhere where it is not secret? So that's kind of a no brainer, right?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Telling the venire its options for whom to believe at trial. \"So who are the only two people in the world who really know what really happened? Just those two.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 Indicating when prospective jurors gave answers she liked and praising them, showing (despite her opening remarks to the contrary) that there were indeed right and wrong answers. \"Okay. Very good. Very good.\" \"There we go. There we go.\" \"Yeah, exactly.\" \"That's exactly right.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b628 Finally, in many instances, the prosecutor posed questions without awaiting a response. \"Isn't it that the child says ... something is bothering me.\" \"Everybody understand[s] ... who is usually there? The perpetrator and the child, right? Okay.\" On this point, we consider persuasive a Virginia case discussing juror examination questions posed by a trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Proof of a prospective juror's impartiality should come from him and not be based on\n   his mere assent to persuasive suggestions. When asked by the court, a suggestive question produces an even more unreliable response.

There, the court reviewed a defendant's convictions for sexual assault and aggravated sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. During juror examination, the prosecutor asked prospective jurors, \"Would somebody volunteer to tell all of us about your last sexual experience?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Presumably because no one volunteered, the prosecutor followed up with, \"How about last year, experience from last year? Doesn't have to be the most recent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Again, the prosecutor had no takers. So he asked a specific prospective juror, \"Why didn't you raise your hand and tell everybody about\n   that[?]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This led to a discussion about \"feelings of nervousness and embarrassment and that sort of thing involved and attached to that question,\" as well as how difficult it would be for a fifteen-year-old girl to share details about sexual abuse by her stepfather.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b634 The Illinois Appellate Court reviewed for plain error the defendant's claim that \"the prosecutor improperly indoctrinated the jurors during [juror examination].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

It explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Juror examination] is not to be used as a means of indoctrinating a jury, or impaneling a jury with a particular predisposition.

Both cases involved a father figure allegedly sexually abusing his daughters. Both prosecutors asked inappropriately intimate questions about the jurors' sex lives. Both prosecutors used their examination questions to segue to a discussion regarding the difficulties of sharing intimate details in a public setting. And in doing so, both prosecutors improperly attempted to bolster the victim's credibility. We accordingly conclude, like the Illinois Appellate Court, that the \"prosecutor should never have asked these questions, and once they were asked, the trial court should have emphatically stopped this line of inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.

Additional problematic questions posed by the prosecutor in this case make it a clear call. Here, the prosecutor impermissibly used juror examination to preview and argue her case, explaining how child sex abuse cases are reported, investigated, and proven at trial and coaching the potential jury members on how they should evaluate the evidence.

We conclude that had error not occurred, there is a reasonable likelihood that Defendant would have had a more favorable outcome. Our reasoning is two-fold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b639 First, the prosecutor's attempts to bolster the victims' credibility were not isolated incidents, but permeated the State's entire juror examination. When she did ask questions, they were almost always premised on facts-presented as hypotheticals-that mirrored the actual facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Instead of asking open-ended questions, her questions resembled those one would expect to hear on cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. In short, where the juror examination process was replete with suggestive questions and improper allusions to the actual facts of this case, and lacking in questions meant to root out biases, Defendant's trial was tainted before it began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b640 Second, the case turned on the credibility of the victims, and the improper juror examination predisposed the jury to believe the victims' testimony, despite evidence of inconsistency. We acknowledge that the State presented a large amount of evidence indicating Defendant's guilt. But that evidence was not without its problems, and ultimately the case turned entirely on the victims' testimony. The incongruities in the daughters' testimony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-8, thus compound the concerns that began during juror examination and undermine our confidence in Defendant's convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366314\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/850/1201/#p1225\">\n    850 P.2d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
