But there were no due process violations with respect to her three remaining claims. We further conclude that the Appeal Board's failure to make findings of fact that supported its decision to uphold Palmer's discipline constituted an abuse of discretion. We therefore set aside the decision of the Appeal Board and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Palmer is a Sergeant with the SGPD. In June 2014, she received a report that someone's cell phone contained child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Palmer initiated an investigation and seized the suspect's computer and cell phone. Another officer then copied pornographic images from these devices onto a CD for Palmer's review. Palmer did not complete her report on the case until August 2016-more than two years later. During that period, she did not properly store the CD and instead left it unsecured in her desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Before Palmer had completed her report, her supervisor had initiated an internal affairs investigation to review her ability to manage her responsibilities. Palmer's supervisor formally complained to SGPD's Chief of Police (the Chief), who determined that the Disciplinary Review Board (the Disciplinary Board) should be convened to recommend discipline. Based on the internal affairs investigation, the Disciplinary Board recommended that Palmer be demoted in rank and that she undergo a six-month action plan \"to improve report writing and ensure any future evidence [is] logged correctly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Following the Disciplinary Board's recommendation, Palmer received a Notice of Intent to Discipline (the Notice), informing her that she had violated St. George City Policy 4.50 related to incompetence, misconduct, and failure to perform duty. The Notice also provided the date and time of a pre-disciplinary hearing meeting and explained that Palmer could \"bring to the meeting any evidence or witnesses\" that she chose. Palmer requested that her attorney be present, but she was told an \"attorney would not qualify as a witness\" and therefore would not be allowed to attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Palmer appeared at the pre-disciplinary hearing meeting without counsel, after which the Chief recommended to the City Manager that she be demoted without a reduction in pay and placed on a \"Performance Improvement Action Plan.\" The City Manager gave Palmer notice of this recommendation and informed her that she had the right to appeal it. Through the process of that appeal, the Chief reconsidered his recommendation and instead recommended only \"five days (40 hours) off without pay and that [Palmer] be placed on an action plan, rather than a recommendation of demotion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City Manager upheld the decision to impose the lesser penalty, and Palmer appealed this decision to the Appeal Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Before her hearing in front of the Appeal Board (the Disciplinary Appeal Hearing), Palmer twice requested \"production of information regarding other disciplinary matters investigated under [Palmer's supervisor].\" The City responded that the comparable discipline information was \"not relevant\" because the only information the Appeal Board would review was the internal investigation of Palmer. Palmer also communicated to the City her belief that the St. George\n   City Attorney (the City Attorney) should not be involved in the Disciplinary Appeal Hearing, because of his \"prior involvement [in the investigation] and obligation to protect the City's interest,\" as well as her belief that the City Attorney's continued involvement in her case constituted \"[a] de facto violation of [her] procedural due process rights.\" The City Attorney and the City disagreed and stated they would \"proceed as planned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Leading up to the hearing, both parties were informed that they would be \"given one hour to present their arguments, including questioning of any witnesses.\" Palmer believed that one hour was too little time in which to present her defense, and that the Appeal Board's one-hour time limit was \"unacceptable and yet again another attempt by the [Appeal Board] to deprive [her] of her protected due process rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The City Attorney did not participate in the hearing. Instead, an Assistant City Attorney advised the Appeal Board, and the City was represented by private counsel. Palmer's attorney opened the arguments by identifying five issues that he believed constituted due process violations, the following four are relevant to this petition for review: \"[Palmer's] right to counsel during the [pre-]disciplinary process\"; \"her right to present evidence and confront witnesses free from unreasonable [time] limits\"; \"her right to an impartial hearing free from the taint of dual representation by city attorneys\"; and \"the refusal of the City and [the Appeal Board] to provide information for comparable disciplinary analysis.\" During the course of the hearing, Palmer's attorney called two witnesses, and the City called four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 After hearing testimony from six witnesses, the Appeal Board unanimously upheld the City Manager's decision to suspend Palmer \"for five days, 40 hours, without pay.\" The Appeal Board issued its decision in a one-sentence \"certification\" and did not make findings of fact or otherwise explain the basis for its decision to uphold Palmer's suspension. Palmer petitions this court for review of the Appeal Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Palmer makes three overarching contentions on judicial review. First, she contends that the Appeal Board erred in failing to rule on her claim that the City violated her due process rights when she was denied legal representation at the pre-disciplinary hearing meeting. Generally, our review of administrative agency decisions is \"limited to determining whether the [agency] abused its discretion or exceeded its authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylorsville City v.

Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Palmer contends the Appeal Board erred in failing to rule on her due process claim that she was entitled to legal representation at her pre-disciplinary hearing meeting. Palmer also contends the Appeal Board violated her due process rights in three respects: by imposing a one-hour time limit for the Disciplinary Appeal Hearing; by receiving advice from the City Attorney who had already advised the City in the pre-disciplinary proceedings; and by refusing to compel the City to disclose comparable discipline evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Employees Do Not Have the Right to Counsel at Pre-Disciplinary Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 Palmer contends her attorney should have been allowed to represent her at the pre-disciplinary hearing meeting and that the Appeal Board erred when it failed to rule in her favor on the issue. Palmer does not assert any constitutional right to counsel in administrative proceedings but correctly points out that the right to counsel attaches if it is provided by statute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

App. 1990) (explaining that agencies are not \"required to appoint counsel for claimants\" and that, \"[g]enerally, claimants in an administrative hearing [before the Labor Commission] are entitled to retain the counsel of their choice\"). Specifically, Palmer argues that, under Utah Code section 10-3-1106, the statutory right of employees to be represented by counsel in disciplinary proceedings attaches \"as soon as [an] employee becomes [the] subject of discipline.\" We disagree with Palmer's interpretation of section 10-3-1106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 When interpreting statutes, we first look to their plain language and give effect to that language unless it is ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At that point, she was the subject of a pre-discipline investigation that resulted in a recommendation for discipline. Her pre-disciplinary hearing meeting was intended to inform her of the alleged misconduct and to\n   allow her to explain her actions before the Chief made a recommendation for discipline to the City Manager. Only when the City Manager made the final decision to suspend Palmer did she become \"the subject of the ... suspension,\" and therefore her right to have an attorney present did not attach until after the City Manager made this decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2010-3-1106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10-3-1106(4)(a).

Before the Army could begin its destruction of the hazardous waste, the board required \"a series of 'trial burns' to ensure that the facility could operate safely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These trial burns were also subject to screenings to address whether the emissions during the burns \"would cause cancer...

Sierra Club was informed six months in advance of a hearing before an appeal board that it would be given \"twelve hours to argue and conduct direct and cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 346. Sierra Club asserted that the restrictions did not allow it adequate time to cross-examine witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It argued on its petition for review to this court that the appeal board violated its due process rights \"by unreasonably limiting its time to present its case and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The opposing party argued that \"Sierra Club was afforded ample opportunity to present its case and to cross-examine witnesses, but that Sierra Club failed to efficiently use its allotted time and failed to exploit the available opportunities for otherwise getting evidence before the [appeal board].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 On review, this court determined that although the appeal board's time limitations \"appear[ed] somewhat parsimonious, under the APA the [appeal board] was entitled to regulate the course of the hearing, which necessarily included its duration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 347. The appeal board \"offered the parties numerous opportunities to present their positions in forms other than through time-consuming testimony\" and granted Sierra Club \"forty-five minutes of extra time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, Sierra Club failed to show it \"suffered substantial\n   prejudice\" because, \"[a]side from generally alleging that it lacked time to cross-examine several witnesses, Sierra Club [did] not state what evidence it needed to get in but did not, nor [did] it show that the case would have come out differently had it been given more time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 348. This court concluded that the \"time limitations were not unreasonable and that Sierra Club was not denied its constitutional rights to Due Process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 Here, the one-hour per-side time limit was not unreasonable. The complexity of Palmer's case did not rise to that of\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   because Palmer's disciplinary proceedings related to one discrete employment incident. The Appeal Board permitted the parties to cross-examine witnesses outside of the one-hour limit and to admit hundreds of pages of exhibits into evidence. Although counsel was unable to finish conducting his direct examination of a witness because his time was running out and could not call his remaining witnesses, he used a considerable portion of his time having Palmer, as a witness, read documents that were already admitted into evidence. Palmer has also failed to show that she suffered substantial prejudice by the time limit; she did not identify evidence she was prevented from presenting before the Appeal Board or what certain witnesses would have testified to, had they been called, and she did not explain how the case might have been resolved differently had she been given more time.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   We therefore conclude the Appeal Board's one-hour time limit did not constitute a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C.

SGPD Policy 1005.5 requires supervisors to \"ensure that all formal and informal complaints are documented on a complaint form,\" \"[a]ll complaints and inquiries should also be documented in a log that records and tracks complaints,\" and the \"log shall include the nature of the complaint and the actions taken to address the complaint.\" SGPD Policy 1005.6.3 and 1005.6.4 further require that formal investigations include documentation of the investigation, including an introduction, synopsis, summary, evidence, conclusion, exhibits, and the final disposition. And City Policy 4.50(V) requires the department supervisor, in this case the Chief, to recommend to the City Manager appropriate discipline and to include \"[d]etails of the employee's behavior or performance\" and a \"summary of the evidence that includes the employee's response and submitted evidence.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In fact, Respondents concede as much in their brief, stating that \"the Appeal Board was not required to consider the consistency of [Palmer's] treatment because [she] 'failed to point to sufficiently similar episodes of conduct by other officers so as to trigger consistency analysis.' \" (Quoting\n    <em>\n     Kelly v. Salt Lake City Civil Service Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11195806\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/8/1048/\">\n     2000 UT App 235\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 34,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11195806\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/8/1048/\">\n     8 P.3d 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .) This was an onerous task, considering Respondents refused to disclose evidence of similar conduct on the basis that it was \"not relevant.\" And in\n    <em>\n     Kelly\n    </em>\n    , the employee had access to comparable discipline evidence but could not make a showing that her conduct was similar to other employees with more lenient penalties.\n    <em>\n     Kelly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11195806\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/8/1048/\">\n     2000 UT App 235\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11195806\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/8/1048/\">\n     8 P.3d 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, Respondents' reliance on\n    <em>\n     Kelly\n    </em>\n    is also misplaced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
