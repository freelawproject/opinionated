The State charged Defendant with two of the four alleged incidents. At trial, the State moved to introduce evidence of the other two incidents under rule 404(b). The trial court allowed the evidence, despite Defendant's objection, and issued a limiting instruction. The trial court also employed-without objection-a jury instruction based on statutorily undefined terms which the court defined for the purpose of the instruction by using dictionaries. The jury convicted Defendant as charged. Defendant timely appeals, alleging that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the character evidence and erred in employing dictionary definitions in the additional jury instruction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Incident One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Incident One occurred in December 2011, when Defendant visited Victim's home. During Defendant's visit, Victim fell asleep on the couch in her living room. She awoke to someone kissing her neck in a \"very sexual ... nature\" and \"assumed it was [her] husband\" because it was open mouthed and his tongue was on her neck. He had his left hand pressing on her right rib cage, which was \"below [her] breast but ... touching [her] bra[.]\" Upon seeing that it was actually her father touching her, Victim froze in place, completely in shock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Soon thereafter, Victim's husband (Husband) entered the room, heard \"weird kissing noises,\" and saw Defendant leaning over Victim with his face down. Husband yelled, \"Hey!\" and Defendant ran out the door of the house, quickly got into his car, and drove away. Afterward, Defendant stayed away from Victim and her immediate family for approximately eight months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Incident Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Incident Two (Count One) occurred in October 2012. Without permission or invitation, Defendant visited Victim's new home, where he spent the night. The next morning, Defendant, Victim, and her children were at the house after Husband had gone to work. Victim heard Defendant speak in a \"very low, husky voice, and ask[ ] her [daughter] if she had her big girl panties on.\" Victim's eight-year-old daughter was visibly shocked. Victim gave him a \"dirty look,\" and he stopped talking to her daughter in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant then got on the computer, purportedly to look for a job, but instead pulled \"multiple tabs up with pornographic images and violent animal documentaries.\" Shortly thereafter, Defendant went up to a bedroom to \"take a nap.\" But instead of sleeping, Defendant began to masturbate. Victim caught him and ordered him to leave the house, but he ignored her request. Later, Defendant approached Victim's six-year-old son and asked \"if he had his big boy briefs on\" in a \"low, husky voice.\" Victim once again ordered Defendant to leave, and she took her son out of the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Defendant finally acquiesced to the repeated requests for him to leave and slowly took his belongings out to the car. However, once he had packed the final item, he snuck back into the house. Victim became aware that he had returned only after Defendant suddenly pressed against her from behind with his hands on her breasts, thrusting \"with his erect penis pushed against her buttocks,\" kissing the right side of her neck with an open mouth while using his tongue, and grinding against her several times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 While Defendant sexually assaulted her, Victim froze until she heard her children, who were still in the house. Upon hearing the children, Defendant \"whirled around, ran out the open door, jumped into his car,\" and quickly drove away. Victim began crying and called Husband to relay what had happened. Thereafter, Victim and her family did not see or hear from Defendant for over a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Incident Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Incident Three (Count Two) occurred during a family event on a Saturday in December 2013. Defendant was invited with the understanding that he was to leave directly afterward. However, because it began to snow, Victim and Husband allowed Defendant to stay at their home over the weekend. On Monday morning, after Husband went to work, Victim sat down at her computer with her back to Defendant. Suddenly, Defendant approached Victim, reached around the chair, put his hands on Victim's breasts, and kissed her neck with an open mouth using his tongue. Victim told him to stop several times, but he became more aggressive. As the abuse escalated, Victim burst out of the chair and went to the kitchen \"fuming.\" She told Defendant that she was going to call Husband and that he needed to leave immediately. Defendant left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Incident Four\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 A few days after Incident Three, Victim and her family visited her mother's home to Skype with her sister. When Defendant showed up at the house, Victim left the room that Defendant was in and went into the kitchen. While she was alone in the kitchen, Defendant swiftly approached her and grabbed her from behind. He touched her lower pelvis and breasts and began thrusting against her and kissing her neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Becoming \"alarmed that he was bold enough to do this in front of [the] family,\" she told him to stop, but he became more assertive. He did not stop and when she tried to move away, he grabbed her arms. He started speaking in a \"seductive kind of way\" to her and she said, \"Please let go. Let go of me.\" He ignored her, so she grabbed a cup of water and dumped it on him. Husband heard her say, \"Stop,\" and, \"Let go,\" and he also saw that Defendant had grabbed ahold of Victim's arm as she attempted to pull away. Additionally, Husband witnessed Victim toss water in Defendant's face. At the same moment that the incident began to de-escalate, Victim's sister called the family on Skype, so Defendant went into the other room to speak with her. When the call ended, Defendant quickly left the house, leaving the door open behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Summary of Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 The State charged Defendant with two counts of class A misdemeanor sexual battery relating to Incidents Two and Three.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-702.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Both counts were based on Defendant touching Victim's buttocks and/or breasts under circumstances he knew or should have known would likely cause her affront or alarm.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Prior to trial, the State moved to present evidence under Rule 404(b) that Defendant had sexually touched Victim on two other occasions: Incidents One and Four. The State argued that the evidence was permissible for the noncharacter purposes of showing context, intent, plan, preparation, motive, knowledge, absence of mistake, or lack of accident, or to complete the narrative and disprove Defendant's claim that the witnesses were fabricating their version of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 The trial court held an evidentiary hearing followed by arguments of counsel. In a written ruling, the trial court allowed the State to present evidence of Incidents One and Four, although the State did not bring charges regarding those incidents. The trial court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The consistency of grabbing his daughter when he thought others were not watching, of touching her breasts, pressing his pelvis against her buttocks, kissing her neck, and then fleeing when confronted show intent, motive, plan and preparation to commit the crimes charged. This evidence also shows that the defendant ... knew or should know his conduct would likely cause affront or alarm to his adult daughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to any testimony by Victim regarding Incidents One and Four, the judge read a limiting instruction reminding the jury that the evidence was to be used for specific, noncharacter purposes. Before closing arguments, the court read the limiting instruction again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 The trial court also gave-without objection-a jury instruction based on the statutorily undefined terms \"affront\" and \"alarm,\" which were defined for purposes of the instruction by using three dictionaries: Black's Law Dictionary, Oxford Dictionary, and Merriam-Webster Dictionary. The jury convicted Defendant as charged. Defendant timely appeals and we reject his contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 Defendant raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Incidents One and Four as bad-act evidence against Defendant under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. We review a trial court's decision to admit evidence under rule 404(b) for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

While case law has previously spoken of a requirement of \"scrupulous examination\" of evidence and appellate review has often closely examined the reasoning of the trial court in addressing rule 404(b) evidence, our supreme court recently repudiated that standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court clarified that the correct standard of appellate review regarding evidentiary questions is \"whether the district judge made an error in admitting or excluding the evidence in question.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted). Said another way, we no longer focus on the path the trial court followed in reaching its conclusion, but review only the conclusion itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3 (\"[T]he appellate review of evidentiary rulings is on the decision made at trial, not the process by which that decision is reached.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 Second, Defendant contends that his defense counsel was ineffective for allowing the crime of sexual battery to be so broadly defined in the jury instructions that Defendant suffered unfair prejudice. \"A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Character Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 Defendant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his other two alleged bad acts (Incidents One and Four) under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. This argument fails. Rule 404(b) provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character. ... [but] may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Utah R. Evid. 404(b). Accordingly, under rule 404(b), evidence of a defendant's bad act is not admissible to prove that \"a defendant has a propensity for bad behavior and has acted in conformity with his dubious character.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988572\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1102/\">\n    2011 UT App 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988572\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1102/\">\n    256 P.3d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Noncharacter Purpose\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b618 Here, the trial court appropriately admitted the evidence for at least two\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   different proper, noncharacter purposes: (1) intent and (2) absence of mistake or lack of accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   1. Intent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b619 Evidence is offered for a proper, noncharacter purpose if used to prove intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(2). Here, the two additional incidents, when considered in tandem with the two charged offenses, are relevant to show Defendant's intent. Because sexual battery requires that the defendant not only commit the act of touching, but do so under circumstances that he knows or should know would likely cause affront or alarm, the evidence of the additional two acts is relevant to show Defendant's intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-9-702.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-9-702.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis 2017) (stating that a defendant commits the crime of sexual battery \"under circumstances the actor knows or should know will likely cause affront or alarm to the person touched\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The act-touching and licking Victim, his adult daughter, as she slept on the couch-\"could reasonably be inferred with a basis in logic and human experience\" as evidence of Defendant's intent, since it involved more than just a simple, familial gesture or a harmless or accidental physical act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795068\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/56/\">\n    2016 UT App 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795068\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/56/\">\n    374 P.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that intent to arouse or gratify sexual desire can reasonably be inferred \"with a basis in logic and human experience\" from circumstantial evidence). Here, Defendant's acts were overtly sexual in nature. Kissing his adult daughter, licking her neck, and touching her bra all constitute prima facie evidence of the intent to act under circumstances that one knows or should know will likely cause affront or alarm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b621 By the same token, Incident Four, which occurred in the kitchen at Victim's mother's house, also demonstrates Defendant's intent to act in a sexual way that he knew would cause affront or alarm. The fact that this incident occurred after the charged events is of no import. Particularly where the State offered bad-acts evidence to show intent, acts committed after the charged events can be relevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this case, while at the house, Defendant waited until he and Victim were alone in the kitchen before forcing himself upon her. The fact that he repeated the unwanted conduct only after he isolated her from the family demonstrates his knowledge that the prior conduct was unwelcome. And the particularly sexualized nature of his behavior is relevant to show the intent of his entire course of conduct. Accordingly, the court properly admitted Defendant's two alleged comparable, repeated acts to show his intent to knowingly touch his daughter in a way that would cause affront or alarm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   2. Absence of Mistake or Lack of Accident\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b622 While not a stated basis by the trial court for admission, the State asserted at the evidentiary hearing that the evidence of Incidents One and Four should have been admitted to show absence of mistake or lack of accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evidence is properly offered for a noncharacter purpose if it is offered to prove the absence of mistake or lack of accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R.
