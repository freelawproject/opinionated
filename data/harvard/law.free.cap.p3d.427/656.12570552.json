We hold that it did not. We affirm Nicholas Taylor's DUI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 A trooper with the Washington State Patrol stopped Mr. Taylor for suspected DUI. The stop occurred within the city limits of Spokane. Mr. Taylor failed various tests, and the trooper arrested and cited him for violating RCW 46.61.502.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State charged Mr. Taylor in Spokane County District Court for violating RCW 46.61.502. The jury found Mr. Taylor guilty of DUI, and the district court judge entered a judgment of conviction. Mr. Taylor appealed his conviction to Spokane County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 There, Mr. Taylor argued that the Spokane County District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his DUI case. His argument was predicated on the City enacting Spokane Municipal Code \u00a7 16A.02.010, which adopted Title 308-330 WAC-the Washington Model Traffic Ordinance (WMTO). Title 308-330 WAC adopts various state statutes, including RCW 46.61.502. Mr. Taylor argued that the City's adoption of RCW 46.61.502 vested its municipal court with exclusive jurisdiction over all DUIs committed within the City's boundaries. The superior court rejected his argument and affirmed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mr. Taylor sought discretionary review. We were persuaded that the issue was one of first impression and granted his request. A panel of this court considered the issue without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Taylor challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of the Spokane County District Court. A party may challenge the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction for the first time at any point in a proceeding, even on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State charged Mr. Taylor with a gross misdemeanor in violation of RCW 46.61.502. As noted previously, the legislature gave district courts concurrent jurisdiction with superior courts of all misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor violations occurring within their respective counties. It is undisputed that Mr. Taylor committed his DUI in Spokane County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Mr. Taylor fails to cite to a statute that would deprive the district court of its jurisdiction in this matter. At best, he cites to RCW 3.50.020, which gives municipal courts exclusive criminal jurisdiction over all violations of\n   <em>\n    city ordinances.\n   </em>\n   RCW 46.61.502 is not a city ordinance. Nor did RCW 46.61.502 become a city ordinance by virtue of the City adopting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Mr. Taylor argues that allowing law enforcement to cite a criminal law violation as a state law or a municipal law violation gives law enforcement too much discretion and threatens the viability of municipal courts. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 Washington State Patrol troopers are authorized to enforce state laws. RCW 43.43.030. They are not permitted to enforce local laws. 1957 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 115,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1957%20WL%2054007\">\n    1957 WL 54007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . County sheriffs and their deputies are authorized to enforce state laws within their respective counties. Such authorization applies equally to incorporated areas as to unincorporated areas within the county. 1990 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20505770\">\n    1990 WL 505770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . State and county law enforcement will therefore forward their citations to county prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 On the other hand, cities may only prosecute violations of their own ordinances. RCW 3.50.430 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Auburn v. Gauntt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021940\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/321/#p325\">\n    174 Wash.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20P.3d%201033\">\n    274 P.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). And any city that refuses to enforce its own criminal ordinances and refers comparable state criminal law violations to counties will be required to reimburse the county.\n   <em>\n    Whatcom County v. City of Bellingham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517991\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/128/537/#p549\">\n    128 Wash.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=909%20P.2d%201303\">\n    909 P.2d 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). To avoid the required reimbursement, city officers will always cite an offender under the city code, rather than the state statute, and forward their citations to city prosecutors. The orderly referral of prosecutions to the appropriate authorities will not be evaded by our holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 We conclude that the Spokane County District Court had subject matter jurisdiction over DUI offenses committed within the City, notwithstanding that the City enacted an ordinance that adopted the DUI statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fearing, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
