Norton alleges several errors related to the jury instructions and sentencing. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In October 2012, Wife left Norton, her husband of over twenty years, taking their children with her. After staying in a women's shelter for several days and after a protective order against Norton went into effect, Wife and the children moved into her parents' then-vacant house. The protective order permitted Norton to have supervised visits with the children and to communicate with Wife via email regarding \"parent time, counseling, and school attendance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On the date when the events leading to Norton's convictions occurred, Norton had overnight supervised parent time with the children in the marital home. Wife claimed that, on that night, Norton left the children and broke into her parents' house, after which he, among other things, kidnapped and raped her at gunpoint. The State charged Norton with aggravated kidnapping, a first degree felony; three counts of aggravated sexual assault, all first degree felonies; aggravated burglary, a first degree felony; aggravated assault, a third degree felony; violation of a protective order, a class A misdemeanor; and damage to or interruption of a communication device, a class B misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The case proceeded to a jury trial. Norton and Wife each testified about the events of that night and agreed on the following basic facts. It was snowing. After the children went to sleep, Norton retrieved Wife from her parents' house and drove the two to Fort Douglas on the University of Utah campus. Norton, who worked for the University, accessed a vacant office building with a key he had by virtue of his employment. Once inside the building, the parties had sexual intercourse in an office, after which Wife rinsed off in a bathroom across the hall. Norton then drove Wife first to the marital home to check on the children and then back to her parents' house. Aside from these facts, the parties' accounts differed significantly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Wife's Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Wife testified that, on the night in question, she awoke in the middle of the night to \"a loud bang\" downstairs in her parents' house, which she \"figured ... was [from] the dryer\" that she had previously moved in front of a door to block entry from the basement's outside entrance. Wife grabbed her phone and dialed 911 when Norton appeared \"at the end of [her] bed.\" He punched her face with a closed fist, grabbed the phone, and duct-taped her head. She passed out, and when she regained consciousness, she was riding in Norton's car with him. She claimed that Norton \"had a gun in his lap\" and pointed it at her as she tried to open the car door. She realized that they were driving \"up to the Fort Douglas area\" near Norton's office at the University of Utah. After arriving at a building in the Fort Douglas area, Norton parked the car and told Wife that they were going to enter the building and that she \"needed to be quiet or he would shoot [her].\" Because she did not have any shoes on, Norton gave her a pair of his shoes and then led Wife toward the building and unlocked the entrance door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Wife testified that Norton initially took her to a bathroom, where he \"ripped the duct tape off [her] head\" and began talking to her about their marriage, going to counseling, and getting back together. Wife rejected Norton's suggestions, and after talking for approximately twenty minutes, Norton told Wife \"to take [her] shirt off.\" When she initially refused, he \"pointed the gun at [her]\" and again ordered her to take off her shirt. She complied. He then \"squeezed [her] breasts\" and led her to an office across the hall. Once there, he told her to \"take off [her] pants.\" Again, she refused, and again he \"pointed the gun at [her],\" and she complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 While Wife was undressing, Norton also undressed. Norton then \"popped the magazine out of the gun\" and put the gun pieces in a drawer. He \"told [her] that [they] were going [to] have sex.\" She again told him, \"no,\" which Norton dismissed, and Wife asked if he was \"going to rape [her].\" Norton replied, \"You can't rape somebody that you're married to,\" and he laid down on the floor and pulled Wife on top of him. He then vaginally raped her. Wife testified that she made no effort to participate. She testified that at one point she grabbed his penis \"really hard,\" but that because she has rheumatoid arthritis, she did not \"know how hard\" the squeeze was. Norton responded by grabbing \"both of [her] hands and ... put[ting] them over [her] head in one of his hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Wife testified that afterward Norton took her back to the bathroom and ordered her \"to get in the bathtub and rinse [herself] off.\" She stated that her \"hands were shaking really bad\" and that Norton told her that she was not \"doing a good enough job,\" at which point he \"shoved his fingers up in [her vagina] and tried to rinse himself out.\" Wife dried herself off with some paper towels, and they both got dressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Norton, having retrieved the gun, then told Wife to sit down on a chair. While he initially suggested the two reconcile, the conversation took a turn when he told her that \"he was going [to] kill himself,\" and he put the gun to his head. He then pointed the gun at Wife and said, \"[M]aybe I'll kill you and then I'll kill myself.\" Norton \"went back and forth\" about shooting himself and Wife for a few minutes, after which Wife \"got really mad\" and \"[t]old him to go ahead and shoot himself.\" At that point, \"it just ended,\" and Norton \"took [Wife] back out into the car.\" Norton then drove them to their marital home and, after insisting that Wife \"couldn't tell anybody\" what had happened and that\n   she needed to \"make up some sort of story\" to tell the children about how she hurt herself, he drove her back to her parents' house. Once there, Norton attempted to fix both a locked gate and the basement door through which he had entered earlier. He again told her not to tell anybody what had happened, and she told him she would not tell. After Norton left, Wife called the police, and an officer took her to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Norton's Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Norton testified at trial that Wife willingly accompanied him to the Fort Douglas office building and that she initiated the sexual conduct that occurred. He claimed that Wife had \"told [him] to come over\" to her parents' house after their children had gone to sleep and that, after missing her call at approximately two o'clock in the morning, he drove to the house and parked in front. Though it was snowing, Norton testified that, \"[a]fter a couple of minutes,\" Wife came outside \"in stocking feet\" and got into the car with him. He gave her some Reeboks to wear. He claimed that as they drove, Wife suggested going to his office to talk. Norton thought that rather than his office, \"it might not be a bad idea to ... go up to one of the buildings that's part of [his] college up in the Fort Douglas area.\" Accordingly, he parked behind a building there and unlocked the entrance to a unit that used to be an officer's quarters and was recently vacated by its tenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Norton testified that, once inside, the parties went into an office, sat down, and began talking about marriage counseling and possible reconciliation. Norton claimed that as they were reminiscing about when they first married, Wife went over \"and sat on [his] lap and put her arms around [him]\" and they began kissing. He testified that they eventually moved to the floor, undressed, and that Wife \"climbed on top of [him]\" and had sex with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Norton testified that afterward they went into the bathroom and that Wife got in the bathtub. Norton said that normally they would shower, but that because the water in the building was cold, he told Wife that he was not going to shower. Instead, he suggested to Wife that she \"just rinse off,\" and he turned on the knob for her. He claimed that after Wife rinsed and dried herself off with paper towels he provided, they then went back into the office and dressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Norton testified that, at this point, the parties resumed their conversation about reconciliation. He stated that Wife indicated that she \"didn't really want to reconcile,\" which prompted him to say that he thought it would be fair for him to have joint custody of their children. Wife responded that she did not want joint custody, and she became angry-calling him names-when he said his attorney told him that he would be able to get joint custody. At one point during the exchange, Wife slapped Norton, and he claimed that he backhanded her \"pretty hard\" in response. He testified that Wife then tried to hit him again, and so he \"grabbed her hands and [they] rastled for a minute,\" which caused Wife to start crying. Norton stated that Wife then went into the bathroom, shut the door, and refused to come out for about ten minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 When Wife came out, Norton and Wife left the building and got back into the car. Norton testified that Wife asked to check on their children at the marital home, which they did. Norton then drove Wife to her parents' house. When they arrived, they discovered the front door was locked. Norton testified that he then went around to the back door, and along the way opened a locked gate by pushing it \"real hard.\" He then went and \"pushed\" the laundry room back door open and walked through the house to let Wife in around front.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Norton testified that, once inside, he again tried to talk to Wife about joint custody, which angered Wife. Wife then threatened to call the police and accuse him of breaking into the house and beating her up. Norton \"got scared\" and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The Jury Instructions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 The State charged Norton with eight offenses of varying severity related to the events described above, specifically one count each of aggravated burglary, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, violation of a\n   protective order, and damage to or interruption of a communication device. The State also charged him with three counts of aggravated sexual assault, and the court specified which episode of abuse each count referred to in its instructions, referring to them as Count 2, Count 3, and Count 4. Count 2 concerned the \"allegation of the touching of [Wife's] breast\"; Count 3 concerned \"the allegation of sexual intercourse\"; and Count 4 concerned \"the penetration of [Wife's] vagina by [Norton's] fingers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Defense counsel requested lesser included offense instructions for the aggravated burglary charge, the aggravated kidnapping charge, and all counts of the aggravated sexual assault charges. The court permitted only one lesser included offense instruction for each count. For aggravated burglary, the court instructed on the lesser included offense of burglary, but it declined to instruct on both aggravated assault and assault. For the aggravated kidnapping charge, the court instructed on the lesser included offense of kidnapping, but it declined to instruct on unlawful detention. And for the aggravated sexual assault charges, the court permitted lesser included offense instructions related to each particular act. For Counts 2 and 4, it permitted the lesser included offense instruction of forcible sexual abuse. For Count 3, it instructed on rape. It declined counsel's request to instruct on sexual battery for those counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 The jury convicted Norton of two of the three charged counts of aggravated sexual assault-the counts pertaining to sexual intercourse and Norton inserting his fingers into Wife's vagina-and acquitted him of the aggravated sexual assault charge related to touching Wife's breasts. In addition, the jury convicted Norton of the lesser offense of kidnapping, the lesser offense of burglary, violation of a protective order, and a class B misdemeanor assault. The jury acquitted Norton of the damage to or interruption of a communication device count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Sentencing: The Three Tiers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The court instructed the jury that \"[a] person commits aggravated sexual assault\" if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   in the course of a rape or attempted rape or forcible sexual abuse, or attempted forcible sexual abuse, a person uses, or threatens the victim with the use of a dangerous weapon or compels, or attempts to compel, the victim to submit by threat of kidnaping, death, or serious bodily injury to be inflicted imminently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Quotation simplified.) Thus, the jury was instructed that it could convict Norton of aggravated sexual assault based upon the underlying acts of a rape, an attempted rape, forcible sexual abuse, or an attempted forcible sexual abuse. However, at trial, no special verdict form was requested or given. As a result, although the jury convicted Norton of two aggravated sexual assault charges, it did not specify on which underlying offenses it relied to convict Norton of those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 During sentencing, defense counsel requested that the trial court sentence Norton under the lowest tier of the aggravated sexual assault sentencing scheme-the six-years-to-life tier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel explained to the court that because there was not a special verdict form, it was inappropriate to sentence Norton according to the highest tier-the fifteen-years-to-life tier. Counsel asserted that the jury instruction \"allow[ed] for the jury to find the defendant guilty ... for the offense based on an attempted forcible sexual abuse,\" and contended that \"there's no indication or evidence that the jury made a finding other than that.\" He also contended that, because there was no special verdict form, it would violate Norton's right to a jury trial to find at sentencing that he committed\n   a completed act under the highest tier where the jury could find from the evidence that Norton committed attempted forcible sexual abuse. In response, the State argued that Norton should be sentenced under the highest tier because \"there was never any evidence that this was an attempted forcible sex abuse or an attempted rape. It was all evidence that it was an actual rape and actual forcible sex abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 Although the court determined that defense counsel's argument had some merit, the court ultimately agreed with the State, taking a \"common sense approach\" and determining that although the instructions included the offenses of attempted rape and attempted forcible sexual abuse, \"[t]he evidence presented is that there was an actual act of sexual intercourse\" and \"an actual ... insertion [in her vagina] by his hand.\" Accordingly, the court ruled that it was proper to sentence him at the highest tier because the \"evidence as presented\" related to actual, not attempted, conduct and \"there was never an argument made that this was an attempted rape or attempted forcible sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Sentencing: The Interests of Justice Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 Once the court determined that it was proper to sentence Norton at the highest tier for the aggravated sexual assault convictions, defense counsel then requested that the court impose terms of six-years-to-life on those counts and to run the sentences concurrently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In requesting the lesser sentence, defense counsel identified several facts which, in his opinion, merited a lesser sentence. Norton also made a statement, expressing his regret at having violated the protective order and for having hurt Wife and his family and stating a desire to move forward personally and professionally to \"rebuild [his] life.\" In response, the State requested that the court impose the presumptive sentences of fifteen years to life on both of the aggravated sexual assault counts and that the sentences run consecutively. The State contended that a lesser sentence on those counts made \"no sense,\" particularly where Norton had not accepted responsibility for what he had done and the crimes were \"terrible.\" The court also had the benefit of the Presentence Investigation Report (the PSI) prepared by Adult Probation &amp; Parole, which recommended imprisonment according to the statutory terms and indicated that \"there are not enough mitigating circumstances to override the serious nature of the current offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 The court sentenced Norton to the presumptive fifteen years to life on each of the aggravated sexual assault counts. It recognized that Norton had \"a good past in many, many ways\" but that \"one of the real difficulties\" in the case was Norton's \"inability and unwillingness to follow the truth,\" stating that the court and the jury did not believe the events happened \"at all the way [Norton said] they happened.\" The court also stated that Norton's conduct \"went[ ] way, way, way over the line\" and was of a kind \"that simply cannot be accepted in our society,\" and that while it recognized a fifteen years to life sentence would be lengthy, especially given Norton's age, the extreme and harmful nature of Norton's conduct merited the presumptive sentence. Nonetheless, the court stated that Norton was \"entitled to some mercy\" in that it did not believe that the sentences ought to be consecutive. Accordingly, on the aggravated sexual assault counts, the court sentenced him to two terms of fifteen years to life, with the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 Norton timely appealed from the court's judgment, sentence, and commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 Norton first argues that the court erred by giving instructions of aggravated\n   sexual assault and its lesser included offenses that did not properly inform the jury of the mens rea that applies to the nonconsent element. \"Generally, whether a jury instruction correctly states the law presents a question of law which we review for correctness,\" and we \"will affirm when the instructions taken as a whole fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869345\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/797/\">\n    2015 UT App 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869345\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/797/\">\n    349 P.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 Norton next argues that the court erred by refusing to give requested lesser included offense instructions on the aggravated sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated burglary counts. \"A trial court's refusal to grant a lesser included offense instruction is a question of law, which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    2015 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    349 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Finally, Norton asserts two claims of error concerning his sentence. First, he argues that the court violated his right to due process and his right to trial by jury when it sentenced him under the highest sentencing tier on the aggravated sexual assault counts for which he was convicted. \"[C]onstitutional questions present questions of law that we review for correctness without deference to the lower court's ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Candedo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993260\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/1008/\">\n    2010 UT 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993260\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/232/1008/\">\n    232 P.3d 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Norton argues that the court abused its discretion when it imposed two terms of fifteen years to life on the two aggravated sexual assault convictions \"without conducting the statutorily mandated interests-of-justice analysis.\" We review a trial court's sentencing decision for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBeau v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An appellate court will ... only set aside a sentence if the sentence represents an abuse of discretion, if the district court fails to consider all legally relevant factors, or if the sentence imposed is clearly excessive.\" (quotation simplified) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   I. Jury Instructions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 Norton first argues that the instructions on the aggravated sexual assault charges and the associated lesser included offenses of rape and forcible sexual abuse misstated the law. Norton asserts that under\n   <em>\n    State v. Barela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868943\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/676/\">\n    2015 UT 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868943\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/676/\">\n    349 P.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the instructions \"failed to instruct the jury that it could not convict unless it found that Norton acted with the requisite mens rea as to [Wife's] nonconsent\" and that, had the jury been properly instructed, there is a reasonable probability that it would have acquitted him of those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b629 \"A mens rea element is an essential element of an offense,\" and as a general rule, failure to accurately instruct on it is error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Likewise, Wife provided no evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that Norton was mistaken as to her nonconsent.

Specifically, Norton refers to his testimony where he described restraining Wife's hands at the Fort Douglas office building. According to Norton, after he and Wife engaged in consensual sexual intercourse, they argued over custody and the argument \"became physical.\" He testified that Wife hit him, he backhanded her, and then, for about \"a minute,\" he grabbed Wife's hands to stop her from hitting him again. He contends that if the jury believed this testimony, it would have been rational for it to find that he \"merely detained or restrained\" Wife and to convict him of unlawful detention instead of aggravated kidnapping or kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b651 Norton's argument is misplaced.

But Norton has not demonstrated that the \"same facts\" relied on by the State to establish the offense of aggravated kidnapping also tend to prove the elements of unlawful detention.

Norton does not contend that these facts-or a subset of these facts-justifies an unlawful detention instruction. Instead, Norton describes an entirely\n   separate event at the Fort Douglas office building where he allegedly restrained Wife by holding her hands for about \"a minute.\" But the State did not rely on this event to prove the greater offense of aggravated kidnapping, nor did the State charge Norton for this act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b653 Thus, Norton cannot demonstrate that the lesser offense of unlawful detention is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to prove the offense for which he was charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    2007 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24-25 &amp; n.21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    154 P.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, he contends that it would have been rational for the jury to acquit him of aggravated burglary but convict him of aggravated assault or assault on the basis of his entry of the Fort Douglas office building. He alleges that the jury could have determined that backhanding Wife during the mutual argument over custody he contends occurred in that building constituted aggravated assault or assault. Further, he claims that the jury could have acquitted him of aggravated burglary by finding that he \"did not enter [the building] unlawfully.\" Either way, Norton claims, if the jury believed that he backhanded Wife in the Fort Douglas office building with the requisite intent, aggravated assault or assault would have been the \"appropriate verdict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b655 Like we concluded about Norton's unlawful detention argument, we conclude that aggravated assault and assault are not lesser included offenses of aggravated burglary under the facts of this case. The evidence developed by the State to establish the greater offense of aggravated burglary and the evidence Norton relies upon to claim entitlement\n   to lesser included offense instructions are materially different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    2007 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n    154 P.3d 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State's entire case related to the aggravated burglary charge centered only on Norton's entry of his parents-in-law's house at the beginning of the night. The State made no allegation and presented no facts or evidence at trial that Norton's entry of the\n   <em>\n    Fort Douglas office building\n   </em>\n   was unlawful or formed the basis of the aggravated burglary charge; indeed, the State specifically argued that Norton \"entered or remained unlawfully in the building-the building being the house.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b656 Norton cannot prove entitlement to lesser included offense instructions by pointing to facts and evidence that are factually distinct from and center upon entirely different alleged incidents than those offered to establish the greater offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8323854\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/154/788/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrido\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972233\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/314/1014/\">\n    2013 UT App 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6972233\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/314/1014/\">\n    314 P.3d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108049\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/72/692/\">\n    2003 UT App 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108049\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/72/692/\">\n    72 P.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sentencing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b657 Finally, Norton argues that his sentence was erroneous for two reasons. First, he argues that sentencing him for the aggravated sexual assault convictions under the highest sentencing tier violated his rights to due process and a jury trial. Second, he argues that the court abused its discretion in imposing two fifteen-years-to-life terms for the aggravated sexual assault convictions because the court did not conduct the \"statutorily mandated interests-of-justice analysis.\" We address each argument below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   A. Sentencing Tier\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b658 The jury convicted Norton of two counts of aggravated sexual assault based upon Wife's testimony describing nonconsensual intercourse and Norton inserting his fingers into her vagina. During sentencing, Norton contended that, because there was no special verdict form and the instructions allowed the jury to convict him if it found that he had committed attempted rather than completed acts of rape or forcible sexual abuse, the court should sentence him as though the jury had found him guilty of committing the lowest culpable underlying offense in the aggravated sexual assault statute-attempted forcible sexual abuse. The court disagreed and instead sentenced Norton on those counts each to the presumptive fifteen years to life sentences for completed acts of rape and forcible sexual abuse-the highest tier of sentencing available under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-405\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (LexisNexis 2012). In doing so, the court determined that sentencing in that way achieved \"fundamental fairness\" with no \"denial of any due process or right\" because\n   there was no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that Norton's actions constituted mere attempts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b659 On appeal, Norton contends this was error. He frames his challenges under his constitutional rights to a jury trial and due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we understand it, his argument is that, because there was no special verdict form and the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict him for attempts as well as completed acts, sentencing him under the highest tier violated his \"rights to due process and to a jury trial because it increased [his] minimum mandatory sentence without a jury verdict on each of the elements required to increase the sentence.\" He contends that attempted forcible sexual abuse was the only \"version of the offense for which the record showed that the jury found [him] guilty of each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In essence, then, Norton seems to argue that, in choosing to sentence him under the highest tier, the court impermissibly increased the penalty he would have received had he been sentenced according to the facts that he claims were reflected in the jury's verdict. In this way, the sentence violated his rights to due process and a jury trial because the court based its sentence on facts that the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b660 Norton is correct that he is entitled to a jury trial on all of the elements of the crimes for which he is charged and that he cannot be convicted for the charged crimes unless there is \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute\" them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

With the above principles in mind, we address each below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   1. Proportionality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b673 Norton argues that although the court considered the severity of his conduct, it did not consider whether the presumptive sentence was a proportional penalty for both convictions of aggravated sexual assault. He contends that the court did not conduct the proportionality analysis required by\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   and instead merely \"assumed that [his] conduct merited a 15-years-to-life sentence and imposed sentence based on its assessment of whether [he] was entitled to 'mercy.' \" He also contends that, under the circumstances of this case, his aggravated sexual assault convictions are comparatively less serious than other crimes, such as murder, which also carry presumptive prison sentences of fifteen years to life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b674 We conclude that Norton's contentions do not have merit. To begin with, Norton is correct that the court did not expressly explain its sentencing decision in terms of the proportionality rubric set out in\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   . But although Norton asked the court to reduce his sentence in the interests of justice, \"he did not invoke the proportionality rubric in making his argument\" for a reduced sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, Norton referred to subsection (3)(a) but then proceeded to provide the court only with considerations relating to his past and his rehabilitative potential that he claimed justified a departure from the presumptive sentence. At no time did Norton invoke the proportionality rubric set out in\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   or object to the court's analysis for failing to explain the sentence it imposed in those terms. As a result, Norton cannot \"now be heard to argue that the sentencing court was remiss in not articulating its views on proportionality.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343219\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/402/191/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 &amp; n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b675 Moreover, there is no evidence to support Norton's contention that the court imposed its sentence by merely assuming that his conduct merited the presumptive sentence, without taking into account the relevant proportionality considerations presented by the parties. Rather, it is apparent from the sentencing transcript that the court, based upon the information provided to it, did consider whether the presumptive sentence was a proportional penalty to Norton's crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBeau v.

The court stated that, in its view, the case was \"not a probation case.\" The court noted that Norton had had a \"good past in many, many ways,\" with \"very little that's negative,\" and that it recognized that \"a marriage break up is complicated and difficult.\" It also recognized that the convictions resulted from \"a concrete discrete event that took hours and not days.\" Yet the court explained that it accepted the jury's verdict, which demonstrated the jury's rejection of Norton's narrative of the events, and expressed its belief that the events did not happen at all the way Norton contended. In this regard, the court observed that Norton's conduct was \"way, way, way over the line\" and not of a kind that \"our society can tolerate.\" The court explained that Norton was \"entitled to some mercy, but not what [his] lawyer is asking and not what [Norton was] asking.\" It concluded that in the balance, given the severity of Norton's conduct and the \"great\" harm he inflicted, \"a 15 to life term covers it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b678 Norton has not demonstrated this analysis was improper in light of the information presented to the court for sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    2014 UT 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904141\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/254/\">\n    337 P.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a court must consider all information related to proportionality that is \"raised by the parties\").

Norton contended during the sentencing hearing that the \"Court has seen some very serious and egregious offenses,\" and that \"this case does not rise to the level of the kinds of egregious cases where we have individuals who suffered significant loss of life or impairment.\" Other than this imprecise assertion, he did not request that the court compare the presumptive sentence to other sentences imposed for similar crimes or provide the court with any actual comparisons of typical sentences for similar offenses to assist the court. In these circumstances, we will not fault the court for failing to conduct a sua\n   sponte review of the Utah Code to \"identify similar offenses\" and then \"compare their sentencing schemes to the sentence\" it intended to impose on Norton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66 (explaining that this is \"not a task that we can require our district courts to perform without prompting or guidance from counsel\").

Rehabilitation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b680 Norton also argues that the sentencing court failed to consider his potential rehabilitation in imposing the presumptive prison terms. In particular, he claims that the sentencing court failed to consider all the relevant factors and the Board's role in determining his maximum sentence. He also contends that the court wrongly rejected much of the mitigating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b681 We disagree. Norton has not rebutted the presumption that the court duly considered all of the information the parties presented with bearing on his rehabilitative potential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As discussed above, the court \"had the benefit of [the PSI] containing information about [Norton's] criminal and personal history.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. During sentencing, the court was also provided further information regarding Norton's potential for rehabilitation. Norton contended that his lack of criminal history, his desire to move forward productively in his life, his age, his acceptance that his relationship with Wife had ended, his amenability to supervision, and his desire to be released in \"such a time that he could support his children,\" all justified a sentence reduction. He also cited letters submitted in support, which he contended showed that he had been a contributing community member before the incident. In contrast, the State contended that Norton's crimes had been \"terrible\" and violent, and it emphasized the fact that Norton had failed to take any responsibility for his actions and that he continued to maintain his \"bogus\" story. Wife's attorney addressed the court and expressed that, contrary to his contentions, Norton had shown himself to be unamenable to court supervision by blatantly defying the protective order that had been in place the night of the events. Wife also made a statement, reiterating her concern for her and her family's safety if Norton were ever released and stating that Norton blames her for his imprisonment and had lied under oath regarding the events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b682 Further, it is clear from the court's statements during sentencing that it considered the information the parties provided that had some bearing on Norton's rehabilitative potential. The court expressly acknowledged that Norton had a \"good past,\" that he was well-liked by some people, that it would be \"a long time in prison for someone [Norton's] age,\" and that Norton's crimes all occurred in one \"concrete discrete event.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeBeau v.

But the court also expressed concern over Norton's failure to take responsibility for his actions. The court explained that \"one of the real difficulties here ... is [Norton's] inability and unwillingness to follow the truth\" related to the events. The court stated that it accepted the jury's verdict, and that in its opinion, the events did not happen \"at all the way [Norton said] they happened.\" Likewise, the court expressed concern over the extreme nature of Norton's crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b683 To the extent that Norton argues that the court did not consider other relevant factors, such as the Board's role in our indeterminate sentencing scheme, Norton did not\n   specifically raise the factors cited by\n   <em>\n    LeBeau\n   </em>\n   as relevant to rehabilitative potential, request the court to conduct a rehabilitative potential analysis, or raise the Board's role as a pertinent consideration. Indeed, the only mention of the Board throughout the sentencing hearing was made by the court, when it informed Norton that the Board would give him credit for the time he had already served and that it would handle collecting any restitution. As we explained above, we will not require a court to sua sponte consider factors on which Norton provided no information or did not raise for consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2063\">\n    2017 UT 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 64-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569126\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/423/1254/\">\n    423 P.3d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.
