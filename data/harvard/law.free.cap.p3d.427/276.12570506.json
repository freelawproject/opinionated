Peraza's trial was continued twice because the State did not provide all relevant discovery in time for defense counsel to prepare a defense and to procure an expert witness for impeachment purposes. Then, thirty-two days before trial, the State filed a notice of expert witness to rebut Peraza's anticipated defense. The notice disclosed the name and address of the expert (Expert), her curriculum vitae, a one-sentence description of the nature of her testimony, and a list of citations to more than 130 articles upon\n   which Expert would rely; the notice did not include an expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We are asked to determine whether the State sufficiently complied with the notice requirements under Utah Code section 77-17-13 and, if not, whether the district court erred in admitting Expert's testimony under rule 702 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. We are also asked to determine whether, based on the lack of expert report, Peraza's third motion for a continuance should have been granted. We conclude the district court exceeded its discretion when it denied the motion to continue after erroneously deciding to allow Expert to testify. The State's notice did not comply with section 77-17-13, depriving the court of the information necessary to rule on the admissibility of Expert's testimony under rule 702. The State also failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that Peraza would not be prejudiced by the denial of his motion. Peraza was entitled to a continuance so that he could prepare to respond to Expert's testimony. We therefore vacate Peraza's convictions and remand for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Peraza was charged with four counts of first-degree sodomy on a child\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   after Child accused him of sexually abusing her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Child informed her mother (Mother) and her grandfather that Peraza did \"bad things\" to her that she \"did not like.\" During an interview at the Children's Justice Center (CJC), Child told a social worker that Peraza did something to her that happens \"when parents really love each other.\" Child explained that Peraza showed her his \"pee pee,\" and made her use a hand gesture while she touched it, and he forced her to touch it with her mouth. She said he forced her to do this more than once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 After the first CJC interview, Child moved to California to live with her father, and after relocating to California she began therapy. Part of her treatment was to, \"make effigy dolls, and ... kill the effigy doll named [Peraza].\" Eventually, Child disclosed that a second perpetrator may have also sexually abused her, and she made and \"killed\" effigy dolls of that person too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Child's descriptions of the abuse varied over time. On some occasions, she was explicit in describing the acts Peraza had her perform, including descriptions of anal penetration; at other times she recanted what she had described. While she was living with Mother in Utah, Child wrote Mother a note asserting that the abuse did not happen. After she moved to California, Child called Mother, more than once, to say that Peraza did not do anything to her. She also told a private investigator that Peraza did not touch her and that she never touched him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 But at trial, Child withdrew her recantations and testified that Peraza sexually abused her. She also provided more detail when describing the abuse than she had done in previous interviews and therapy sessions. For example, at trial, she testified that \"Peraza had put his penis in her vagina\"; that testimony was the first time the prosecutor and defense counsel had heard that allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Pretrial Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Peraza's trial was first scheduled for March 2015. But the district court granted Peraza's motion for a continuance based on newly disclosed \"evidence warranting additional investigation\"-including a\n   sexual assault nurse examination report; Child's second interview with someone at a CJC in California; and the State's indication of its \"intent to have [Child's therapist] testify at trial.\" The court set a pretrial hearing in April to schedule a new trial date. During that hearing, defense counsel argued, based on arguments made in Peraza's motions supporting his motion for a continuance, that trial could not be scheduled because the State still had not produced the requested evidence, the therapist had not provided Child's therapy records, and these records had not been subjected to an in camera review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court determined it would postpone scheduling a trial until further evidence had been disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 In June 2015, the district court issued a subpoena duces tecum for Child's therapy records, and the State stipulated to an in camera review of those records. By August, the court still had not received Child's therapy records, but the therapist indicated she was reviewing them to redact information not relevant to the case. Relying on this, the court scheduled trial for October 2015. Then in late September, after receiving the records and defense counsel's request for information from the records, the court informed the parties it would provide the redacted records \"by the end of [the] week.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Although trial was set for the end of October 2015, defense counsel requested another continuance because he had learned that a private investigator recorded one of Child's recantations. Counsel also explained that he needed more time to secure Child's therapist as a fact witness \"for impeachment purposes\" because of Child's recantations. The State agreed that given the circumstances, \"it'd be better to continue the trial\" and stated that it was also \"look[ing] at re-filing\" a notice of expert witness based on Child's therapy records. The court commented that it did not \"know that [it] ha[d] any choice\" and continued the trial to February 2016 with a final pretrial conference scheduled for late January.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 During the January pretrial conference, the State stipulated to the introduction of Child's therapy records for impeachment purposes because defense counsel was unable to procure Child's therapist as a witness at trial. Peraza also challenged whether Expert should be allowed to testify. The court agreed to hear oral argument on Peraza's objection the following week, on January 28, 2016-twelve days before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 During the hearing, defense counsel argued that the State's notice of expert witness was inadequate because it did not include an expert report or any written explanation that would inform the court \"exactly what this expert would be testifying to.\" The notice provided Expert's name and address, her curriculum vitae, and a list of more than 130 articles that she would be relying upon. The notice also included a one-sentence statement that the State intended to use Expert to present evidence of the \"methodology and science related to forensic interviewing of suspected child sex abuse victims\" and related to \"child disclosures of sex abuse including identified factors related [to] delayed, partial and gradual disclosures and recantations.\" But counsel asserted that he could not get access to the articles cited, because the medical journals in which they were published required readers to pay for a subscription. And without an expert report, defense counsel argued that all he had been provided were \"topics\" that could be related to Expert's testimony. Further, he argued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   What's troubling to me is, I don't know if those are case notes that talk about possible theories, which if they're just theories, that would be argument, and the state is clearly allowed to argue. But to present evidence of this nature, I think implies a statistical analysis. And the case law that was cited in my objection ... ha[s] already said that [our courts] disfavor this type of testimony, because ... it implies there's a scientific ... [and] statistical basis for it, but yet there isn't an actual statistical basis for [the theories].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   He asked the court \"to incorporate the objection that [was] filed\" in response to the State's initial notice of expert when the State sought to admit Child's therapist's testimony. This written objection, based on Utah Code section 77-17-13 and rules 702 and 403 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, discussed the prejudicial effects of expert witnesses testifying to \"statistical evidence of matters not susceptible to quantitative analysis\" and pointed out that the Utah Supreme Court had determined in\n   <em>\n    State v. Rammel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409004\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/721/498/\">\n    721 P.2d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1986), that \"statistically valid probabilities evidence that focuses the jury's attention on 'a seemingly scientific, numerical conclusion' \" should be excluded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409004\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/721/498/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409004\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/721/498/\">\n    at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The State handed the court a copy of defense counsel's previous written objection, then explained that the purpose of Expert's testimony was to rebut the defense's assumed strategy of showing \"that [Child] changed her testimony over time, [and] at one point that there was a recantation.\" Moreover, it did not intend \"to have [Expert] say that [Child] is telling the truth or lying, but to simply explain to the jury that there are circumstances\" where children \"with confirmed histories of sexual abuse\" have expressed \"denial or hesitation\" in their disclosures of the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Defense counsel countered that \"with no doubt, we will be presenting evidence that [Child] has recanted both to her mother and also [to] a private investigator.\" But he argued that without a report from Expert, the State's notice did not provide sufficient information with respect to Expert's proposed testimony to allow the defense to adequately prepare to rebut her testimony. Further, he argued that it appeared Expert's testimony would relate only to \"possibilities\" for why Child recanted and that to have \"an expert testify about them without a scientific basis, is concerning because it gives more weight to the state's arguments than maybe it should.\" Defense counsel added that, if Expert were to mention the \"possibility that there are repressed memories,\" such references are prohibited by Utah Supreme Court precedent, and while they may be \"valuable in the therapeutic setting ... they're too prejudicial and not allowed in a forensic setting.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court determined that Expert would be allowed to testify at trial if the State determined her testimony was necessary for rebuttal. It told the parties, based on its assumption of what Expert would testify to, Expert was qualified because \"according to\n   the rules of evidence, this person would meet the criteria for being an expert even [though] ... none of us can really tell until we get to the testimony ... whether or not [Expert is] going to be needed [for rebuttal].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Later that day, after the State \"provide[d] some\" of the articles on which Expert would rely, the court held a telephone conference to address defense counsel's motion to continue the trial in light of the court's decision to allow Expert to testify. The State's disclosure led defense counsel to consult a social worker from the Salt Lake Legal Defender Association to help prepare a defense strategy with respect to Expert's testimony. Counsel requested, once again, a continuance to allow him to procure an expert to rebut that testimony. He explained that he felt further obligated to make this request because of the therapy treatments Child received-specifically, killing the effigy dolls of her alleged abusers-\"could give grounds for the recantation of the recantation ... [and] might have led to the allegations becoming much more violent and much more pronounced as the years have gone on.\" The State responded that although it was \"unhappy with the fact that we're continuing again\" but understood the basis for it. Nevertheless, the court stated that it was \"not inclined\" to continue the trial and that it had to \"draw the line somewhere.\" After denying the motion to continue, the court \"recognize[d] this might be something that could be used later\" on appeal, but determined \"this [was] too late in the game.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The following week, the case proceeded to trial. During the State's case-in-chief, Child testified to the nature of the abuse she allegedly suffered from Peraza, beginning when she was six years old. She also testified that she lied to Mother and the private investigator when she said the abuse did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 The State also called Mother, who testified that Child recanted her allegations to her and to the private investigator. Mother testified that Child recanted her allegations more than once. Defense counsel called the private investigator, who testified about his interview with Child in which Child recanted her allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 In an effort to rebut Mother's and the private investigator's testimonies that Child had recanted her allegations on different occasions, the State called Expert to testify about disclosures and recantations by victims of sexual abuse. Defense counsel objected to Expert's testimony on the ground that she was not a \"rebuttal witness\" because \"the evidence about [Child] recanting her statements came out in the [S]tate's case.\" Defense counsel added that it was the State that introduced Child's interview in which Child recanted her allegations against Peraza, and as such, Expert's testimony could not be characterized as a rebuttal. The court overruled the objection and allowed Expert to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Expert explained she was \"trained as a forensic interviewer\" and that she had provided \"supporting research citations\" for the \"areas of inquiry for expert testimony.\" She said that the articles identified in the notice were \"articles that [she had] read, and so, the topics that would be contained in some of those different articles\" were information \"that [she] felt\" allowed her \"to testify as an expert.\" But Expert did not interview or assess Child. She had not reviewed any evidence of the case before testifying and answered questions \"based off of the testimony [she] heard, since [she had not] seen transcripts or anything.\" Expert acknowledged her testimony was only \"academic.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Expert testified she had conducted around 1,900 forensic interviews with children and that recanting is \"not something that happens in all cases, as far as some of the research says,\" and that recantations can \"var[y] between four percent to 20 percent of cases, so it's not something that's typical, but it's not unheard of.\" She reiterated that \"generally, because a child recants does not mean that it did not occur\" and commented,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Sometimes, when a child recants, it may be feeling pressure from family members.... [O]ften times if it's someone that they love, having gone to jail, or if the person's no longer in the home, and now the family is struggling for money, sometimes those are circumstances where the child might think,\n   \"things were not like this before I talked about it, I'll just-it's just better to go back to how things were, I can deal with that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 The jury convicted Peraza on all four counts of sodomy upon a child. Peraza appeals his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Peraza contends the district court erred when it admitted Expert's testimony at trial because the State had not provided sufficient information to demonstrate the scientific validity or basis of the testimony that would have allowed the court to determine whether she met the requirements for expert testimony under rule 702 of the Utah Rules of Evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Peraza argues that the State did not provide \"any details about what [Expert's] testimony would be so that the defense could investigate whether such testimony could be supported by\" the more than 130 article citations Expert provided. The district court \"has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, and such decisions are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We review the grant or denial of a motion to continue under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Expert Witness Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 Peraza contends the district court exceeded its discretion by admitting Expert's testimony without fulfilling its gatekeeping role under rule 702 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. He argues the court \"failed to examine whether [Expert's] testimony and opinions were based upon principles and methods that were reliable, that they were based upon sufficient facts or data, and had been reliably applied to the facts\" of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 Rule 702 provides that a witness may testify as an expert if that person \"is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" and \"the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Utah R. Evid. 702(a). An expert's \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\" must meet \"a\n   threshold showing that the principles or methods that are underlying in the testimony (1) are reliable, (2) are based upon sufficient facts or data, and (3) have been reliably applied to the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121135\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 702(b).

We will address each factor in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b641 First, defense counsel diligently prepared the defense prior to trial. He timely moved to exclude Expert's testimony, highlighting the State's failure to comply with the notice requirements and emphasizing the risk of unfair prejudice to the defense when \" 'statistical evidence of matters not susceptible to quantitative analysis' \" is presented at trial because it is \" 'uniquely subject to being used to distort the deliberative process and skew the trial's outcome.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Dibello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10394759\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/780/1221/#p1229\">\n    780 P.2d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1229 (Utah 1989).) After the court determined it would admit Expert's testimony if necessary, counsel immediately contacted a social worker for assistance to prepare to cross-examine Expert. The social worker informed counsel that Peraza needed his own expert witness for rebuttal, and counsel requested an \"emergency [telephone] conference\" to request a continuance to allow sufficient time to procure an expert witness and to prepare for cross-examination. Considering all of these efforts, we conclude that defense counsel acted diligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b642 Second, Peraza likely could have been adequately prepared to meet the expert testimony if the district court granted his motion to continue the trial. He would have had the opportunity to procure an expert witness to rebut Expert's generalized statement of the probability that a victim's recantation of an allegation does not mean that the abuse did not occur. This expert might also have been able to testify about whether the \"effigy doll\" treatment \"could have led to the allegations becoming more violent and much more pronounced over the years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 Third, Peraza's \"right to a fair trial outweighed any inconvenience to the court [and] the opposing party ... that may have been caused by a continuance.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tolano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121135\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/400/\">\n    2001 UT App 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121135\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/400/\">\n    19 P.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Although inconvenience to the court and jury is one of the four factors considered, this court has specifically held that such an administrative concern is outweighed by the [defendant's] right to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121135\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified).

As this court explained in\n   <em>\n    Tolano\n   </em>\n   , because of the \"difficult burden placed on defendants to establish prejudice in cases such as these,\" the burden is on the State to persuade the court there is no reasonable likelihood that, absent the error, the outcome would have been more favorable to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b645 The State has not met that burden here. First, it argues that Peraza did not seek to continue the trial to procure an expert witness to rebut Expert's testimony but instead to discuss Child's therapy treatment. This mischaracterizes the type of expert witness Peraza sought to procure. Defense counsel argued that, based on Child's therapy treatments, he needed an expert witness to rebut Expert's testimony and to inform the jury that the type of treatment she received could have influenced her withdrawal of her recantations and that this treatment \"might have led to the allegations becoming much more violent and much more pronounced as the years have gone on.\" Essentially, he argued that this type of treatment has been shown to affect the description of the alleged abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b646 The State also argues that the motion's denial did not prevent Peraza from \" 'put[ting] forward the only defense he had' \" or from putting on \" 'the only testimony potentially effective to his defense.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It argues that Peraza \"was able to call [Child's] credibility into question by highlighting inconsistencies in her disclosures, including her recantation and then withdrawal of the recantation.\" But this argument is not persuasive and we find no support for it in Utah case law.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flynt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"325316\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1352/#p1361\">\n    756 F.2d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defense counsel was able to highlight inconsistencies in Child's testimony and was able to present recantations through the private investigator. But this evidence was undercut by Expert's testimony, which should not have been permitted because it \"rehabilitated [Child's] credibility, without challenge.\" And the harm to Peraza's trial was compounded when he was unable to present an expert witness whose testimony, arguably, would have been given similar weight to Expert's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Although counsel was able to elicit some concessions from Expert, the jury would have benefited from the opportunity to weigh Expert's testimony with a second expert from the defense. Ultimately, Peraza's ability to put forward his best defense was materially hampered by the denial of the motion to continue to procure his own rebuttal expert. Under these circumstances, the State has failed to meet its burden of persuading this court that Peraza was not prejudiced by the denial of his motion to continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b648 We conclude the district court exceeded its discretion when it denied Peraza's motion to continue the trial to adequately prepare to cross-examine the Expert and to procure an expert witness to rebut her testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b649 We conclude the State failed to satisfy the notice requirements under Utah Code section 77-17-13 when it failed to provide an expert report or other written explanation articulating the scope of Expert's testimony and therefore the district court exceeded its discretion when it admitted Expert's testimony at trial without sufficient information to satisfy rule 702 of the Utah Rules of Evidence.
