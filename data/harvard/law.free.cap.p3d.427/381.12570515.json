On appeal, Whitbeck argues that the trial court exceeded its discretion in admitting prior bad acts evidence under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence and that his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to object to the introduction of prejudicial photographs, which depicted him posing while holding a gun. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The State charged Whitbeck with failure to stop or respond at the command of a police officer and theft by receiving stolen property, a 2012 GMC Acadia, based on a series of events that occurred in North Ogden in January 2015. At that time, a \"high rate of vehicle [burglaries] and vehicle thefts\" had been occurring in the Ogden area, and officers from North Ogden and Weber County were working together to identify potential suspects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 During the night of January 17, and into the early morning of January 18, several vehicle burglaries and thefts occurred in one particular North Ogden neighborhood. As pertinent here, one theft victim reported that his garage had been \"ransacked\" and that among the items stolen was his wife's vehicle, a charcoal gray 2012 GMC Acadia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Two other victims reported vehicle burglaries in the same neighborhood, on the same night. The first victim, whose vehicle was parked approximately six or seven blocks from where the Acadia had been stolen, reported that his vehicle had been broken into and that, although it did not appear that anything had been taken, there was a phone left in the vehicle that was not his. Through a combination of fingerprints lifted from the phone and evidence obtained through a search of the phone, the officers identified the phone as Whitbeck's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The second victim, whose vehicle was \"approximately two doors away\" from where the Acadia had been stolen, reported that his vehicle had been broken into and that his identification card, several watches, and a check written out to him had been stolen from it. On January 21, a wallet containing, among other things, the second victim's identification card and the check, as well as Whitbeck's driver license, was turned in to the Harrisville City Police Department. The officer investigating the wallet and its contents determined that the wallet belonged to Whitbeck, and he notified one of the North Ogden officers investigating the vehicle burglaries and forwarded to the officer photographs of the wallet's contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 After the January 18 events, police identified Whitbeck and a known associate of Whitbeck's, Witness, as the primary suspects of the string of burglaries and thefts. Various officers met to strategize, and each officer was provided photographs-both booking photographs and photographs obtained through social media-of Whitbeck and Witness. The officers were also provided with Witness's address as well as descriptions of the stolen vehicles from the area, including the 2012 GMC Acadia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Over the next three days, two investigating officers reported observing Whitbeck driving what appeared to be the stolen Acadia. On January 20, one of the officers, Officer Haney, reported that he had observed two vehicles parked in Witness's driveway. One of them, a gray Chevrolet Aveo, had been reported stolen. The other vehicle was a \"dark gray GMC Acadia,\" and Officer Haney observed a person he later identified as Whitbeck \"standing inside the ... driver's door\" of that vehicle. The Acadia did not have a license plate. Officer Haney observed both the Aveo and the Acadia back out of the driveway and drive away from Witness's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The next day, another officer, Officer Huckaby, reported observing Whitbeck driving what he identified as a gray 2012 GMC Acadia in North Ogden. During trial, Officer Huckaby testified that as he was checking out some \"hot spots\" looking for stolen cars, he observed a gray Acadia pull up to a stop sign. Because Officer Huckaby knew that a gray 2012 Acadia had been reported stolen, he \"slowed down,\" and as the vehicle turned, he observed the driver from a distance of approximately twenty feet. He immediately recognized the driver as Whitbeck from his photographs, which Officer Huckaby had with him in his vehicle at the time. He also observed that the Acadia had no license plate. Officer Huckaby immediately executed a U-turn to \"keep an eye on the car,\" and, because he drove an \"unmarked car,\" he radioed for assistance. Another patrol vehicle responded, turning on its siren and lights while getting \"directly behind\" the Acadia. Rather than slowing and stopping, however, Whitbeck \"immediately accelerated,\" ran a stop sign, and proceeded northbound at an \"extremely high rate of speed.\" Although the patrol car initially gave chase, it broke off pursuit for safety reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 A few days later, police recovered the Acadia when a man in Clearfield reported that he suspected that a 2012 GMC Acadia he had received from a friend of Whitbeck's was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Before trial, the State filed a notice of intent to introduce rule 404(b) evidence linking Whitbeck to other burglaries that had occurred in the same North Ogden neighborhood on January 18,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Whitbeck opposed. Out of the jury's presence on the day of trial, the court heard argument from both sides on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State argued that it sought to introduce the phone and the wallet as evidence to \"corroborate the fact that [Whitbeck] was in the area at the time that the [Acadia] theft actually happened,\" which the State claimed would \"help prove the elements that [Whitbeck] knew or should have known that the [Acadia] was stolen\" at the time he possessed it. The State also asserted that Witness was prepared to testify, among other things, that on the night in question, it was his and Whitbeck's \"plan\" to commit these vehicle burglaries and thefts and that they engaged in this conduct on the night in question at the \"general location\" from which the Acadia had been stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 Whitbeck responded that the phone and wallet evidence were \"bits and pieces\" the State was trying to present as \"one cohesive piece of evidence.\" He argued that the pieces of evidence did not demonstrate that he was \"in possession of anything,\" even if the items were \"all related to a type of crime or a genre of crime.\" He also asserted that the introduction of the items would be problematic, given that those items were not found on him at the same location and, for example, it was not clear \"how the [stolen] identification got into his wallet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 The court ruled in favor of the State, concluding that the phone and wallet evidence was being offered for a \"proper noncharacter purpose,\" because it \"goes to identify Mr. Whitbeck\" as \"a person who was involved in\" vehicle burglaries and whether \"he is the person that [the police] were in fact looking for for this series of crimes that allegedly occurred\" in that North Ogden neighborhood. The court recognized that the evidence was prejudicial but determined it was not unfairly so, and the court observed that there was a \"need for the evidence\" and that the State was \"entitled to bring in all the evidence that [it] had that would lead one to believe that the identity of the person that was involved in this crime and inferentially involved in others was Mr. Whitbeck.\" The court accordingly limited its ruling to permitting the introduction of the phone and the wallet to \"tie ... up with [Witness] to the extent that Mr. Whitbeck was involved in this crime or other crimes,\" and the court emphasized that the State was not to use the evidence to say that Whitbeck committed \"all these other crimes,\" but rather that the State was limited to using the evidence to identify Whitbeck as a person \"who may have been involved in this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 At trial, Witness testified that he and Whitbeck had been in the North Ogden neighborhood from which the Acadia had been stolen on the night in question and that they were there to generally steal and burglarize vehicles. Witness also testified that the next day Whitbeck had said that he had lost his phone. In addition, Witness testified that on at least two occasions he had observed Whitbeck driving a GMC Acadia-later in the morning of January 18 when he and Whitbeck reunited, and on the day Officer Haney observed the Acadia in Witness's driveway because Witness was seated in the Acadia as Whitbeck drove it away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 The State also introduced the wallet and phone evidence to corroborate Witness's testimony about the events of the night in question, arguing that Whitbeck knew the Acadia was stolen because, in part, the evidence demonstrated he was in the North Ogden neighborhood with Witness pursuant to the plan to steal and burglarize vehicles. As to the phone in particular, the State presented evidence recovered from the phone to demonstrate that it belonged to Whitbeck, including fingerprints, text messages, application use, and two photographs depicting Whitbeck posing with a gun. The trial court admitted the photographs into evidence without objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 At closing, the State emphasized to the jury that although other vehicle burglaries and thefts had been discussed, the State had not charged Whitbeck with those other vehicle burglaries, and the \"only things\" the jury was to decide were whether Whitbeck eluded the police officer and \"was in possession of a stolen vehicle, the Acadia.\" \"Everything else,\" the State explained, \"was presented [as] background and to identify the person ... that had the Acadia.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts. Whitbeck appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 Whitbeck raises two claims of error. First, he argues that the trial court \"erroneously allowed the State to present prior bad act evidence that [he] was allegedly involved in two different vehicle burglaries.\" We review \"a trial court's admission of prior bad acts evidence\" for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    2015 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    349 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Second, Whitbeck argues that his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing \"to object to the introduction of irrelevant and highly prejudicial photographs\" recovered from his phone that depicted him holding a gun. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Parkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2062\">\n    2018 UT App 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=427%20P.3d%20272\">\n    427 P.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I. Prior Bad Acts Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Whitbeck argues that the trial court erred when it admitted the wallet and phone\n   evidence. He contends that the wallet and phone evidence allowed what was otherwise \"a very weak case ... to be bolstered with a highly improper propensity inference: that because [he] must have been committing multiple vehicle burglaries that evening, he must have committed\" the crime of possessing the stolen Acadia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 Rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence regulates the admissibility of evidence of a defendant's prior acts of misconduct. \"The rule recognizes the dangers of exposing a jury to evidence of a defendant's acts of prior misconduct,\" especially \"the risk that the jury will infer that the defendant has a reprehensible character, that he probably acted in conformity with it, and that he should be punished for his immoral character in any event.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). To preclude that inference, the rule provides that \"evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 \"On the other hand, the rule also recognizes that acts of prior misconduct may also sustain an alternative-and entirely permissible-inference.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To that end, the rule provides that past misconduct evidence \"may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\" Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(2). Past misconduct evidence presented for such a noncharacter purpose will be admissible if it is also relevant under rule 402 and the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed \"by the danger of unfair prejudice\" under rule 403.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence turns on a three-part test: the prior bad act evidence \"(1) must be offered for a genuine, noncharacter purpose, (2) must be relevant to that noncharacter purpose, and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    2015 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    349 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 Nevertheless, the ultimate question for an appellate court reviewing a trial court's rule 404(b) determination is \"whether the district judge made an error in admitting or excluding the evidence in question,\" not whether we would have decided differently in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 50-53, 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).

The trial court found that the phone and wallet evidence \"goes to the identity of Mr. Whitbeck,\" and it accordingly limited the use of the evidence to that end. Specifically, the court stated that the phone and wallet evidence could be used only to \"tie ... up with [Witness's testimony] ... that [Whitbeck] was involved in this crime or other crimes\" that police were investigating, and it emphasized that the State would not be permitted to use the evidence to argue that Whitbeck committed the other vehicle burglaries and therefore must have committed the charged crimes. In this regard, the court determined that because police were investigating the Acadia's theft as part of a \"total criminal situation\" involving a \"series of crimes,\" the phone and wallet evidence raised \"a legitimate inference or question as to why [Whitbeck's] wallet [was] found where it was found and why [Whitbeck's] phone [was] found where it was found.\" The court also determined that the State was \"entitled to bring in all the evidence that [it] had that would lead one to believe that the identity of the person that was involved in this crime and inferentially involved in others was [Whitbeck]\" rather than someone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 32 In so ruling, the court did not exceed its discretion. It is significant that the phone and wallet evidence was not introduced to simply establish that Whitbeck had committed certain specific prior bad acts with some bearing on the case, such as the alleged burglaries associated with those items. Rather, the evidence was introduced to permit the jurors to draw a reasonable inference that Whitbeck had been a person involved in the larger crime spree under investigation, which included the Acadia's theft. Given that there was no direct evidence that Whitbeck had actually stolen the Acadia, the jury was required to draw such an inference to convict Whitbeck of a crime that depended on his knowledge or belief that the Acadia had been stolen.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 63,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (indicating that the risk of unfair prejudice may be mitigated if the evidence pertained to \"a matter of substantial relevance to the prosecution\");\n   <em>\n    Alires\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20UT%20App%20244\">\n    2000 UT App 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11223545\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/9/769/\">\n    9 P.3d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the prior bad acts evidence was not unfairly prejudicial in part because the defendant's \"identity ... is a necessary element of the charged offense\" and \"identity was a crucial issue at trial,\" rendering the evidence \"very important to the State's case\"). As a result, the challenged evidence does not seem to be of a kind likely to unfairly prejudice Whitbeck, given its role and purpose in the overall case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 33 In the balance, then, the court did not exceed its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the phone and wallet evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. It was the only physical evidence that corroborated Witness's account and that tended to show Whitbeck knew or believed the Acadia was stolen. Under these circumstances, it was not improper for the trial court to admit the phone and wallet evidence under Utah Rule of Evidence 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   II. The Photographs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34 Whitbeck also argues that trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to object to the introduction of \"irrelevant and highly prejudicial photographs.\" During the trial, the State presented two photographs it had obtained from Whitbeck's phone that showed him holding a gun. The State used these photographs to demonstrate that the recovered phone was, in fact, Whitbeck's. Defense counsel did not object to the admission\n   of the photographs as exhibits. Whitbeck argues that counsel performed deficiently by not objecting because failing to do so could not have been a legitimate trial strategy where the photographs only tangentially connected him to the crimes with which he was charged. He suggests that, at the very least, counsel should have requested that the guns in the photographs be redacted. He also argues that had the photographs been excluded there is a reasonable probability the outcome at trial would have been more favorable to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35 To prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Whitbeck bears the burden to demonstrate both that his trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to the photographs-i.e., \"that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" and that, had trial counsel objected, there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the outcome of the trial would have been more favorable to him.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We also consider the strength of the evidence supporting the jury's verdict, as a \"weakly supported\" verdict \"is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 38 Here, examining the record as a whole, we conclude that the admission of the photographs does not undermine our confidence in the jury's verdict. The evidence of Whitbeck's guilt overwhelmed any effect counsel's failure to object might have produced, rendering the photographs' overall impact on the case as a whole slight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2053\">\n    2017 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569463\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/171/\">\n    424 P.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the eluding the police charge was supported by the eyewitness accounts of Officer Huckaby and the responding patrol officer. Officer Huckaby testified that three days after the Acadia was stolen he observed Whitbeck driving a vehicle that matched the stolen Acadia's description, which prompted him to call for backup, and both Officer Huckaby and the responding patrol officer thereafter observed Whitbeck flee at high speeds once the patrol officer pulled behind Whitbeck and activated his lights and siren.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 39 The theft by receiving the stolen Acadia charge was also supported by eyewitness identifications of persons who had observed Whitbeck in possession of the Acadia shortly after it was stolen. Witness testified that later on the morning of January 18,\n   after he and Whitbeck had been separated while carrying out their plan to burglarize and steal vehicles in the North Ogden neighborhood, Whitbeck met back up with him and was driving a GMC Acadia. Officer Haney observed Whitbeck standing inside the driver's door of an Acadia parked on Witness's driveway two days after its theft, and Witness, who was with Whitbeck at the time, testified that Whitbeck then drove the vehicle away. Officer Huckaby, as discussed above, observed Whitbeck driving (and, later, fleeing) in the Acadia three days after the theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 40 The State also introduced substantial evidence that Whitbeck would have known or believed that the Acadia had been stolen. Witness testified that he and Whitbeck were in the North Ogden neighborhood from which it was stolen on the night in question to carry out their plan of thieving and burglarizing vehicles and that they did, in fact, carry out that plan. Witness also testified, as discussed, that although he and Whitbeck became separated while carrying out their plan, he reunited with Whitbeck later in the morning of January 18, and at that time Whitbeck was driving an Acadia. The State introduced the phone and wallet evidence, which corroborated Witness's testimony about the plan to steal and burglarize vehicles. And both parties stipulated before trial that the Acadia was recovered by police from someone who claimed he received the Acadia from a person who Witness later testified was an associate of Whitbeck's, one who was \"able to use\" the stolen vehicles that were \"around\" \"when he wanted to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 41 Thus, given all of the evidence before the jury, we cannot conclude that the introduction of the photographs-while troubling-prejudicially affected Whitbeck's case such that the outcome would have been more favorable to him without them. The evidence in the record that Whitbeck eluded the police and received the stolen Acadia overwhelms any potentially prejudicial effect counsel's failure to object might have produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2053\">\n    2017 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569463\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/171/\">\n    424 P.3d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, we are unpersuaded there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted him had counsel objected, or that the verdicts must have resulted from the jury's desire to improperly sanction him for holding a gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We also conclude that Whitbeck has failed to persuade us that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to object to the admission of the photographs recovered from his phone. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence provides that, \"[o]n request by a defendant in a criminal case, the prosecutor must ... provide reasonable notice of the general nature of [evidence of the defendant's prior wrongful acts] that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Whitbeck also argues that the State did not lay a sufficient foundation for the admission of the other vehicle burglaries. He argues that the State \"did not present evidence as to how the evidence arrived in the various vehicles\" and it \"never showed [his] actual involvement or culpability in these bad acts\" or \"create[d] an actual connection between the other vehicle burglaries and [his] supposed theft of the Acadia.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R. Evid. 104(b) (providing that \"when the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist\" and that \"the court may admit the proposed evidence on the condition that the proof be introduced later\"). But the State did not seek admission of the evidence to argue that Whitbeck had, in fact, committed the other burglaries. Instead, it sought to use that evidence to identify Whitbeck as a person with some connection to those crimes. Thus, the only conditions of fact at issue here were the circumstances in which the phone and wallet were recovered and how the identifications of those items as belonging to Whitbeck proceeded. As a result, the phone and wallet evidence does not run afoul of rule 104 's requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
