(\"USAA\"). We agree that the Fishers failed to file a timely objection; therefore, their claim is waived, and we affirm the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The Fishers were involved in two low-speed car accidents within one week of each other in the summer of 2012. Following the accidents, Stefanie Fisher suffered increasingly severe back and neck pain. She sought medical treatment and eventually underwent surgery to fuse a herniated disc. Stefanie attributed the pain to the car accidents, and because the damages she claimed exceeded the insurance limits of the other drivers, she filed an underinsured motorist claim with her insurer, USAA. Pursuant to the underinsured motorist policy, the claim was submitted for arbitration before a single arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The Fishers' original attorneys suggested the parties use arbitrator Alan Goldman, and USAA agreed. One day prior to the arbitration hearing, however, the Fishers' original counsel voiced concerns about Goldman's potential partiality. According to the Fishers, their counsel told them that Goldman often served as an arbitrator for Jones, Skelton &amp; Hochuli (\"JSH\"), the law firm representing USAA, and that this business relationship with the firm could compromise his neutrality. Although counsel advised the Fishers to settle, they chose to go forward with arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The arbitrator heard testimony from experts for both sides. After weighing the evidence, he concluded that the low-impact collisions did not cause Stefanie's extensive injuries. Thus, the arbitrator did not award damages to the Fishers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On December 8, 2016, through counsel, the Fishers filed a motion to reconsider with the arbitrator. The motion reiterated the evidence presented at the hearing but did not mention any concerns over the arbitrator's impartiality. The Fishers also demanded that their original counsel raise the issue of conflict of interest, which caused the attorneys to abruptly terminate their representation. Counsel's motion to withdraw stated that the Fishers were pushing them to take action that they considered unethical and repugnant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On January 3, 2017, the Fishers filed a pro per motion for reconsideration with the arbitrator and raised the issue of partiality for the first time. After the arbitrator denied that motion for reconsideration, the Fishers retained new counsel and filed another motion to vacate the award due to the arbitrator's alleged conflicts of interest and lack of disclosure. In addition, the Fishers filed a motion to allow discovery to investigate the arbitrator's possible business relationship with JSH. The arbitrator did not rule on the two motions, and the Fishers filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award with the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 With respect to the discovery issue, the court denied the Fishers' motion, reasoning that the issue of partiality may be waived, and case law does not support granting post-arbitration discovery. On the motion to reconsider, the court held further argument, and took the matter under advisement. In its subsequent ruling, the court found that the Fishers had waived their right to challenge the arbitrator's alleged bias because they knew about the arbitrator's relationship with opposing counsel prior to the arbitration but did not raise any objection before or during the arbitration hearing. The court went on to find that, even absent waiver, the Fishers failed to show evidence of partiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 We have jurisdiction over the Fishers' timely appeal pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Judicial review of an arbitration award is limited, as Arizona public policy favors arbitration to achieve a speedy and inexpensive disposition of disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Atreus Cmtys.

The Fishers argue that the arbitrator did not disclose an existing relationship with USAA's counsel and, citing A.R.S. \u00a7 12-3012(E), claim this showed evident partiality because a neutral arbitrator who \"does not disclose ... a known, existing and substantial relationship with a party is presumed to act with evident partiality under \u00a7 12-3023, subsection A, paragraph 2.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Upon timely objection by a party, the superior court may vacate an arbitration award if an arbitrator did not disclose a substantial relationship with a party or counsel.

The approach adopted by the Sixth Circuit finds waiver is appropriate when the party knew all of the facts suggesting bias at the time of the arbitration hearing but failed to object.\n   <em>\n    Apperson v.

Because of the \"policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards,\" the Ninth Circuit has adopted a slightly broader approach in which waiver is appropriate \"where a party to an arbitration has constructive knowledge of a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   conflict but fails to timely object.\"\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Fed.

The Fishers contend that the arbitrator's failure to disclose his alleged relationship with JSH deprived the Fishers of the knowledge needed to object on the grounds of partiality during the arbitration proceedings. This argument is unpersuasive. The Fishers' opening brief admits that they had knowledge of a potential relationship between JSH and the arbitrator before the hearing, yet they chose to continue with the arbitration without raising an objection or requesting additional information from the arbitrator about prior JSH cases in which he had served as an arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Fed.

While an arbitrator has a duty to disclose non-trivial relationships with parties and clients,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Cont'l Cas.

The statute provides that an arbitrator is\n   <em>\n    presumed\n   </em>\n   to act with evident partiality if the arbitrator does not disclose \"a known, direct and material interest in the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of the arbitration proceeding or a known, existing and\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   relationship with a party.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 12-3012(E) (emphasis added). The Fishers do not allege that the arbitrator had an interest in the outcome of the arbitration, nor that he had a relationship with either party; instead, they contend that the arbitrator worked as an arbitrator in other matters in which JSH attorneys served as counsel. However, the cases cited by the Fishers do not support the proposition that mere service as an arbitrator in other matters involving a party's counsel is sufficient to trigger a presumption of partiality.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wages\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"195658\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/188/525/#p530\">\n    188 Ariz. at 528-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"195658\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/188/525/#p530\">\n    937 P.2d at 718-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing alleged bias where the arbitrator had previously worked as an attorney for the parties who had litigated similar claims against the defendant).
