(Food Democracy) appeals from a judgment imposing civil penalties against it for violations of state campaign finance disclosure laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Food Democracy solicited and received contributions to support Initiative 522 (I-522). In turn, it contributed the money in its own name to the Yes on I-522 political committee. After the general election and vote on I-522, and after the Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) began an investigation, Food Democracy registered as a political committee and filed reports disclosing the contributions it received from over seven thousand contributors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Food Democracy argues that the trial court erred in concluding it concealed the source of its campaign contributions. It contends that only intentional conduct amounts to concealment. Food Democracy also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the trial court erred by imposing statutorily authorized civil penalties for the state campaign finance disclosure law violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 I-522 appeared on the state ballot in November 2013, in the general election. It concerned the labeling of genetically engineered foods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In early July 2013, Food Democracy sent e-mails to its members soliciting contributions in support of the I-522 campaign. Food Democracy raised $295,661.58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In the three months before the election, Food Democracy made five payments, for a total of $200,000, directly to the Yes on I-522 political committee. Food Democracy made those contributions in its own name. It did not disclose that the money it contributed to the I-522 campaign came from over seven thousand individuals, most of whom lived outside the state. The Yes on I-522 political committee filed a report with the PDC stating that the $200,000 in contributions came directly from Food Democracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Food Democracy had some familiarity with the state campaign finance disclosure reporting requirements. An e-mail Food Democracy sent to its members referenced the \"public disclosure records filed in Washington State\" by the No on 522 political committee. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 130. As of two weeks before the election, Food Democracy's website stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Washington State law requires [that Food Democracy] collect and report the name, mailing address, and the contribution amount for each individual whose contributions exceed $25 and the employer and occupation for each individual whose contributions exceed $100 in an election cycle. [The] contribution will be used in connection with Washington State elections and is subject to the limits and prohibitions of the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CP at 135-36. However, before the election, Food Democracy did not report the names of any individuals who contributed funds that Food Democracy then contributed in its own name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Eight days before the election, the Attorney General's Office received a citizen action letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that Food Democracy violated state campaign finance disclosure laws. The Attorney General's Office forwarded the letter to the PDC. The PDC opened an investigation within eight days of the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After the PDC began investigating Food Democracy, and after the election, Food Democracy registered as a political committee\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (C-1pc Form), identified its treasurer\n   and depository accounts, and filed the required reports. Former RCW 42.17A.205(1), (2)(d) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Food Democracy filed twelve contribution reports (C-3 Forms), covering the period between July 31 through October 31. The reports detailed the weekly contributions Food Democracy deposited into their depository account for the three months prior to the election. Former RCW 42.17A.235(3). Those reports were the first filings disclosing the individuals who had contributed to Food Democracy in relation to the I-522 campaign. Food Democracy filed all of the C-3 Forms seventeen days after the election. They were between 18 and 109 days late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Food Democracy also filed five summary reports (C-4 Forms), summarizing its financial activities and itemizing its expenditures from July until after the election. Former RCW 42.17A.235(2). Food Democracy filed all of the C-4 Forms on January 15, 2014, well after the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State filed a complaint in Thurston County Superior Court seeking statutorily authorized civil penalties, costs, and fees under former RCW 42.17A.750(1)(c)-(d), (f). The complaint alleged that Food Democracy violated state campaign finance disclosure laws because it failed to timely register as a political committee, it failed to timely identify a treasurer or a depository account for collected funds, it failed to timely file required reports, and it concealed the identity of the individuals from whom it received its $200,000 in contributions to the Yes on I-522 political committee. The complaint also alleged Food Democracy acted either intentionally or negligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Food Democracy filed an answer admitting that it failed to comply with the registration and reporting requirements; however, it denied that its actions amounted to concealment of the source of its contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 The State filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Food Democracy opposed the State's motion and argued that its actions did not amount to concealment under former RCW 42.17A.435.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the State. The only contested issue remaining for trial involved the amount of penalties, costs, and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Food Democracy did not appear for trial. The State called witnesses and the court admitted evidence in support of the State's requests for civil penalties, costs, and fees authorized under former RCW 42.17A.750 and .765.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 The State abandoned any argument that Food Democracy intentionally concealed the source of its contributions and did not seek treble damages for intentional violations of the state campaign finance disclosure laws. Former RCW 42.17A.765(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 The trial court entered judgment against Food Democracy. It imposed a total penalty on Food Democracy of $319,281.58, including a penalty of $295,661.58 equaling the amount Food Democracy raised; a penalty of $18,000 for the 18 late reports ($1,000 per report for 18 reports);\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a $5,620 penalty for the cumulative number of days the reports were late ($5 per day for 1,124 days).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the court awarded the State $2,131.32 in investigation costs, $90,590.20 in attorney fees, and $325 in trial costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Food Democracy appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I. CONCEALMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Food Democracy argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment\n   and by concluding that it concealed the source of its campaign contributions because former RCW 42.17A.435 only prohibits intentional or knowing conduct.

The plain meaning contains no exception for unintentional conduct that results in the concealment of the source of campaign contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 Food Democracy relies on a Black's Law Dictionary definition of concealment to argue that the concealment statute only applies to \" 'conduct that is intentional or known to be likely to keep another from learning facts.' \" Op. Br. of Appellant at 19. We reject this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 Food Democracy attempts to read the word \"conceal\" in isolation from the rest of the statute and not in the context of chapter 42.17A RCW. In addition, the public disclosure statute at issue applies to conduct that conceals the identity of the source of the contribution. RCW 42.17A.435. The plain meaning is evident; it prohibits any conduct that conceals the source of campaign contributions. In arriving at this conclusion, we note that one of the primary policies of the disclosure laws is \"[t]hat political campaign and lobbying contribution and expenditures be fully disclosed to the public and that secrecy is to be avoided.\" RCW 42.17A.001(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 In addition, there is a separate statute that permits treble punitive damages for intentional violations of the campaign finance disclosure laws. Former RCW 42.17A.765(5). The increased penalty for intentional violations suggests that the legislature contemplated unintentional conduct underlying some violations of the campaign finance disclosure laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dailey v.

It does not require intentional or knowing concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30 Food Democracy does not dispute the facts; it only disputes the applicability of the concealment statute to its conduct. Despite soliciting and receiving contributions to support I-522, Food Democracy contributed to the Yes on I-522 political committee in its own name. Food Democracy did not report the source of its contributions. No genuine issue of material fact exists that Food Democracy's failures to timely report campaign finance activities concealed the identity of the sources of its campaign contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 Because the statute does not require the concealment to be intentional or knowing, the trial court did not err in granting partial summary judgment. Food Democracy's conduct resulted in the concealment of the source of it campaign contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II. CIVIL PENALTIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 32 Food Democracy argues that the penalties amount to a manifest error of constitutional magnitude because they are a \"grossly excessive\" fine imposed in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Br. of Appellant at 33. Food Democracy also argues the trial court abused its discretion by imposing civil penalties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Food Democracy did not appear at the trial on the question of penalties, all of these issues are raised for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 33 The State argues that Food Democracy waived any objection to the penalties by failing to appear at trial and raise the issue below. The State further argues that any alleged error is not \"manifest\" because Food Democracy's argument \"has no legal or factual basis.\" Br. of Resp't at 37. We agree with the State. In addition, the record is insufficient for us to address Food Democracy's constitutional challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 34 A party generally waives the right to appeal an error absent an objection at the trial level.

(Food Democracy) committed multiple violations of our campaign finance laws in its support of Initiative 522. However, I disagree that its actions constituted concealment under the governing statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 46 Food Democracy did not file its political committee registration, its C-3 contribution reports, or its C-4 financial summary reports within the time prescribed by chapter 42.17A RCW. These delinquent reports were months late and were filed after the election occurred, thus depriving citizens of potentially enlightening information in deciding on their vote. In doing so, Food Democracy violated the law, including former RCW 42.17A.235 (2012) and former RCW 42.17A.240 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 47 Food Democracy's actions, however, did not constitute concealment under RCW 42.17A.435, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   No contribution shall be made and no expenditure shall be incurred, directly or indirectly, in a fictitious name, anonymously, or by one person through an agent, relative, or other person in such a manner as to conceal the identity of the source of the contribution or in any other manner so as to effect concealment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 48 By its terms, this provision bars contributions and expenditures that are made or incurred in a specific manner: a manner that conceals the identity of their source or effects concealment in other ways. \"Manner\" is defined in relevant aspect as \"the mode or method in which something is done or happens.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1376 (2002). The term is not otherwise defined in chapter 42.17A RCW. No argument is raised that statutory context compels some other meaning of \"manner.\" Thus, the plain meaning of \"manner\" in this statute refers to the way in which the contribution or expenditure itself is carried out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 49 The specific examples in the statute confirm legislative intent to use the term in this way. Contributions made or expenditures incurred in fictitious names, anonymously or through conduits each depend on the nature of the transaction itself, not on the failure to file a report after they have occurred. Under the canon of statutory construction known as ejusdem generis,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   general terms appearing in a statute in connection with specific terms are to be given meaning and effect only to the extent that the general terms suggest similar items to those designated by the specific terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Silverstreak, Inc. v.

Following that canon, the general term \"in any other manner so as to effect concealment\" must be read to mean the same sort of thing as do the specific examples; that is, the general term must pertain to the nature or circumstances of the contribution or expenditure itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 50 Thus, both the plain language of the statute and the applicable canon of construction point to the same end. RCW 42.17A.435 is aimed at concealment through the circumstances of the transaction, including but not limited to evidence of intent to conceal through the transaction. It is not aimed at the failure to file subsequent reports disclosing the transaction. Those transgressions are covered by other elements of chapter 42.17A RCW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 51 Our recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that decision, we affirmed the summary judgment by the trial court that upheld penalties imposed on the Association for various violations of chapter 42.17A RCW, including the failure to file required political committee reports. Among the provisions the trial court held violated was RCW 42.17A.435 's prohibition of concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 52 The Association challenged this only on the ground that RCW 42.17A.435 was unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    Grocery Mfr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569978\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/927/#p931\">\n    425 P.3d at 936-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Association asserted that \"concealment\" under RCW 42.17A.435 requires an independent act or omission besides the failure to comply with other FCPA (Fair Campaign Practices Act) regulations and that apart from its failing to register as a political committee, there was no evidence of that.\n   <em>\n    Grocery Mfr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569978\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/425/927/#p931\">\n    425 P.3d at 937-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The resolution of that issue is not affected by\n   <em>\n    Grocery Manufacturers Association\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 54 For these reasons, the superior court erred in concluding that Food Democracy concealed the true sources of the contributions made and expenditures received in violation of RCW 42.17A.435. That ruling should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 55 The court imposed a civil penalty of $295,661.58 for \"concealing both the amount accumulated in and source of contributions received.\" Clerk's Papers at 245. Because the conclusion of concealment under RCW 42.17A.435 was in error, this civil penalty should be reversed. The figure of $295,661.58 imposed by the court was the amount of money Food Democracy raised in cash and in-kind contributions. Under former RCW 42.17A.750(1)(e) (2012), \"[a] person who fails to report a contribution or expenditure as required by this chapter may be subject to a civil penalty equivalent to the amount not reported as required.\" This matter should be remanded to superior court for a new decision as to what amount of civil penalties should be imposed absent concealment under RCW 42.17A.435.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
