The trial court dismissed the suit on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, concluding that LUPA governed and the failure to file suit within 21 days barred the action. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We hold that the imposition of a permit application fee falls under the statutory definition of a land use decision under chapter 36.70C RCW and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2012 and 2013, petitioners submitted permit applications\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the San Juan County Department of Community Development. The county code lists 19 items that a party must submit to complete an application, one of which is paying \"[t]he applicable fee.\" SAN JUAN COUNTY CODE (SJCC) 18.80.020(C)(4). Petitioners paid the applicable fees, and the permits were issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On March 18, 2015, almost three years later, petitioners filed this lawsuit, seeking a partial refund of the fees they now characterize as \"illegally excessive\" in violation of RCW 82.02.020. Pet. for Review at 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2. They sought certification as a class action lawsuit for everyone who paid San Juan County for consideration of land use and building permits, modifications, or renewals during the preceding three years. Petitioners requested a declaratory judgment, payment to the putative class reaching back three years for any amount found to be an overcharge, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 San Juan County filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and asserted that chapter 36.70C RCW, commonly referred to as LUPA, was the exclusive means of judicial review for the fees paid because each fee was inextricably tied to and paid as a condition of approval of a land use decision.

RCW 36.70C.030(1)(c). It noted that RCW 82.02.020 expressly states that counties are not prohibited from imposing reasonable fees for building permit applications and noted that the petitioners' challenge was not to the ordinance establishing the application fees but to the payment of the fees imposed for a completed project permit application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Petitioners contend the trial court erred in determining that LUPA applied to their claim for partial reimbursement of alleged overcharges for permit application processing fees.

RCW 36.70C.030(1) ;\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5628632\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/574/\">\n    154 Wash.2d at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20286\">\n    115 P.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The legislature enacted LUPA in 1995, \"to reform the process for judicial review of land use decisions made by local jurisdictions, by establishing uniform, expedited appeal procedures and uniform criteria for reviewing such decisions, in order to provide consistent, predictable, and timely judicial review.\" RCW 36.70C.010. It explicitly replaced the writ of certiorari for purposes of appealing land use decisions and is the \"\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   means of judicial review of land use decisions,\" with only a handful of specific exceptions. RCW 36.70C.030(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 A petition for review of a land use decision must be filed within 21 days of the issuance of the decision. RCW 36.70C.040(3). To have standing to bring a land use petition, a party must have exhausted administrative remedies \"to the extent required by law.\" RCW 36.70C.060(2)(d). There are only statutory exceptions to this provision; as we have previously explained, no equitable exceptions to the exhaustion requirement in LUPA exist.\n   <em>\n    Durland v. San Juan County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075705\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/182/55/#p66\">\n    182 Wash.2d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20P.3d%20191\">\n    340 P.3d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Petitioners did not contest the fee amounts at the time of payment, nor do they contest the fact that they did not pursue administrative remedies and did not file land use petitions within 21 days of the assessment of the fees in question. Thus, their complaint was properly dismissed if the assessment of fees constituted \"land use decisions\" under LUPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Petitioners characterize the decision to impose the application fee as \"a prerequisite that must be fulfilled before an applicant can get a land use decision,\" arguing that \"[a] decision to impose that fee is not, itself, a 'land use decision' [because] nothing about the fee and the process for determining it affects the use of land.\" Suppl. Br. of Pet'r at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 The county, on the other hand, points out that \"[t]he land use decision 'on an application' includes a constellation of smaller decisions that precedes approval or disapproval of the land use request,\" and that \"[t]hese decisions are part-and-parcel of the permit decision and inextricably linked to the permit itself.\" Suppl. Br. of Resp't at 8. We agree with the county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 As a starting point, RCW 36.70C.020(2) provides the definition of a \"land use decision\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Land use decision\" means a final determination by a local jurisdiction's body or officer with the highest level of authority to make the determination, including those with authority to hear appeals, on:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    An application\n   </em>\n   for a project permit or other governmental approval required\n   by law before real property may be improved, developed, modified, sold, transferred, or used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 SJCC 18.80.020, which governs project permit applications in San Juan County, states that a completed application\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   include the applicable permit fee. The imposition of such a processing fee is ministerial in nature. In\n   <em>\n    Chelan County v. Nykreim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960832\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/146/904/#p940\">\n    146 Wash.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 940,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20P.3d%201\">\n    52 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), we explicitly stated that LUPA does not distinguish between quasi-judicial and ministerial decisions and governs both. And because the fee here is a mandatory requirement for a completed project permit application, it is inextricably tied to the permitting process. Mindful of the policy of finality in land use decisions, this court in\n   <em>\n    Wenatchee Sportsmen Ass'n v. Chelan County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183446\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/141/169/\">\n    141 Wash.2d 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20P.3d%20123\">\n    4 P.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), likewise held that an untimely petition under LUPA precluded collateral attack of the land use decision and rendered the improper approval valid. Similar considerations apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 To conclude otherwise, one would have to disregard the basic tenets of statutory construction and interpret clear and unambiguous language to achieve a result contrary to the purpose LUPA was enacted to achieve. Community Treasures' argument is similar to the argument the respondents advanced in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   : both seem to concede that building permits must be challenged through a LUPA action within 21 days, but insist that challenges to permit\n   <em>\n    conditions\n   </em>\n   can be brought separately up to 3 years later. The fees imposed, whether petitioners agree or not, are part and parcel of any application. There is nothing tangential about requiring a person or an entity seeking to build or enhance a structure to pay a required application fee-a nonpayment of the fee is directly related to the final determination of whether to grant or deny the permit. That these fees were due and payable before the county's consideration or processing of the land use applications in question is of no legal consequence: there are many other prerequisites that must be met before the final decision is issued, but those activities or conditions are all tied to the decision process nonetheless, occurring within the processing of the application. Accepting Community Treasures' argument to the contrary would undermine the purpose LUPA established. Adopting petitioners' argument would divide a land use decision into component pieces, each of which would arguably support a claim for monetary damages arising out of the decision process. Our cases have rejected that argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5628632\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/574/\">\n    154 Wash.2d at 582-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20286\">\n    115 P.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 And while it seems fairly obvious that the decision whether to charge fees and the decision to impose a fee structure in the first place were made independently at some point, that does not appear to form the basis of the petitioners' claim here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Petitioners argue further that even if LUPA governs, their claims fit the \"monetary damages or compensation\" exception under RCW 36.70C.030(1)(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 Petitioners rely on\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Kitsap County v. City of Bainbridge Island\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to argue that the fees imposed and collected by the county in 2012, 2013, and 2014 exceeded expenses in violation of RCW 82.02.020 as an unauthorized tax. That statute forbids a city, county, or municipal corporation from imposing any fee on construction activities but expressly allows an exception to this general rule to cover a municipality's costs to process building permit applications and to inspect and review plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Petitioners' class action complaint alleged that similar to\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   , \"the municipality had overcharged for fees associated with building permits.\" CP at 35. But as the Court of Appeals correctly held,\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   does not support petitioners' argument because here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   , the class action does not challenge the ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   establishing permit fees but, rather, the payment of the fees imposed as part of a completed project permit application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 46 (alleging systematic overcharging), 47 (seeking a declaration that \"the fees charged plaintiffs were in excess of those allowed by RCW 82.02.020 are therefore invalid\"). Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , we have already rejected the applicability of RCW 82.02.020 to the \"monetary damages\" exception in LUPA in the wake of its enactment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 Finally, we note that concluding that LUPA applies does not leave a permit applicant without legal recourse or render the fee amount unchallengeable. If an applicant views the permit application fee as unreasonable, the LUPA review procedures establish the basis to seek relief and bring a challenge, provided the time limits are met. Here, petitioners failed to exhaust all available administrative remedies and file an appeal in superior court within 21 days of the final decision to grant their completed applications, including the requisite fees. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fairhurst, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Owens, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wiggins, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Gonz\u00e1lez, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 This case concerns whether the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), chapter 36.70C RCW, applies to petitioners' suit seeking reimbursement for alleged overcharges concerning application fees charged by San Juan County (County) for processing petitioners' building and land use permit applications. In my view, LUPA does not apply to the present suit challenging application processing fees. First, the ordinance setting permit fees specifically states that the permit fees are \"for services provided\" and, thus, are not imposed as mitigation for the land use impact of a project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When imposed, these permit fees are limited by state law\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to only the amount necessary for the County to recoup its costs of processing the permit; the fees are not, nor can they be, tied to the impact of the proposed project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 Second, it makes no sense for permit applicants, like the present petitioners who have received their building and land use permits, to jeopardize the timely pursuit of their projects by filing a LUPA appeal for the sake of attempting to recoup a few dollars in application processing overcharges. In other words, the applicants here received their permits and it makes no sense for them to file a LUPA appeal to challenge permit fees that are set by separate ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Third, I disagree with the majority's overly expansive reading of our opinion in\n   <em>\n    James v. Kitsap County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5628632\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/574/\">\n    154 Wash.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20286\">\n    115 P.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). The result of the majority's misapplication of\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   will require that any county action that precedes the County's ultimate land use decision and that can conceivably be associated with such final land use decision is subject to review only via a LUPA petition, no matter how tangential the prior county action may be to the final land use decision. In my view, the circumstances of this case show the fallacy of such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, in the present circumstance-where petitioners are seeking only money compensation rather than reversal or modification of a land use decision-LUPA itself expressly exempts such claims from its provisions. Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 The relevant facts on appeal are not in dispute. In 2012 and 2013, petitioners submitted four separate permit applications and paid the applicable fees, without objection, to the San Juan County Department of Community Development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The county code lists multiple items that a party must submit to complete an application for a project permit and, relevant here, specifies that the permit application \"must\" include \"[t]he applicable fee.\" SAN JUAN COUNTY CODE (SJCC) 18.80.020(C)(1), (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 On April 12, 2012, petitioner John Evans submitted an application to build a storage building on his property on Orcas Island. The review fee was $105, plus a state surcharge of $4.50 for a total of $109.50. Evans paid without objection, and the County approved his application on April 25, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 On September 19, 2013, Community Treasures submitted three permit applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two applications sought to change the use of existing buildings to retail. Community Treasures paid a fee of $109.50 for each of the change of use applications, and the County approved the change of use on November 22, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Community Treasures also submitted one application for a building permit to construct additions to an existing building and paid $753.60 as part of the application. On February 26, 2014, the County issued the permit. Neither Mr. Evans nor Community Treasures sought to appeal any part of these approvals to a hearing examiner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28 On March 18, 2015, Community Treasures and Mr. Evans filed the present lawsuit, seeking a partial refund of the fees paid for their permits and seeking certification as a class action lawsuit for everyone who paid the County for the consideration of land use and building permits or modifications or renewals during the preceding three years. The first amended complaint alleged the \"fees paid ... were in excess of those allowed by RCW 82.02.020.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2. Plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment, payment to the putative class reaching back three years for any amount found to be an overcharge, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29 Defendant County filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.

In letter rulings, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies or file complaints within 21 days of the land use decision. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal, ruling that the building permit fee is a component of a final land use decision, subject to review under LUPA. The Court of Appeals stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   RCW 36.70C.020(2)(a) unambiguously defines a \"land use decision\" as a final determination on an \"application for a project permit.\" SJCC 18.80.020 governs project permit applications.

Petitioners' suit does not seek to challenge or modify any final determination concerning the use of land. Petitioners' suit concerns only a money damages claim for alleged overcharges of application processing fees, in amounts pursuant to a schedule that was determined outside of petitioners' land use permit decisions. For purposes of LUPA, a \"land use decision\" includes a local jurisdiction's \"final determination ... on ... [a]n application for a project permit\" required before real property may be improved, developed, modified, or used. RCW 36.70C.020(2)(a). Here, the processing fees at issue were determined by a county ordinance that amended the relevant fee schedule before any of the permits in question were filed. The corresponding amounts from the fee schedule were then applied when petitioners later filed their building and land use applications. Thus, the determination of the fee schedule amounts that were applied here, the propriety of which is the basis of petitioners' class action suit, occurred outside the County's consideration of petitioners' project permit applications. In my view, simply plugging in the predetermined processing fees from the fee schedule to petitioners' permit applications is not a land use decision subject to LUPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 34 The courts below and the majority reasoned that since the processing fee is a mandatory requirement of a permit application, LUPA applies to challenges to the amount of the fees.

But this court actually held in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   that \"the imposition of impact fees\n   <em>\n    as a condition on the issuance of a building permit\n   </em>\n   is a land use decision and is not reviewable unless a party timely challenges that decision within 21 days of its issuance.\"\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5628632\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/574/\">\n    154 Wash.2d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20286\">\n    115 P.3d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 37 The application fee in the present case does not involve a determinative connection to the land use decision. It is merely a processing fee that must be paid regardless of the application's outcome. Instead, the application fee at issue here is similar to the processing fees submitted with a college application or a court filing fee, neither of which is affected by the determination and outcome on the application. The application fee here is a prerequisite to consideration of the land use request; it must be paid even if the permit is abandoned or denied; it is merely a processing fee, administrative in nature and not part of the actual land use decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 38 These distinctions reflect the differing purposes of the impact fees in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   and the application fees here. Impact fees facilitate the efficient mitigation of the effects of development; in contrast, application processing fees fund government's regulatory oversight as their only purpose. Notably, the ordinance enacting the fee schedule indicates that its purpose is \"setting fees\n   <em>\n    for services provided\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 83 (emphasis added) (formatting omitted). Thus, the application fees are reflective of the costs of processing and are unrelated to any consequence or effect that the completed project may impose on the environment or community. In\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , this court addressed a challenge to the imposition of an impact fee, the amount of which was determined by the needs resulting from the project as proposed. We concluded that the impact fee was inextricably linked to the substantive decision regarding the use of land and issuance of the building permit, and thus was subject to LUPA. By contrast, the application fee here concerns administrative processing and has no similar connection to the land use determination. Because the application\n   fee lacks a similar mitigating connection to the substantive land use decision, LUPA does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 39 In the majority's view, LUPA applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   administrative decisions leading to land use approval. I disagree. Notably, the provisions of chapter 36.70C RCW have been found to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to \"an interim decision made in the process of, but prior to, reaching a final decision on a permit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   36 MICHAEL F.

In the trial court, six permits were at issue. As explained herein, the trial court determined that LUPA applied to each of the plaintiffs' claims for partial refund and granted summary judgment to the County on that basis. Additionally, as to two of the six permits at issue, the trial court ruled that plaintiffs had no standing to seek partial refund of the processing fee because another person or entity had paid the fee. The trial court's standing determinations regarding the permit challenged by Bonita Blaisdell and one of Community Treasures' permits were not appealed. Thus, only four permits (three concerning Community Treasures and one concerning John Evans) are currently at issue in the present matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The F. &amp; P.

The majority notes that petitioners here are challenging the payment of fees imposed, rather than challenging the ordinance that increased the fees. But in both cases, the gravamen of the complaint is that the fees did not reflect costs and thus were overcharges in violation of RCW 82.02.20. In\n    <em>\n     Home Builders\n    </em>\n    , Division Two of the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the city and held that the burden to show that the permit fees complied with the statutory exceptions contained in RCW 82.02.020 lay with the city, remanding the case for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The majority again relies on\n    <em>\n     James\n    </em>\n    in dismissing any application of the RCW 36.70C.030(1)(c) monetary damages exemption, stating, \"[I]n\n    <em>\n     James\n    </em>\n    , we have already rejected the applicability of RCW 82.02.020 to the 'monetary damages' exception in LUPA in the wake of its enactment.\" Majority at 651.
