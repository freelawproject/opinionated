In the second appeal (the Second Appeal), Kirsling challenges the trial court's denial of his petition to modify the divorce decree's custody arrangement. We affirm the trial court's decisions in both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial and the Amended Decree\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Pulham and Kirsling were married in 2008 and separated in 2010. The parties had one child (Child) born during the marriage. In June 2012, the trial court entered a bifurcated decree of divorce, reserving several issues for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 At a bench trial in 2014, the parties contested the issues of custody, child support, past-due child support, and unreimbursed child care expenses. Each party also alleged that the other party was in contempt of the court's prior orders and should therefore face sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On Child's custody, the trial court made detailed findings. Among other things, it found that Pulham had remarried, had a son with her new husband, and was living in Tooele, Utah. The court also found that Pulham had been the primary caregiver of Child since birth and that, at the time of trial, Pulham was unemployed and was acting as the full-time caregiver of her younger son and Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Regarding Kirsling, the court found that he was living in Taylorsville, Utah, with his girlfriend and her children, and that Kirsling's older son from a previous marriage lived with Kirsling part-time. The court also found that Kirsling had resided in various places, including Brigham City, Utah, and Phoenix, Arizona, for lengthy periods after the parties separated. The court found that even though Kirsling's \"contact and visitation with [Child] ha[d] been inconsistent for much of that time,\" his contact had \"stabilized considerably\" in the year leading up to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Although Kirsling and Pulham agreed at trial that it would be in Child's best interest if they shared joint physical and legal custody, they sharply disagreed about the details of that custody, including where Child should be enrolled in school and with whom she should primarily reside. A custody evaluator prepared a custody evaluation and testified about it at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Kirsling requested a court order requiring Child to enroll in the school near his home in Taylorsville for three years, at which point Child would then transfer to the school near Pulham's home for the latter half of elementary school. The court rejected Kirsling's request, reasoning that his plan would\n   require Child \"to spend considerable time commuting by car between Taylorsville and Tooele\"-amounting to \"upwards of an hour each way, before school and after school\"-and that it was not in Child's best interest to do so merely to accommodate Kirsling's preferred parenting plan. The court also reasoned that Kirsling's plan would require Child to change elementary schools and that such a plan, which would put Child through \"an unnecessary adjustment of surroundings, friends and routine,\" was not in Child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 In the November 2014 amended divorce decree (the Amended Decree), which followed the earlier bifurcated decree, the trial court awarded the parties joint physical and legal custody. The court also ordered that Pulham would be the primary custodial parent and would have the final say in parenting decisions for Child, including which school Child would attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 As for parent-time, the court determined that a standard parent-time order, as anticipated under Utah Code section 30-3-35, did \"not provide sufficient parent time\" for Kirsling and was not in Child's best interest. As a result, the court awarded Kirsling additional parent-time in a manner that avoided \"creating the attendant travel time that would be inflicted upon [Child] by [Kirsling's] proposed parenting plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 On future child support, the trial court found that it would be calculated based on Pulham's monthly income of $30 and Kirsling's monthly income of $4,580, \"which are the stipulated monthly gross incomes\" of the parties. Then, referencing the Utah Code and a custody worksheet,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court ordered Kirsling to pay Pulham $548 per month for child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 On past-due child support, the trial court found that the evidence supported Pulham's claim that Kirsling had an outstanding obligation for a period before 2012. The court also found that Pulham incurred fees paid to the Office of Recovery Services (ORS) due to Kirsling's \"failure to timely pay his child support obligation.\" Because Kirsling had not been \"consistently responsible for payments until ORS intervened,\" the court agreed with Pulham that Kirsling should reimburse her for the ORS fees. Accordingly, the court ordered Kirsling to pay Pulham for past-due child support and ORS fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 On unreimbursed child care expenses, the trial court found that Pulham had shown that Kirsling had not paid his share of some expenses. The court ordered Kirsling to pay Pulham those expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Finally, on the allegations of contempt of court, the trial court found that \"insufficient evidence was presented at trial to warrant sanctions for either party.\" Thus, the court dismissed all charges of contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Motion for a New Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Kirsling moved for a new trial pursuant to rule 59(a) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion was accompanied by an unsworn document signed by his attorney that purported to be Kirsling's affidavit. As relevant here, Kirsling challenged the trial court's decisions regarding child support and custody as well as the amounts Kirsling owed to Pulham for past-due child support and child care expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 With respect to the amounts owed to Pulham for past-due child support and child care expenses, Kirsling contended that, under rule 59(a)(4), he had newly discovered evidence that he could not have produced at trial. Referring to Pulham's testimony that she did not receive a particular payment, he asserted that post-trial he was \"able to obtain a photocopy of the cashed money order that was presented to [Pulham's] counsel as settlement for the financial issues of the\n   case\" and that the new information affected the amounts he owed Pulham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 In denying the motion, the trial court began by characterizing the purported affidavit as \"an argument by [Kirsling's] counsel, complaining generally of the failure of the Court to find in [Kirsling's] favor.\" The court then rejected Kirsling's newly discovered evidence argument, explaining that Kirsling had not established \"whether or why he was unable to obtain this evidence prior to trial\" and also had not shown that \"the introduction of the evidence would have resulted in a different trial outcome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Kirsling raised another argument under rule 59(a)(6), attacking the court's determination that Pulham's gross monthly income was $30 for child support purposes. Kirsling argued that the evidence was insufficient because the court did \"not show[ ] why Ms. Pulham's income was not calculated\" based on her employment potential and probable earnings pursuant to a statute governing the imputation of income. Kirsling asserted this same argument as an error of law under rule 59(a)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 The court rejected Kirsling's arguments. It explained that Utah Code section 78B-12-203(7) dictates the circumstances under which the trial court may impute income and gives discretion to the court to impute under those certain circumstances. The court then explained that it \"did not impute income to [Pulham]\" and that the application of this statute was \"not the basis for a complaint of 'insufficient evidence' \" under rule 59(a)(6). Similarly, the court concluded that, in relation to rule 59(a)(7), it had not committed an error of law, because it had \"exercised its discretion in determining not to impute income to [Pulham], something the statute authorizes it to do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 Concerning custody, Kirsling contended that, under rule 59(a)(7), the trial court erred when it did not follow the recommendations of the custody evaluator. In particular, he stated that the court failed to provide \"a detailed and clear finding\" explaining why it did not adopt the custody evaluator's recommendation. The court rejected this argument as well, maintaining that it had \"articulated the reasons for its decision regarding custody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 The trial court denied the motion for a new trial on June 17, 2015. Kirsling filed a timely notice of appeal, giving rise to the First Appeal. In his notice of appeal, Kirsling stated that he thereby appealed \"the final Decree of Divorce ... entered in this matter on June 17, 2015,\" and that the appeal was \"taken from such parts of the judgment as follow\": Paragraph 3 regarding child support calculation; Paragraph 4 regarding child support, ORS fees, and child care expenses; and Paragraph 8 regarding contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The Petition to Modify the Amended Decree\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 On the same day he filed the First Appeal, Kirsling petitioned the trial court for a modification of the Amended Decree. Specifically, Kirsling asserted that \"[a] significant change of circumstances has occurred as a result of [his] recent relocation to Stansbury Park, Utah, which is located approximately 15 minutes of driving time from his home to the home of [Pulham].\" Kirsling further asserted that at the time the trial court entered the Amended Decree he lived approximately forty-five minutes away from Pulham and that \"[t]his distance affected the Court's awarding of parent time for both the overnight schedules, school choices and the midweek parent time determinations.\" Because the long \"commute time no longer exist[ed],\" Kirsling requested that the court change the schedule to \"fifty-fifty,\" essentially asking to have Child spend every other\n   week with him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 Pulham responded by filing a motion to dismiss the petition to modify. Although she did not dispute that Kirsling had relocated, she contended that Kirsling's move from Taylorsville to Stansbury Park did \"not represent a change of circumstances sufficient to modify the controlling order,\" because it did not affect her \"parenting ability\" and the \"functioning of the current custodial relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 A court commissioner heard the matter and recommended that the trial court deny Pulham's motion to dismiss. Pulham objected to that recommendation, and the trial court ultimately resolved the petition to modify on its merits. The court observed that it had \"considered the distance the minor child would be subjected to traveling\" when entering its custody and parent-time orders in the Amended Decree, but it expressed concern that Kirsling's \"stop\" in Stansbury Park would be \"brief,\" in light of his \"somewhat migratory history.\" The court also expressed concern that, \"given the timing of the move and the petition itself, [Kirsling] made this move solely to create a change in circumstances in an effort to succeed in modifying the decree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 Although Kirsling's relocation closer to Pulham \"benefits all parties, including the minor child,\" the court concluded that the \"move, in and of itself, is wholly insufficient to create a sufficient change of circumstances to warrant reconsideration\" of the Amended Decree, and it denied Kirsling's petition to modify. Kirsling filed another notice of appeal, which triggered the Second Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I. The First Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 Kirsling raises three issues in the First Appeal. First, he contends that the trial court erred in calculating \"Pulham's income at $30 per month for child support purposes.\" Second, he contends that it erred in denying his motion for a new trial on his claim of newly discovered evidence related to child care expenses. Third, he contends that the trial court erred in deviating \"from the recommendations of the court-appointed custody evaluator without making any specific findings on the record as to its deviation.\" Before we reach the merits of these contentions, however, we must consider whether Kirsling's notice of appeal vested this court with jurisdiction to consider and address these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A. The Scope of This Court's Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b626 As a threshold matter, we first consider Pulham's argument that this court lacks jurisdiction to review certain issues on appeal. Pulham argues that \"Kirsling's notice of appeal invokes this Court's jurisdiction over only some of the issues he has argued in his brief.\" According to Pulham, \"Kirsling's notice of appeal references only the decisions in the Amended Decree relating to child support, a monetary judgment, and the dismissal of contempt charges,\" and \"[b]ecause [his] notice of appeal does not reference the district court's custody award or the ... denial of [his] motion for a new trial, this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction over issues related to those decisions.\" Kirsling counters that a notice of appeal's \"designation of the specific parts [of an order or judgment] does not waive the appeal of the whole order or judgment\" and that therefore this court \"has jurisdiction over all of the issues raised on appeal ..., as well as the issues concerning the post-trial motion\" for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 \"Whether appellate jurisdiction exists is a question of law....\"\n   <em>\n    Goggin v.

The order denying Kirsling's motion for a new trial was entered on June 17, 2015. When the notice of appeal is considered in context, its reference to \"the final Decree of Divorce\" manifests Kirsling's intent to appeal from the Amended Decree, and its reference to an order \"entered in this matter on June 17, 2015,\" manifests his intent to appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Speros v.

Because the Amended Decree has paragraph numbers and subject matters that correspond to those mentioned in the notice of appeal, we read the notice of appeal's references to specific paragraphs as referring to Paragraphs 3, 4, and 8 of the Amended Decree. We thus construe the notice of appeal as manifesting Kirsling's intent to contest on appeal only the issues of child support, past-due child support, ORS fees, child care expenses, and contempt. In contrast, the notice of appeal does not convey Kirsling's intent to appeal issues related to the custody evaluation or the parenting plan-issues that were resolved in other paragraphs of the Amended Decree that are not cited in the notice of appeal.

On this point, we agree that no evidence adduced at trial supported the conclusion that, at the time of trial, Pulham had a monthly income of $30. It was undisputed that Pulham was unemployed and cared for her young children full-time. The trial court, however, did not purport to base its determination of income on the testimony or other evidence at trial. Rather, the court twice stated that its income determination was based on the parties' \"stipulated monthly gross incomes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b637 Kirsling does not acknowledge the trial court's explanation that its income determination was not based on evidence but on a stipulation by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duchesne Land, LC v.

As noted above, the undisputed evidence at trial showed that Pulham was unemployed and had no income. Thus, if the court erred in attributing some income to her based on a stipulation, that error arguably favored Kirsling. At the least, Kirsling has not demonstrated that if Pulham's income was decreased from $30 to $0 that his child support obligation would be reduced. As a result, we will not reverse the trial court on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b639 We further conclude that Kirsling has not established that the alleged error of which he complains entitles him to his requested relief-a new trial with the opportunity to request the imputation of additional income to Pulham based on evidence not presented at trial. Kirsling did not move for a new trial on this issue under rule 59(a)(4) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure based on a claim of newly discovered evidence, and he has not shown that the court committed an error of law by not imputing income to Pulham based on her anticipated earnings or the federal minimum wage such that a new trial would be warranted under rule 59(a)(7).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-203(7) (LexisNexis 2012) (allowing under certain circumstances for the imputation of income for child support purposes based on employment potential and anticipated earnings or the federal minimum wage for a forty-hour work week).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

And, as Kirsling concedes on appeal, none of the factors relevant to imputing income to Pulham based on her employment potential and probable earnings were discussed, and information about those factors was not placed on the record. In fact, the only evidence at trial arguably relevant to the imputation of income was that Pulham worked for a time but that she \"barely made anything\" after paying for child care. Given that the record contains no evidence regarding Pulham's employment potential and probable earnings, and given that her undisputed testimony was that the cost of child care approached the amount of income she previously had earned,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6973632\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/314/1069/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , we cannot conclude that the trial court committed legal error in not imputing income to Pulham under section 78B-12-203(7)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 Similarly, Kirsling's argument that the trial court should have imputed income to Pulham under Utah Code section 78B-12-203(7)(c) at the federal minimum wage also fails. Not only did Kirsling not ask for imputation under this provision at trial or in his post-trial motion, but he now admits that \"Pulham does have recent work history.\" Thus, he implicitly concedes that imputation under that section would not have been appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6973632\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/314/1069/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-12-203(7)(c) (\"If a parent has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   recent work history or a parent's occupation is unknown, income shall be imputed at least at the federal minimum wage for a 40-hour work week.\" (emphasis added) ).

Newly Discovered Evidence Related to Child Care Expenses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 Kirsling next contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial when it refused to consider newly discovered evidence relating to past-due child care expenses. According to Kirsling, he \"had been misinformed at the time of trial that he could not obtain evidence to show that Pulham had received and cashed\" a money order that he had given to her counsel, but he was able to obtain a copy of that cashed money order after trial. Kirsling asserts that he undertook due diligence but that the misinformation given to him was \"outside of his control.\" He further asserts that the copy of the cashed money order would \"affect[ ] the financial settlement ordered by the court\" and that therefore the court should have granted him a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 Rule 59(a)(4) provides that a new trial may be granted if a party shows the existence of material and \"[n]ewly discovered evidence, ... which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and\n   produced at the trial.\" Utah R.

Moreover, though Kirsling recites the factual basis for his claim that evidence was newly discovered, he cites no evidentiary basis for his assertions that he could not obtain the relevant evidence prior to trial. Aside from his rule 59 motion and memorandum, the only material that Kirsling presented to the trial court in support of his newly discovered evidence claim was a document signed by his attorney purporting to be Kirsling's affidavit. Rule 59(c) requires that a newly discovered evidence claim be \"supported by affidavit,\" Utah R. Civ. P. 59(c) (2014), but, as the trial court correctly noted, the purported affidavit is \"more accurately characterized as an argument by [Kirsling's] counsel.\" Given Kirsling's failure to provide the trial court with evidentiary support, the court did not exceed its discretion in denying Kirsling's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II.

Rather, the court considered the merits of Kirsling's petition. The court accepted as true that Kirsling moved to Stansbury Park after the entry of the Amended Decree, but it rejected his assertion that the court's custody and parent-time orders were driven primarily by the fact that Kirsling lived in Taylorsville at the time of trial. The court expressed concern that Kirsling's \"stop in [Stansbury Park would] be ... brief,\" given Kirsling's \"migratory history.\" The court also expressed concern that the move was motivated to create a change of circumstances to justify a modification of the Amended Decree.

Attorney Fees on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b655 Both parties request an attorney fees award pursuant to rule 33 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 33 allows this court, if it determines that an appeal is \"either frivolous or for delay,\" to \"award just damages, which may include ... costs ... and/or reasonable attorney fees, to the prevailing party.\" Utah R. App. P. 33(a). \"[P]arties seeking attorney fees under rule 33 face a high bar,\" and the Utah Supreme Court has directed that such sanctions are warranted only in \"egregious cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Porenta v.

We conclude that this case does not present an egregious case and\n   therefore deny the parties' requests for attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b656 In the First Appeal, we conclude that only two of the three issues that Kirsling argues on appeal were identified in his notice of appeal and are properly before this court. On the merits of those two issues, we conclude that Kirsling's challenge to the trial court's calculation of income fails and he has not shown that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on his claim of newly discovered evidence. As for the Second Appeal, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Kirsling's petition to modify the Amended Decree. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's decisions in both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    We have consolidated Case No. 20150577-CA and Case No. 20160236-CA for purposes of this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    This child support worksheet is not part of the record on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Rule 59(a) provided, in relevant part, that \"a new trial may be granted to ... any ... part[y] and on all or part of the issues, for any of the following causes[:] ...

(a)(6) [i]nsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision\"; or \"(a)(7) [e]rror in law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 59(a) (2014).

While Kirsling briefly refers to rule 59(a)(3) in his statement of the issues on appeal, he makes no argument based on surprise and instead focuses this portion of his appeal on rule 59(a)(4) and his contention of newly discovered evidence. Accordingly, we do not address whether the trial court abused its discretion in not granting a new trial under rule 59(a)(3).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Wintle-Butts v.
