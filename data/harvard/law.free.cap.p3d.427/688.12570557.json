We find no error. The trial court correctly determined that the replevin claim is not preempted by the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), chapter 19.08 RCW, and is an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Partnership is a nonprofit organization that provides training to many Washington home care workers. These include individual providers whose training is funded by the State pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with the union for individual providers. The union, SEIU 775, is part of the Service Employees International Union. The State shares information with the Partnership about state-funded individual providers. The Partnership stores this data, along with other information about trainees, in a confidential electronic database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Foundation is a nonprofit organization that, among other things, endeavors to inform workers of their constitutional rights regarding financial support of public-sector unions. An opportunity to acquire contact information for individual providers arose in the spring of 2016. A former employee of the Partnership, Matthew Williams, had access to confidential records about thousands of trainees from the Partnership's internal database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   He offered to sell this data to the Foundation. The Foundation paid Williams $12,000 for two electronic spreadsheets stored on a flash drive. The Foundation copied and downloaded the spreadsheets and the data they contained, including individual contact information, into its electronic database. The Foundation used the records to notify individual providers that they had the right to opt out of financially supporting SEIU 775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In August 2016, two flyers from the Foundation were delivered to the Partnership's office addressed to a name that existed in the Partnership's database only in connection with a mock file created as part of a training exercise for a new employee. The Partnership realized that the Foundation must have gained access to its database. The Partnership brought this suit, alleging a violation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and a claim for intentional interference with business expectancy. Shortly thereafter, in a different lawsuit between the Foundation and SEIU 775, Maxford Nelsen-the Foundation's CR 30(b)(6) witness-testified that the Foundation had purchased records concerning approximately 42,000 individual providers from a person he referred to as Confidential Source B. Although the Foundation refused to reveal the identity of Confidential Source B, the Partnership later learned through its own efforts that it was Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Partnership wrote to the Foundation demanding immediate return of all copies of the stolen records and the destruction of information derived from the stolen database. The Foundation did not comply with this demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 In September 2016, the Partnership amended its complaint to include a cause of action for replevin, seeking return of the spreadsheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Replevin is an ancient remedy for an ancient problem that can be phrased as \"that's mine, give it back.\" Replevin has come down to us from medieval times as a summary process, arising \"out of the need of a turbulent society to discourage resort to self-help.\" JOHN G. FLEMING, THE LAW OF TORTS 73 (5th ed. 1977). Washington has had a replevin statute since the first legislative assembly of the Territory of Washington. LAWS OF 1854, \u00a7\u00a7 100-110, at 149-52.

As the result of an amendment in 1979, the plaintiff must first apply for an order directing the defendant to appear and show cause why the court should not issue an order putting the plaintiff in possession of the personal property. RCW 7.64.020(1). Final judgment at a show cause hearing is permitted when the defendant raises no factual issues requiring a trial. RCW 7.64.035(3).

The court entered a written order of replevin on November 15, 2016. The court listed the following as facts that were undisputed at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The Foundation purchased copies of two spreadsheets containing information about the Training Partnership's students from Person B for $12,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The Foundation knew the copies of spreadsheets came from the Training Partnership when it purchased them;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 The Training Partnership maintained the spreadsheets and the information contained therein as confidential;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The Training Partnership treated the information in the spreadsheets as confidential\n   pursuant to its Confidentiality Policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Downloading information from the Training Partnership's database is not permitted under the Partnership's policies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 The Training Partnership owns or has lawful possession of all of the information contained in its student database, and the Partnership never authorized the Foundation to own or possess any part of its student database;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 The Washington State Department of Social and Health Services owns some of the information in the Training Partnership's student database and authorizes the Training Partnership to use that information.

The Foundation was ordered to take various actions to comply with this ruling. The court rejected the Foundation's argument that the replevin claim was preempted by the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 10 In December 2016, the Foundation filed a notice seeking discretionary review by this court.

The replevin statute expressly provides that its remedies \"\n   <em>\n    are in addition to any other remedy available to the plaintiff\n   </em>\n   .\" RCW 7.64.010 (emphasis added). This language was added to the Washington replevin statute in 1990, nine years after Washington's enactment of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act in 1981. It evinces legislative intent that statutory replevin is always available to a qualifying plaintiff. It follows that a plaintiff who has alleged (or could allege) misappropriation of a trade secret does not thereby lose the right to seek replevin of property owned by the petitioner and wrongfully detained by the alleged misappropriator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Foundation is able to construct an argument for the supremacy of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act only by ignoring the strong antipreemptive language in the replevin statute-\"in addition to any other remedy available.\" The Foundation does not address this provision. According to the Foundation, the displacement of other law that occurs by means of RCW 19.108.900 obliterates the court's duty to try to reconcile or harmonize statutes that might appear to conflict with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. Reply Brief of Petitioner at 7-9. In the analysis recommended by the Foundation, the text of a preempted statute is irrelevant and statutory construction is unnecessary. Reply Brief of Petitioner at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Foundation contends that when another claim is brought in the same lawsuit with a claim of trade secret misappropriation, the question the court must ask is whether both claims are based on the same underlying facts. The Foundation supports this position by citation to a number of federal district court decisions. When such decisions apply Washington law, they typically take as their starting point the \"factual preemption\" test adopted in\n   <em>\n    Thola v.

Her former employee, Mahan, went to work for Henschell, another chiropractor. Henschell paid Mahan a bonus of $100 for every new client she added to the patient rolls. Mahan appropriated Thola's confidential client list and used it to persuade many of Thola's clients to transfer to Henschell. Thola sued Henschell and Mahan, alleging misappropriation of trade secrets under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as well as three common law claims: breach of the duty of loyalty, tortious interference with a business relationship, and unjust enrichment by the tortious conduct.\n   <em>\n    Thola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091959\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/140/70/\">\n    140 Wash.

When the case went to trial, defendants argued that the trade secrets claim preempted the three common law claims and moved for a directed verdict on those claims. The motion was denied. A jury awarded $89,000 in damages against Mahan and Henschell and found that Henschell had been unjustly enriched by $28,712.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 Preemption was argued on appeal. The court did not dismiss any of the common law claims as preempted. The court preserved Thola's cause of action for unjust enrichment, noting that the act expressly allows for recovery of \"unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing damages for actual loss.\" RCW 19.108.030(1), quoted in\n   <em>\n    Thola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091959\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/140/70/\">\n    140 Wash.

The court also preserved the tortious interference claim because it was supported by evidence of Mahan's in-person solicitation of clients, which evidence was distinct from the misappropriated client list that supported the claim of trade secret misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    Thola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091959\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/140/70/\">\n    140 Wash.

The error that required reversal was the court's failure to instruct the jury that it could not consider acts of trade secret misappropriation as proof of other claims. Most of the evidence related to the theft of the confidential customer list, and it was likely the jury used that evidence to find in Thola's favor on all claims. The trial court \"should have instructed the jury that it could not consider evidence of Mahan's acts of trade secret misappropriation when it deliberated on Thola's common law claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Thola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091959\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/140/70/\">\n    140 Wash.

In support of its claim for relief under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, the Partnership did allege facts supporting its claim that the confidential database of student educational records is a trade secret, the misappropriation of which caused damage. But to the extent that the Partnership alleged these same facts in support of replevin, they were not material to the replevin claim; they were simply part of the narrative. As the trial court stated, \"Data can belong to one party and not be a trade secret. And the issue in a replevin case is who has the right to possess the data, not whether the data has any competitive value or economic value to a competitor.\" To have the right to replevin, the Partnership did not have to prove that the property was confidential data that might be characterized as a trade secret. What mattered was which entity, the Partnership or the Foundation, had the superior possessory interest in the property. The causes of action arising from the two statutes at issue\n   operate independently of each other.

The replevin statute does not distinguish between tangible and intangible property. The question is whether the property may be taken back from the defendant and returned to the plaintiff. RCW 7.64.045, .047. Electronic data can be both taken and returned. In fact, this has already occurred in the present case. The electronic spreadsheets were removed from the Foundation's database pursuant to the replevin order.

The Foundation argues the court had no basis to compel the return of the copies because the Partnership retained the same information in its own database. The replevin statute does not support this interpretation. The Partnership has a superior possessory interest in the information. That interest is a property interest. It includes the right to control whether others can have access to the information. If the Foundation had acquired and wrongfully detained copies of tangible documents belonging to the Partnership, the Foundation would have to give them back regardless of whether the Partnership maintained possession of the originals. The same is true with respect to electronic data. The trial court did not err in applying the replevin statute to the electronic spreadsheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    It was wrongful for the Foundation to retain the data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 In support of a motion for a show cause hearing under the replevin statute, the plaintiff must file an affidavit showing, among other things, that the property is \"wrongfully detained\" by the defendant. RCW 7.64.020(2)(b). The Foundation contends the Partnership did not and could not show the Foundation's detention of the spreadsheets was wrongful because the Partnership always had access to its own copies of the information contained in the spreadsheets. As discussed above, for purposes of replevin, it does not matter that the Partnership kept its own copies of the stolen data. The Partnership's superior possessory interest in the information included the right to control access by others to the information. The Foundation wrongfully detained the spreadsheets when it was asked to give them back and did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 The Foundation also argues that the spreadsheets were not \"wrongfully detained\" because when Williams transferred them to the Foundation, he did not divulge that he had acquired them from the Partnership's database and he gave assurances that it was lawful for him to possess and transfer the information. To the extent this argument is based on Williams' deposition testimony, it will not be considered because that evidence was not before the trial court. Further, the argument is contradicted by findings the Foundation does not argue are erroneous. The trial court specifically found that the Partnership owns or has lawful possession of all of the information contained in its student database, the Department of Social and Health Services owns some of the information in the database and authorizes the Partnership to use it, and neither the Partnership nor the department ever authorized the Foundation to own or possess any portion of the database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 40 The elemental question in this action for replevin is the relative right of possession as between the Foundation and the Partnership. It is immaterial that Williams may have told the Foundation he had a legal right to possess and share the spreadsheets. The Foundation has not shown any basis on which it was entitled to possess or retain the spreadsheets when asked by the Partnership to give them back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 41 We conclude the record supports the element of wrongful detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    A bond was not required\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 42 The Foundation contends that the trial court erred by not requiring the Partnership to post bond upon being awarded possession. Bond is required only when temporary possession is granted \"pending final disposition.\" RCW 7.64.035(1)(a)(i). No bond was necessary here because the trial court entered final judgment at the show cause hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 43 First, we address the Foundation's motion to supplement the appellate record with a transcript of Williams' deposition and related exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 44 The Partnership discovered Williams' identity in January 2017. His deposition was taken in March 2017, but the deposition was not considered by the trial court and is not in the trial court record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 45 The motion is denied. The criteria of RAP 9.11 are not satisfied. The deposition adds nothing material to what is already in the record, and equitable considerations do not support the motion. The reason Williams' testimony was not available before the order of replevin was entered is that the Foundation chose not to reveal his identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 46 Second, we address the Partnership's motion to strike a letter sent to this court by the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 47 The Foundation asserts that the majority of jurisdictions that have interpreted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act favor the fact-based or \"strong\" approach to preemption. During oral argument before this court on July 25, 2018, we asked the Foundation for authority supporting this assertion. The Foundation responded the next day with a letter citing eight cases. The Foundation's letter continues with briefing responding to points raised by the Partnership during oral argument. The letter states that questioning by the panel prevented counsel for the Foundation from using her four minutes of reserved time to rebut the arguments of the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 48 The Foundation's case citations are accepted as a proper response to the panel's specific request for authority. We strike the remainder of the Foundation's letter as a brief not authorized by RAP 10.1. The use of time given for oral argument is at the discretion of the court. The opportunity to reserve time for rebuttal is not a guarantee that the panel will refrain from questioning counsel during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Attorney fees on appeal are awarded to the Partnership\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 49 The trial court awarded fees to the Partnership as authorized by the replevin statute when final judgment is entered at a show cause hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (3) If at the time of the hearing more than twenty days have elapsed since service of the summons and complaint and the defendant does not raise an issue of fact prior to or at the hearing that requires a trial on the issue of possession or damages, the judge or court commissioner may also, in addition to entering an order awarding possession, enter a final judgment awarding plaintiff possession of the property or its value if possession cannot be obtained, damages, court costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and costs of recovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   RCW 7.64.035(3). When a trial court awards attorney fees pursuant to a statute, it is ordinarily the rule that attorney fees are awardable on appeal as well.\n   <em>\n    Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1372147\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/118/801/#p825\">\n    118 Wash.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=828%20P.2d%20549\">\n    828 P.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). This court once denied a request for attorney fees on appeal in a replevin action, reasoning that RCW 7.64.035\"applies only to rulings of a 'judge or court commissioner, at the hearing on the order to show cause' in a replevin action.\"\n   <em>\n    Puget Sound Nat'l Bank v. Honeywell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1796192\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/40/313/#p319\">\n    40 Wash.

Because\n   <em>\n    Cowiche Canyon\n   </em>\n   is the stronger precedent, we follow it. We award attorney fees on appeal to the Partnership, subject to compliance with RAP 18.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 50 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Leach, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Schindler, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Clerk's Papers at 642 n.1 (Defendant's Brief on Show Cause Hearing): \"The copies of the lists plainly do not meet the high standard required for trade secret protection.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
