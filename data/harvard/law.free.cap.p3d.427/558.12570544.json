We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b62 This case involves adjudication of water rights within the drainage area of Utah Lake and Jordan River. In 1981, Johnson's predecessor in interest, the East Warm Creek Irrigation and Canal Company (the Company), filed a statement of water user's claim (the Original Claim) in the Utah Lake and Jordan River adjudication. The Company claimed right to 4.96 cubic feet per second of water from Warm Springs to irrigate 407.5 acres of land and water 250 livestock units based on a priority date before 1900. In 1985, Engineer prepared and filed with the district court a Proposed Determination for the Goshen Valley Subdivision, of which the Original Claim was a part. No party-including the Company or Johnson-filed an objection to the Proposed Determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b63 In 1999, nearly fourteen years later, the Company filed a diligence claim (the Diligence Claim) with Engineer in which it claimed water rights from Warm Springs to irrigate an additional 64.6 acres of land. In\n   its explanatory remarks, the Company represented that the \"owner for this diligence claim is the same as the original diligence claim,\" referring to the Original Claim filed in 1981. It also explained that \"[t]he original claim only accounted for 407.5 acres and the company wants to apply for the 64.6 acres that were left off and have always been used by [the Company].\" Approximately two weeks after filing the Diligence Claim, the Company transferred a fifty percent interest in the Diligence Claim to Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 In October 2000, and after conducting some on-site evaluation of the Diligence Claim, Engineer filed with the district court the Amendment, which recommended to the court that the Diligence Claim be disallowed. Johnson objected to the Amendment. After many years of discovery and negotiations between Johnson and Engineer-which included a failed stipulation between the two as to the Diligence Claim-Engineer in 2016 moved for summary judgment on Johnson's objection. Engineer characterized the Diligence Claim as \"an attempt to claim additional acreage that the Company failed to include\" in the Original Claim. Engineer argued that the Diligence Claim was barred by Utah Code section 73-4-9 due to the Company's failure to timely file a claim for the water identified therein. Engineer also asserted that the Diligence Claim could not be used to modify the Proposed Determination, \"because the only proper mechanism for correcting or modifying a proposed determination is through filing an objection [to it] with the district court,\" which neither Johnson nor the Company filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b65 Johnson opposed the summary judgment motion, arguing that it was improper for Engineer to amend the Proposed Determination regarding \"property and water rights not previously included in the Determination without giving an affected party sufficient opportunity to be heard.\" He contended that due process required that he have an opportunity to be heard regarding the water rights he asserted in the Diligence Claim. He also asserted a laches defense, contending that the parties who had objected to the Diligence Claim had waited fifteen years to pursue their objections and that he was prejudiced by the delay. He contended that the evidence establishing the Diligence Claim faded and became harder to obtain, and that during the delay he had also relied on the rights he asserted in the Diligence Claim. And he argued that the objecting parties' failure to pursue remedies constituted a fatal failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Engineer. The court made four determinations. First, the court concluded that the Diligence Claim was \"untimely and that the water right had already been addressed in the original Proposed Determination.\" In particular, the court determined that the Diligence Claim was \"an expansion of the water rights claimed in [the Original Claim],\" and the court concluded that the Company was \"forever barred and estopped\" under section 73-4-9 from asserting the Diligence Claim, that the Company \"forfeited\" the Diligence Claim water, and that \"the 2000 Amendment properly disallowed\" the claim. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Second, the court determined that the 2000 Amendment \"did not revive Mr. Johnson's right to assert a claim for additional water in the Goshen Valley adjudication or to challenge the original Proposed Determination.\" Rather, the court noted that the \"only way\" to challenge the Proposed Determination was through filing an objection under section 73-4-11, and it concluded that the \"time to file an objection to the original Proposed Determination passed in 1985.\" As a result, the court concluded that Johnson could not \"rely on the 2000 Amendment to revive any right to assert a claim for water in the general adjudication or object to the State Engineer's recommendations in the original Proposed Determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b68 Third, the court concluded that the Company and Johnson \"were afforded the process due to them\" under the general adjudication statutes. The court determined that the Company \"was afforded sufficient due process in connection with the original Proposed\n   Determination in the 1980s,\" and that Johnson, as the Company's successor in interest, was \"not entitled to any more rights than the Company had, and thus is bound by the timeframes for filing a water user's claim and an objection that apply to the Company.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 Fourth, the court was \"not persuaded\" by Johnson's laches argument. The court explained that \"[n]ot only did Mr. Johnson have both the opportunity and responsibility to pursue his own objection, he did not demonstrate that he would suffer any injury or prejudice in his ability to support his objection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The court therefore granted Engineer's motion for summary judgment, dismissed Johnson's objection, and affirmed the Amendment. Johnson appeals that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Johnson makes several arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted and applied the general adjudication statutes to bar the Diligence Claim, and that thereby he has been improperly denied his due process rights. He also argues that the district court incorrectly determined that laches and/or failure to prosecute did not bar Engineer from opposing the Diligence Claim or third parties from continuing to assert their objections to the Diligence Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Johnson's arguments of error all flow from the district court's summary judgment decision. \"We review a district court's legal conclusions and ultimate grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness, and view the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Likewise, we review a district court's interpretation and application of a statute for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Timothy v.

He contends that the Diligence Claim is not statutorily barred, as the district court concluded. Rather, he argues that he is entitled to the opportunity to perfect his Diligence Claim and that the Amendment filed by Engineer improperly and prematurely denied him that opportunity. As support for his argument, he makes several contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 He contends that diligence claims are different in kind from other water claims and that they may be made at any time, regardless of whether an action for a general adjudication of water rights is ongoing. He also contends that the Amendment effectively revived his opportunity to challenge the Proposed Determination and that due process requires that he now have the opportunity to prove his claim. Relatedly, he also argues that the district court's decision that the doctrines of laches and/or failure to prosecute did not apply was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 We begin by describing the statutory landscape involving diligence claims and the general adjudication process. We then address Johnson's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I.

The Utah Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    United States Fuel\n   </em>\n   makes that clear. In that case, an irrigation company filed a diligence claim in a general adjudication, and United States Fuel (USF) objected to the proposed determination one day after the statutory ninety-day deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.

The district court denied both motions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the district court determined that it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ultimately concluded that the evidence demonstrated that USF, not the irrigation company, held priority to the water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 On appeal, the supreme court reversed, holding that USF's failure to timely object was fatal to its attempt to have its water right adjudicated in a separate action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The court explained that filing the objection one day late \"had consequences,\" specifically that where no timely objections\n   to the proposed determination were filed, the district court overseeing the general adjudication became required under the \"clear mandate\" of section 73-4-12 to \"enter judgment consistent with [the] uncontested elements of [the] proposed determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15, 17 (explaining that the \"clear mandate of section 73-4-12 is that courts must render judgment in accordance with a proposed determination where the proposed determination is uncontested at the close of the ninety-day statutory period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 The supreme court explained that by failing to timely object, USF \"took on the status of a defaulting party in the general adjudication,\" rendering USF unable to defeat the irrigation company's \"right to obtain judgment\" in accordance with the proposed determination through \"collateral attack in a separate lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.

In so doing, the court noted that USF did have a potential remedy in the general adjudication: it could seek leave from the court overseeing the general adjudication \"to excuse its tardy objection,\" but explained that \"[u]nless and until\" USF sought and obtained leave, the court in the general adjudication was required to enter judgment \"perfecting [the irrigation company's] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 While the jurisdictional question presented by\n   <em>\n    United States Fuel\n   </em>\n   is not at issue in the present case, Johnson, like USF, has effectively sought to collaterally challenge the water rights described and established by the Proposed Determination through the untimely filed Diligence Claim.

Given the procedural stage of the general adjudication and the failure of any party to timely object to the Proposed Determination, the district court was required at the close of the statutory objection period to enter judgment in accordance with the water rights described therein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States Fuel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052483\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/79/945/\">\n    2003 UT 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052483\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/79/945/\">\n    79 P.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That result cannot now be collaterally challenged by the filing of a separate diligence claim. Rather, as explained in\n   <em>\n    United States Fuel\n   </em>\n   , the rights described in the Proposed Determination are now immune from attack absent leave from the court overseeing the general adjudication to lodge an untimely objection to the Proposed Determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9052483\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/79/945/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b636 Further, the Amendment, and Johnson's objections to the Amendment, did not open the door to an untimely challenge of the Proposed Determination. The Amendment was a proposed resolution of only the Diligence Claim, which represented water rights that perhaps could have been included in the Proposed Determination but, because the Company did not timely assert them, were not. The Amendment did not propose any revision to the Proposed Determination and instead allowed it to remain untouched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b637 In this way, while it was filed as an inclusion to the general adjudication, it is an amendment to the Proposed Determination only insofar as it acts to further insulate the Proposed Determination from collateral attack. Thus, regardless of how the Amendment is characterized (housekeeping measure or otherwise) or the path that Engineer took to file it, the Amendment recommended a discrete and statutorily mandated resolution of a diligence claim that improperly sought to disturb the water rights established by the unopposed Proposed Determination. On this basis, Johnson's objections to the Amendment therefore could only be objections to the Amendment and the recommendation itself, not to the Proposed Determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Butler, Crockett &amp; Walsh Dev.

And, in dicta, the court noted that even if the decree were intended to adjudicate the rights associated with the isolated springs at issue, it was unclear that the users of the isolated springs' water received the process and notice they were due of the adjudication and of their duty to assert their rights in it, particularly in light of a shift in law mid-proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10369455\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/857/927/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10369455\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/857/927/\">\n    at 933-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b641 Here, in contrast, the water represented by the Diligence Claim had allegedly been used by the Company since before 1903 and apparently was part and parcel of the Original Claim.

There is also no question that the Company received the Proposed Determination and the required notice that it had ninety days to object, which it did not do. And although Johnson attempts to argue that applying the statutory bars to diligence claims represents a shift in law (like the shift in law at play in\n   <em>\n    Provo River\n   </em>\n   , which affected the notice given to the isolated springs' users), he has not demonstrated that this is so in light of the plain statutory language and the precedent we have discussed.

Johnson is bound by those failures. The Company and Johnson have also failed to avail themselves of the proper procedural vehicle-a requested extension under section 73-4-10-to try to remedy the failure to include in the Original Claim the water represented by the Diligence Claim or to object to the Proposed Determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-4-3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-4-10. Further, the Company and Johnson, as its successor, have received the process they are due, given that the Diligence Claim represents an improper collateral challenge to the Proposed Determination and that the Company received all the process it was due in relation to the Proposed Determination. And the Amendment, or the proceedings associated with the Amendment, did not revive a right to challenge the Proposed Determination. Thus, under the plain language of the statutes in question, as well as precedent interpreting those statutes, we affirm the district court's determination that the Diligence Claim was barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   III. Laches Defense and/or Failure to Prosecute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 Finally, Johnson argues that the district court erred when it determined that laches and failure to prosecute did not apply in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b645 \"Laches is designed to shelter a prejudiced defendant from the difficulties of litigating meritorious claims after an unexplained delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v.

For one thing, our supreme court has rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Green River Canal Co. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Olds\n   </em>\n   , a canal company asserted that the state engineer was barred from seeking dismissal of its filings because the engineer waited nearly twenty-seven years to file the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975109\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/666/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 n.4. The Utah Supreme Court rejected the canal company's assertion, concluding that, \"[g]iven the highly unusual nature of general adjudication proceedings and the fact that [the canal company] itself had an obligation and opportunity to litigate its objection during that twenty-seven-year period, [the court was] not inclined to hold the State Engineer accountable for the long delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975109\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/666/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b647 Likewise, here, Johnson has not demonstrated why the district court erred in determining that laches did not apply, given the unusual nature of general adjudication proceedings, Johnson's obligation and opportunity to litigate the Diligence Claim and the Amendment, and the various circumstances in play, such as the lengthy negotiation proceedings between Johnson and Engineer and the failed stipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975109\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/666/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b648 Similarly, Johnson has failed to demonstrate error in the district court's determination that he has not demonstrated prejudice. In particular, Johnson has not shown that it was error for the district court to discern no prejudice from the disappearance of evidence to prove a claim the court determined Johnson was barred from making under\n   statute, a determination we have affirmed above. And Johnson has not otherwise demonstrated that his reliance on his alleged diligence rights ought to have persuaded the court to reach a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b649 Johnson also has failed to demonstrate that the third parties objecting to the Diligence Claim ought to be barred from asserting their objections by a failure to diligently prosecute them. He contends that the objecting parties did not pursue remedies on their objections for over fifteen years, and cites a provision of the Utah Code-section 73-3-15-which he claims supports his assertion that the objections can be dismissed for failure to prosecute diligently. But section 73-3-15 addresses dismissal for failure to prosecute an\n   <em>\n    informal\n   </em>\n   adjudicative proceeding, which the present case was not, and he does not explain how this provision nonetheless applies. Moreover, other than citing general cases for the basic proposition that a party must diligently prosecute its claims, Johnson does not explain how a failure-to-prosecute theory ought to apply in these circumstances, given the nature of general adjudication proceedings or the circumstances particular to this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975109\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/666/\">\n    2004 UT 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8975109\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/110/666/\">\n    110 P.3d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b650 Accordingly, we affirm the district court's conclusion that the doctrines of laches and/or failure to prosecute do not apply under the circumstances present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b651 For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on Johnson's objection.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The court additionally noted that Johnson had \"not requested an extension of time to file an objection to the original Proposed Determination\" under Utah Code section 73-4-10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    As Engineer notes in his briefing, many of the relevant general adjudication provisions in sections 73-4-1 to -24 were left unrevised between 1979 and the latter part of the first decade of 2000.

No language in either the diligence claim statute or the general adjudication statutes suggests that allegedly corrective claims are an exception to the statutory bar when they are untimely filed in a general adjudication or that it is procedurally proper to untimely assert a corrective claim through the filing of a new diligence claim outside of the general adjudication proceedings already underway. Rather, the plain language of both sections 73-4-5 and 73-4-9 require a claimant to describe and claim the full extent of his water rights within the time frame required and in the general adjudication proceedings or suffer the consequence for failing to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Johnson also argues that a 2013 amendment to the diligence claim statute, section 73-5-13,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-5-13\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 73-5-13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (7) (LexisNexis Supp. 2013), as well as the state engineers' historical practice, which he contends has included accepting untimely diligence claims in areas subject to general adjudication, support his argument that we should interpret the diligence claim statute as exempting diligence claims from the reach of the general adjudication statutes. But here, we have concluded that the plain language of the relevant statutory provisions bars the Diligence Claim and, moreover, does not support Johnson's suggested interpretation. Thus, we have no need for \"other interpretive tools\" to aid us, such as subsequent legislative history or the state engineers' historical practice, and \"our task of statutory construction is [therefore] at an end.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bagley v.
