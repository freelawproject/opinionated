As part of an effort to obtain that water, Haik challenged a change application that sought to add acreage to accommodate a private water system that would serve ten homes in Little Cottonwood Canyon. The change application did not directly impact Haik's property or his water rights. Haik sought judicial review of the State Engineer's approval. The district court\n   concluded Haik lacked standing to mount that challenge. The district court also rebuffed Haik's efforts to amend his petition and dismissed. Haik appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 As we noted when we last addressed a Haik appeal, \"[Haik] has spent the better part of the last twenty years asking courts to order Salt Lake City to supply his undeveloped property in the Albion Basin Subdivision with enough water (at least 400 gallons per day) to allow him to build houses on it.\"\n   <em>\n    Haik v.

For a somewhat more complete history of Haik's saga, see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339431,12339461,12339447\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/285/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2 -6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 This time around, Haik challenged Change Application #57-10013. The application explained its raison d'\u00eatre:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   This Change Application adds 25.165 acres, located and described in the attached Exhibit A, to the approved place of use. No other changes are sought. Salt Lake City adds this acreage to reflect the anticipated construction of a private stand-alone water system sourced from the Bay City Mine to serve only up to 10 single family homes to be located on said acreage. The right to use of this surplus water is based on the ... Water Supply Agreement between Salt Lake City and certain Alta area property owners, as amended by [a court order]. Under this Order, each of the up to 10 homes may receive up to 800 [gallons per day] average calculated on a monthly basis-for a maximum total of 8,000 [gallons per day] calculated on a monthly basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Haik is not one of these \"certain Alta area property owners\" the change application references. Indeed, Haik requested that the district court either enjoin the State Engineer's decision or allow him \"to similarly construct a private stand-alone system\" that could serve his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 Despite having no direct connection to the change application, Haik challenged it. Haik asserted that Salt Lake City Corporation (the City) failed to show that \"its application was filed in 'good faith and not for purposes of speculation or monopoly.' \" (Quoting UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-3-8(1)(a)(v) ). Haik also argued that the City had violated article XI, section 6 of the Utah Constitution, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   No municipal corporation, shall directly or indirectly, lease, sell, alien or dispose of any waterworks, water rights, or sources of water supply now, or hereafter to be owned or controlled by it; but all such waterworks, water rights and sources of water supply now owned or hereafter to be acquired by any municipal corporation, shall be preserved, maintained and operated by it for supplying its inhabitants with water at reasonable charges ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Haik contended that by \"add[ing] a private system for the purpose of diverting [the] public water supply,\" the City unconstitutionally alienated water. Haik additionally asserted that the City abused its alleged monopoly power by denying landowners water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5 Despite Haik's objections, the State Engineer approved the change application. In response, Haik filed a petition in the district court seeking a trial de novo of the State Engineer's order. Haik's petition rehashed the arguments he made to the State Engineer. The City moved to dismiss, arguing that Haik lacked standing, had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and that the petition failed to state a viable claim. The State Engineer argued that Haik lacked standing and that Haik's claims fell outside the scope of a trial de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 Haik opposed the motions, but also moved for leave to amend. Haik asked: \"If the Court determines there is an insufficiency in the petition based upon the motions for dismissal of either the State Engineer or Salt Lake City Corporation, then Mark Haik requests leave to amend or supplement so as to cure any deficiency.\" But Haik did not attach a proposed amended petition or describe in any way, shape, or form how he might amend the petition to remedy the deficiencies the City and State Engineer attacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 The district court granted the motions to dismiss. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because Haik lacked standing. The court also held that Haik had asserted claims that were not the proper subject of a trial de novo of a change application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the district court denied Haik's\n   motion to amend because he had \"failed to provide a proposed amended petition with his motion\" and because \"any proposed amendment would be futile ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 8 Haik appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 Haik argues that the district court erred in granting the motions to dismiss his petition.

The district court denied the motion because Haik failed to attach a proposed amended petition and because it found that any amendment would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 We have reviewed denial of motions for leave to amend under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Holmes Dev., LLC v.

And we have drawn no distinction between denials premised on a procedural defect-such as timeliness or failure to attach a proposed amended pleading-and denials based upon the amendment's futility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Powder Run at Deer Valley Owner Ass'n v. Black Diamond Lodge at Deer Valley Ass'n of Unit Owners\n   </em>\n   , the appeals court noted that while it reviews for \"abuse of discretion a ruling on a motion for leave to amend a pleading, we review a futility determination for correctness.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6949857\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/1076/\">\n    2014 UT App 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6949857\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/1076/\">\n    320 P.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State Engineer noted this distinction in its brief and expressed confusion over the appropriate standard. And we think the court of appeals has it right. Futility of an amendment asks for a legal determination of the merits of the proposed amendment. But before overturning our precedent, we must conduct a\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eldridge v.

Because\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is so important to the predictability and fairness of a common law system, we do not overrule our precedents 'lightly.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 \"Our decisions have identified two broad factors that distinguish between weighty precedents and less weighty ones: (1) the persuasiveness of the authority and reasoning on which the precedent was originally based, and (2) how firmly the precedent has become established in the law since it was handed down.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. It appears that we have simply not analyzed whether we should employ a separate standard of review for denying a motion for leave to amend because of futility. In\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , we reviewed a denial of a motion to amend on grounds of futility and summarily stated that \"[w]e review a district court's decision to deny a plaintiff's motion to amend its complaint for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994301\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/146/\">\n    2009 UT 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994301\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/146/\">\n    220 P.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Haik Lacks Standing Because He Is Not \"Aggrieved by an Order of the State Engineer\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 Before the district court, Haik argued he had standing to challenge the State Engineer's order under Utah Code section 73-3-14. That provision provides that \"[a] person aggrieved by an order of the state engineer may obtain judicial review in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 4, Administrative Procedures Act, and this section.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 73-3-14(1)(a). In this context, \" 'aggrieved' is consistent with our traditional standing requirement that a plaintiff show particularized injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Wash. Cty. Water Conservancy Dist. v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9066867\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/82/1125/\">\n    2003 UT 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9066867\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/82/1125/\">\n    82 P.3d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 \"We have recognized that 'the first and most widely employed standard' for establishing standing 'requires a plaintiff to show some distinct and palpable injury that gives rise to a personal stake in the outcome of the dispute.' This requirement that a plaintiff demonstrate such 'particularized' injury is part of the 'traditional' test for standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (citations omitted). \"The traditional standing requirement is generally justified on grounds that in the absence of a requirement that a plaintiff have a 'personal stake in the outcome' or a 'particularized injury,' the courts might permit themselves to be drawn into disputes that are not fit for judicial resolution or amount to 'generalized grievances that are more appropriately directed to the legislative and executive branches of the state government.' \"\n   <em>\n    Soc'y of Prof'l Journalists, Utah Chapter v.

Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6824790\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/366/901/\">\n    2016 UT App 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6824790\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/366/901/\">\n    366 P.3d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for this proposition. In that case, the court concluded that appellants were aggrieved because they were granted a water right \"subject to the [Water] District's senior right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9 (alteration in original). Appellants there challenged that senior right.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The State Engineer's decision that appellants' rights were junior caused appellants to suffer an \" 'actual or potential injury' resulting from the State Engineer's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). Thus, they were aggrieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 There is no similar contention here. Unlike the appellants in\n   <em>\n    Utah Alunite Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the change application here does not impact Haik in any direct or particularized way. Haik merely claims that he, like many others, \"is a landowner in the valley from which the water is to be appropriated ....\" In other words, Haik argues that because he receives (or wants to receive) water from the City, he has an interest in how the City manages that water and standing to challenge the City's decision. Haik's injury could hardly be \"particularized\" if any person who receives water from the City could assert it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 Haik also appears to argue that approval of this change application appropriated water that could have been his. Haik\n   claims that \"[i]f wrongful municipal appropriation is followed by unconstitutional alienation back to selected or favored private parties, then the public trust is injured and wrongful displacement of waters that would otherwise be available to serve private residences occurs, directly harming Haik.\" But Haik makes no showing that if the change application were denied, any additional water would flow his way. Since Haik has made no showing that if this water were not used for these residences it would be available for his land, he cannot meet our traditional standing test and cannot be considered an aggrieved party under the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 Next, Haik contends that \"wrongful displacement [of water] enhances injury to Haik because his apparent recourse to water is only through purchase of private water. To the extent[ ] that private water is unconstitutionally, illegally displaced; that injury reduces recourse for Haik.\" (Emphases omitted). Again, the availability of water on the open market, which impacts all persons receiving water from the City, is more of a \"generalized grievance[ ]\" than the distinct injury our standing caselaw requires.\n   <em>\n    Bullock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10408966\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/743/1166/#p1170\">\n    743 P.2d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II.
