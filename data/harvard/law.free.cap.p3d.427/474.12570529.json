Specifically, he appeals the trial court's refusal to allow him to cross-examine a witness (Witness) about a plea in abeyance and the trial court's refusal to allow the jury to be transported to the scene of the crime. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Shooting\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The State charged Robinson with the murder of the victim (Victim) as well as aggravated assault and use of a firearm by a restricted person, based on events that occurred on April 9, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Robinson and Victim were in a relationship and living together. On the day of the murder they were temporarily staying at Robinson's parents' home over the weekend while his parents were out of town. Witness, a friend of Robinson's-who was an instructor at the college Robinson attended-drove Robinson to his parents' home after their classes had ended for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 When they reached the Robinson home, Robinson invited Witness inside. Robinson and Witness went down to the basement and, while there, Robinson went into his father's bedroom and retrieved from a shelf a black and silver Smith &amp; Wesson 9mm semiautomatic handgun to show Witness. Robinson claimed he had received it for his birthday. He and Witness \"checked out\" the gun, and Robinson \"took the bullets out of it,\" after which he put the gun away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Robinson and Witness then left to run an errand. When they returned, Robinson and Victim started to argue. The argument, though only verbal at that time, \"escalated pretty quickly,\" and Witness, feeling \"uncomfortable,\" started to leave. Robinson tried to \"hold\" Witness to keep him from leaving, telling Witness to \"not ... let it get to [him].\" Around this time, Victim \"ran out the front door,\" and Robinson chased after her. Witness \"went straight to [his] car and left.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 A neighbor (Neighbor) was in her backyard with her sixteen-year-old son (Neighbor's Son) when she observed Victim \"running fast\" past Neighbor's house, followed by Robinson. Both Neighbor and Neighbor's Son went to the front of their house \"to see what was going on,\" and they saw Victim lying with her back on the ground and Robinson on top \"punching,\" \"kick[ing],\" and \"beating\" her. Both neighbors described Robinson as being in a type of \"rage.\" When Neighbor told Robinson to stop, Robinson got up and lunged at Neighbor, but he turned around when Victim alerted him that Neighbor's Son was on his phone, apparently\n   dialing 911. Robinson then walked back to his parents' home, with Victim following behind. Neighbor and Neighbor's Son called the police and reported the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Police officers arrived shortly after 3:00 p.m. and, after speaking with Neighbor and Neighbor's Son, knocked on the Robinson's door and rang the doorbell. Receiving no response, the officers checked windows and went around the back of the house. Eventually, more than thirty minutes later, Robinson emerged from the backyard to talk to the officers. The officers universally described Robinson as being in a state of emotional upset-that he was \"[t]eary\" and \"shaking\" and that he appeared to be \"nervous,\" \"agitated,\" \"pretty aggressive,\" \"[v]ery angry,\" and \"annoyed.\" Though Robinson initially refused to allow the officers into the home, the officers told him that they would not leave without checking on Victim. Robinson then called into the house, telling Victim to come up to \"show the police [he] didn't hurt [her].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 The officers spoke separately with both Robinson and Victim about the incident; both denied that their argument became physical. Two of the officers carefully looked at Victim's face, head, and scalp but could see no injuries. They also did not see any injuries on Robinson's hands. Finding no evidence of assault, the officers left the home at approximately 4:16 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Meanwhile, after leaving the Robinson's home, Witness went to a mutual friend's (Friend) house where Robinson and Victim had been living. While there Friend received several phone calls from Robinson, some of which Witness overheard. In one of the early calls, Robinson told Friend that he and Victim were arguing. In the last phone call, Robinson informed Friend that he had shot Victim in the head and that she was dead, and he told Friend that he needed to \"get some money [Friend] owed him.\" Witness, overhearing Friend question Robinson about whether he shot Victim, immediately called 911 and reported that Victim had been shot. He reported the incident at approximately 4:40 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The first responding officer arrived at the Robinson's home at approximately 4:50 p.m. The officer noticed a man-Robinson-walking down the street, and another of the neighbors flagged the officer down to let him know she had observed a gun tucked into the back of Robinson's pants as he walked by her house. The officer then attempted to approach Robinson, and a foot chase ensued, ending in Robinson's apprehension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Other responding officers entered the Robinson's home and discovered Victim lying at the bottom of the basement stairs. The paramedics discovered a gunshot wound to Victim's head and, shortly after responding, they pronounced her dead. The responding officers also discovered several holes through which a single bullet appeared to have passed-a hole in the molding of the basement's \"low hanging ceiling ... at the bottom of the [basement] stairs,\" a hole in the basement door, and a \"divot\" in the kitchen ceiling. The officers also discovered a bullet in the cat's dish on the kitchen floor. At trial, witnesses-both fact and expert-testified about Victim's location at the time the gun was fired as well as the bullet's trajectory. Though various witnesses disagreed on the exact stair on which Victim had been standing at the time she was killed, witnesses postulated that Victim had been standing on one of the basement stairs. Witnesses also postulated that the bullet had traveled in an upward direction from the basement, going first through the molding of the \"low-hanging\" basement ceiling, then entering the right side of Victim's head and exiting on the left, passing through the basement door to the kitchen ceiling, creating a \"divot\" in that ceiling, and finally coming to rest in the cat's dish in the kitchen upstairs. In addition, two handwritten notes were discovered in the kitchen, which read, \"Accident, I love you,\" and, \"I'm sorry. This was an accident, so will be the next.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Based on these events, the State charged Robinson with murder, a first degree felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-203\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). The case proceeded to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 At trial, both parties agreed that, despite the low basement ceiling, at the time\n   Robinson shot Victim from the basement he would have seen at least part of her body on the stairs. The central issue at trial was whether Victim's death was merely reckless and accidental on Robinson's part, or whether it was knowing and intentional. Robinson asserted that he was guilty only of manslaughter-that Victim's death was the result of a \"tragic accident\" involving his unfamiliarity with, and reckless operation of, the gun. In contrast, the State asserted that, according to the elements of the variants of murder, Robinson intended his actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To that end, the State introduced several fact witnesses to testify regarding their observations and involvement, including Witness, Neighbor, Neighbor's Son, the various responding police officers, and the lead detective on the case. The State also introduced several expert witnesses, including a ballistics expert, a bloodstain pattern analyst, and the forensic pathologist who performed Victim's autopsy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Robinson made two motions during trial that are the subject of this appeal. First, Robinson apparently discovered on the second day of trial that Witness had previously pleaded guilty to theft by deception but that the plea had been held in abeyance. Robinson therefore moved under rule 608(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence to cross-examine Witness about that plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robinson asserted that the plea was probative of Witness's character for untruthfulness, as required under rule 608(b). The court denied Robinson's request, finding that \"it would certainly be more prejudicial than probative also because it's not actually a plea of guilty entered.\" While Robinson was therefore unable to cross-examine Witness about the plea itself, he otherwise extensively cross-examined Witness about what he characterized as Witness's apparent tendency to omit facts \"when ... talking to law enforcement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Second, Robinson moved under rule 17(i) 5 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure to have the jury transported to view the basement at the Robinson's home where the shooting occurred. Both parties agreed that the scene had changed since the crime because the homeowner had remodeled the basement following the shooting. Nevertheless, Robinson claimed that the jury view was \"critical\" and \"crucial\" to his case and that the jury needed to \"personally observe the angles and obstructions,\" arguing that \"[t]he angle of the stairs, the obstruction of the basement ceiling, and the location of both parties on the stairs casts considerable doubt on whether [he] could have been acting knowingly and intentionally where his vision was obstructed.\" He also asserted that, although the basement had been remodeled and the \"paint and flooring ha[d] changed,\" the important aspects, such as the approximate ceiling height, \"remain[ed] primarily the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 To support this assertion, Robinson offered testimony from his father, who testified that he had the \"whole [basement] redone.\" For the ceiling, he testified that where it had been tiled with molding at the bottom, the tile was removed and the ceiling sheetrocked, which he opined changed the ceiling height about \"an inch.\" He also testified that he had completely replaced the stairs with thinner treads and carpeted them. As for the rest of the basement, where it had been open before, separate rooms had been walled off and finished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 The State opposed Robinson's motion, arguing that the significant changes to the basement meant that the jury would view \"a completely different scene\" than the one in which Victim was shot, which it asserted would only be \"confusing,\" particularly in light of the photographs and other visual evidence of the scene that would be presented during trial. The State also argued that the outcome of Robinson's motion was controlled by\n   <em>\n    State v. Cabututan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352101\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/408/\">\n    861 P.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1993), in which our supreme court affirmed the trial court's denial of a motion to view a crime scene in part because it was \"unlikely that the site would have been in the same condition\" as it had been at the time of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352101\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/408/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352101\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/408/\">\n    at 412-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court agreed with the State and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 The jury convicted Robinson of all charges. Robinson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Robinson argues that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow him to cross-examine Witness regarding his theft by deception plea in abeyance under rule 608(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. \"Trial courts have broad discretion in restricting the scope of cross-examination, and on appeal the trial court's ruling ... is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8468703\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/141/614/\">\n    2006 UT App 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8468703\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/141/614/\">\n    141 P.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). \"In circumstances where evidence should have been admitted, it is reviewed for harmless error. If it is reasonably likely a different outcome would result with the introduction of the evidence and confidence in the verdict is undermined, then exclusion is harmful.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

While allowed under the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, jury views are rare,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1991). We will not reverse the trial court's decision \"unless the trial court has clearly abused that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10376098\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/814/604/#p613\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Relatedly, Robinson argues that the trial court's denial of his request for a jury view violated his constitutional right \"to present a meaningful and complete defense, and was fundamentally unfair.\" While Robinson contends this issue was preserved, as we explain below, we conclude that it was not. We therefore review this issue for plain error, as Robinson alternatively requests. \"The plain error standard of review requires an appellant to show the existence of a harmful error that should have been obvious to the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    2015 UT App 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6858913\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/354/775/\">\n    354 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   I. Witness Impeachment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 Robinson argues that the trial court improperly precluded him from cross-examining Witness under rule 608(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence about Witness's theft by deception plea in abeyance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is the type of error to which we generally apply a harmless error analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court stated on the record its finding that \"it would certainly be more prejudicial than probative [to allow the cross-examination] because it's not actually a plea of guilty entered.\" This statement arguably raises some question about whether the court disallowed the testimony under rule 403, or whether the court instead determined that the plea in abeyance itself did not qualify as evidence admissible under rule 608(b).

On that basis, we affirm the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 Robinson argues that the court's error was harmful because Witness's testimony \"was important to the State's case\" for two reasons. First, Robinson claims that the State relied on Witness's testimony to establish that Robinson was familiar with the gun, which he claims made it \"less likely\" that the jury would believe \"he unintentionally discharged the gun\" the day Victim was killed. Second, he claims that Witness's testimony undermined his defense \"by providing support for the State's argument that [he] was angry enough to be physically aggressive toward [Victim].\" He contends that it was therefore \"essential ... to be able to challenge [Witness's] credibility by cross-examining him about his prior dishonest act-theft by deception-to show that [Witness] had fabricated the incidents\" to which he testified. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b626 To begin with, contrary to Robinson's assertion that Witness's testimony \"established\" that Robinson was familiar with the gun, Witness's testimony was only that Robinson had showed him the gun, that Robinson got the gun from \"[s]omewhere on his dad's shelf,\" and that he and Robinson \"checked out\" the gun before Robinson put it back. More importantly, however, Witness's testimony was cumulative to statements Robinson himself made to the lead detective who investigated the shooting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347256\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1033/\">\n    2017 UT App 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347256\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1033/\">\n    407 P.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that \"when erroneously admitted evidence is cumulative of evidence already before the factfinder,\n   the error may be considered harmless\"). The detective testified that Robinson said he got the gun from his dad's room in the \"dresser, cabinet area,\" and he had showed the gun to Witness, after which he put the gun away. Indeed, Robinson's statements to the detective about the gun were more specific than Witness's testimony. The detective testified that Robinson told him the gun was a black and silver 9mm, there were boxes of ammunition in the \"same cabinet area\" where the gun was, and he had taken the bullets out of it around the time he showed the gun to Witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Witness's testimony regarding Robinson's physical aggression and state of mind was also cumulative to other evidence introduced at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347256\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1033/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Witness testified that the argument between Robinson and Victim \"escalated pretty quickly,\" he also testified that the argument he witnessed was only verbal. He offered no testimony that Robinson was physically aggressive with Victim; his only testimony about physical aggression was that Robinson \"got a little bit physical\" with him by attempting to \"hold\" him to keep him from leaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 On the other hand, several other witnesses testified to Robinson's physical aggression and state of mind closer in time to the shooting. For example, both Neighbor and Neighbor's Son testified that they witnessed Robinson punch, kick, and beat Victim, and both described him as being in a \"rage.\" Neighbor further testified that Robinson was physically aggressive towards her, lunging at her when she told Robinson to stop beating Victim. And the police officers who responded to the initial welfare check variously described Robinson as being \"agitated,\" \"annoyed,\" \"belligerent[ ],\" \"pretty aggressive,\" and \"[v]ery angry.\" In fact, one of the officers testified that Robinson's anger and apparent emotional state caused him to be concerned enough that he specifically positioned himself to be in one of the other officer's line of sight while talking with Robinson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 In addition, although the court did not allow Robinson to cross-examine Witness about the plea in abeyance, Robinson otherwise thoroughly cross-examined Witness about his \"tendency\" to omit facts when talking with law enforcement and pointed out inconsistencies in Witness's testimony. For example, Robinson highlighted Witness's failure to initially tell police that he had gone with Robinson to a liquor store before going to the Robinson's home, that he had looked at and handled the gun, or that Robinson had tried to physically restrain him from leaving; indeed, Robinson was able to have Witness admit outright that he was \"willing to omit facts to law enforcement.\" Robinson also highlighted certain inconsistencies in Witness's testimony, such as the number of times Robinson called him after he left the house. And, in his closing, Robinson suggested to the jury that Witness was a \"horrible witness\" and had \"zero credibility,\" and he urged the jury \"not to believe a single thing\" Witness had said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 For these reasons, we conclude that Robinson has not demonstrated that denying him an opportunity to cross-examine Witness about the plea in abeyance was harmful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II. Jury View\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 Robinson argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to transport the jury to view the scene where the shooting occurred. He contends that his defense was that \"the discharge of the firearm ... was unintentional-the result of a tragic accident,\" and he asserts that his defense \"depended on the jury's ability to accurately visualize\" the scene \"to understand the unlikelihood that [he] intentionally discharged the gun toward [Victim].\" He also argues that the court's error in denying his motion deprived him of \"his due process right to present a complete and meaningful defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A.

As noted in this opinion, the basement's remodel altered the scene in which Victim had been shot, and apart from contending that the jury needed to view the unique angles and heights in play to fully comprehend his defense, Robinson has not explained how viewing the remodeled basement-where the heights and building materials have been altered since the crime occurred-would have swayed the jury into believing that he recklessly and accidentally shot Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 In this regard, we agree with the State's contention that viewing the scene would not have changed the basic facts to which all parties have agreed-that, at the time Robinson shot Victim, at least part of her body would have been visible to him, and that, given the trajectory of the bullet, the gun was necessarily aimed in Victim's direction at the time it was fired. In light of these facts, we further agree with the State that whether the firing was accidental seems to turn on circumstantial evidence, such as evidence about Robinson's state of mind around the time of the shooting, not on whether (or how much) the ceiling heights and stair angles might have obscured Robinson's view of Victim's head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 Along those lines, it is also significant that the jury was not required to find that Robinson intended to kill Victim in order to convict him. The jury was instructed that it could convict Robinson of murder if it found that he \"[c]ommitted an act clearly dangerous to human life with the intent to cause serious bodily injury to [Victim],\" which caused her death; that he acted \"under circumstances evidencing a depraved indifference to human life, knowingly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another and thereby caused\" Victim's death; or that he \"[e]ngaged in the commission or attempted commission of a Discharge of a Firearm,\" \"[Victim] was killed in the course of the commission or attempted commission\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   of the firearm's discharge, and Robinson \"knew or had reason to believe that any person may be endangered by the discharge of a firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b645 In other words, the jury could have concluded that perhaps Robinson did not intend to outright kill Victim but that he was still guilty of murder because, seeing Victim standing on the stairs, he nevertheless pointed and fired the gun in her direction. Robinson has not attempted to explain how viewing the remodeled scene would have been reasonably likely to dispel all the potential variants of murder in play to convince the jury that Victim's killing was merely reckless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b646 Moreover, in making his argument that the jury view was critical, Robinson seems to rely heavily on his expert's testimony that it was important to view the crime scene firsthand to understand the relationships of the heights and angles involved. But the jury was provided extensive visual evidence, including many photographs from the actual crime scene and a video made by investigating officers shortly after the shooting, as well as various witnesses discussing the crime scene. Robinson fails to explain why, given that evidence, a visit to the remodeled scene would have been reasonably likely to convince the jury that he was merely reckless in killing Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b647 For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its discretion or otherwise plainly err in denying Robinson's motion to transport the jury to the scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b648 We conclude that any assumed error in the trial court's denial of Robinson's motion to cross-examine Witness about a plea in abeyance under rule 608(b) does not undermine our confidence in the verdict.
