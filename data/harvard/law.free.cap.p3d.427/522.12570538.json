As she had in her federal suit, she named as defendants Iron County; the Iron County Attorney, Scott Garrett; and Cedar City (collectively, the Defendants). Upon a motion from each of the Defendants, the state district court dismissed Cheek's claims without reaching any conclusions regarding their substantive merit. Cheek appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    The Federal Suit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 On May 28, 2010, Cheek filed a complaint in Utah's federal district court alleging that, during her arrest and subsequent detention, the Defendants had violated her civil rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint contained seven causes of action arising under section 1983 of the United States Code and three arising under the \"unnecessary rigor\" provision of the Utah Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of her state-law claims, Cheek alleged that the named defendants had violated her constitutional rights by setting excessive bail, by compelling her to provide blood and urine samples pursuant to an illegal warrant, and by failing to protect her from a sexual assault during her incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 In the initial complaint, Cheek listed Garrett as a defendant in both his official and individual capacities. But Cheek later amended the complaint to include Garrett only in his official capacity. Garrett then filed a motion to dismiss. The federal court granted the motion on November 18, 2014, reasoning that the complaint stated that the individual defendants were sued only in their official capacity. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   An official-capacity suit is another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent. What's more, a person sued in his official capacity has no stake, as an individual, in the outcome of [the] litigation. Accordingly, the claims against all individual defendants ... are dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court specified in its order that Garrett's dismissal was \"with prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b64 Following Garrett's dismissal, Cedar City and Iron County moved, respectively, for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings. Rather than opposing these motions, Cheek conceded that her \"claims under federal law may be procedurally, legally and/or factually insufficient\" and agreed that they should be dismissed with prejudice. In light of this concession, the federal court dismissed Cheek's suit, noting that she had the option to refile her state-law claims in a state court of general jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The State Suit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b65 In May 2015, Cheek commenced this action in Utah's Fifth District Court against the Defendants and several Cedar City and Iron County departments and employees. In her complaint, she reasserted two of her three unnecessary rigor claims, this time narrowing the scope of her suit to the allegations that the Defendants had illegally compelled her to provide a urine sample and that\n   they had failed to prevent her sexual assault. After filing her complaint, Cheek attempted to effect service on the Defendants, with, as it turns out, only mixed success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b66 In October 2015, the Defendants filed motions to dismiss. Cedar City argued that Cheek's claims against it should be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds because she had failed to file a notice of claim prior to commencing her action, in accordance with the Governmental Immunity Act of Utah. Garrett, for his part, argued that Cheek's claims against him were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Finally, Iron County argued that the state district court had not effectively exerted jurisdiction over the county because Cheek did not serve the summons and complaint on the County Clerk, as required by rule 4 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Instead, she had served the County Recorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b67 The state district court granted Cedar City's motion in November 2015, and it granted Garrett's and Iron County's motions several months later in a bifurcated order. In its first \"partial\" order, entered in July 2016, the court dismissed all Iron County departments, as they are not separate legal entities and cannot be sued. The court also dismissed all employees named in the suit, with the exception of Garrett, explaining that Cheek had voluntarily relinquished her claims against them during the hearing on Iron County's motion. The court then entered its second order in August 2016, wherein it dismissed Cheek's claims against Garrett with prejudice and her claims against Iron County without prejudice. On appeal, Cheek concedes that all of her claims were time-barred by the time the court ruled on Iron County's motion, meaning that, if it stands, the court's second order effectively put an end to her suit. Cheek now appeals the district court's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 Cheek presents three issues for our review. In her opening brief, Cheek ascribes error to the state district court's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of her suit against Cedar City. The court's decision should be reversed, she argues, because it rested on the incorrect premise that her unnecessary rigor claims were subject to the notice-of-claim provisions of Utah's Governmental Immunity Act. Rather than contesting this point, Cedar City concedes that a plaintiff's right to assert an unnecessary rigor claim is not subject to the Governmental Immunity Act and argues that we should affirm on mootness grounds instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Accordingly, the first issue presented for our review becomes this: To successfully assert an unnecessary rigor claim against a governmental employer, must a plaintiff name, as a party to the action, the individual employee whose conduct gave rise to the claim? If so, Cedar City argues, then the district court's errant jurisdictional determination is mooted by the district court's July 2016 order, in which it dismissed all of Cheek's claims against Cedar City and Iron County employees with prejudice. Whether a plaintiff has successfully stated a prima facie claim for relief is a question of law, which we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Handy v. Union Pac.

App. 1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 The second issue for our review is whether the state district court erred in concluding that Cheek's claims against Garrett were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. \"Whether a claim is barred by res judicata is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Gillmor v.

Cedar City\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 We begin by addressing Cedar City's mootness argument. As we briefly explained above, Cedar City concedes that the district court erred in determining that it did not have jurisdiction over Cheek's unnecessary rigor claims against it. Nevertheless, the City contends that the jurisdictional issue was mooted by the court's July 2016 order. In that order, which Cheek has not challenged on appeal, the court dismissed with prejudice Cheek's claims against every Cedar City employee named as a defendant in the complaint. Cedar City contends that this is fatal to Cheek's suit against it because an unnecessary rigor claimant proceeding against a governmental employer must, in order to survive a motion to dismiss, name as a defendant the particular employee who subjected her to unnecessary rigor. Because we see no basis for this purported requirement in the law, we reject Cedar City's mootness argument and reverse the district court's decision dismissing the City from the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 As an initial matter, we note that we will decline to reach the issue of whether the district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of a suit if we determine that the issue has become moot on appeal. In general, \"subject matter jurisdiction goes to the heart of a court's authority to hear a case,\" and as such, \"it is not subject to waiver and may be raised at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    In re adoption of Baby E.Z.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    2011 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    266 P.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But \"[w]e refrain from adjudicating issues when the underlying case is moot,\"\n   <em>\n    Burkett v.

Thus, we have echoed our Supreme Court in stating that \"where any determination an appellate court might make regarding a lower court's jurisdiction will not affect the rights of the parties in relation to any issues other than those ... already declared moot, the issue of jurisdiction is also moot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984330\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/272/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (omission in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 Cedar City has not persuaded us that Cheek is required to name a City employee\n   <em>\n    as a party\n   </em>\n   in order to proceed with her suit. The City maintains that our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bott v. Deland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10328233\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/922/732/\">\n    922 P.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1996),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spackman v. Board of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106892\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/533/\">\n    2000 UT 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106892\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/533/\">\n    16 P.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , stands for the proposition that a plaintiff cannot maintain an unnecessary rigor action against a governmental employer unless she names as a defendant the governmental employee who she believes is responsible for her injuries. In support, the City relies on the following language from the Court's decision: \"[A] prisoner may not recover damages\" against the government under the unnecessary rigor provision \"unless he shows that his injury was caused by a prison employee who acted with deliberate indifference or inflicted unnecessary abuse upon him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 740. But we do not read this language to mean that an unnecessary rigor claimant cannot proceed against a governmental entity without naming one of its employees as a defendant in her lawsuit. Rather, it simply means that she may not hold a governmental entity liable for the torts of an individual without proving that the entity had the right to control that individual's conduct at the time of the tort. This requirement does not necessitate naming the individual tortfeasor as a party to the suit-only that the responsible employee or employees be identified in due course. Indeed, in her complaint Cheek describes actions that would necessarily be attributable to individual city employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 Our interpretation of the Supreme Court's language in\n   <em>\n    Bott\n   </em>\n   accords with ordinary rules of agency law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mounteer v. Utah Power &amp; Light Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10379695\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/823/1055/#p1058\">\n    823 P.2d 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058 (Utah 1991) (holding that \"[c]ommon law rules of agency and respondeat superior\" govern an employer's liability for the alleged defamatory statements of an employee who\n   was not named as a defendant), and Cedar City gives us no compelling reason to believe that the Court sought to undercut this time-honored principle with its decision in\n   <em>\n    Bott\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we conclude that Cheek's claims against Cedar City are not moot. Therefore, given Cedar City's concession that the court's jurisdictional decision was erroneous, we reverse it and remand for such further proceedings as may now be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II. Garrett\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 Cheek maintains that the state district court erred in dismissing her unnecessary rigor claims against Garrett on res judicata grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The doctrine of res judicata embraces two distinct branches: claim preclusion and issue preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mack v.

Rather, she challenges only its determination that the federal district court's decision dismissing Garrett from the first action constituted a final judgment \"on the merits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that Cheek has failed to carry her burden of persuasion on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b618 Our Supreme Court has explained that the phrase \" '[o]n the merits' is a term of art\" referring to a judgment \"rendered only after a court has evaluated the relevant evidence and the parties' substantive arguments.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Further, \"[i]n the context of res judicata, 'merits' has been interpreted to mean real or substantial grounds of action or defense as distinguished from matters of practice, procedure, jurisdiction or form.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah State Dep't of Social Services v.

App. 1987). Pointing to these principles, Cheek maintains that the federal district court's order dismissing\n   Garrett from the federal action could not have been a decision on the merits because the court dismissed him from the action without ever directly addressing the substantive law of unnecessary rigor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b619 Despite the logic of her position, we disagree. In the courts of this state and the federal system alike, even though it does not involve the usual hallmarks of a resolution on the merits, a successful motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim results in a final judgment on the merits and \" 'is accorded res judicata effect.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994304\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/194/\">\n    2009 UT 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994304\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/194/\">\n    221 P.3d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    FDIC v.

Utah 1990) ). Cheek does not address\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   except to say that Garrett was not dismissed on a motion for failure to state a claim and that \"not all rulings on a motion to dismiss are on the merits.\" But both the state district court and Iron County treat Garrett's federal court motion to dismiss as one for failure to state a claim, and Cheek has not included the motion in the record on appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or otherwise shown that Garrett moved under a different rule. Accordingly, Cheek has failed to persuade us that\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   does not apply and that the state district court erred in concluding her state court action against Garrett was barred by reason of the preclusive effect of the federal court's dismissal of her federal complaint for failure to state an unnecessary rigor claim against Garrett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   III. Iron County\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b620 Cheek also maintains that the state district court erred in determining that it did not have personal jurisdiction over Iron County as a result of her defective service of process. While conceding that her service upon the County Recorder did not satisfy rule 4(d) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1)(G) (\"Upon a county, [personal service must be made] by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint ... to the\n   <em>\n    county clerk\n   </em>\n   [.]\") (emphasis added), she maintains that the court exerted jurisdiction over Iron County all the same by operation of the now defunct rule 4(b)(ii). Again, we conclude that Cheek has failed to carry her burden of persuasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b621 When the district court entered its order dismissing Iron County from the action, rule 4(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure provided that, \"[i]n any action brought against two or more defendants on which service has been timely obtained upon one of them, (A) the plaintiff may proceed against those served, and (B) the others may be served or appear\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   at any time prior to trial.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 4(b)(ii) (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cheek contends that the court's decision to dismiss Iron County from the action was premature under this rule because the sufficiency of her service upon the other Defendants is undisputed, and the court rendered its decision prior to the trial stage. In other words, given that the other Defendants had been properly served, Cheek argues that Iron County was not permitted to move for dismissal on defective service grounds until the first day of trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b622 Cheek concedes, however, that her argument conflicts with our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Sunrise Title Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286908\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1163/\">\n    2004 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286908\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1163/\">\n    84 P.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, although the plaintiff named three defendants in his complaint, he did not properly serve the third defendant until the first two had already been dismissed from the action \"with prejudice and on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. For that reason, the district court determined that the plaintiff could not seek shelter under rule 4(b)(ii) and was therefore subject to the ordinary 120-day timeframe for effecting service following the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

In fact, the entirety of her argument is limited to a single, three-sentence paragraph, which takes up not even one half of one page of her opening brief. Of course, the strength of an appellant's argument does not necessarily increase in proportion with its length. Yet here, given that Cheek's scant argument contains neither reasons nor legal citations in support of her position, there can be no question that Cheek's argument is \"so lacking as to shift the burden of research and argument to the reviewing court.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983885\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/273/385/\">\n    2012 UT App 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983885\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/273/385/\">\n    273 P.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b626 Further, we observe that the persuasiveness of Cheek's basic position is far from obvious. In fact, there is nothing in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   suggesting that the scope of its holding is\n   limited to cases in which all served defendants have been\n   <em>\n    properly\n   </em>\n   dismissed. On the contrary, the Court expressly held that rule 4(b)(ii) did not apply whenever the served defendants had been \"formally dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286908\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1163/\">\n    2004 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286908\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/84/1163/\">\n    84 P.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the reasoning adduced by the Court in support of its holding seems to suggest that the propriety of the district court's decision dismissing one defendant is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a salient consideration when evaluating the effect of the plaintiff's failure to serve another defendant. In explaining its decision, the court began by emphasizing that \"court rules dictate that plaintiffs pursue their claims in an expeditious manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. It then proceeded to quote with approval the following language from the Washington Supreme Court: \" 'A plaintiff who fails to serve each defendant risks losing the right to proceed against unserved defendants if the served defendant is dismissed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (brackets omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sidis v.

No mention was made of the dismissal having to be proper in an absolute sense. And because predicating the applicability of rule 4(b)(ii) upon the result of a later appeal would most certainly not further the goal of encouraging the expeditious resolution of claims, it is logical to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   applies regardless of whether the district court's decision dismissing a served defendant is eventually affirmed or reversed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b627 Accordingly, Cheek has failed to persuade us that the\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   exception to rule 4(b)(ii) did not apply if a served defendant was dismissed improperly. We therefore affirm the court's decision that Cheek's defective service did not effectively bring Iron County under its jurisdiction and that Cheek could not avail herself of rule 4(b)(ii) 's protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's decisions dismissing Cedar City from the action but affirm its decision to dismiss Iron County and Garrett.
