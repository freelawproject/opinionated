Victim fled the facility on foot and wound up on the freeway, where Defendant picked her up. Defendant took Victim to the apartment he shared with his mother. That night, Defendant had nonconsensual sexual intercourse with Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The next day, Defendant drove Victim back to the healthcare facility, and Victim reported the incident to the facility's staff. Victim was then taken to Primary Children's Hospital, where a nurse performed a sexual assault examination. The nurse introduced herself to Victim \"as a nurse working with Safe and Healthy Families\" and stated that she \"would be asking [Victim] questions about why she was there and about her health history and then [the nurse] would also want to do a physical exam.\" When the nurse asked Victim why she was there, Victim \"said she had been raped four times.\" The nurse also asked Victim if she was having any pain or had any injuries, and Victim stated that \"she had a sore throat and that she had bruises on her neck, her stomach and her leg.\" The nurse treated Victim with an emergency contraceptive and with antibiotics for possible exposure to sexually transmitted infections that might result from \"penile penetration.\" \"[B]ased upon the information [she] got from [Victim] about ejaculation,\" the nurse took swabs from Victim's stomach, vaginal cavity and surrounding areas, and anus, and assembled a sexual assault kit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 A detective interviewed both Defendant and Victim. During his interview with Defendant, the detective explained to Defendant that Victim alleged he had raped her. Defendant denied having any sexual contact whatsoever with Victim. The detective collected a sample of Defendant's DNA via buccal swab-\"a method of collecting DNA by swabbing the interior surface of a person's cheek.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The detective took the swab and Victim's sexual assault kit to the state crime lab for processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 A forensic biologist tested Victim's swabs for seminal fluid and was able to \"identif[y] sperm on ... the vaginal swabs, anal swabs and stomach swabs.\" A DNA expert determined that Defendant's DNA matched the DNA found on Victim's swabs. The DNA expert later testified that the chances of an unrelated individual, randomly drawn from the population, matching the DNA profile \"turns out to be in Caucasians 1 in 44 sextillion, in blacks it would be 1 in 350 sextillion, and in southwestern Hispanics it would be one in 340 quintillion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The State initially charged Defendant with four counts of rape and one count of object rape, all first degree felonies, but later dropped one of the rape counts. At the preliminary hearing, Victim testified that she \"had lied when she claimed there had been any sexual conduct between her and Defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on Victim's preliminary hearing recantation, Defendant filed a motion pursuant to rule 412 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, seeking to admit evidence that Victim was truthful in saying she had \"not [been] raped this time because she had truthfully reported other rape incident[s] in the past.\" The trial court denied Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 During the pretrial conference, the prosecutor indicated that he had not been able to locate Victim, and the court continued the trial date to allow the State to subpoena additional witnesses. At the beginning of trial, when Victim failed to appear, the State informed the court that it intended to \"offer[ ] [Victim's] explanation as to what happened to her through Rule of Evidence 803(4), statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment.\" Specifically, the State asserted that it intended to call the nurse to testify about Victim's statements during the medical examination that she had been raped multiple times. Defense counsel objected, arguing that Victim did not make the statements to the nurse for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment and that his only opportunity to cross-examine Victim had been at the preliminary hearing. Defense counsel also indicated that he would not seek to admit Victim's preliminary hearing testimony. The trial court ruled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   to the extent the statements made by [Victim] to medical providers were provided for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, and those statements were related to medical diagnosis or treatment, then those statements carry the guarantee of trustworthiness and [are] entitled to this exception, and so ... to the extent that testimony fits into that criteria, those statements will be allowed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Before closing arguments, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict on counts two through four (two counts of rape and one count of object rape). The trial court dismissed the object rape count but denied Defendant's motion on the two counts of rape. The jury convicted Defendant on one count of rape. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 Defendant makes several arguments on appeal. First, he contends that his \"rights to cross-examination and to present a complete defense [were] abridged when the [trial] court denied his Rule 412 motion seeking admission of rebuttal evidence to show that [Victim] knew how to report a true rape to the authorities.\" \"We review the trial court's underlying evidentiary determinations for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Utah Rule of Evidence 412\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Defendant contends that \"[t]he court denied [him] the right to present a complete defense by not allowing him to present evidence of [Victim's] prior rape incidents to rebut the State's theory and show that [Victim] knew how to report a true rape.\" According to Defendant, admission of Victim's prior rape accusations would have illustrated that Victim \"had truthfully reported other rape incidents in the past\" and that she \"was thus truthful when she said [at the preliminary hearing that] she was not raped this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 In a criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct, rule 412 of the Utah Rules of Evidence prohibits admission of \"evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior\" or \"evidence offered to prove a victim's sexual predisposition.\" Utah R. Evid. 412(a). Defendant concedes that \"the evidence [he] sought to introduce is generally barred under Rule 412,\" but he asserts that \"evidence of [Victim's] other rape incidents/cases should have been admitted under the exception allowing admission if excluding such would infringe the right to effective cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344245\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/404/53/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 412(b)(3) (\"The court may admit the following evidence if the evidence is otherwise admissible under these rules: ... (3) evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's constitutional rights.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 The trial court determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [e]vidence of [Victim's] prior victimization and her knowledge of how to report a rape is simply not relevant ... as to whether the Defendant raped her under the facts of this matter. ... The evidence of [Victim's] prior sexual activity and/or victimization simply does not make it less probable or more probable that [Defendant] raped or had sexual intercourse with her in the instant matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court further determined that under rule 403 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, \"the probative value of [Victim's] prior sexual conduct and reporting of sexual assault is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to [Victim] and the state, and has a great tendency to confuse and mislead the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 According to Defendant, he \"anticipated rebutting the State at trial with evidence showing that [Victim] truthfully reported her other rape incidents to the authorities, and thus was not lying at the preliminary hearing when she said [Defendant] did not rape her.\" \"Conversely, should [Victim] revert at trial to her out-of-court story, [Defendant] would not have needed the evidence to be able to mount a complete defense because he could have impeached [Victim] with her preliminary hearing testimony and further damaged her already weakened credibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 The State correctly observes that Victim's preliminary hearing testimony-that she \"had lied when she claimed there had been any sexual conduct between her and Defendant\"-did not come in at trial. Thus, according to the State, \"any error in omitting the evidence of [Victim's] prior rape accusations under Rule 412 was harmless because the jury never heard [Victim's] preliminary hearing recantation.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 At the beginning of trial, the State asserted that it planned to introduce evidence of Victim's medical examination and her statements to the nurse. The State also noted that it understood that the defense planned to offer the statement Victim made at the preliminary hearing that \"there was no sexual contact at all.\" The State informed the court that it would not object to the admission of Victim's preliminary hearing statement. The State further asserted, however, that \"once that evidence is in, Rule 806 of the Utah Rules of Evidence allows us to ask the officer who interviewed [Victim] at the time for additional details, that being a prior inconsistent statement with the statement made at the preliminary hearing. That occurred prior to any motivation to fabricate, thus meeting the Rule 806 exception.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 Defense counsel responded by discussing the admissibility of Victim's medical examination and her statements to the nurse, and he stated that \"we'd be more than happy to not mention what happened at the preliminary hearing in order to prevent these random statements [from] being brought in that we have no chance to challenge.\" The trial court clarified, \"So you do not anticipate utilizing the preliminary hearing for your purposes ....\" Defense counsel replied, \"No, I think we can skip over that.\" The court stated, \"And if that changes we can probably further address that later.\" Despite the fact that Victim's statements to the nurse were later introduced into evidence, defense counsel did not seek to introduce Victim's preliminary hearing testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Even if we assume, without deciding, that the exclusion of the evidence of Victim's prior rape accusations violated Defendant's constitutional rights, we conclude that the exclusion of that evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As mentioned,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b616, Defendant's trial strategy was to use Victim's prior rape accusations, in conjunction with her preliminary hearing testimony recantation, to demonstrate that Victim \"truthfully reported her other rape incidents to the authorities, and thus was not lying at the preliminary hearing when she said [Defendant] did not rape her.\" However, given that defense counsel did not seek to admit Victim's preliminary hearing testimony after all, there was no need for defense counsel to use the evidence of Victim's prior rape accusations to bolster her credibility and demonstrate that she was telling the truth at the preliminary hearing; the jury simply never heard Victim's preliminary hearing recantation. Moreover, we agree with the State that the trial court's exclusion of the rule 412 evidence did not prevent Defendant from seeking to admit her preliminary hearing rape recantation. Indeed, even without the rule 412 evidence, the evidence of Victim's preliminary hearing recantation might well have been helpful to Defendant's case, although defense counsel had to consider whether the benefit of the recantation would be outweighed by the detective's being then able to recount Victim's detailed account of the rapes the day following the incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 In sum, we conclude that any error in omitting the evidence of Victim's prior rape accusations was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II.

Evid. 801(c). Nevertheless, we conclude that the evidence was admissible under rule 803(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b630 The record demonstrates that Victim's statements to the nurse were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. The nurse testified that she introduced herself to Victim \"as a nurse working with Safe and Healthy Families\" and that she told Victim that she \"would be asking her questions about why [Victim] was there and about [Victim's] health history and then [she] would also want to do a physical exam.\" The nurse stated that Victim appeared to understand how the nurse was going to \"treat her or examine her.\" The nurse stated that asking Victim \"why she's there\" was important for the physical exam and knowing \"what parts of the body we want to examine. And then also if they are complaining of a rape or sexual assault, we would definitely want to examine closely the genitals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b631 The nurse testified that Victim reported that \"she had been raped four times.\" The nurse then asked Victim \"if she was having any pain or if she had any injuries or if she was bleeding,\" and Victim stated that she \"had a sore throat and that she had bruises on her neck, her stomach and her leg.\" Victim also stated that \"she had been touched on different parts of her body\" and that \"her arms were held down and that she was choked.\" The nurse stated that the information from Victim helped her know \"where to look when [she] did the physical examination\": \"We'd want to make sure and examine her neck closely for any trauma there and then also assess her arms to see if there was anything, ... bruises, any injuries to the bones or anything like that.\" The nurse further testified that, \"because there was ejaculation into the vagina,\" she gave Victim an emergency contraceptive. In addition, upon \"seeing [a] history of penile penetration,\" the nurse gave Victim antibiotics \"to treat for possible exposure to Chlamydia and Gonorrhea.\" The nurse took swabs from Victim's stomach, vaginal cavity and surrounding areas, and anus based on Victim's report regarding ejaculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b632 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it admitted Victim's statements to the nurse under rule 803(4). Victim's statements suggest they were made for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis, and the statements allowed the nurse to address the possibility of injuries, pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 Defendant also asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses was violated by the nurse's testimony.

Johnson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n     2017 UT 76\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 29,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n     416 P.3d 443\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quotation simplified). The doctrine applies \"where a rare procedural anomaly has either prevented an appellant from preserving an issue or excuses a failure to do so.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quotation simplified). Although it is unclear, Defendant's reference to the State's \"invited error\" appears to be an attempt to assert a prosecutorial misconduct claim. Either way, Defendant provides no analysis as to why an error of this type constitutes an exceptional circumstance. Accordingly, we decline to address this assertion further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Before closing arguments, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict on counts two (rape), three (rape), and four (object rape), but not count one (rape). The State conceded to the directed verdict on count four, and the trial court dismissed that count. With regard to counts two and three, defense counsel argued that \"there's been evidence supporting a possible finding of one count [of rape] but nothing to suggest there were multiple counts.\" The trial court ultimately denied Defendant's motion for directed verdict on counts two and three and submitted the three counts of rape to the jury. On appeal, Defendant observes that defense counsel moved for directed verdicts on counts two through four, and he acknowledges that \"it very well may be that counsel believed it would be futile to move for dismissal on Count 1.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Defendant also asserts that we should address this issue under the exceptional-circumstances exception to the preservation rule. Again, this exception applies \"where a rare procedural anomaly has either prevented an appellant from preserving an issue or excuses a failure to do so.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quotation simplified). Defendant has failed to present any rare procedural anomaly or other exceptional circumstance that might justify his failure to preserve his sufficiency of the evidence argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Accordingly, we decline to address this argument further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
