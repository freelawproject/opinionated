Defendant argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by proposing erroneous jury instructions. Because Defendant has not demonstrated that any such errors were prejudicial, we affirm his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Two Murray City detectives, driving in unmarked police vehicles, initiated a traffic stop after Defendant followed the car in front of him too closely and failed to use his turn signal for at least two seconds before changing lanes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Responding to the emergency lights and siren of the first detective's vehicle, Defendant pulled over. The first detective approached the driver's side of Defendant's vehicle while the second detective positioned himself at the passenger side. Both detectives were dressed in plain clothes, but the second detective had a badge visibly hanging from his neck on a lanyard. The first detective explained why they pulled Defendant over and asked Defendant for his license, registration, and proof of insurance, which Defendant immediately provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 While the first detective returned to his vehicle to check Defendant's license, a sergeant arrived at the scene, also in plain\n   clothes and wearing his badge on a lanyard around his neck. The sergeant had called Defendant's parole officer, leaving a message that officers intended to search Defendant's vehicle. When he informed Defendant of his intent to search the vehicle pursuant to Defendant's parole agreement, Defendant disagreed with the officers on whether they had the authority to do so, insisting that only his parole officer could conduct the search. The sergeant then attempted to coax Defendant out of the vehicle, to no avail. During the coaxing, Defendant asked the sergeant, \"[W]ho are you, like what's your name?\" Defendant testified at trial that the sergeant told him his name and that he worked for Murray City Police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 During the sergeant's attempts to get Defendant to exit his vehicle, Defendant repeatedly revved the engine and reached for the gearshift knob. In a final attempt to get Defendant to exit the vehicle, the sergeant placed his hands on Defendant's left hand and shoulder. The first detective returned to Defendant's vehicle and reached over to try and turn off the ignition, but Defendant put the car into drive and \"accelerated at a high rate of speed,\" causing the first detective to grab hold of the steering wheel, forcing the car toward the curb. The driver's side door shut on the sergeant and the first detective, causing them to be dragged along the road. The officers yelled for Defendant to stop, but Defendant continued driving until he went up and over the curb. Dislodged from the car due to the impact with the curb, the first detective's ankle hit the curb and his chest hit the rear door of the vehicle, and both the sergeant and the first detective fell under the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Defendant drove away from the scene. He left his car in a nearby parking lot and departed on foot. He did not call 911 to report that he had been accosted by persons of questionable legitimacy. Instead, he made his way to a friend's house and stayed there for a few days. He was arrested at his home four days after the incident and charged with two counts of assault on a peace officer, a second degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-102.4\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-102.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (LexisNexis 2017), and one count of failure to respond to an officer's signal to stop, a third degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-102.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-6a-210(1)(b)(i) (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At trial, Defendant's counsel proposed jury instructions on the elements of both crimes.

And when asked for his license, registration, and insurance, he produced his documentation without question because he believed he was being given a ticket for a traffic violation. Although Defendant challenges the testimony of the officers that they were wearing badges and had identified themselves upon approaching Defendant in his vehicle, Defendant testified that he specifically asked the sergeant who he was and that the sergeant replied that he was with Murray City Police. And the sergeant told Defendant that, following consultation with his parole officer, whom the sergeant named, Defendant's vehicle would be searched pursuant to his parole agreement-Defendant's parole status and the name of his parole officer being the type of information that would be available to law enforcement officers but not to random mischief makers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 Second, Defendant's behavior after fleeing the scene indicates that he knew he had been stopped by police officers. Defendant did not return home for four days, and during this time, he made no effort to report the incident and complain that he had been stopped by vigilantes, pranksters, or imposters posing as police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 It is exceedingly unlikely that based on the evidence before it, a properly instructed jury would have reasonably doubted whether Defendant knew that the two detectives and their sergeant were police officers. Because there is not a substantial possibility that a different verdict would have resulted from jury instructions containing the necessary mental states for each count, we conclude that Defendant did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the challenged jury instructions.

The court's decision to give this instruction rested on Defendant's testimony that \"he had serious questions about whether [the men] were police officers.\" But the Utah Supreme Court stated in\n    <em>\n     State v.

Although the district court allowed the self-defense instruction, this is of limited relevance for us, given the lower standard applicable to giving jury instructions when requested. We instead look beyond Defendant's testimony to the totality of the evidence to determine whether there was a substantial likelihood of a different outcome had a proper elements instruction been given.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
