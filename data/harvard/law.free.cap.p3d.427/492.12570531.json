Albiston's driver license and vehicle registration for her failure to satisfy a judgment unrelated to owning or operating a motor vehicle. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Albiston signed an agreement with Design Academy, promising that she would pay tuition and related fees, and in return, Design Academy would provide her with the\n   2,000 educational hours then required by the State of Utah to become a licensed cosmetologist. Less than six months later, Albiston withdrew from Design Academy. Shortly thereafter, Design Academy sent her a statement indicating what she owed under the agreement. Albiston did not pay any part of the balance due, and Design Academy filed a complaint against her to collect it. Albiston failed to answer the complaint or make an appearance, and Design Academy obtained a default judgment from which Albiston did not appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Albiston did not make any payments on the judgment. Two years after entry of the judgment, Design Academy filed a motion in the district court, requesting that, under section 511 of the Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Owners and Operators Act (the Act), Albiston's driver license and vehicle registration be suspended for failure to satisfy the judgment within 60 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -12a-511 (LexisNexis 2014). The district court denied the motion, explaining that to trigger the license and registration suspensions, the Act requires a judgment arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle and that the \"suspension of a license on an unsatisfied judgment applies only to judgments obtained under [the Act]\" and not to Design Academy's judgment premised on the breach of a cosmetology tuition contract. Design Academy appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Design Academy contends that the district court erred in interpreting \"judgment\" as defined in subsection 103(2) of the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-12a-103(2).

Reading the statute uncritically, Design Academy's position is sound. First, although the use of \"or\" runs the risk of creating an ambiguity in a statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage\n   </em>\n   639 (3d ed. 2011), here the Legislature's use of \"or\" between subsections 2(a) and 2(b) is clearly exclusive for the reason that a judgment cannot become final without an appeal and also be affirmed on appeal. And second, the organizational scheme of section 103(2) clearly states that the requirement that a cause of action \"aris[e] out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle\" is a qualifier of subsection 2(b) only-not a qualifier of both subsections 2(a) and 2(b). Because subsection 2(a) is exclusive of subsection 2(b), this qualifier would not be applicable to subsection 2(a), given the organizational scheme of section 103(2). As a result, a plain reading of the statute suggests that the holder of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   judgment that becomes final without appeal has the right to seek suspension of the judgment debtor's driver license and vehicle registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 Obviously, such an interpretation of \"judgment\" in light of the purpose of the Act and its relevant provisions results in an absurdity given that license and registration suspensions can result from final judgments that are affirmed on appeal only if they arise out of motor vehicle ownership, maintenance, or usage, while judgments that become final without an appeal can arise from all manner of cases, including divorce, mechanic's lien foreclosure, collection, defamation, or eviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 Viewed on its own terms, the statutory interpretation urged by Design Academy makes no sense. Why would the Legislature give more favored treatment to judgment debtors who appeal and lose than those who simply forgo an appeal? And why would the Legislature further burden a civil judgment debtor-who already will be dealing with appearances in supplemental proceedings, wage garnishments, and execution on personal and real property-with the added sanction of driver license and vehicle registration suspension\n   (unless the judgment debtor had the foresight to appeal even if there were no good grounds for appeal, thereby avoiding this added sanction)? And if, as Design Academy contends, this loss of driving and vehicle privileges applies to all judgments that go unappealed, why is there no mention of this civil sanction in the statutory provisions dealing with judgments and appeals? Instead, the provision Design Academy relies on is found in the\n   <em>\n    Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Owners and Operators Act\n   </em>\n   , and it seems absurd that the Legislature would vest unappealed civil judgments not related to the subject matter of the Act with the added burden of license and registration suspensions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 In sum, the punctuation of the statute is flawed, but the Legislature surely did not mean to enact a bizarre scheme that imposes license and registration suspension on those who appeal and lose\n   <em>\n    if and only if\n   </em>\n   the judgment is for damages \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -12a-103(2)(b)(i) (LexisNexis 2014), while imposing the same suspensions across the wide range of judgments, including those with no connection whatsoever to the \"ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , if the judgment becomes final without an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 This, quite clearly, is what the Legislature meant and how the provision should be read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Judgment\" means any judgment that is final by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) expiration without appeal of the time within which an appeal might have been perfected, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (b) final affirmation on appeal, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction of any state or of the United States,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   upon a cause of action for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We interpret the provision accordingly and uphold the district court's denial of Design Academy's motion to suspend Albiston's license and registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Albiston also failed to file a brief in this appeal later taken by Design Academy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    This doctrine is not to be confused with the absurd consequences canon, a different interpretative tool that resolves ambiguities in a statute when the \"statutory language lends itself to two alternative readings\" by selecting \"the reading that avoids absurd consequences.\"\n    <em>\n     Utley v.
