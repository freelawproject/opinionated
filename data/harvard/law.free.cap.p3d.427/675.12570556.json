PCC 5.14.230 allows the County to suspend or revoke the licenses issued to erotic dance studio operators, managers, and dancers if they violate or permit the violation of erotic dance studio regulations. PCC 5.14.250 provides criminal penalties for violating erotic dance studio regulations and states that managers on duty and erotic dance studio operators are strictly liable for violations of substantive regulations in chapter 5.14 PCC. The appellants do not challenge those substantive regulations, which primarily are contained in PCC 5.14.180 and .190.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The appellants argue that the sanction provisions constitute an unconstitutional prior restraint of erotic dance, which is protected expression, because the provisions impose strict liability for violations. They also argue that the sanction provisions violate due process for the same reason. Pierce County argues that Forbes and Richardson do not have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.230 and that none of the appellants have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that (1) the appellants have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.230, but they do not have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250 because no criminal penalties were imposed or threatened; (2) PCC 5.14.230 operates as a prior restraint of protected erotic dance but is not unconstitutional under article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution because it does not allow the imposition of sanctions based on strict liability; (3) PCC 5.14.230 is not unconstitutional under a First Amendment analysis for time, place, or manner restrictions; and (4) PCC 5.14.230 does not violate due process because it does not allow the imposition of sanctions based on strict liability. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's summary judgment order dismissing the appellants' complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the relevant times, each of the appellants held licenses issued under chapter 5.14 PCC. Forbes, doing business as Dreamgirls of Tacoma, LLC, is the licensee and operator of an erotic dance studio known as Dreamgirls at Fox's (Fox's). Ashley Richardson is a licensed manager at Fox's and Heather Blakeway is a licensed dancer at Fox's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Violations and Hearing Examiner Rulings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Between April and August 2014, the County conducted several licensing inspections and compliance checks at Fox's. The inspections revealed multiple violations of regulations in chapter 5.14 PCC. In August 2014, the auditor's office sent Forbes a notice and order to correct, which identified violations of PCC 5.14.110, .180, and .190 and explained how to correct them. The notice stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Failure of the establishment to comply with this order may result in further enforcement action being taken. Examples of enforcement may include: suspension of establishment license, revocation of establishment license, fines. Failure to comply with the compliance instructions contained in this order will constitute sufficient grounds for suspension or revocation of the license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 318. The notice did not at that time suspend Forbes's license to operate an erotic dance studio, impose any civil sanction for the violations, or impose or threaten a criminal penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Forbes appealed the notice and order to a county hearing examiner, who conducted a formal hearing and entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. After reviewing the allegations in detail, the hearing examiner found that the County proved the alleged violations by a preponderance of the evidence and denied Forbes's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Subsequently, the auditor's office conducted additional site visits at Fox's and observed violations of chapter 5.14 PCC. In\n   response to these alleged violations, the auditor's office sent both Richardson and Blakeway a notice and order of suspension. The notices stated that Blakeway was dancing off the platform, that a patron was seated too close to Blakeway while she was dancing on the platform, and that Richardson was present while those violations occurred. Richardson, as the manager at the time, was required to ensure compliance. The notices stated that both of their licenses would be suspended for 30 days, with the suspension effective immediately unless it was appealed. Neither notice imposed a criminal penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Both Richardson and Blakeway appealed to the hearing examiner, who conducted formal hearings and entered findings and conclusions on both appeals. The hearing examiner found that the County proved the alleged violations by a preponderance of the evidence, but modified the period of suspension to 15 days for Richardson and 10 days for Blakeway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Petition for Writ of Review and Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 Forbes, Richardson, and Blakeway all filed petitions for writs of review and complaints for injunction and declaratory relief against the County in superior court. Each petition alleged that substantial evidence did not support the hearing examiner's decision, that the hearing examiner made a legal error regarding application of strict liability, and that PCC 5.14.180, .190, .230, and .250 violated the Washington Constitution. The cases subsequently were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The superior court entered an order granting the County's motion and denying the appellants' motion. The court first considered the appellants' constitutional arguments and ruled, \"None of the challenged sections of Chapter 5.14 PCC, nor Chapter 5.14 PCC as a whole, violate the free speech or due process clauses of the Washington State Constitution.\" CP at 827. Regarding the appellants' petition for a writ of review, the court ruled that substantial evidence supported the hearing examiner's decisions. On that basis, the court affirmed the hearing examiner's decisions regarding Forbes, Richardson, and Blakeway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The appellants sought direct review in the Supreme Court of the summary judgment order. The Supreme Court ordered that the case be transferred to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

Because our review is de novo, we do not rely on or give deference to the superior court's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2. Chapter 5.14 PCC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 The appellants each held licenses issued pursuant to chapter 5.14 PCC, which relates to the licensing and regulation of the adult entertainment industry in Pierce County. Chapter 5.14 PCC applies a licensing scheme to \"erotic dance studios\" and imposes substantive requirements on erotic dance studio operator, studio manager, and dancer licensees. The chapter outlines the process for persons to apply for and receive an erotic dance studio license, PCC 5.14.030-.090, and requires all managers and dancers to obtain licenses. PCC 5.14.100, .110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 PCC 5.14.180 imposes requirements on managers, and states that \"[t]he manager shall be responsible for ensuring\" that both the studio and the dancers comply with restrictions in PCC 5.14.190. PCC 5.14.180(D), (E). PCC 5.14.190 designates a number of unlawful acts, including any dancing other than on an 18-inch platform that is 10 feet from the nearest patron, PCC 5.14.190(H),\n   touching between patrons and dancers, PCC 5.14.190(I), (J), and dancers exposing themselves except on the platform. PCC 5.14.190(H), (I), (J), (M).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 PCC 5.14.230(A) allows the county auditor to revoke or suspend the license of an erotic dance studio operator if the licensee has \"violated or permitted violation\" of any of the chapter's provisions. PCC 5.14.230(B) applies the same provision to managers and dancers. In addition, PCC 5.14.250 states that a person, firm, or corporation that violates any of the chapter's provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a $1,000 fine or 90 days imprisonment. PCC 5.14.250 states that the manager on duty or erotic dance studio operator \"shall be held strictly liable for any violation of the requirements set forth in PCC 5.14.180 and/or 5.14.190.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17 The process for appealing a decision by the auditor is set out in PCC 5.02.120. A licensee has the right to appeal a decision by submitting a written notice of appeal and paying a fee within 10 days of the decision. PCC 5.02.120(A). The appeal must be heard within 90 days by a hearing examiner. PCC 5.02.120(B). On appeal, the County bears the burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the standards for suspending or revoking a license have been met. PCC 5.02.120(E). Filing a timely notice of appeal stays the auditor's decision until a final decision by the hearing examiner. PCC 5.02.120(C). The hearing examiner's decision is final unless a writ of review is filed in the superior court within 20 days from the decision. PCC 5.02.120(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 This court upheld several challenged portions of chapter 5.14 PCC in\n   <em>\n    DCR, Inc. v.

APPELLANTS' STANDING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 As an initial matter, the County challenges the appellants' standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the County argues that Forbes and Richardson lack standing to challenge PCC 5.14.230 because, unlike Blakeway, they were not personally engaged in protected expression. Second, the County suggests that the appellants lack standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250 because no criminal penalty was assessed against them under that provision. We hold that Forbes and Richardson have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.230, but that the appellants lack standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1.

Standing to Challenge PCC 5.14.230\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 Here, Richardson has standing to challenge PCC 5.14.230(B) because her license was suspended under that provision. The statute has adversely affected her and she has a real interest in challenging its validity.\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"425268\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/143/12/#p18\">\n    143 Wash.2d at 18-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20P.3d%20523\">\n    18 P.3d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 Similarly, the suspension of Richardson's and Blakeway's licenses under PCC 5.14.230(B) adversely affected Forbes because his employees were not available to manage and dance at his erotic dance studio. The Ninth Circuit addressed the same issue in\n   <em>\n    Clark v. City of Lakewood\n   </em>\n   , and held that the owner of an adult cabaret suffered an injury in fact regarding a regulation placing limitations on issuing licenses for his employees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500781\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/996/#p1010\">\n    259 F.3d 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010-11 (2001). The court stated that the owner could not operate his business without licensed employees, and therefore he would be unable to engage in expressive activity if the City did not license his employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500781\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/996/#p1010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500781\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/996/#p1010\">\n    at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reason, Forbes has standing to challenge the suspensions of his employees' licenses under PCC 5.14.230(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 A different analysis applies for Forbes's challenge to PCC 5.14.230(A), which allows sanctions to be imposed against him as the licensee of the erotic dance studio. Unlike Richardson, Forbes's license has not been revoked or suspended under PCC 5.14.230(A). The County's notice and order to correct listed only a series of violations identified at Fox's, but did not impose any sanction. The record does not show that a sanction was imposed at a later time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 However, the County's notice and order describes observed violations of PCC 5.14.180 and .190 and directs that Forbes correct those violations. The order further states that Forbes's failure to comply with the order may result in further enforcement action being taken, including suspension or revocation of his license. And the order states that failure to comply will constitute sufficient grounds for license suspension or revocation. Although the order does not reference PCC 5.14.230(A), that provision provides the only authority for the County to impose those sanctions. As a result, under the specific facts of this case PCC 5.14.230(A) adversely affected Forbes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 We hold that both Forbes and Richardson have standing to challenge the constitutionality of PCC 5.14.230(B) and that Forbes has standing to challenge the constitutionality of PCC 5.14.230(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3. Standing to Challenge PCC 5.14.250\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 The County suggests that the appellants do not have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 Here, no criminal penalties were assessed under PCC 5.14.250 against any of the appellants. Therefore, PCC 5.14.250 has not adversely affected them. The appellants do not argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28 Instead, the appellants argue that they have standing to challenge PCC 5.14.250 because they intend to engage in constitutionally protected conduct in the future and there is a credible threat of prosecution. They cite two Supreme Court cases:\n   <em>\n    Susan B. Anthony List v.

First, the appellants have not demonstrated a\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   threat to impose a criminal\n   penalty. Forbes's notice and order to correct states that failure to comply may result in further enforcement action, but concludes only that \"[f]ailure to comply with the compliance instructions ... will constitute sufficient grounds for\n   <em>\n    the suspension or revocation of the license\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 318 (emphasis added). The letter references a fine as an example of enforcement, but does not indicate any intent to impose criminal penalties.

The court noted that under federal law, laws affecting an operator's license rather than a dancer's license may not constitute prior restraint under article I, section 5.\n   <em>\n    Ino Ino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498215\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/132/103/#p116\">\n    132 Wash.2d at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=937%20P.2d%20154\">\n    937 P.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However,\n   <em>\n    Ino Ino\n   </em>\n   makes it clear that the suspension of operator and manager licenses implicates article I, section 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 54 Beyond these specific requirements, the extent of protection under article I, section 5 of erotic dance in the context of suspension of erotic dance licenses must be developed on a case-by-case basis. We need not address the parameters of this protection here because the appellants argue only that the suspension of licenses based on strict liability violates article I, section 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2. No Strict Liability Under PCC 5.14.230\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 55 The appellants argue that (1) PCC 5.14.230 allows the County to suspend the licenses of erotic dance studio operators and managers based on strict liability, and (2) article I, section 5 prohibits suspending erotic dance licenses on the basis of strict liability. We hold that PCC 5.14.230 does not allow the County to suspend the licenses of erotic dance studio operators, managers, and dancers based on strict liability. Therefore, PCC 5.14.230 does not violate article I, section 5 on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   a.

Strict Liability Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 57 PCC 5.14.230(A) applies to erotic dance studio operators and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The Auditor shall revoke or suspend, for a specified period of not more than one year, any erotic dance studio license if he/she determines that the licensee or applicant has: made a materially false statement in the application for a license which the applicant knows to be false; or violated\n   <em>\n    or permitted violation\n   </em>\n   of any provisions of this Chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (Emphasis added). PCC 5.14.230(B) provides the same revocation or suspension sanction to managers and dancers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The Auditor shall revoke or suspend, for a specified period of not more than one year, any dancer/manager license if he/she determines that the licensee or applicant has: made a materially false statement in the application for a license which the applicant knows to be false; or violated\n   <em>\n    or permitted violation\n   </em>\n   of any provisions of this Chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 58 The appellants argue that these provisions allow for suspension of an erotic dance\n   studio operator's or manager's license arising from a dancer's violation of PCC 5.14.190 based on strict liability, even in the absence of some fault by the operator or manager. The appellants claim that in the absence of a requirement that the operator or manager knew or should have known of the violation, PCC 5.14.230 constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 59 A manager can violate PCC 5.14.180(D) and (E) and be subject to sanctions under PCC 5.14.230 by not \"ensuring\" that the studio or the dancers comply with the restrictions in PCC 5.14.190. This provision does not involve strict liability. A failure to ensure compliance necessarily involves some fault by the manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 60 We also interpret PCC 5.14.230 as requiring some fault before an erotic dance studio operator or manager can be sanctioned. Under PCC 5.14.230, an operator or a manager can be subject to sanctions by \"permitting\" a violation of one of the erotic dance studio regulations. But \"permitting\" does not involve strict liability. One dictionary definition of \"permit\" is to \"consent to expressly or formally.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1683 (2002). Under this definition, an operator or manager can permit-consent to-an activity when he or she knows that the activity is occurring and fails to take steps to stop that activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 61 Another dictionary definition of \"permit\" is to \"make possible\" or to \"give an opportunity.\" WEBSTER'S at 1683. Under this definition, an operator or manager can permit-make possible-an activity by not taking steps before the activity occurs to prevent that activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 62 Under either definition, operators and managers can be subject to sanctions under PCC 5.14.230 only if their conduct involves some fault. As a result, we hold that PCC 5.14.230 does not allow the imposition of sanctions in the absence of a finding of fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 63 The same analysis applies with respect to dancers' liability for patrons' actions. PCC 5.14.190 specifically prohibits certain unlawful actions by patrons. For example, a patron cannot pay or give any gratuity directly to any dancer. PCC 5.14.190(K). A dancer's license could be revoked or suspended based on this provision only if the dancer\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   the violation to occur, requiring the dancer to have some fault regarding the actions of patrons. Therefore, as with operators and managers, dancers are not strictly liable for the prohibited actions of patrons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 64 Because PCC 5.14.230 does not allow for the suspension of a license based on strict liability, we hold that PCC 5.14.230 does not violate article I, section 5 on that basis. Because the appellants' prior restraint claim is based only on its argument that PCC 5.14.230 imposes strict liability, we reject the appellants' challenge to PCC 5.14.230 based on article I, section 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   D. INAPPLICABILITY OF TIME, PLACE, AND MANNER RESTRICTIONS ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 65 The appellants argue that PCC 5.14.230 is unconstitutional under the First Amendment analysis used to determine the constitutionality of time, place, and manner restrictions on protected expression. Appellants apparently concede that PCC 5.14.230 is not a time, place, and manner restriction, but suggest that we apply the time, place, and manner analysis to the prior restraint imposed under PCC 5.14.230. We decline to apply this analysis to PCC 5.14.230.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 66 A time, place, or manner restriction on speech or expression is one that does not prohibit expression but imposes temporal or geographic limitations.\n   <em>\n    Ino Ino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498215\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/132/103/#p116\">\n    132 Wash.2d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=937%20P.2d%20154\">\n    937 P.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The provision does not place any substantive limits on how a license holder may engage in any form of expression. Instead, PCC 5.14.230 provides for the sanctions the County may impose if an operator, manager, or\n   dancer violates requirements contained in other sections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 68 The appellants provide no compelling reason to apply the time, place, or manner analysis in a prior restraint context. And neither\n   <em>\n    JJR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ino Ino\n   </em>\n   , nor any other case has applied this analysis to evaluate a prior restraint. Accordingly, we hold that the analysis for time, place, and manner restrictions under the First Amendment is inapplicable to PCC 5.14.230.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   E. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PCC 5.14.230-DUE PROCESS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b6 69 Forbes argues that PCC 5.14.230 violates article I, section 3, the due process provision of the Washington Constitution, because it imposes strict liability on erotic dance studio operators, managers, and dancers for violations of erotic dance studio regulations. As discussed above, PCC 5.14.230 does not allow the imposition of sanctions based on strict liability. Therefore, we reject the appellants' due process challenge on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 70 We affirm the trial court's summary judgment order dismissing the appellants' complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   SUTTON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   PRICE, J.
