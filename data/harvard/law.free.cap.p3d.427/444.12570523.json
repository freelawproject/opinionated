McConkie, David W. Read, and Strong &amp; Hanni PC (collectively, Law Firm). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Kirkham retained Law Firm to represent her from 2007 to 2012 in post-divorce proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2011, Kirkham's ex-husband filed a petition to modify child support, seeking, among other things, a tax exemption for the parties' only remaining\n   minor child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Law Firm did not file a counterpetition in response. Subsequent disagreements emerged between Kirkham and Law Firm over the tax exemption issue, prompting Law Firm to withdraw as counsel. Kirkham continued pro se, and at the conclusion of a trial, the district court granted her ex-husband's petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Widdison v. Widdison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6910656\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/1106/\">\n    2014 UT App 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6910656\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/336/1106/\">\n    336 P.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Kirkham brought suit against Law Firm for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract for failing to file a counterpetition for increased child support. Both sides in the malpractice action were provided a schedule of due dates, requiring the disclosure of expert witnesses by March 25, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 26(a)(4)(A) (requiring disclosure of any witness \"who is retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony\"). Law Firm timely disclosed that it intended to use an expert witness to testify that Law Firm did not breach any standard of care or fiduciary duty or cause any damages to Kirkham for failure to file a counterpetition. Kirkham did not disclose any expert witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After the expert witness deadline passed, Law Firm moved for summary judgment, arguing that Kirkham's claims should be dismissed for failure to present expert testimony as evidence that Law Firm breached the standard of care. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Law Firm, determining that Kirkham failed to satisfy her burden of proof by not designating an expert witness to prove the essential elements of her legal malpractice claims. Kirkham appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Kirkham contends that the district court improperly awarded summary judgment to Law Firm. \"Summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Corp. v.

Because Law Firm made the requisite initial showing, Kirkham needed to present sufficient evidence on each element of her negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims to survive summary judgment-including the attorney standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick v.

App. 1993) (negligence elements). The district court determined that, by failing \"to present expert testimony to prove the applicable standards of conduct, breach and causation,\" Kirkham did not satisfy her evidentiary burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 While expert testimony is not necessary in all cases, it is required \"where the average person has little understanding of the duties owed by particular trades or professions,\" including \"duties owed by practicing attorneys to their clients, especially in cases involving complex and involved allegations of malpractice.\"\n   <em>\n    Preston &amp; Chambers, PC v.

Accordingly, the district court determined that \"whether a claim for child support is a compulsory counterclaim under rule 13\" that must have been filed to satisfy the applicable standard of care would not be \"so obvious\" to the average person, including those sitting on the jury in this case. And Law Firm designated an experienced family law attorney to testify that \"the standard of conduct in [the] community did not require [Law Firm] to file a counterclaim to increase child support in the underlying divorce case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 We agree that the average juror would not know whether an attorney with ordinary skill and capacity would have filed a counterpetition under the same circumstances of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watkiss &amp; Saperstein v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10327292\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/931/840/#p846\">\n    931 P.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846 (Utah 1996) (defining the attorney standard of care as the \"duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake\") (quotation simplified). Without the help of an expert, jurors would be hard pressed to understand how the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and the Utah Child Support Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   operate together and whether an attorney would have been expected to file a counterpetition, consistent with the standards of professional conduct in the community. Indeed, these issues require a level of expertise in the field of family law, and an expert was therefore necessary to aid the jury in identifying the attorney standard of care for filing petitions to modify child support and determining whether Law Firm had breached that standard in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Consequently, in order to prevail, Kirkham needed to retain a family law expert to testify to the standard of care, breach, and causation elements of her claims. Given that she did not present expert testimony in support of her case, and in refutation of the opinions offered by Law Firm's expert, the district court correctly determined that Law Firm was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Because Kirkham failed to carry her burden of proof by retaining an expert witness to testify on her behalf to the necessary elements of her legal malpractice claims, we conclude that the district court correctly\n   granted summary judgment to Law Firm.
