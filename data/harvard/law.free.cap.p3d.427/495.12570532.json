After they arrived, all four of them smoked methamphetamine together. Some time later, the young men went into Oliver's bathroom and, without Oliver's knowledge, swallowed additional methamphetamine. One of the young men (Victim) overdosed, and later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Oliver eventually pled guilty to reckless endangerment, a class A misdemeanor. The district court, at the State's request, ordered Oliver to pay Victim's medical and funeral expenses as restitution. Oliver appeals that restitution order, arguing that the State did not present sufficient evidence demonstrating that her actions were the proximate cause of Victim's death, and therefore she should not have been required to pay restitution. We find Oliver's arguments persuasive, at least in part, and therefore vacate the restitution order and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On November 16, 2013, Victim (an eighteen-year-old male) and his friend (Friend) called Boyfriend and asked if they could come over to the house in which Oliver and Boyfriend lived so that they could \"get warm\" and \"smoke a bowl of [m]eth.\" Boyfriend\n   granted them permission, and so Victim and Friend came over to Oliver's house. Once they arrived, Oliver, Boyfriend, Victim, and Friend all smoked methamphetamine together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Soon thereafter, Victim and Friend went into the bathroom at Oliver's house. At the time, Oliver did not know what they were doing in the bathroom, but as it turned out they spent some of their time there ingesting additional methamphetamine through a method known as \"parachuting,\" a technique where an individual wraps methamphetamine in toilet paper and then swallows it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Later, after emerging from the bathroom, Victim and Friend both \"started acting funny.\" Oliver and Boyfriend \"had another guy get [Victim] out to his car and go to the hospital,\" but for reasons unclear from the record, that effort failed. Eventually, another person present called 911, and the paramedics came and took Victim to the hospital. Victim later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The State filed six criminal charges against Oliver, including one count of obstructing justice, a third degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-306\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-8-306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis 2017); two counts of possession or use of a controlled substance, one charged as a third degree felony, and one charged as a class B misdemeanor\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37-8(2)(a)(i); two counts of reckless endangerment, both class A misdemeanors,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-112; and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37a-5(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eventually, after plea negotiations, Oliver agreed to plead guilty to possession of a controlled substance (reduced to a class A misdemeanor) and one count of reckless endangerment (also a class A misdemeanor) in exchange for the State dropping the remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On the date set for preliminary hearing, Oliver elected to waive her right to that hearing and enter her plea instead. Before it accepted Oliver's plea, however, the district court asked about the factual basis for the plea, and Oliver's counsel stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 16th of 2013 in Salt Lake County, Ms. Oliver was in possession and she used methamphetamine. Additionally, she was residing in a home where she allowed two other people to use methamphetamine that\n   <em>\n    resulted in the overdose\n   </em>\n   of one of those ... individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Emphasis added.) After Oliver's counsel recited the factual basis, the district court asked Oliver, \"Is that what happened, Ms. Oliver?\" Oliver answered \"Yes.\" At that point, the court accepted and entered Oliver's guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 After Oliver pled guilty, she provided the following statement to probation officers who were preparing a presentence report for the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Friend and Victim] had called my boyfriend at the times phone to see if they could come into our house to get warm + smoke a bowl of Meth and he told them yes. They came in and we all smoked and then [Friend and Victim] went into the bathroom and swallowed some meth and I did not know this at the time then the guys both started acting funny and we had another guy [there] get [Victim] out to his car and go to the hospital but then [another friend] [ended] up having to call 911 and the paramedics came + took [Victim] to [the] hospital where he later had passed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 The district court held a sentencing hearing in February 2016. The court ordered Oliver to serve 120 days in jail (with the remainder of two one-year jail terms suspended), and to serve twenty-four months on probation, and imposed various terms and conditions of probation. The court ordered that the issue of restitution would \"remain open\" for ninety days. A few weeks later, the State filed a motion seeking an order compelling Oliver to pay $14,151.64 in restitution to Victim's father to pay for Victim's hospital and funeral expenses. The State also asked the court to order that the restitution amount be paid jointly and severally by Oliver and Boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Oliver objected to the State's restitution request, arguing generally that she \"did not admit to facts which constitute the proximate\n   cause of [Victim's] death.\" Specifically, Oliver's causation objection was based entirely upon a superseding cause argument, in which Oliver asserted that Victim's \"own ingestion of a large quantity of methamphetamine ... was the proximate cause of his death\" and that it was Victim's own decision to swallow methamphetamine that was \"the direct and proximate cause of his hospitalization and ultimate death resulting in the restitution amounts.\" Oliver made no specific argument that the State had failed to prove a causal link between Victim's overdose and Victim's death, and made no specific argument that she should not be required to pay restitution jointly and severally with Boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 After briefing, the district court held a hearing on the State's restitution request. The hearing was very short; the entire transcript is only six pages long. Neither side presented any actual evidence, whether through witnesses or through documents, and the court heard no testimony from any witness. Instead, attorneys for the State and for Oliver made legal arguments regarding causation. Oliver's attorney reiterated the superseding cause argument made in the briefing, arguing generally that Oliver's conduct was not \"the proximate cause of [Victim's] death,\" and arguing specifically that \"the proximate cause of [Victim's] death unfortunately and practically was his own independent decision to ingest a lethal quantity of methamphetamine.\" As in her briefing, Oliver made no specific argument that the State had failed to demonstrate a causal link between the overdose and the death and made no specific argument about joint and several liability. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 About a week later, the district court issued a decision granting the State's request for restitution, and ordering Oliver to pay Victim's hospital and funeral expenses. The court reasoned that Oliver \"allowed the victim to come to her home to smoke methamphetamine\" and that \"[t]his in itself was recklessly engaging in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the victim.\" The court added that \"[i]t was also foreseeable that allowing someone to ingest methamphetamine either by smoking or swallowing could lead to death or serious bodily injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ISSUES, STANDARDS OF REVIEW, AND PRESERVATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Oliver now appeals the district court's restitution order, and asks us to consider two issues. First, Oliver argues that the district court should not have ordered her to pay restitution, because (according to Oliver) the State failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that Oliver's actions were the proximate cause of Victim's overdose or death. The State asserts that this entire argument is unpreserved. To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue \"must be specifically raised, in a timely manner, and must be supported by evidence and relevant legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Donjuan v. McDermott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985841\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/839/\">\n    2011 UT 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985841\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/839/\">\n    266 P.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"An issue is preserved for appeal when it has been presented to the district court in such a way that the court has an opportunity to rule on [it].\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n    2017 UT 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n    416 P.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). We agree with the State that part of Oliver's first argument is unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The lack-of-causation argument that Oliver advances on appeal has two components: (1) that the State failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between Oliver's actions and Victim's overdose, and (2) that the State failed to present sufficient evidence of a causal link between Victim's overdose and Victim's death. As we explain below, the second part of Oliver's challenge on appeal-that there is not a sufficient causal link between Victim's overdose and Victim's death-was not preserved below; indeed, we conclude that any error that the district court may have made on this point was invited by Oliver. Therefore, we cannot disturb it on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 The other part of Oliver's lack-of-causation argument, however, was preserved. As discussed below, we agree with Oliver that she adequately presented to the district court her argument, now advanced on appeal, that the State failed to present evidence of a sufficient causal link between Oliver's\n   conduct and Victim's overdose. Accordingly, we review that part of the district court's restitution determination as we would ordinarily do. \"[I]n the case of restitution, a reviewing court will not disturb a district court's determination unless the court exceeds the authority prescribed by law or abuses its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Laycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    2009 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    214 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To the extent that the district court made legal determinations in connection with its restitution analysis, we review those legal determinations for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Brooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10341831\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/908/856/#p858\">\n    908 P.2d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858-59 (Utah 1995) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Second, Oliver argues that the district court erred by ordering that the restitution be paid jointly and severally by and between Oliver and Boyfriend. Oliver contends that she preserved this argument for appeal when her counsel \"argued repeatedly that ... Oliver could only be held liable for pecuniary damages that were proximately caused by her admitted criminal actions, not the actions of others.\" The State disagrees, and points out that Oliver \"cites no place where she pointed the trial court to the statutory authority she now says clearly shielded her from joint and several liability.\" We agree with the State that Oliver did not preserve this second argument for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 In opposition to the State's restitution request, Oliver argued generally that she did not proximately cause Victim's death, and argued specifically that Victim's own conduct was a superseding cause of his death. She did not explicitly alert the district court to her position that she could not be jointly and severally liable with Boyfriend; nor did she cite any legal authority in support of the legal theory she now advances on appeal. And at oral argument before the district court, Oliver made the same arguments that she made in her briefing in opposition to the State's restitution request. As with her briefing, during oral argument Oliver did not specifically argue that she could not be jointly and severally liable with Boyfriend. We conclude that Oliver's general proximate causation challenge was not sufficiently specific to alert the district court that Oliver intended to raise the legal theory that she could not be jointly and severally liable with Boyfriend. Therefore, the issue is unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Oliver nonetheless asks us to review this issue for plain error. To prevail under plain error review, Oliver must establish that (1) an error exists, (2) the error should have been obvious, and (3) the error prejudiced her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I.

While we are not suggesting that Oliver was intentionally attempting to mislead the district court, Oliver's arguments-intentionally or not-did indicate that Oliver was not contesting the existence of a causal link between Victim's overdose and Victim's death. Had Oliver taken the position, before the district court, that she considered the State's proof of a causal link between the overdose and the death insufficient, the State could have easily taken steps at the restitution hearing (such as introducing the autopsy report into evidence or calling the medical examiner as a witness) to attempt to prove that causal link.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oliver made no such argument below, and even led the district court to believe that Victim's death was caused by a methamphetamine overdose.

The State persuasively argues that Oliver effectively conceded the existence of but-for causation when her attorney stated in open court at the plea hearing that Oliver \"was residing in a home where she allowed two other people to use methamphetamine that resulted in the overdose....\" The district court asked Oliver if that was \"what happened,\" and Oliver answered affirmatively. Thus, we agree with the State that Oliver has conceded that allowing Victim into her home to smoke methamphetamine set in motion a chain of events that \"produced the injury, and without which the injury would not have occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (quotation simplified). We agree with the State that Oliver has effectively admitted the existence of at least a but-for causal link between her actions and Victim's overdose-if Boyfriend, with Oliver's tacit approval, had not invited Victim and Friend over to their house to \"smoke a bowl,\" Victim would not have overdosed on methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 Oliver argues, however, that the causal nexus is too attenuated to constitute proximate cause. Specifically, Oliver asserts that Victim died not from smoking methamphetamine together with her and Boyfriend but, rather, died from his own later additional oral ingestion of methamphetamine in the bathroom, events she maintains she knew nothing about and did not sanction. As she puts it, she \"did not allow [Victim] to parachute additional amounts of methamphetamine\" and \"could not have foreseen that [Victim] would secretly swallow a dangerous amount of methamphetamine in addition to smoking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Although Oliver does not phrase it in precisely this way, she is effectively arguing that a \"superseding cause\" broke the chain of causation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Utah law, \"[a] superseding cause is an unforeseeable act of subsequent negligence that severs the causal connection to an initial causal act.\"\n   <em>\n    Thayer v.

But we are not so convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b638 As noted above, the record in this case is spare, and allows us to draw facts from only three sources: any facts necessarily implied by Oliver's plea; the one brief paragraph of facts Oliver admitted during the plea colloquy; and Oliver's personal statement to probation officers. The State made no effort to supplement that factual record through testimony or documents. These factual sources tell us almost nothing about whether Victim's actions in parachuting methamphetamine were extraordinary, or whether they should have been foreseeable to Oliver. While it is possible that such a conclusion could reasonably be drawn after a more complete restitution hearing on remand, the record before us now hardly compels the conclusion that Victim's actions were not extraordinary and were (or should have been) foreseeable to Oliver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b639 The district court did not hear testimony from Oliver, and therefore we know very little about whether Oliver actually could have foreseen that Victim and Friend would, after smoking methamphetamine, retreat to the bathroom for the purpose of parachuting additional methamphetamine. We know from her statement to the probation officers that she \"did not know\" that Victim and Friend were going to swallow additional methamphetamine. But we do not know whether Victim and Friend had ever done such a thing before; whether Oliver knew that Victim and Friend were prone to such activity; whether Oliver had ever parachuted methamphetamine before; or whether Oliver knew that parachuting methamphetamine was even a thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b640 The district court likewise did not hear any evidence about parachuting in general, other than the fact that Victim and Friend had used that method to ingest additional methamphetamine on the day in question. There was no testimony that, for instance, parachuting is a common way of ingesting methamphetamine; no witness, expert or lay, informed the district court that persons familiar with using methamphetamine would likely know about, and be able to foresee the probability of, persons ingesting the drug by swallowing it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all we know from this record, it is at least equally likely that ingesting methamphetamine by parachuting it is extremely rare and not the type of thing that happens as a matter of course following smoking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b641 Had the district court made a factual finding, based on competent evidence, that Victim's actions were foreseeable, we would have deferred to such a finding. But the district court made no such determination, and we are unable to affirm on alternative grounds because the record before us does not compel the conclusion that Oliver reasonably should have foreseen Victim's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   II. Joint and Several Liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 Oliver next argues that the district court erred in holding her jointly and severally liable with Boyfriend for the full amount of the restitution.

The\n   <em>\n    Ogden\n   </em>\n   court again acknowledged this point when it recognized \"a number of the difficulties a sentencing court [might] face in trying to resolve issues of causation and losses, most notably a lack of opportunity for discovery that would allow a defendant to 'raise issues of proximate cause and comparative negligence by using depositions and interrogatories to gather relevant information.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%208\">\n    2018 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566913\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/1132/\">\n    416 P.3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    2009 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    214 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).
