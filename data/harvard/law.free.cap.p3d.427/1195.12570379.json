Hahn (Mother) and ordering Randy R. Hahn (Father) to pay child support. Father appeals, raising several challenges, including the constitutionality of certain Utah Code provisions governing custody and child support. We affirm and remand for the purpose of determining Mother's attorney fees incurred on appeal, which award we limit as described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Mother and Father divorced in New Mexico, entering into a marital settlement agreement and stipulated parenting plan, eventually agreeing to the entry of a final divorce decree in 2014. The parenting plan provided that the parties would share joint physical and legal custody of their minor\n   children. The decree did not impose a child support obligation on either party. Instead, the parties agreed that no child support would be paid by either party for one year following entry of the decree so that each could obtain employment. Following this deferment, the parties agreed to calculate child support using New Mexico Child Support guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Mother relocated to Utah and in 2015, registered the decree, parenting plan, and related orders with the Third District Court in Salt Lake County. She then filed a petition to modify those orders. Father filed an answer and counter-petition through counsel, but he subsequently filed an amended answer pro se. Both parties asserted that a substantial material change in circumstances justified modification of the original decree and orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In his amended answer, Father also raised general constitutional challenges to Utah's child custody and support statutes. Father later filed a motion for declaratory judgment in the modification proceeding, alleging many of the same constitutional challenges. Mother responded with a request for temporary orders, including a request for child support of $1,680 per month and attorney fees. Father responded and argued that no child support should be awarded to either party and also sought an award of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Following a hearing, a domestic commissioner recommended denial of Father's amended answer for child support and parent-time, and denial of Father's declaratory judgment motion as moot. The commissioner imputed income to Father of $10,533 per month based upon Father's average earnings from 2010, 2011, and 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ordered Father to pay child support in the amount of $1,369 per month. The commissioner reserved ruling on the issues of child support arrearages and Mother's request for attorney fees. Father objected to the commissioner's recommendations and requested a hearing before the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The district court heard argument on Father's objections and overruled them, affirming the commissioner's temporary orders with some modifications. The court ordered Father to pay $1,350 per month in child support, and to pay $1,000 of Mother's attorney fees. The court's award of attorney fees was related to Father's \"instigat[ing] unnecessary proceedings or litigation, ... [and] mak[ing] arguments that are without merit.\" Because Father was unemployed at the time of the hearing, the court required Father to pay a minimum of $123 per month toward the ordered child support and apply for two jobs per week, or face potential contempt of court proceedings. Thereafter, the case was certified for trial on the issues of (1) physical and legal custody of the children, (2) parenting plan, (3) child support, (4) child support arrearages, (5) insurance coverage for the children and premium payment, (6) right to claim the children as dependents on taxes, and (7) attorney fees. Prior to trial, Mother relocated to a different city in Utah, and Father relocated to Texas from Utah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 In late January 2017, shortly before the bench trial was set to begin, Father filed (1) a motion to continue the trial, (2) a motion to disqualify the assigned trial judge and commissioner, (3) a motion requesting a jury trial, and (4) a motion for summary judgment. The presiding judge of the district court denied the motion to disqualify the assigned trial judge. The trial court then denied the motion to continue and motion for jury trial, reserving time at the beginning of trial to address Father's summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Through his motion for summary judgment, Father sought a declaratory judgment that Utah's custody and child support statutes are unconstitutional. Father asserted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Utah, like state courts across the country, has failed to protect [fundamental] rights. Instead courts have usurped these fundamental rights, enabled by legislative statute, in Utah no less, that: the government's interest is superior to the fundamental rights of fit parents and their children; and the government is entitled to determine\n   custody and support in the \"best interests of the child\" merely because parents divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before trial began, however, Father sought to withdraw the motion for summary judgment, submitting instead a \"Declaration of Rights.\" Father also sought to withdraw the motion to disqualify the assigned trial judge, despite the presiding judge's earlier denial of that motion. Father, who then, as now, was not represented by counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed his documents the morning of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 Father failed to appear for trial, and the trial court, despite significant efforts, could not reach him. In his absence, the court denied Father's motion for summary judgment on the merits and proceeded to take evidence on the modification petitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following trial, the court ordered the parties to share joint legal custody and awarded sole physical custody of the children to Mother. Father was designated as the \"relocating parent\" and awarded visitation pursuant to statute.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-37\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 30-3-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis Supp. 2017). The court also ordered Father to pay (1) $1,761 per month in future child support, (2) $13,690 in child support arrearages, and (3) $3,300 for Mother's attorney fees in addition to the $1,000 amount previously ordered. Father appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Father first argues that the court deprived him of his right to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review the question of whether Father had a right to a jury trial for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Failor v.

The court addressed physical custody, legal custody, health care and medical expenses, insurance, child tax exemptions, and child support. Considering the nature of the proceedings and our precedent, the court properly concluded that the modification matter was equitable in nature, and consequently, that Father was not entitled to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Imputed Income\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Next, Father maintains that the court improperly imputed income to him in determining child support. The income imputed to a parent \"shall be based upon employment potential and probable earnings as derived from employment opportunities, work history, occupation qualifications, and prevailing earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the community.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-12-203(7)(b) (LexisNexis 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 Based upon the commissioner's findings, the court issued a pre-trial order in 2015, imputing monthly income to Father of $10,533 for the purpose of calculating child support. At trial in 2017, the court reviewed the financial declaration Father had submitted before trial, finding no indication of Father's current income. The declaration stated only \"that [Father's] income is heavily garnished for child support and that [he is] barely living month-to-month while paying down debt.\" To calculate child support, then, the court first had to determine the amount of Father's income. Because Father failed to provide current financial information, failed to attend trial, and \"refused to meaningfully participate in discovery,\" the trial court again imputed income to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court heard testimony and took documentary evidence regarding Father's historical earnings at a previous job he had held from 2010 to 2012. The court determined that Father had recently started a new job in Texas and inferred that Father's income was comparable to his historical earnings because his previous job was \"essentially the same job he holds now.\" The court ultimately imputed income to Father at $10,533 per month, based upon Father's three-year average monthly income at his previous job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 We see no basis to disturb the court's findings regarding imputed income. Although he had taken a new job in Texas with a similar title to his former position in New Mexico-on which his historical earnings were based-Father provided no current financial information and did not attend the trial. Thus, the court properly considered historical earnings as a suitable alternative to Father's current income and did not err in calculating child support based on that imputed amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III. Father's Other Claims on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Father raises several other contentions, including the trial court's award of attorney fees and certain other claims related to the constitutionality of Utah's custody and support statutes. Father has not adequately briefed these issues, however, and has therefore failed to carry his burden of persuasion on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Office of Prof'l Conduct\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2050\">\n    2017 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569459\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/134/\">\n    424 P.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"a party who fails to\n   adequately brief an issue will almost certainly fail to carry its burden of persuasion on appeal\" (quotation simplified) ).

Father claims that the district court erred, particularly asserting that (1) the court awarded fees \"beyond the cost of the effort and expertise expended,\" (2) the court did not take \"evidence of hours spent [or] rate applied,\" and (3) \"it is not bad faith for [Father] to assert his parental rights at trial specifically for the purpose to preserve the issues for appeal.\" Based upon a spate of motions Father filed one week before trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b67,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court determined that (1) Father's motion for jury trial was \"clearly not allowed under the law,\" (2) Father's summary judgment motion \"is just a re-hash ... of arguments [Father has] already made,\" and (3) Father's motion to continue trial, \"made on the eve of trial,\" could have been presented far earlier. The trial court also emphasized that Father had raised the same constitutional arguments multiple times, and noted that the court believed that Father had already sufficiently preserved these issues for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 On appeal, Father does not explain how the court erred regarding Mother's counsel's effort or expertise, or describe any error regarding the lack of time-sheet evidence. Additionally, Father does not contest the court's factual findings supporting the award of attorney fees, or present reasoned analysis supported by legal authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. App. P. 24(a)(8). He fails, for example, to contest the court's findings regarding Father's several motions filed immediately before trial, or the necessity for Mother to prepare hasty responses to these motions. Father also does not confront the court's determination that Father had previously raised, multiple times, the same constitutional arguments, and that Father continued to \"instigate[ ] unnecessary proceedings or litigation, ... mak[ing] arguments that are without merit.\" Finally, Father does not describe, with reasoned analysis and citations to legal authority, why he should prevail on this issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Father's challenge to the court's award of attorney fees to Mother is inadequately briefed and we decline to address it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 With respect to Father's constitutional arguments, we first note the high bar appellants face when challenging the constitutionality of statutes.

Father's opening brief contains no development of authority and no meaningful application of precedent to the facts of this case. For example, Father asserts that the court \"erred in failing to apply procedural and substantive Due Process and Equal Protection rights and safeguards and strict scrutiny of state action as it relates to infringement or deprivation of fundamental parental rights in the 'care, custody, and control' of children.\" He points to no part of the record and no particular process, however, in which the divorce decree modification procedures failed to meet constitutional requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 Accordingly, the overall analysis of Father's constitutional challenges is \"so lacking as to shift the burden of research and argument to the reviewing court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
