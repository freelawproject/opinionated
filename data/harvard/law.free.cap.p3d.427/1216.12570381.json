James Krahenbuhl, Kayleen Krahenbuhl, and the Estate of Tanner Krahenbuhl (collectively, the Krahenbuhls) appeal from the district court's interlocutory order denying their objection to Prior Counsel's subpoena duces tecum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Krahenbuhls assert that the district court erred in denying their objection because the subpoena violates the attorney-client privilege. We agree and therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In August 2009, Tanner Krahenbuhl was killed while riding in a motor home that\n   was traveling down a steep mountain road near Powder Mountain Resort. Several witnesses stated that the motor home was traveling at a high rate of speed down the road and that its brakes were smoking before it crashed. The Krahenbuhls hired Prior Counsel to pursue several claims, including a negligence claim against Powder Mountain on a theory of premises liability as well as product liability claims against the manufacturer of the motor home's brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Two years and one day after Tanner's death, Prior Counsel filed a one-count complaint for negligence against Powder Mountain. Powder Mountain's answer asserted that the two-year statute of limitations barred the claim because it was filed one day late. In November 2012, over a year after the complaint was filed, Prior Counsel withdrew from the case. In December 2012, the Krahenbuhls retained a new attorney (Successor Counsel). Thereafter, Powder Mountain moved for summary judgment, arguing that the claim against it should be dismissed because it was not timely filed. The district court granted the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In August 2015, the Krahenbuhls, through Successor Counsel, filed a legal malpractice action against Prior Counsel for failing to timely file the lawsuit against Powder Mountain and for failing to file any claims against the brake manufacturer. In their answer, Prior Counsel asserted the affirmative defense of comparative negligence, contending that the Krahenbuhls and Successor Counsel were at least in part responsible for the untimely filing of the Krahenbuhls' claims. After Prior Counsel moved for summary judgment, the parties stipulated to dismissing the Krahenbuhls' claims as to Prior Counsel's failure to timely file the negligence claim against Powder Mountain, because the district court had determined in a subrogation lawsuit that Powder Mountain did not owe a duty to the Krahenbuhls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Discovery continued on the issue of whether Prior Counsel committed legal malpractice for failing to assert the product liability claims in an action filed before the expiration of the statute of limitations. Prior Counsel filed a notice of issuance of a subpoena duces tecum (the Subpoena), requesting all documents in Successor Counsel's file that related to the underlying lawsuit. The Krahenbuhls objected, arguing that the Subpoena sought materials protected by the attorney-client privilege. In response, Prior Counsel filed a statement of discovery issues, seeking an order requiring the Krahenbuhls to comply with the Subpoena. Prior Counsel argued that the Krahenbuhls waived the attorney-client privilege as to communications between themselves and Successor Counsel because the privileged communications were \"at issue.\" First, citing a number of cases from other jurisdictions, Prior Counsel argued that \"suing one attorney for malpractice amounts to a waiver of the privilege as to all attorneys involved in the underlying litigation.\" Second, they argued that Successor Counsel was at fault because he \"could have amended the complaint to add the claims he now argues [Prior Counsel] should have brought.\" The district court agreed, without explanation, and ordered the Krahenbuhls to comply with the Subpoena. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The Krahenbuhls contend that the district court erred by determining that they had waived the attorney-client privilege as to communications between them and Successor Counsel and by ordering them to comply with the Subpoena.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Whether a party has waived the attorney-client privilege is an issue of law, which we review for correctness[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

The district court concluded that the plaintiff waived the privilege because the plaintiff sought damages that occurred after it hired successor counsel, and it was unclear whether the initial attorneys or successor counsel were responsible for the plaintiff's losses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 In addition to being nonbinding,\n   <em>\n    Lyon\n   </em>\n   is inapposite, and we decline to follow it here. The Krahenbuhls are not seeking damages that occurred outside of Prior Counsel's representation and therefore have not placed at issue their communications with Successor Counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Prior Counsel also assert that Successor Counsel is at fault for the preclusion of the Krahenbuhls' product liability claims. According to Prior Counsel, Successor Counsel could have brought the claims by amending the complaint and alleging that the discovery rule tolled the statute of limitations. Prior Counsel assert that \"Successor Counsel's underlying representation of the Krahenbuhls was likely an intervening cause of the Krahenbuhls' alleged injury\" because Successor Counsel failed to argue that Powder Mountain did not specifically plead its statute of limitations defense. According to Prior Counsel, a determination that the Krahenbuhls did not waive the attorney-client privilege would allow them to use the privilege both as a sword and a shield, which we have said a party cannot do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

We find this argument unavailing. In support of their assertion, Prior Counsel cite cases in which courts have required the production of the successor counsel's files. Typical of these-and the case upon which Prior Counsel primarily relies-is\n   <em>\n    Pappas v.

But in\n   <em>\n    Pappas\n   </em>\n   , the court applied the second variation,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 4, of the at-issue waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=787%20P.2d%2030\">\n    787 P.2d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that it was applying the second variation of the at-issue waiver, also known as the\n   <em>\n    Hearn\n   </em>\n   test), which presents a lower bar for parties seeking the production of privileged communications. We cannot adopt the wide-sweeping rule that Prior Counsel advocates, because it is at odds with the rule our Supreme Court articulated in\n   <em>\n    Maret\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582317\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/984/980/\">\n    1999 UT 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582317\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/984/980/\">\n    984 P.2d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a party waives the attorney-client privilege \"by placing attorney-client communications at the heart of a case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 In sum, we conclude that requiring the Krahenbuhls to comply with the Subpoena is inconsistent with the principles outlined in\n   <em>\n    Maret\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , and therefore the court erred in determining that the Krahenbuhls waived the attorney-client privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 We conclude that the district court erred in determining that the Krahenbuhls waived the attorney-client privilege as to communications between them and Successor Counsel and by ordering them to comply with the Subpoena.
