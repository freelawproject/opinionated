Over the next seventy-five days, the money sat in a UHP bank account and no forfeiture proceedings were filed in a Utah state district court. During this time, a federal magistrate issued a seizure warrant for the money on behalf of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). UHP sent a check for the cash amount to the DEA, but it was never cashed. Mr. Savely wants his money back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 To that end, Mr. Savely filed a petition in state district court, asking the court to force UHP to return his funds because prosecuting attorneys failed to take one of the actions necessary under Utah Code section 24-4-104(1)(a) to avert a duty on the part of law enforcement to \"return [the] seized property.\" Initially agreeing with Mr. Savely, the state district court ordered UHP to return Mr. Savely's seized funds. However, after UHP filed a motion to reconsider, the state district court reversed course, concluding that it lacked\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction of the seized funds based on principles of comity, and dismissed Mr. Savely's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 Mr. Savely appealed this decision. We conclude that the state district court had\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over Mr. Savely's funds under the Act. Therefore, we reverse the state district court's dismissal of Mr. Savely's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 On November 27, 2016, a UHP trooper stopped Mr. Savely while Mr. Savely was driving on Interstate 80 through Summit County, Utah. In response to his K-9's alert, the trooper detained the vehicle's occupants and searched the vehicle. The trooper uncovered no drugs or other contraband but found a case containing 52 bundles of cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 The trooper seized the cash and provided Mr. Savely with an asset seizure notification form, providing him notice, pursuant to section 24-4-103(1) of the Act, that the cash had been seized for purposes of forfeiture. The cash was deposited into a UHP bank account for seized currency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 No further action was taken in regard to the seized cash until January 13, 2017, when a federal magistrate issued a seizure warrant for the cash. UHP sent a check in the amount of the seized cash to the DEA on January 24, 2017, but the check was never cashed or deposited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 On February 10, 2017, seventy-five days after UHP's seizure, Mr. Savely filed a petition in state district court seeking the release of his property. In a hearing on February 21, 2017, the state district court ruled in favor of Mr. Savely, concluding that UHP was required by the Act to procure an order from a state district court that authorized UHP to release the seized cash to the DEA and, thus, that UHP had unlawfully transferred the funds. Additionally, the state district court concluded that UHP had failed to take one of the actions required by Utah Code section 24-4-104(1)(a) and therefore ordered UHP to return the funds to Mr. Savely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 UHP immediately stopped payment on the January 24, 2017 check sent to the DEA. In response, the DEA served UHP with a second federal seizure warrant on February 23, 2017, after which UHP requested that the state district court reconsider its initial ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 The state district court heard additional arguments in response to UHP's motion to reconsider and set aside the original judgment. This time, the state district court concluded the federal court had begun exercising\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction by issuing the January 13, 2017 seizure warrant, prohibiting the state district court's exercise of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction when Mr. Savely filed his petition. As a result, the state district court granted the motions, dismissing Mr. Savely's petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Mr. Savely appeals that decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 We review questions of jurisdiction for correctness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mr. Savely contends that the state district court first acquired\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction when UHP provided him with a notice of intent to seek forfeiture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, UHP and its amicus, the United States, argue that a state court does not exercise\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction under the Act until there has been a filing in the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result,\n   the United States contends that the federal court was the first to exercise\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction through its issuance of the first seizure warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 Therefore, this case presents two interrelated questions: (1) When does a Utah state district court begin exercising\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over property seized under the Act? and (2) Did the federal court's first seizure warrant constitute a valid exercise of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction prior to the state district court's exercise of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction? We address each of these questions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I. EXERCISING\n   <em>\n    IN REM\n   </em>\n   JURISDICTION UNDER THE ACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 The first dispute we must resolve is when a Utah state district court begins exercising\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over property seized under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Mr. Savely argues that a state district court has\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over seized property as soon as a seizing agency serves a notice of intent to seek forfeiture, even if no \"filing\" has occurred in the court. He points to several provisions in the Act, including Utah Code sections 24-4-108(1), (4) and 24-4-114, to support this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 Conversely, UHP and the United States contend that\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction can never be vested until there has been a filing in the state district court. Moreover, relying on Utah Code section 24-1-103(1), they contend that the Act only recognizes\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction when an action has been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 Consequently, we must first decide if it is possible for a court to exercise\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over property without any filing in the court. If it is possible, we must determine if the Act provides for\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction without a filing, and, if so, at what time. Finally, we must decide whether the state district court exercised\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over Mr. Savely's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    A. Exercising\n   </em>\n   In Rem\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction Without a Filing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 \"The basic requirement of jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   ... is that a court must have exclusive possession or control over the property in order to consider the suit and grant or deny the relief sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Scarabin v.

When considering whether a state court has exercised\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over seized property, other courts have focused on the state's statutory scheme. Where \"state law expressly provides jurisdiction as an integral element of its statutory warrant and seizure scheme,\" the state district court is imbued with\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction at the time provided by statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524431\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/989/#p994\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524431\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/989/#p994\">\n    at 993-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts have recognized two different types of statutory provisions that provide jurisdiction as an integral element of the statutory scheme: (1) provisions that place custody and control of seized property in the district court and (2) provisions that restrict or prohibit the transfer or turnover of seized property without the district court's permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 The first type of relevant statutory provision is one that places custody and control in the district court or otherwise restricts disposition of the property to court order. When a state's statutory scheme does not provide for judicial control over seized property, courts have determined that\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction is not conferred by the seizure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We conclude that the strength of these other sections, and the Act as a whole, requires us to resolve the ambiguity in favor of a state district court exercising\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over property held for forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631 The Act contains both types of provisions that make jurisdiction an integral part of the seizure and forfeiture scheme: provisions that place the custody and control over property held for forfeiture in the district court and provisions that restrict the transfer of the property without a turnover order by that court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , UTAH CODE \u00a7 24-4-108(1) (\"After the seizing agency gives notice that the property is to be held for forfeiture, a person or entity may not alienate, convey, sequester, or attach that property until the\n   <em>\n    court issues a final order\n   </em>\n   of dismissal or an order of forfeiture regarding the property.\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24-4-108(4) (\"Property held for forfeiture is considered to be in the\n   <em>\n    custody of the district court\n   </em>\n   and subject only to: (a) the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the property or the forfeiture proceedings; and (b) the acts of the agency that possesses the property or the prosecuting attorney pursuant to this chapter.\" (emphasis added) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 24-4-114(1) (prohibiting the direct or indirect transfer of property held for forfeiture \"to any federal agency or any governmental entity not created under and subject to state\n   law\" without a court order authorizing the transfer and limiting when a court may enter such an order).

This provision, along with the grant of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction to the state district court over property held for forfeiture, ensures that the authority to seize and hold property for forfeiture under the Act is limited by the protections provided in the Act.

Second, even if a check can imbue a federal court with\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over underlying cash, the parties further disagree on whether an\n   <em>\n    uncashed\n   </em>\n   check actually places the seized funds within the federal court's control, and thus its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b644 Circuit courts appear to be split on the first issue.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scarabin v.

Instead, we conclude that even if an uncashed check could vest a federal court with\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction, the\n   check issued in response to the federal seizure warrant in this case did not have such effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b645 As we concluded above, the state district court began exercising its\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over Mr. Savely's property on November 27, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.

However, as noted above, this conclusion was incorrect. Additionally, the actions taken by the federal court and the United States are insufficient to divest the state district court's\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction or to vest such jurisdiction in the federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b647 Even if the uncashed January 13, 2017 check would generally be sufficient to confer\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction on the federal court, such was not the case here.

First, the prior construction canon, which presumes that the legislature has adopted a judicial construction of the statute when it \"amends a portion of a statute but leaves other portions unamended, or re-enacts them without change,\"\n    <em>\n     Christensen v.

Garner, Reading Law: the Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012). UHP provides no argument or authority that supports presuming that the legislature has adopted a single construction by a federal district court (which would be, at most, a persuasive authority in any Utah court). Second, Utah Code section 24-4-114(1) recognizes that a transfer pursuant to a state court order would be \"\n    <em>\n     relinquishing jurisdiction\n    </em>\n    to a federal agency.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 24-4-114(1)(c) (emphasis added).
