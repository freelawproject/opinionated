Salgado challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her DUI conviction. Additionally, she contends that the trial court provided two jury instructions that improperly commented on the evidence. Finally, she argues that the trial court erred in declining to instruct the jury on a minimum-speed violation as a lesser included offense of DUI. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Traffic Stop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 While patrolling I-15 near 9000 South around 2 p.m., a Utah Highway Patrol officer (the officer) noticed a car traveling in the middle northbound lane at speeds \"considerably slower than the rest of traffic,\" creating a traffic hazard for vehicles that had to drive around it. Because the car had its hazard lights on, the officer thought it might be having mechanical problems and that the driver-later identified as Salgado-was attempting to merge over to the shoulder of the freeway. To help Salgado safely pull over, the officer activated his patrol vehicle's rear emergency lights and blocked the two right lanes of traffic. Instead of pulling over, Salgado continued to drive at forty-five miles per hour (mph) for a while, before eventually increasing her speed to sixty-five mph, five mph below the posted maximum speed limit of seventy mph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 When Salgado failed to pull over, the officer pulled up alongside the driver's side of her car and turned on his siren to try to get her attention. She did not respond. Instead, according to the officer, she stared \"kind of to the right and ahead.\" Thinking Salgado may be hearing impaired, the officer drove to the passenger's side of the vehicle and chirped his siren, but she continued to focus straight ahead, avoiding eye contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 At this point, the officer grew concerned that Salgado was driving while impaired. The officer had nearly ten years of experience with the Utah Highway Patrol and had completed his standardized field sobriety instructor certification as well as his drug recognition expert (DRE) certification, although his DRE certification was no longer current. Based on his training and experience, he understood that \"it is common with people that are under the influence of ... alcohol or drugs [to be] so focused on staying in their lane or what's right ahead of them, that they really don't know what's going on around them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In an attempt to get Salgado's attention, the officer turned on all of his patrol vehicle's emergency equipment, moved in front of Salgado's car, and motioned with his hand for her to pull over. Salgado moved over one lane but continued driving. In response, the officer left the emergency equipment on and fluctuated his distance from Salgado's car, trying \"to do anything [he] could to get [her] attention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Salgado began to drive on the skip lines that divide the freeway lanes, prompting the officer to think she was going to take the 7200 South exit. She did not. \"Thinking there might be a medical condition or ... some impairment,\" the officer notified dispatch of the situation. Responding to that call, a detective in the area began following Salgado and the officer. According to the officer, at this point, Salgado \"was not driving recklessly, she just was not responding to anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Salgado maintained near-freeway speeds until she approached 4500 South where traffic slowed due to an unrelated collision. As traffic slowed to approximately five to ten mph, the officer used his public address system to tell Salgado \"to pull over to the right.\" The officer thought Salgado had finally noticed him because she motioned with her hand, but again she continued driving. Finally, when traffic completely stopped, the officer exited his patrol vehicle, knocked on Salgado's window, and instructed her to pull over. As a safety precaution, the officer and detective had approached the car with weapons drawn. With Salgado finally stopped\n   on the side of the road, the officer ordered her out of the car and handcuffed her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 When asked why she had not stopped, Salgado initially claimed that she never saw the officer but later stated that \"she didn't believe that she needed to stop.\" When talking to Salgado, the officer noticed that she was confused as to why she was being stopped and that her eyelids were very droopy. Because the officer knew, through his training and experience, that certain illegal drugs and prescribed medications cause droopy eyelids, he asked Salgado whether she had taken anything. Salgado stated that she had taken four different medications at 5 a.m. that morning, including tramadol, a central nervous system depressant with effects similar to alcohol. Based on this admission and his observation of Salgado's \"intent focus straight ahead, which is common with people that are under the influence,\" the officer was concerned about her ability to drive and consequently began a DUI investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The investigation included three standardized field sobriety tests: the horizontal gaze nystagmus test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the nine-step walk-and-turn, and the one-leg stand. The officer testified that law enforcement use these field sobriety tests to assess a driver's balance, coordination, and ability between divide his or her attention to more than one task. During each test, an officer looks for \"clues\" that the driver is impaired by drugs and/or alcohol, such as jerking eyes, inability to maintain balance, and failure to follow instructions. More clues equate to \"more signs of impairment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Before the officer administered the first test, he asked Salgado whether she suffered from any current injuries or illnesses that might affect the test results. Because Salgado said she had previously undergone brain surgery, the officer examined her eyes to check for abnormalities that would indicate head trauma, but he found none. Her pupils were the same size, they were tracking equally, and there was no resting eye nystagmus. Salgado denied having any other injury that could impair her ability to perform the tests, such as back, knee, or ankle problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Confident the results of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test would be accurate, the officer conducted the three-part test. During the first part of the test, the officer noticed that \"there was a lack of smooth pursuit\" in both of Salgado's eyes, resulting in \"two clues.\" When the officer asked Salgado to look as far left and right as she could, he observed additional signs of nystagmus, which amounted to two more clues. During the final part of the test, however, Salgado showed no additional signs of nystagmus. All told, Salgado demonstrated four clues on this test, which, according to the officer, is a significant indication that an individual is \"either over the legal limit of alcohol or impaired by drugs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The officer next administered the nine-step walk-and-turn test, looking for up to eight clues. He later testified that studies have demonstrated that observing two clues during this test is a significant indication that an individual is impaired. Salgado exhibited six clues-failing to maintain balance during the instruction phase of the test, missing heel to toe several times, stepping off the line several times, taking the wrong number of steps the first time, taking the wrong number of steps the second time, and performing an improper turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Finally, the officer asked Salgado to perform the one-leg stand, a test with four potential clues. The officer observed two clues when she put her foot down twice and when she swayed during the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 The officer gave all of the test instructions in English. Although Salgado is a native Spanish speaker, she never asked for an interpreter or otherwise indicated that she did not understand. The officer testified that he did not believe there was a language barrier sufficient to necessitate a translator, because Salgado responded appropriately to the questions that he asked her and she confirmed that she understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 The officer administered a breath test, which showed that Salgado had not consumed alcohol. Nevertheless, based on his training and experience, his observations of\n   Salgado's driving, and the results of the field sobriety tests, the officer arrested Salgado for DUI. A subsequent chemical test confirmed the presence of tramadol in Salgado's system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 During a post-arrest interview that same day, the officer asked Salgado \"where she was coming from, where she was going, [and] what she'd been doing.\" Salgado was again able to respond to all of the officer's questions. She told him that she was having problems with her tire and that she had been driving from Orem to her mechanic in Salt Lake City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 The State ultimately charged Salgado with one count of failure to respond to an officer's signal to stop, a third degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-210 (LexisNexis 2014), and one count of DUI, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-6a-502.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 The case proceeded to trial. After the close of the State's case, Salgado moved for a directed verdict on the DUI charge, contending that there was insufficient evidence to prove she was not \"able to safely operate the motor vehicle.\" Specifically, Salgado argued that the State's only allegation was that \"she was moving slowly with hazard lights on.... And [that] this by itself is not enough.\" In ruling on the motion, the judge stated, \"I think there is sufficient evidence that the jury could look at it and determine that ... the facts support a finding of guilt\" because \"[h]er eyes were drooping\" and there were \"the clues that [the officer] talked about.\" The trial continued, and Salgado did not renew her motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 At the close of the evidence, the court heard arguments from each side regarding proposed jury instructions. Salgado objected to two of the State's requested instructions, later numbered as Instructions 18 and 19. Instruction 18 listed \"relevant factors\" for \"determining whether alcohol and/or drugs rendered defendant incapable of safely operating a vehicle.\" Salgado argued that such an instruction \"emphasizes some pieces of evidence over other pieces of evidence and creates a situation ... of the Court commenting on what's important and what isn't in [the jury's] factual determination.\" The court overruled Salgado's objection, explaining that \"there's no instruction that could give all of the relevant factors\" and that Salgado was not precluded from arguing any other factors that might be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 Instruction 19 included a sentence interpreting the statute, which explained that \"tak[ing] drugs as directed by a physician pursuant to a prescription ... does not excuse the defendant's liability for DUI.\" Salgado objected only to this sentence, contending that it was an \"incorrect\" interpretation of the statute and was neither \"supported\" nor \"warranted.\" Because the court believed it was not \"inappropriate\" to include this sentence, it overruled Salgado's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Salgado requested two lesser included offense instructions. The trial court granted her request to instruct the jury on interference with an arresting officer as a lesser included offense of failure to respond to an officer's signal to stop. She also requested a jury instruction on minimum-speed violation as a lesser included offense of DUI. The judge declined her request, stating, \"I don't believe that a minimum speed violation is a lesser included offense as defined by case law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 The jury convicted Salgado of one count of interference with an arresting officer, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-305\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-8-305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017), and one count of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-8-305\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 41-6a-502 (2014). Salgado appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 Salgado raises several issues on appeal. First, Salgado contends that her DUI conviction must be overturned because the State presented insufficient evidence to prove she was impaired by drugs to such a degree that she was incapable of safely operating her vehicle. \"In evaluating sufficiency of the evidence claims, we review the evidence and all inferences which may reasonably be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Salgado contends that we should reverse her DUI conviction \"because the State presented insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [she] was impaired by drugs\" to a degree that rendered her incapable of safely operating her vehicle. As an initial matter, we must address the State's argument that Salgado failed to preserve the issue she asserts on appeal. According to the State, Salgado did not specifically raise the issue or support her argument with relevant legal authority in her motion for a directed verdict. Because we conclude that Salgado preserved the issue, we next address whether the trial court erred in submitting the charge to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Preservation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 Absent an exception to the preservation requirement, \"[w]e generally do not hear [issues] on appeal that were not presented to the [trial] court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To provide the court with such an opportunity, the party asserting error must specifically raise the issue in a timely fashion and must introduce supporting evidence and relevant legal authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 Here, Salgado moved for a directed verdict on the DUI charge at the close of the State's case, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that she was unable \"to safely operate the motor vehicle\" because, according to Salgado, \"[t]he sole allegation [was that] she was moving slowly with hazard lights on. No other reckless behavior was observed.\" On appeal, Salgado contends that the State failed \"to prove that [she] was impaired by tramadol to a degree that rendered her incapable of safely operating a vehicle.\" In support of this contention, Salgado argues that \"the State's proof that [she] was impaired by tramadol was too speculative to support a conviction\" where (1) the State's expert \"could not say that Salgado had enough of the drug in her body to create a therapeutic effect let alone an impairing effect,\" and (2) the arresting officer \"was not trained to distinguish drug impairment from medical conditions or innocent behavior.\" Although Salgado did not make these two specific arguments before the trial court, \"issues must be preserved, not arguments for or against a particular ruling on an issue raised below.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court held that \"there's sufficient evidence that the jury could [find] ... that there's such impairment there that she's incapable. Her eyes were drooping. We have ... the clues that [the officer] talked about.\" We therefore conclude that Salgado preserved for appeal her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the DUI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B.

It is undisputed that Salgado had operated a vehicle and that she had taken tramadol on the day in question. On appeal, Salgado challenges the State's proof only as it relates to impairment, i.e., her ability to safely operate her vehicle. In particular, Salgado contends that the State's proof is based on speculation because (1) its expert \"could not say that Salgado had enough of the drug in her body to create a therapeutic effect let alone an impairing effect,\" and (2) the arresting officer \"was not trained to distinguish drug impairment from medical conditions or innocent behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b632 At trial, the State called an expert witness who had tested Salgado's blood sample. The expert confirmed that Salgado had ingested tramadol, testifying that her test results were \"positive.\" He explained that a positive result shows whether the amount of tramadol in Salgado's system fell within the detection range but not whether that amount was impairing. According to the expert, even if the results showed the precise amount of tramadol in Salgado's system, a DRE evaluation or eyewitness testimony would still be required to determine whether she was impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b633 Here, the State presented testimony from the officer regarding Salgado's unusual driving patterns and her performance on several field sobriety tests to prove that she was impaired to a degree that rendered her incapable of safely operating her vehicle. In particular, the officer testified that Salgado first caught his attention because she was driving considerably below the speed limit, which created a \"traffic hazard\" for the cars that had to go around her. According to the officer, he then made several attempts to get Salgado to pull over-including driving along both sides of her car, driving in front of and behind her car, motioning with his hand, activating his emergency equipment, and making an announcement over his public address\n   system-yet Salgado did not respond. The officer further testified that although he had previously been worried that Salgado was experiencing mechanical or medical issues, he began to suspect that she was impaired when she failed to pull over and when she maintained her intent focus straight ahead. When Salgado did finally pull over, the officer's suspicion was heightened when he noticed that her \"eyelids were very droopy\" and that \"[s]he was very confused about what was going on and why she was being stopped.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 To confirm whether Salgado was impaired, the officer began a DUI investigation, which included three standardized field sobriety tests that are used \"whether [the officer is testing] for drugs or ... alcohol.\" The officer testified that Salgado showed signs of impairment during each test, exhibiting twelve out of eighteen possible clues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 Salgado's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence largely rests on her contention that the officer's testimony is speculative because he was not certified as a DRE at the time of Salgado's arrest.

The officer in this case had significant training and experience related to detecting drug and alcohol impairment. Specifically, the officer testified that he was \"certified as a standardized field sobriety instructor\" and that he had been \"a DRE for a couple of years.\" Although he had not renewed his DRE certification, he had previously undergone the requisite training that aided his conclusion that Salgado was impaired. And, unlike the officer in\n   <em>\n    Hechtle\n   </em>\n   , the officer observed odd behavior indicative of recent drug use, including Salgado's intent focus straight ahead and failure to notice his signals to stop, and he conducted several field sobriety tests, which confirmed his suspicion of impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b637 Salgado maintains that there are several innocent explanations for her driving pattern and performance on the field sobriety tests.

At trial, Salgado argued that \"anything that's admitted into evidence is ... presumed to be relevant\" and will be considered in the jury's deliberations. But according to Salgado, Instruction 18 impeded the deliberative process by \"emphasiz[ing] some pieces of evidence over other[s].\" In particular, she believes that Instruction 18 could lead the jury to incorrectly assume that the \"defendant's coordination, judgment, [and] physical appearance\" are important factors, while \"a medical condition [and] ... language issues\" are not. On appeal, Salgado points to additional shortcomings: \"[Instruction 18] did not tell the jury that drugs affect different people differently, educate the jury on the factors DREs use to determine drug impairment, or provide a list of factors tailored to tramadol impairment.\" Contrary to the State's characterization,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Salgado has never argued that Instruction 18 should have included these additional factors. Instead, she highlights these factors to support her contention that an instruction of this kind should not be given at all. Because Salgado has raised the same issue at trial and on appeal, we conclude that this issue is preserved and review it accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2. Harmlessness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 Salgado contends that Instruction 18 improperly commented on the evidence because it \"emphasized some factors of impairment over others and incorrectly limited\n   the types of factors for emphasis to the physical manifestations of alcohol impairment.\" In other words, Instruction 18 \"was erroneous because it instructed the jury to assess drug impairment the same way that it would alcohol impairment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b643 Instruction 18 included a nonexclusive list of factors that the jury could consider in determining whether Salgado was impaired to a degree that she could not safely drive. The instruction provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In determining whether alcohol and/or drugs rendered defendant incapable of safely operating a vehicle, relevant factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 The defendant's driving pattern, if any\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 The defendant's physical appearance\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 The smell of alcohol on the defendant, if any\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 The defendant's coordination\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 The defendant's judgment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 The defendant's actions before and after driving\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Whether the defendant took field sobriety tests and, if so, her performance on them\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b644 Even assuming the trial court erred in instructing the jury on factors that were irrelevant to assessing tramadol impairment, we conclude that any error was harmless. An error does not require reversal \"if it is sufficiently inconsequential that we conclude there is no reasonable likelihood that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As a result, where the State presented no evidence of alcohol impairment, \"there was absolutely no way the jury could have related the instruction to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The remaining factors were relevant to both drug and alcohol impairment. We therefore conclude that there was no reasonable likelihood that Instruction 18 affected the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   B. Instruction 19\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b646 Salgado also contends that Instruction 19 improperly commented on the evidence. Instruction 19 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [I]t is not a defense to the charge of DUI that the defendant is or has been legally entitled to use the alcohol or drugs she may have consumed. In other words, the fact that the defendant may have taken drugs as directed by a physician pursuant to a prescription or otherwise does not excuse the defendant's liability for DUI if her ability to safely operate a vehicle is impaired as a result of the introduction of such drugs into the defendant's body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Salgado concedes that the first sentence accurately reflects the law as prescribed by Utah Code section 41-6a-504.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6a-504 (LexisNexis 2014) (\"The fact that a person ... is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or a drug is not a defense against any charge of violating [the DUI statute].\"). But Salgado argues that \"the jury could have understood [the second sentence] to mean that [it] could not consider the fact that [she] took tramadol as prescribed ... as evidence that [she] was not impaired.\" We disagree with Salgado's reading of Instruction 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b647 The second sentence of Instruction 19 reiterates the law in simple terms and tailors it to drug impairment, which was the relevant scenario at trial. The second sentence does not bar the jury from considering evidence that Salgado took tramadol as prescribed to mitigate a finding of impairment. Instead, it accurately states the law: legal use of prescription drugs is not a defense to DUI \"if [an individual's] ability to safely operate a vehicle is impaired\" as a result of taking the medication. Accordingly, we conclude that Instruction 19 was a correct statement of the law and properly given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b648 Because we conclude that any error in providing Instruction 18 was harmless and that the trial court did not err in providing Instruction 19, we need not address Salgado's contention that these instructions prejudiced her defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   III. Lesser Included Offense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b649 Salgado contends that the trial court improperly denied her request \"to instruct on minimum-speed violation as a lesser-included offense of DUI.\" \"A defendant's request for a lesser included offense instruction is evaluated under the evidence-based standard set out in Utah Code section 76-1-402(4).\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In interpreting this standard, the Utah Supreme Court has determined that a defendant is entitled to such an instruction where (1) \"the charged offense and the lesser included offense have overlapping statutory elements\" and (2) \"the evidence 'provides a rational basis for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

She testified that she was driving slowly because her \"car was making a strange noise\" and she \"was afraid [she] was going to get into an accident.\" If the jury had credited Salgado's testimony that her slow speed was due to some type of mechanical problem and not due to drug impairment, it would have acquitted on both DUI and minimum-speed violation charges. Based on the evidence presented at trial, there was no rational basis on which the jury could have acquitted Salgado of DUI while convicting her of a minimum-speed violation. Therefore, the court properly denied her request for a lesser included offense instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b652 We conclude that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Salgado was impaired by prescription drugs to a degree that rendered her incapable of safely operating her vehicle.

Even assuming, without deciding, that the exception is an affirmative defense, by testifying that she was driving slowly because she had a flat tire and that her car was making a strange noise, Salgado had put the exception at issue, and the State therefore would have had to disprove it for the jury to convict her of a minimum-speed violation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
