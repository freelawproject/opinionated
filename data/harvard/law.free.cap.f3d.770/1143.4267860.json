(\u201cWWE\u201d), seeks <em>ex parte </em>seizure and temporary restraining orders against unnamed Defendants under the <em>ex parte </em>seizure provision of the Trademark Counterfeiting Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied relief and certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). We allowed appeal and now VACATE the order of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">WWE presented evidence establishing that it owns many valuable trademarks and earns significant revenues from the sale of merchandise bearing those marks at live WWE events across the country. The evidence further established that WWE can readily identify the unauthorized designs of counterfeit merchandise and that WWE makes its own merchandise sales directly \u2014 it does not license third parties to sell merchandise at live events. WWE alleges that Defendants work as \u201cfly-by-night\u201d counterfeiters, setting up shop near WWE events and cannibalizing WWE\u2019s merchandise sales by purveying unauthorized products. As the district court acknowledged, WWE faces a real threat from such counterfeiters who, upon detection and notice of suit, disappear without a trace and hide or destroy evidence, only to reappear later at the next WWE event down the road. This is the very nature of the \u201cfly-by-night\u201d bootlegging industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-18\">WWE brought suit in the district court seeking <em>ex parte </em>seizure and temporary restraining orders under the <em>ex parte </em>seizure provision of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied relief, concluding that WWE had not proved \u201cspecific facts\u201d about the identities of \u201cperson[s] against whom seizure would be ordered.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without knowing the identities of persons against whom seizure would be ordered, the district court thought it was unable to evaluate WWE\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>likelihood of success in showing such persons had used a counterfeit mark, whether the harm to WWE outweighed the harm to such persons, or whether such persons would destroy or make inaccessible the infringing goods upon notice. The district court applied similar reasoning in denying WWE\u2019s request for a temporary restraining-order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">The district court\u2019s granular focus on the \u201cidentity\u201d of unnamed Defendants misinterpreted the statutory requirement and its application here. The district court is correct that <em>ex parte </em>seizure orders should not be granted at will, and it commendably gave the requirements careful attention. It is the case that the Act constrains the issuance of such orders with certain procedural protections for the persons against whom they are issued. The district court concluded that it could not, <em>ex ante, </em>identify the persons against whom orders would issue as required by section 1116(d), an appropriate concern but one not present on the specific facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">The district court\u2019s concern overlooks a predicate established in this case: WWE does not license third parties to sell merchandise at live events. Rather, it makes its own merchandise sales directly. The resulting confined universe of authorized sellers of WWE merchandise necessarily \u201cidentifies\u201d any non-WWE seller as a counterfeiter. WWE cannot know in advanee the specific identities of counterfeiters who will present themselves at any given event, but it does know that any non-affiliated seller at or near an event is almost certainly a counterfeiter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, therefore, the \u201cperson[s] against whom seizure would be ordered\u201d are readily identifiable as any non-affiliated person purporting to sell WWE merchandise at or near a live WWE event. Provided that observation of unauthorized sales themselves is sufficient to identify a counterfeiter, as in this case, we see no reason why the district court- cannot evaluate the requirements for <em>ex parte </em>seizure and temporary restraining orders to issue. We conclude from the record that WWE has met its burden under section 1116(d), and that the orders sought here should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-12\">As a final matter, the district court understandably expressed concern about a provision of the proposed order purporting to deputize private citizens \u2014 namely, WWE\u2019s \u201cEnforcement Officials\u201d \u2014 to undertake work more properly the province of law enforcement officers, but it did not reach the issue. On its face, the Act does not appear to authorize private citizens to carry out <em>ex parte </em>seizure orders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, the Act\u2019s sponsors appear to suggest that a court granting such an order might \u201cpermit a representative of the applicant, such as its counsel, to accompany the U.S. Marshal [or other law enforcement officer] to assist\u201d in determining what materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>should be seized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not address the validity of this provision of the proposed order, leaving it to the district court to address in the first instance. The district court is free to modify the proposed order or to draft its own order as it sees fit, consistent with the <em>ex parte </em>seizure provision of the Act and with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is VACATED, and this case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1116(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1168-12\">.

One may ask about a person who legally purchased merchandise bearing a valid trademark and subsequently ventured into the area surrounding a WWE event to resell that merchandise. The <em>ex parte </em>seizure order sought here would not authorize seizure of such merchandise, presenting a risk that the party enforcing the order might mistakenly identify the reseller as a counterfeiter. But, as presented, WWE can readily identify the unauthorized designs of counterfeit merchandise, and the Act\u2019s wrongful seizure provisions would entitle the harmed reseller to a cause of action for any damages. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116(d)(l 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1170-15\">.
