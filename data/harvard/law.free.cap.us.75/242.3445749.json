Drakely <em>&amp; </em>Fen-ton had agreed to receive, on consignment, from McCabe <em>&amp; </em>Co., <em>hams, </em>shoulders, prime.and new pork; to sell the property at the highest market price, and to advance, on each shipment, at certain specified rates. In pursuance of this understanding, McCabe &amp; Co. made two shipments, one of barrelled meat, and the other of shoulders, in tierces, on which they drew drafts in favor of Gregg &amp; Hughes to the amount of $59,000 which were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-10\">Soon after this the <em>hams </em>were sent. On .the day succeeding their shipment, the Baltimore firm received a telegram, which was followed by a letter from Gregg &amp; Hughes, of Chicago, claiming title to all the property, and requesting that the bills of lading for the hams might not be negotiated until the whole matter was properly adjusted; and, until then, Drakely &amp; Fenton did not know that Gregg &amp; Hughes had any interest in the property consigned to them. It seemed, from Gregg &amp; Hughes\u2019s letter, that they liad furnished Mc-Cabe &amp; Co. with money to cut and pack hogs, and had taken in security, the warehouse-receipts on all the pork products, which afterwards came into the possession of Drakely &amp; Fenton. The intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes resulted in nothing more being paid to McCabe &amp; Co., and in a final direction from McCabe &amp; Co. to Drakely &amp; Fenton, to place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the proceeds of all the pork products consigned to them, to the credit of Gregg &amp; Hughes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">It appeared, from the conduct of the parties, that there was no apprehension, until long after Gregg &amp; Hughes had intervened, that the portion of these products, covered by the two first shipments, would not bring, when sold, enough to reimburse Drakely &amp; Fenton for what they had advanced on them. But it so happened, in the vicissitudes of trade, that the hog market greatly declined, and that the proceeds of the pork and shoulders were inadequate to repay the money which was advanced upon them. The hams having sold for a large sum over charges and advancements, Drakely &amp; Fen-ton insisted that they were entitled to a lien on the proceeds, for their general balance arising out of the deficiency on the sale of the pork and shoulders, which right was denied by Gregg &amp; Hughes, and hence this litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">The question depended, of course, upon the fact, whether the intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes had changed the relation of principal and factor, which had previously existed .'between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and separated the consignment of hams from the preceding consignments. \u2022This, of course, was a question, depending oil the terms on which the hams had been received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">The evidence,'on this point, consisted of a long correspondence, and of some oral testimony.

McCabe &amp; Co., of this city, to pack pork with, and have been getting from them their warehouse receipts, with policy of insurance, covering the same security. We have been shipping the property to New York on B. L. in our name, where it was held for our account. <em>Some few days ago, Col. McCabe, of the firm named, handed us a letter from your house, authorizing them to make sight drafts on you, bn the basis of certain figures therein named, the drafts to be accompanied by B. L. </em>These shipments they made without our knowledge in their own name, <em>and gave us only a portion of the proceeds of the drafts made on you, payable to our order, viz., one for </em>$41,000, <em>and another for </em>$18,000. To THIS WE DID NOT MAKE ANY SERIOUS OBJECTION, US they had been ...cutting a few hogs with money obtained from another source, and we presumed they Wanted to close that account. There was still a considerable quaritity of lard and hams remaining here, which we supposed was sufficient to secure us for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>advances here, in addition to what we had in New York. Subsequently, they shipped the lard to you, on their own account, for which we got nothing yet. Col. McCabe, however, told us that we should have the benefit of anything that might be in your hands, from the sale of the property shipped you on B. L. in the name of McCabe &amp; Co., the lard included, after, your advances apd charges were paid. <em>We were satisfied with that arrangement, and on Friday last proposed that toe would ship to you, in a few days, the hams that were still here, there being then about a thousand tierces in which we were interested, and we would not draw anything upon them until they were sold. </em>Col. McCabe told us, at that time, he would leave on Saturday morning for New York, <em>and we were to attend to the shipping of the hams ourself. </em>To our surprise, this morning (Monday), we found that McCabe did not go to New York, as contemplated, but remained here and shipped the hams himself to your house, on yesterday (Sunday), and this morning left for your city himself. Now, the last move, to us, does not look right, and we are not satisfied with it. We, consequently, write to you <em>all the facts </em>in connection with our dealings with McCabe &amp; Co., and will deem it an especial favor, <em>if you will hold off making further advances to them, over and above the </em>$41,000 <em>and </em>$18,000 <em>sight drafts drawn in our favor. The property shipped you is virtually and legally ours, and we hold Me Cabe\u2019s warehouse receipts for it. </em>If .you will delay <em>the payment </em>of anything further to McCabe &amp; Co. until we can advise with them, and. direct the property to be placed with you for our account, we will feel very grateful to you; and if they refuse to comply with our request,' we can then take steps to make them surrender the' property or reimburse us for our advances. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\"><em>We do not wish your interests in </em>the. <em>matter to be impaired in the least; we want you to sell all the property consigned to you; but we do not want the proceeds paid over to McCabe &amp; Co., until we are secured, nor do we want any sale for the future made, unless the sales are placed to our credit. </em>McCabe &amp; Co. may have the very best intentions in this matter, and we hope they have, but the course pursued is not exactly as we would have done, and we think very strange of McCabe &amp; Co., for having moved <em>property belonging to us without our consent. </em>We desire that they shall have the benefit of everything <em>the pork, lard shoulders, and hams bring over the amount </em>we have in them.....

Finding, however, that they had themselves forwarded it, we distrust them, and while we sanction and adopt the selection of your firm <em>as the consignees of all the </em>property, we give you notice of <em>oar title to all the property </em>and request you to hold off making further advances to McCabe &amp; Co.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-10\">These admissions prove the transaction to have been one, where the owners of property, after permitting an agent to establish in his own name relations with a third party, or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>which is the same thing, not objecting to those relations, wheu he learns they have been established, but availing himself, of them, becomes dissatisfied, discloses his ownership, and takes upon himself the further conduct of the business. In other words, the case is one in which the principal, intervening in a transaction between his agent and a factor, has recognized their relations and proceeded to carry them out. That in such a case, the factor would have a lieu for his general balance is so clear, that the point need not be discussed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">The main question, then, is one of fact. Did Gregg &amp; Hughes recognize the relation of principal and factor, established between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton by the correspondence and acts of the parties respectively, and assume the obligations thereby created in regard to <em>all </em>the property, pork, shoulders, and hams,.consigned by the former to the latter?</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6g\">McCabe &amp; Co.\u2019s letter of the 6th January, proposed to forward <em>pork, shoulders, and hams, </em>mentioning the quantities, and inquiring about advauces.. Drakely &amp; Fenton\u2019s letter of 10th January, states what advances will be made. McCabe &amp; Co., Janu\u00e1ry 13th, 1865, advise that shipments will be made accordingly, on the 16th, of the pork; aud that the hams and shoulders will go forward the next. week. The pork and shoulders go forward accordingly, and drafts ^mounting to $59,000 are paid. The hams are forwarded also, as-promised, <em>by the same parties, </em>on the 21st January, with a bill of lading dated the 23d.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">Gregg &amp; Hughes intervene on the 22d. Had they not intervened, there would have been no question as to the right of Drakely &amp; Fenton to a lien for their general balance. Their letter of 22d January is a portion of the evidence relied on, to show that this intervention was but the substitution of a principal in place of an agent in-dealings with a factor. Was there a reason for such a substitution ? Touching <em>all </em>the property, pork, shoulders, and hams, McCabe &amp; wJQg. were but agents dealing with the property of their principal, whose absolute title was the warehouse receipts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The conduct of the-agents exciting distrust, .there was a reason why the principal should substitute himself in their place.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">- From the use of the words <em>all of the property, </em>in the letter of 22d January, it would be fair to argue that not only the hams, the consignment of which was the occasion of that letter, but the pork and shoulders were meant. The next sentence, however, removes all doubt on this score. \u201cWe desire that they shall have the benefit of everything, <em>the pork, lard, shoulders, and hams, </em>bring over the amount we have on them.\u201d Here then was a setting up of ownership of <em>all </em>the property, assuming the control of <em>all </em>of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">The subsequent correspondence corroborates this view, and shows that Gregg &amp; Hughes stepped into the place of R. McCabe &amp; Co., in <em>all </em>respects as regards <em>all </em>the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">\u25a0 Indeed, it is difficult to see how Gregg &amp; Hughes could make their determination to deal with <em>all the pork products </em>consigned to Drakely &amp; Fenton by McCabe &amp; Co., as their own particular property, plainer than they have done by their letter of 31st January, 1865. Then comes the letter of Drakely <em>&amp; </em>Fenton to Gregg &amp; Hughes, of February 3d, 1865, in which they recognize the claim of the latter to deal with the property as their own, attorning to them, as it were.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">On the 6th February, Gregg &amp; Hughes wrote to Drakely &amp; Fenton: \u201c <em>We claim the whole of the property </em>\u2014 the <em>hams, pork, and shoulders </em>\u2014 our <em>receipts cover them.\u201d </em>The extracts given in the statement of the case <em>(supra, </em>p. 244 to p. 252) show that Gregg &amp; Hughes at this time, made no distinction' between the hams, and the pork, and shoulders; but set up the right to deal with all alike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-10\">'But the correspondence does not leave-us merely to infer, from the ownership alone, that, the hams were responsible for the advances made or for the general balance, when the final account sales of the whole was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-11\">The letter of February 9th, 1865, not only speaks of the hams and shoulders as in the same category, but refers to the letter \u00a9f the 10th January, fixing the rate of advances, shown by R. McCabe to Gregg &amp; Hughes, and it distinctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>informs Gregg &amp; Hughes that a new rate must be adopted. In other words, the advances originally proposed, owing to. the fall of prices, had turned out to be greater than should have been allowed; so that in determining now what was to be advanced hereafter, good margins on all the shipments were to be provided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A16\">Now was the time for Gregg &amp; Hughes to have made their present point, and to have said: \u201cWe cannot let the hams go in with the pork and shoulders, so as to give you a margin on all the shipments, for that would give you alien for your general balance. This will never do. The hams were a separate transaction, and .must be kept apart from the pork and shoulders. Deal with McCabe &amp; Co. for the latter; but the hams are an especial consignment, to he accounted for by itself.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-7\">The letter in reply is dated February 11th, <em>and makes no comment </em>in this connection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">The next letter is dated February 22d \u2014 this too <em>is silent upon the subject.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-9\">The next, dated February 27th, <em>instead of remonstrating </em>against Drakely &amp; Fenton\u2019s views in regard to the liability of all the property, pork, shoulders, and hams, for the advances already made, expressly confirms it. They say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-10\">\u201c <em>We hand you memorandum Of property in your hands which our order </em>covers, <em>subject to two drafts made by McCabe f Co. on you loith transportation .and other regular </em>charges.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-11\">On the memorandum inclosed <em>the hams are put.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-12\">How, in the face of this letter, it can be contended, that the hams were not liable for the two drafts, along with all the other property consigned, is difficult to see.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-13\">The reason for the change in positidh, shown by Gregg &amp; Hughes\u2019s correspondence <em>after </em>May 8th, is evident. The .letter of Drakely &amp; Fenton of that date, reporting the net of all the consignments as not exceeding $10,000, when the net value of the hams alone was so much greater, on which but $10,000 had been advanced, showed the importance of separating the hams from the pork and shoulders, so that the shortcoming of the latter might not become a claim on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the proceeds of the former. There would be reason for this change if in truth any distinction could be drawn between \u201c our hams,\u201d and the \u201cportions of McCabe &amp; Co.,\u201d by which is meant the pork and shoulders. But there was no such difference. . The origin of the title to all these pork products; the actual ownership, as proved by the warehouse receipts; the equitable ownership as security for advances \u2014 all were the same. They were consigned by the same party to the same consignee, Drakely &amp; Fenton. The order of February 25th, directing the proceeds of all the pork products consigned, to be placed to the credit of Gregg <em>&amp; </em>Hughes, made no distinction between \u201c our hams, and other portions of McCabe &amp; Co.\u201d The previous and subsequent correspondence up to the 12th May made no such distinction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">The distinction is not borne out by the fact, and cannot therefore be regarded as having any existence' whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">Regarding then, Gregg &amp; Hughes as the owners, by the same title, of the pork, shoulders, and hams, we find them, after the pork and shoulders had been consigned without their consent, making no serious objection and receiving the proceeds of the advances; we find them also, after the consignment of the hams without their knowledge, insisting that the <em>whole of the property </em>was \u201c virtually and \u2019 legally \u201d theirs, and taking from the-consignors an order on Drakely &amp; Fen-ton for the proceeds of <em>all the pork products consigned; </em>we find them declaring, in so many words, that the property which the order covered, including the hams now in dispute, was subject to the consignors\u2019 two drafts, the transportation and other regular charges, the liability now denied; we find thei\u00f1 throughout controlling the disposition and management of all the property, and making no objections, when Drakely &amp; Fent\u00f3\u2019\u00c9rreferred to the <em>whole </em>as a security for the advances, leaving them to suppose, if they had ever doubted on the subject, that this was a thing of course; we find them, in a word, acting in the premises as though the relation of factor and principal as to all the consignments, had been established between the plaintiffs in error and themselves, until the fall in prices and the indifferent condition of much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the property made it probable that the pork and shoulders would uot cover the advances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">Surely upon this case there was evidence, if not proving, at least tending to prove our defence, that after the hams were received by Drakely &amp; Fenton, Gregg &amp; Hughes, with entire knowledge of the agreement between McCabe &amp; Co., and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and its partial performance, ratified and adopted it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">If the evidence but <em>tended </em>to prove this case, the court below erred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-8\">As respects the oral testimony of Hughes, it may be said so far as a want of legal precision is suggested in the letter of the 27th February, that it is the legal preeision used which frees the case from all doubt. Nothing can well be imagined clearer with regard to what the drafts covered than the expression of that letter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-9\"><em>Messrs. S. T. Wallis and J. H. </em>Thomas, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-10\">The hams being confessedly the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, could not cease to be theirs, or become subject to a lien in favor of any one else, except by some contract of their own, founded upon a legally adequate consideration, of which there is no pretence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-11\">McCabe had entered into no obligation to ship the hams to cover possible deficiencies which might arise from advances made on the other meats. The advance on each was specific, the bill of lading always accompanying the draft to show on what it was drawn. Even as against him, Drakely &amp; Fenton had no claim on the hams till in their possession, and he might have diverted the consignment after it was made. If, however, the arrangement between him and these last had been different, Gregg &amp; Hughes drily acquiesced in the shipment of the other meats and the imposition of a lien thereupon by him. They reserved their property in the hams, and right to ship them in their own names,-and so notified to Drakely &amp; Fenton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-12\">If McCabe had been under an obligation to ship the hams, and Gregg &amp; Hughes had been bound by it, they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u2022have been entitled to the corresponding benefits of the contract \u2014 to the advance of $40 per tierce on the 983 tierces, to $39,323, which is' more than the amount they now claim out of them. If they had meant to subordinate their rights to that agreement, they could have got from him drafts to that amount, which the appellants would have been bound to accept. But they never asked for more than $25,000, and the appellants refused to advance even that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-6\">Gregg &amp; Hughes claimed the hams as their own, claimed none of [he benefits, admitted none of the liabilities arising from the contract between McCabe and the other side, except as to the shipment of the pork and shoulders, and the lien imposed on them. They waived no title to the hams, but reserved the right to deal with them- as their own property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">Their receiving a portion of the proceeds of the drafts drawn on the pork and shoulders, did not affect their right to the hams. It was received, under an agreement with McCabe, that the hams were to continue their own,be shipped by them in their own names, on their own account, and they so wrote to Drakely &amp; Fenton, before the hams went into their possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">The taking by Gregg &amp; Hughes of the order for the proceeds of pork and shoulders, and the assignment of the bill of lading for-the hams, did not impair the right they already had to the hams. They' do not claim title under those papers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">The expression used in the letter of the. 27th of February, cannot hav6 the effect of subjecting the hams to a lien, or rendering the proce\u00e9ds of them liable to a de mtion for the drafts which had been drawn on the pork and shoulders, in view of all the facts. Even if Gregg &amp; Hughes had meant, and had expressly promised to pay these drafts themselves, or make their hams liable for them, such a promise would have been void for want of consideration. The other side, as acceptors, were bound to pay them to us, and we, if compelled, as indorsers, to pay them to apy one else, might have recovered them from the former. It was a debt due by Mc: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Cabe to Drakely &amp; Fenton, for which our clients were in no way liable, and a promise by them to pay it, or make their property responsible for it, was a promise to answer for the default of another, <em>nudum pactum, </em>and void, under the Statute of Frauds.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Admissions are useful to determine doubtful questions, not to take away or qualify clear, rights. They must be deliberate, \u201cnot.fished out of loose expressions in mercantile correspondence.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">Gregg &amp; Hughes might have replevied the hams from the railroad company, before they reached Drakely &amp; Fenton, or from these afterwards, on tendering the freight and charges on them'specifically. The amount which Drakely &amp; Fenton would have been compelled to tender before replevying them, is still the testes to the character and amount of liability to which they were then subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">If the hams had never been shipped, the loss arising from deficiency of the other meats, to coyer. advances made on them, would have fallen on the other side, not on us. Nothing in the case justifies the transfer of the loss to us. The' other side, having exhausted,their security, seek now to exhaust that of our clients, who are creditors of McCabe, and losers by him to a much larger amount than they.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-8\">Although factors have a lien Upon goods actually in their hands, or the proceeds of them for a general balance, it is. only for a balance due by the principal, against whom it is sought to be asserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\">All the facts assumed in the court\u2019s instructions were admitted, and the court, construing the letters between the parties, according to their proper and legal effect and force, was right, in substantially saying to the jury, that they contained no sufficient agreement, whereby the appellants had acquired the right to charge the property of the appellees for advances made on other property, to McCabe, and not to the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The appellant\u2019s prayers were properly ^-ejected, because they all fell short of the law of the case. They assumed, that if the jury could establish the relation of principal and factor, between the appellants and appellees, as to all the consignments, a lien upon all would follow as matter of law and matter of course, without reference to the circumstances under which that relation was created, or the intention of the parties who entered into it.. This theory and assumption are bn tenable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">The lien of factors for a general balance is an implication of law, and, therefore, never arises where there is a special arrangement, or the circumstances rebut such implication. Special circumstances indeed always control it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">The doctrine of lien applies only where the deposit of the goods is in the nature of a pledge, and does not apply where it is made for a special purpose.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">Nor does any lien arise for antecedent debts of the principal, by reason of the subsequent creation of the relation of principal and factor.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The property on which the lien is sought to bo fixed must not only belong to the party from whom the debt is due to the factor, but it must come -to his hands as the agent of that party.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-10\">And where the factor is not acting in the capacity of general factor, but only in regard to a special consignment or adventure, he has no lien for a general balance.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-11\">These well-recognized principles are conclusive, <em>d </em>fortiori, where the effort is, as here, to establish a lien against one principal, for advances made to another, by a sort of process analogous to <em>merger </em>at CQjnmon law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-12\">\n<em>Reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">The argument of the other side \u2014 and such was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the view taken in the court below, is, that admitting the construction put by us on the letter of the 27th, there was no consideration for the responsibility insisted on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-6\">Now there are two answers to this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-7\">Looking at the letter of the 27th February, and seeing that, in terms, the hams were made responsible, along with the pork.and shoulders, for the $59,000 already advanced\u2014 Drakely &amp; Fenton, on the 2d March, acknowledging the receipt of the letter of the 27th February, whose contents they say they have carefully noted, consent to make a further advance, and subsequently do actually advance the farther sum of $10,000. This is a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-8\">But there is a second answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-9\">The letter of the 27th February is not a single fact in the case, containing a promise, so to speak, for which there was no consideration, but one of a series of facts, going to show that Gregg &amp; Hughes recognized tbe acts of McCabe &amp; Co. up to that time, and assumed and continued all the obligations of their relations to Drakely &amp; Fenton. Some of these facts are to be found in the admissions of the letter of the 20th January, others in subsequent letters, already com: mented <em>on; </em>and the letter of the 27th February is but a recognition of a state of things, <em>not created by it, but existing preciously, </em>the proof of which it facilitates, and that is. all. It is an admission of a. fact that was susceptible of proof, less absolute, perhaps, but sufficient for all that, without it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-10\">References to the letters of Gregg &amp; Hughes 'of March 8th, 15th ; to Drakely &amp; Fenton\u2019s letter of March 20th; and again to Gregg &amp; Hughes\u2019s letter of April 25th, corroborate the views taken by us of their relations to all .their property in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-11\">Recollecting that but $10,000 had been advanced on the hams, which, under unfavorable circumstances, produced $37,694.76, it is impossible to read this last letter and believe that, when it was written, Gregg &amp; Hughes believed that the hams were a separate transaction, or that they were not liable for the general balance on final account, embracing all the consignments. The whole tone of the letter corv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>roborates the view taken by us in the relations between them and the other side touching all the consignments.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> Gist <em>v. </em>Cockey, 7 Harris &amp; Johnson, 140; Robinson <em>v. </em>Marshall, 11 Maryland, 253, 4; Northern Central R.

Their position is, that the evidence in the case proved their defence, or, at least, tended to prove it; and if it did, it was the province of the jury, and not of the court, to say what effect should be given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">It is not denied, that in the dealings between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, there existed the relation of principal and factor, and that if Gregg &amp; Hugnes had not intervened, Drakely &amp; Fenton would have had a lien on the surplus, after all the consignments were closed up, for their general balance. The question then arises, whether this relation was changed by the intervention of Gregg &amp; Hughes? The defendants in error contend that it was, so far as the shipment of hams was concerned, because they were received as the property of Gregg &amp; Hughes, after notice that it was their property; on the contrary, the plaintiffs in error insist that the relation of principal aud factor was unchanged as to all the shipments, for the reason that Gregg &amp; Hughes, after the receipt of the hams by Drakely &amp; Fenton, put themselves in the place of McCabe &amp; Co. in regard to the whole transaction, adopted what had been done in reference to each shipment, and claimed to be the owners of all the property, and did direct and control the disposition of it. The ease was tried substantially on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">There is no dispute that the warehouse receipts gave to Gregg &amp; Hughes the legal title to all the property described ih them;, aud if so, it necessarily follows that McCabe &amp; Co. could not lawfully contract with Drakely &amp; Fenton to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and sell this property without the consent of Gregg &amp; Hughes. There is no doubt if thi's consent had-been obtained in advance of the making of the contract, that Gregg &amp; Hughes would have been bound by it, and could not free themselves from any of the obligations which rested on McCabe &amp; Co. to discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">But as. this consent was not obtained before the movement of the property commenced, the important inquiry is, whether the consignment of hams is separable from the preceding consignments, and whether the loss on the pork and shoulders must be borne by Drakely &amp; Fenton, or by Gregg &amp; Hughes. This must depend on the terms on which the hams were received, and'these terms need not be embodied in the form of a written agreement, but can be gathered from the correspondence and conduct of the parties. If the case stood alone, on the naked fact that notice of title was given while the hams were <em>in </em>transitu, there would be no difficulty. But it is claimed that Gregg &amp; Hughes adopted McCabe &amp; Co.\u2019s contract throughout; substituted themselves in their place as to all the consignments \u2014 pork,shoulders, and hams \u2014 and continued in their own name, the relation of principal and factor, before existing between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton. If this were so, the case would be equally free from difficulty; for, if Gregg &amp; Hughes were not bound by a contract which McCabe &amp; Co. had entered into with reference to their property, they could elect, after being informed of the nature of the contract, to reject it or adopt it, If, with a fulhknowledge of the facts concerning it, they ratify' it, they thereby make themselves a party to it, as much so as if the original agreement had been made with them. And if they ratified it, no new or additional consideration was re-quired to support the ratification, because in adopting the contract, they accepted with it the original consideration on which it was founded, as a sufficient consideration for their adoption of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">With t\u00ediis general statement of the principles of law applicable to the controversy, we are met with the inquiry, whether there is any evidence in the case to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>theory of the plaintiffs in error, that Gregg &amp; Hughes intended to, and did, adopt tipe contract of McCabe <em>&amp; </em>Co. with them. It is not enough that Drakely &amp; Fenton should have so understood the agreement, but the proof must also show that Gregg &amp; Hughes had a similar understanding of.it, and manifested their intention to be bouud by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The evidence in the case, to which no exception was taken, consists of a voluminous commercial correspondence, and some parol proof, explanatory of the conduct of the parties. The correspondence covers many pages of the record, and there is <em>a </em>marked difference in its tone and. bearing after it had progressed for several months. It would be difficult to discuss the evidence in reference to the theory advanced by the plaintiffs in error, without indicating', in a greater or less degree, our views as to the effect that should be given to it. If the case is to be tried again, it is not proper to do this, for in that event it is the province of the learned court and the jury to determine the effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The only question with which we have to deal at the present time is, whether the evidence in this record <em>tended </em>to prove the position assumed by the plaintiffs in error; for if it did, the learned court should either have submitted the evidence on this point to the consideration of the jury, or if, in the opinion of the court, there were no material extraneous facts bearing on this question, and the contract relied on must be determined by the commercial correspondence alone, then to have interpreted this correspondence and informed the jury whether or not it proved the contract to be of the character contended for by the plaintiffs in error.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\"We have examined the record in this ease carefully, and are of the opinion that there was evidence at the trial which tended to prove that, after the hams were received by Drakely &amp; Fenton, Gregg &amp; Hughes, with full knowledge of the agreement between McCabe &amp; Co. and Drakely &amp; Fenton, and its partial performance, ratified and adopted it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Whether the evidence actually proves this ratification and adoption, we express no opinion. It is enough, as we have seen, for the pui\u2019poses of this writ of error, that it tended to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">As the learned court below submitted the case to the jury, on the single issue of legal title to the hams in Gregg &amp;' Hughes, and notice of that title to Drakely &amp; Fenton, it follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court should be reversed, and a</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Venire de novo awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> Turner <em>v. </em>Yates, 16 Howard, 23</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
