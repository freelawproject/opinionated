In May, 1835, an agreement was.entered into between Price and Seymour, which provided, on the part of Price, that he should devote his time and best judgment to the selection and purchase of. land, to an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars, in certain designated States and Territories, or in such of them as hs--might find most advantageous to the interest of Seymour; that the purchases should be made during the then existing year, and that the contracts of purchase should be made, and the conveyances taken in the name of Seymour; and &amp;n the part of Seymour, that Ije should furnish the five thousand dollars; that the lands purchased should be sold within five years afterwards-, and that of the profits made by such purchase and sale, one-half should be paid to Price, and be in full fon his services and expenses. Under this agreement, lands having been purchased by Price and the title taken in the name of Seymour ; Held,</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-8\">i. That Seymour took the legal title in trust for the purposes specified; that is, to sell the property within the time limited, and, after deducting from the proceeds the outlay, with interest and'taxes, to\u2018pay over to Price onc-half of the residue; and that, to this extent, Seymour was a trustee, and Price the <em>cestui que trust.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-9\">ii.

That the principle of equitable <em>conversion </em>being applied to the ease, and the land which was to be converted into money, being regarded and treated in equity as money, the personal representative of Price was the proper person to maintain this suit, and it was not necessary that his heirs-at-law should be parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b234-11\">2.

The purchases shall be made.after full and careful searches and explorations, for the most profitable investments, on or near the sites or expectant sites of towns,or places of business, and, in general, in tracts of ground of moderate extent; and the said Seymour covenants, on his part, to furnish $5000 for the above contemplated purchases, and that the lands, purchased as aforesaid, <em>shall be sold within five years from the present time </em>and <em>out of the profit </em>which may be made <em>by such </em>purchase and sale (after charging to the investment, the taxes and other charges, if any, together with 7 percent, interest on the investment and'the charges last mentioned), there shall be paid to the said Price, one-half'of the same, <em>which one-half of the \u25a0profit, shall be, in full of his services and expenses of every kind </em>in making the aforesaid explorations, searches, and in doing all such other things as may be requisite and .proper in making the contemplated purchases. It is understood that the purchases shall be made during the <em>present </em>year, and tnat <em>no </em>payment for services or expenses will be made by said Seymour, <em>except </em>from the profits made <em>as aforesaid.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">Contemporaneously with the making of the contract, Seymour placed into the hands of Price the $5000 mentioned in it. And between June and October, 1835, Price bought about thirty pieces of land in Illinois, thus using all the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The lands were unproductive,'and consisted,in their sundry parcels, of two thousand four hundred and forty acres, and some village lots, situate in Joliet. It was all conveyed to Seymour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">In August, 1837, Seymour died; he left two sons, viz , Horatio and John F., and four daughters, two of them being, at his death, and at the expiration of the five years mentioned in the contract, infants. By his will, he appointed Horatio, John F., and another,his executors; and his real estate, under the directions of his will, went to his heirs, except the share of one daughter, which was vested in trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">No part of the land was sold during the five years specified in the contract. It was admitted of record that, at the expiration of the time- for sale, stated in the contract (May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1840), the lands were unsalable, 'and that it was entirely uncertain how much they could have been sold for, or whether they would ever have brought enough to repay the original investment and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">During the five years, there were no taxes upon, or expenses as to the lands purchased, except taxes upon the-lots in Joliet, amounting, in all, to $19.33. These were paid by Price, with money furnished by Seymour. Subsequently to the five years, Price,-till his own death, in 1854, paid the taxes on the lands; Seymour\u2019s executors furnishing him the money to pay them, as also to pay any small expenses he was put to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">The accounts of Price (indepeiidently of the outlay -for the purchase, and in which all the taxes and expenses just spoken of were entered), began March 4th, 1837. They were headed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-8\">\u201c Aeeount of payments on account of H. Seymour.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">They began 24th December, 1841, comprised eighty-four items amounting to $2054, and rah to near the date of Price\u2019s death in July, 1854, terminating 16th June, 1854. The items were chiefly of taxes on the different pieces of property. But there were several charges for postage on letters, for a small item of travelling expense in paying taxes, for interest on small sums advanced to pay taxes, &amp;c., and one in March, 1845, of $1.53 paid as a charge for advertising a county tax, \u201c because,\u201d said the account, <em>\u201cfunds not sent.\u201d </em>But there was no charge or claim for services by Price or any other, person as agent. In fact, in one or more instances he apparently suffered lands to be sold for taxes. At the date of Price\u2019s death all Price\u2019s charges for taxes paid and for these small outlays had been settled; Seymour\u2019s executors having sent him, from time to time, and apparently'as informed of them, checks for the sums due. Between December, 1841, and Price\u2019s death in July, 1854, the executors had thus sent him about sixteen different checks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-10\">Price', as already said, died in July, 1854, in Illinois. John High became his administrator. High now looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>after the lands; under what exact source of interest was a matter disputed. His accounts of money received and of lands sold were thus headed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Account of money received from heirs and devisees of Henry Seymour, deceased (after his decease and after decease of Jeremiah Price), by John High, Jr., as agent for heirs and devisees, to pay taxes and other expenses on lands aioresaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\">\u201c Account of sales made by John High, Jr., as agent for estate, heirs and devisees of Henry Seymour, deceased, from lands purchased by Jeremiah Price, dece\u00e1sed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">In 1.855 and 1856, High negotiated sales of portions of the land, which were consummated by contracts executed by the heirs and the purchasers. The sales were profitable.. Two hundred acres were sold for $69,200; and High now, as administrator of Price, alleging that the original outlays, costs, and interest had been repaid, claimed one-half the surplus; contending that he was entitled to it under the contract of 1835. The representatives of Seymour not being of this opinion, High (who dying in the course of the suit was succeeded by Freer), now, February, 1857, filed a bill in the court below against all the executors of-Seymour, his heirs-at-law, and the trustees of the <em>cestui que trust\u2019s </em>daughter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">The bill set out the contract, stated that no sales had been made within the five years, and that Price had not insisted on their .being so made, because it was thought that the interest of all'parties would be promoted by holding on for better times, but that nothing was done to release Seymour or his representatives ironl their original obligations; that High, after Price\u2019s death, had acted as agent of Seymour\u2019s representatives, and effected sales; and that the original $5000, interest, &amp;e., being all refunded, and the surplus being clear profits, he, High, as administrator, claimed ouehalf of it for the estate of Price, and that he had always been and was bow ready to agree upon and define the relative rights of the two-estates, and divide the profits, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>in consequence of the number of the parties interested, on Mr. Seymour\u2019s part, the distance of their residence from the subject-matter, the death of the original party, and the intervention of descents, marriages, &amp;c., and from the refusal of several of the parties so in interest to admit Price\u2019s rights,, he was dfraid that in case the residue of the lands should be sold out, and the whole converted into money and be allowed to go into the hands,of Seymour\u2019s representatives,-he would, owing to their number and to the fact of their- residence being without the jurisdiction of the courts of the State where the whole profits had been made, lose Price\u2019s share; on which iaccount as he conceived the interposition of a court of equity was necessary. <em>Price\u2019s heirs were not made parties to t)\\.e bill.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">The answer, admitting the agreement, purchase, and advance of money, stated that the lands were situated near Price\u2019s residence, and being wild required no particular care; that during the five years Price did nothing except what was .required of him by his agreement; that at the death of Seymour one of the defendants was a married woman, and two others were infants. It denied that the omission td sell during the five years was for the benefit of the defendants, but averred, on the contrary, that both Seymour, in his lifetime, and the defendants, afterwards, had at all times been anxious to sell if they could do so without loss. It denied that Price did not waive a right to have the property sold within five years, but averred, on the contrary, \u2022that he did. It averred, moreover, that Price always treated the defendants as the sole owners, and solely entitled t.o the proceeds, and never pretended to have any interest; that he refused to pay the taxes or any portion of them; \u201c but claimed that he ought to be allowed a reasonable compensation for his services as agent, and not under the contract;\u201d that the defendants had always been willing to allow hira such compensation. It set up further that by the legal effect of the agreement Pric\u00e9\u2019s interest was to be half the profits to be got upon a sale to be made in five years, and averred that no profits on sales could be made or were made within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>that time; and averred that the defendants had in no way continued or extended the agreement with Price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-6\">As to any claim for a breach of the agreement in not selling in five years, the answer pleaded the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-7\">As to the agency and the expenditures of High, it stated that after the death of Price he, High, was requested by Horatio and-John F. Seymour to-find purchasers for the land if he could; but that he had no other power respecting the lands; that the contracts for-the parcels sold were executed by the defendants and not by High; that the negotiations for such sales were made by the defendants through High, and were subject to the ratification of the defendants, and that High was not employed in consequence of any relationship which he had to Price or to his estat\u00e9, or on account of the agreement between Henry Seymour and Price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">Finally, it denied that any cause existed for .the interppsition of a court of equity, submitted that the defendants w.ere improperly joined, for the want of a common interest among them, and asserted that no receiver was wanted,, the devisees of Seymour being all well known as citizens of New York, and fully competent to dispos^ of the lands without the aid of a receiver, and not wanting in ability to ref\u2019und, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">General replic\u00e1tions were filed. No proofs were taken, nor did it appear from the evidence, that any letters from either side were called for or produced. Certain facts were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">An interlocutory decree making a reference to a master adjudged that Price, by virtue of the agreement of 1885, was \u201centitled, as an equal copartner\u201d in theprqperty to one equal half of the net profits ihade, of to be made from the sales; that the lands having been purchased by Price as an \u201cadventure or investment on joint account of himself and said Seymour,\u201d the sales already made and the sales yet to be made were to be deemed and taken as made, and to be made \u201con joint account\u201d of the estates of Seymour and Price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-11\">The final decree recited the former decree and a master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>report made to enable the court to administer the property on \u201cjust partnership principles,\u201d and, after making a disposition of the.proceeds of sales of the lands, it provided that \u201cthe balance which shall remain thereof being clear profits of the <em>partnership </em>land purchase and sale up to the present time, be equally divided between the parties in this suit: one-half to the complainant, and.the other half to be held by the heirs and devisees of Henry Seymour, deceased.\u201d And it spoke of \u201cclosing and selling the partnership accounts so far as the sales and collections have progressed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">The solicitor of the complainants, by consent of parties, was appointed receiver, with an agreement that he might sell at private sale. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">The representatives of Seymour brought the case by appeal here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>Messrs.

The view of the court below is directly in the face-of the authorities, including one in this court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">The main question' then is the interpretation of the contract and whether, no sales' having been practicable within the five years, the old'arrangement either remained or was re-established ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-11\">The contract is one <em>sui generis. </em>The year in which it was made was \u00e1n era of great activity in settling lands in the West. \u201cSites or expected sites of towns or places of business\u201d were sought for' with avidity, and they doubled in-value or increased in a yet greater ratio in a few months, in the hands of the possessors. Mr. Seymour was disposed to enter into this field with a considerable sum of money, and Price, who it is to be presumed had local knowledge and an aptitude for selecting lands, was willing to aid Seymour with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>his local knowledge and active agency for a collateral consideration precisely defined. The question was, how this consideration should be arranged. It was resolved that Seymour should become the purchaser with his own moneys, and Price the purchasing agent, and that the latter should .receive (instead of a <em>per diem </em>allowance, or a commission on the amount of the investment, or the interest of a partner in the <em>ultimate </em>profit or loss), one-half of the profits to be got on a sale of the lands within five years, and should have no such interest as would in any event subject him to a loss or compel him to.advance money. This, at least, is what is specified in precise language. The enterprise was to be rapidly conducted and speedily wound up. Price was to set about the purchases <em>for thwith. </em>The purchases were all to be made in the then <em>present year, </em>and the lands were all to be sold within five years; and the compensation of Price was expressly made to depend upon, and be measured by the results of a transaction <em>thus </em>to be carried on and consummated. And to preclude any pretence of a claim in any other aspect, it is twice inserted that his compensation is to be limited to a moiety of the profits thus arising, and that he is to have no other compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">Such a contract was, in that day, a reasonable one, and there is no ground for believing that the parties meant something beyond what they said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">If this is so, the land having become unsalable in 1840, the representatives of Price had not, at the commencement of this suit, any interest in the proceeds of the-land subse quently sold or in the unsold lands remaining.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">If, however, the representatives of Price have any interest in the profits, the remedy is by an action of law'upon the contract. There is no suggestion that if in such an action the plaintiff establishes his rights to a half of the profits, the defendants ar.e not able and willing t\u00f3 pay him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">The rights of Price and his representatives were barred by the lapse of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">Any personal action for not selling in five years was long since barred by the statute, as the answer sets up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The remedy in equity, if there was any, is sought after the lapse of so long a period that upon settled principles of equity the demand will not be enforced. It will be considered a stale demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">In addition to the defence of a bar by the statute, and to the defect of misjoinder of Seymour\u2019s executors in a matter where they had no interest, the bill omits to make Price\u2019s heirs a party.- If Price\u2019s estate has any interest in the matter, they are chiefly interested and should be parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">Price died in July, 1854, more than fourteen years after the alleged default in selling. He never, during his lifetime, once requested that the lands should be sold, or made anj' claim to. an <em>interest </em>in them. The heading of the accounts negatives all such ideas. The fact that he attended to the payment of taxes with money remitted by Mr. Seymour\u2019s representatives, is quite consistent with the character of an agent, and that he let the lands be sold rather than pay taxes himself, is consistent with no other idea. High\u2019s accounts show that he was employed by the heirs and devisees of Seymour <em>as their agent. </em>The fact that they both acted distinctly as agents, rather rebuts the idea of any other relation. It is a circumstance of weight that a peremptory sale at any time during these twenty years would have resulted in a loss which Seymour\u2019s representatives must have boi\u2019ne alone, as Price and his representatives Were in no way bound to contribute; as it also is that during all this time the burden upon the devjsees of Seym\u00f3ur .was increasing at a rapid rate by the accumulation of interest and taxes and the expenses of agency. Good faith required, on both accounts, that Price shojild have advi\u00e1ed the other party that he claimed a continuing interest, if such waS|the fact. All'idea of a continuance of the contract by m'utual consent is thus repelled. But, as the contract looked solely to a sale in five years, and limited the interest bf Price to th'e profits to be made upon <em>such </em>a sale, it.required a plain understanding on both sides to continue and extend the arrangement to sales to be made after-wards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">By the decree the heirs of Seymour are deprived of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>authority and control over the lands; title is taken from them and vested in a receiver. But there is no allegation that Seymour or his heirs have violated their duty under the contract; nor that they acted improvideutly in disposing of the land sold; or that there is any apprehension that they will not dispose of the residue for the best interest oflall concerned. They reside where Mr. Seymour did when the contract was made, and are responsible persons. The only ground of complaint is, that the appellants deny that, by the contract, they are bound to pay over to the representatives of Price a share of the proceeds of the land after the same are sold. But this is not an adequate cause for equity to compel a specific performance. Much less does it authorize the court to take the property from the appellants and place it in the hands of a receiver, to be sold by <em>him.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Mather, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA1\">argued at length that the case was one of partnership, citing numerous authorities, and that at all events the evidence showed that both Price and High regarded Price as interested, he having no compensation otherwise than in an ultimate share of profits for his many years of service; that selling had gone off without default on either side; the thing being nursed along till a good price could be got; that the case being one of partnership and trust, chancery had -special jurisdiction; that the statute did not run against a trust; that there were no laches; and that the relief given was but adequate and proper.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> Berthold <em>v. </em>Goldsmith, 24 Howard, 536, 542; Hesketh <em>v. </em>Blanchard, 4 East, 144; Vanderburgh <em>v </em>Hull, 20 Wendell, 70, 71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-7\">Mr. Justice SWAYNE</author>\n<p id=\"AMX\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The contract which lies at the foundation of this suit, was entered into by Jeremiah Price and Henry Seymour on the 9th of May, 1835. Upon looking into it carefully, we find it contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Price agreed that he would devote his time and attention and exercise his best judgment, in purchasing lands to an amount- not exceeding $5000, in the States of Indiana-, Illinois, and Ohio, and in the Territories of Michigan and Wisconsin, or in such of them as he should find most advantage-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>o.us for the interest of Seymour: the contracts were to be made and the conveyances to be taken in Seymour\u2019s name: the purchases were to be made after full and careful search for the most profitable investments \u201cin of near the sites or expected sites of towns or places of business,\u201d and in general in tracts of land of moderate \u00e9xtent: Seymour agreed to furnish $5000 wherewith to make the purchases contemplated: that the land so purchased should be sold within five years from the date of the contract: that after charging the investment, the taxes, and 7 per cent, interest on the investment, there should be paid to Price one-half of the profits which should be made : it was agreed that this half of the profits should be in full for Price\u2019s services and expenses of every kind in making the explorations and searches, and in doing all such other things as' should be requisite and proper in making the purchases: the purchases were to be -made during the current year: nothing was to be paid by Seymour for Price\u2019s services or expenses, except from the profits.as aforesaid. The premises in controversy were bought by Price, and the titles vested in Seymour, pursuant to the contract. The property consisted of 2440t2525 acres of laud in the State of Illinois, and several lots in the village of Joliet, in that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">It was agreed by the parties to this suit, that at the expiration of the five years within which the premises were to be sold,'they were unsalable, \u201cand that it is entirely uncertain how much they could have been sold for, or whether they would even have brought enough to pay the original investment and interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Before the commencement of the suit the property had become very valuable; 200 acres had been sold for $69,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Seymour died in 1887, and Price in 1854. The five years within which the property was to be sold, expired in 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The duties and obligations with which the contract clothed Price, were those of an agent. He was to make the requisite searches and explorations in the States and Territories named, and to receive and invest the money of Seymour as he might deem best for Seymour\u2019s interest. He was to contribute his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>time, labor, skill,.and judgment, but no money except wbat might be expended in the service he had undertaken to perform. The titles were all to be taken in the name of the principal, who was to advance the money. These functions were performed by Price. His duties and responsibilities thereupon came to an end, and those of Seymour to him commenced. For his expenditures, whatever they might be, he was to receive no immediate or certain return. The same remark is applicable in respect to his labor and services, and the exercise of his skill and judgment. Everything to be done by the agent he was to do, without any charge to his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Seymour was to receive the titles of the property purchased, as if the purchases had been made by himself at home. All \u2022the burdens incident to the acquisition of the property were to be borne by Price, with only the contingency of reimbursement and compensation provided in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The lands were to be sold within five years. It is not stated by whom, but as the legal title was vested in Seymour, the duty of selling, by the clearest implication, devolved upon him. Price had no power to move in the matter, nor to exert any control, except the right to insist that the property should be sold by Seymour, within the time limited, and that the sales should be fairly conducted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> By an implication equally clear, Seymour was to pay all the taxes upon the property which might accrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">It is proper here to consider the legal and equitable relations of the parties arising out of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">We think Seymour took the legal title in trust for the purposes specified. A trust is where there are rights, titles, and interests in property distinct, from the legal ownership. In such eases, the legal title, in the eye of the law, carries with it, to the holder, absolute dominion; but behind it lie beneficial rights and interests in the s\u00e1me property belonging to another. These rights, to the extent to which they exist, are a charge upon the property, and constitute an equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>which a court of equity will protect and enforce whenever its aid for that purpose is properly invoked.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Interests in real .estate, purely contingent, may be made the subjects of contract and equitable cognizance, as between the proper parties.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The object of the trust here was to sell the property within the time limited, and, after deducting from the proceeds the outlaj7, with interest and taxes, to pay over to Price one-half of the residue.- To this extent, Seymour was a trustee, and Price the <em>cestui que trust. </em>They had a joint interest in the property. Seymour held the legal title, but the rights of Price were as valid in equity as those of Seymour were at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">If Seymour, within the five years, had conveyed the property to one of his children, by way of advancement, or to a stranger, otherwise than upon a <em>bond fide </em>sale for its fair value, the grantee would have taken the title, subject to the trust upon which Seymour held it, and a court-of equity would have followed the property and dealt with it in ail respects as if the title had still remained in Seymour. If a valid sale had been made, the trust would have followed and bound the proceeds in like manner as it bound the property.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Upon the death of Seymour, the legal estate passed to his devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The principle of equitable conversion has an important bearing upon the case. Equity considers that as done which is agreed to be done. Money which, according to a will or agreement, is to be invested in laud, is regarded, in equity,, as real estate; and land which is to be converted into money ? is regarded as money, and treated accordingly.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> In this view of the subject, the personal representative of Price is the proper person to maintain this suit, and it is not necessary that his heirs-at-law should be parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">There is another view7 of the subject, which we think may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>properly be taken. The agreement, that the property should be sold, and half of the profits paid to Price, was a charge upon the property, and gave him a lien to the'extent of the amount to which he should be found entitled-upon the execution of the agreement, according to its terms. The principle involved in this proposition, is \u00e1 familiar one in equity, and constantly applied in the administration of its jurisprudence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">It is insisted by the appellees that the contract made the parties copartners in respect to the lands to be bought. We cannot adopt that view of the subject. The adjudications which bear upon it are conflicting and irreconcilable. The case of <em>Berthold et al. </em>v. Goldsmith<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> is conclusive in this forum against the proposition. We deem it sufficient to refer to that authority, without reproducing the considerations which control the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">But the result is the same as if we held that the parties were copartners. In that event, Seymour would still have held the properly as trustee for the .firm, according to the rights of the respective members.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The appellants contend, that for any violation of the contract to the injury of Price, he had a remedy at law, and that neither he nor his legal representative could have any other. An action at law, sounding in damages, may, undoubtedly, be maintained in such cases for -the breach of an express; agreement by the trustee, but this in nowise affects the right to proceed in equity to enforce the trust and lien created by the contract. They are concurrent remedies. Either, which is preferred, may be selected. The remedy in equity is the better on\u00e9. The right to resort to it, under the circumstances of this case, admits of no doubt, either upon principle or authority. Such, in our judgment, were the effect and consequeuces of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>At the end of the 'five years, limited for its complete fulfilment, a new element, not anticipated by the parties, and, hence, not provided for, intervened. The property, if then sold, would have afforded no profit. There would have been nothing to divide. It is uncertain whether it would have yielded enough to reimburse the cost and interest. According to the views we have expressed, there was a trust and lien for the benefit of Price. They could be destroyed only by some thing subsequently to occur. - Either Price or Seymour's devisees might have insisted upon the sale of the property according to the contract. This would have extinguished the rights of both parties touching the lands, but it would have benefited neither. There would have been no profit for either party. Price would have lost his expenditures of time, money, and skill. The devisees might have lost the interest upon the investment, and, perhaps, a part of the principal..</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The devisees might have held the property, and denied' that, under the circumstances, the trust subsisted any longer. If Price acquiesced, his rights would have been at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Price niight, also, have expressly or tacitly abandoned his claim. This would have worked the same result. Both parties might have concluded to continue their existing relations, and to wait for a more auspicious period for the disposition of the property. - Their interests were the same. What would benefit or injure one could not fail to have the same effect upon theothers. If the purchases werejudiciously made, the course last suggested was obviously the wisest and best for both parties. Was either of the alternatives adopted ? and if so, which one ?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">This is the turning-point of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The burden of the proof as to the two former rests upon the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">. Upon a careful examination of the record we have failed to find the slightest proof of any disclaimer by the devisees, or of any renunciation by Price. If such evidence exist we must suppose it is contained in the correspondence between tfye parties They are annexed to the bill accounts, showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>receipts and disbursements of Price down to the time of his death. The receipts, after the death of Seymour, commence on the 24th December, 1841, and terminate on the 16th of June, 1854. All the moneys were received from Messrs. John F. and Horatio Seymour. It appears, by a stipulation in the record, that the sums with which Price debited himself had all been verified by comparing them with the original receipts in the possession of the counsel of the appellants. The Messrs. Seymour lived in the State of New York, and Price at Chicago. The moneys were all remitted by checks. It is apparent, from the face of the accounts, that the receipt of the money, in many instances, if not in all, must have been acknowledged by letter. None of these letters have been produced. Why not? The inference is a fair one, to say the least, that they contain nothing, unfavorable to the claim of the appellee. This negative feature of the ease is not undeserving of consideration. If Price, neither by expression nor acquiescence, did anything to impair his rights, they must still subsist in full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">We think there is proof in the record, that he and his personal representative considered the time within which the sales were to be made, prolonged until they could be made profitably, and, that in all other respects, the contract remained as if it had originally contained this modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We can hardly conceive how the devisees, who advanced the money to pay the taxes, and with whom Price must have corresponded, could have understood his position differently. It is admitted that from the time of the'purchases down to the time of his- death, Price had the care and charge of the property,, and paid the taxes upon it, the devisees furnishing the money. His accounts are long, and the items numerous. There is no proof that he ever made any charge, or claimed anything for his services. His accounts are silent upon the subject. How can this be accounted for, unless he expected to be compensated by his share of the profits of the lands, to be realized when the proper time for selling should arrive ? _</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Upon his death, High, his administrator, succeeded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>agency. He was employed, by the devisees, and performed the same duties as his predecessor. He negotiated the sales mentioned in the bill, and at once claimed a-share of the profits for Price\u2019s estate, according to the contract. The claim was resisted by the devisees, and he thereupon instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">, The theory insisted upon by the appellees is consistent with all the evidence in the case. It is in conflict with nothing which has been developed. It is alleged, in one of the answers, that Price \u201c never pretended to the defendants to have any interest, . . . but claimed that he ought, to be allowed a reasonable compensation for his services as agent, and not under the contract.\u201d When, where, and how was the claim made? If by letter, why is not the letter produced? The fact is important, but the allegation is wholly unsupported by anything in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The-answers set up the bar of the statute of limitations. Where there is no disclaimer the statute has no application to an express trust, such as we have found to exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">It is said there is a misjoinder of parties iu the bill with respect to the executors of Seymour. The doctrine of equitable conversion renders tlieir presence in the case necessary, if not indispensable. If the objection were well taken, the bill as to1 them would be dismissed. The error would have no other effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">It is alleged, also, that there is a defect of non-joinder as to the heirs-at-law of Price. The application of the same doctrine is a sufficient answer to this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Conceding that the appellee is entitled to have the contract specifically executed, the appellants insist that the court below erred in decreeing that it should be done' by a receiver instead of themselves. There being a trust and a lien a court of equity had unquestionable authority to apply' its flexible and comprehensive jurisdiction in such manner as might be necessary to the right administration of justice between the parties. The devisees are numerous. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>death of any one of them might seriously retard and embarrass the execution of a decree shaped as the appellants suggest. The appointment of the solicitor of the appellants as receiver, and the stipulation, which appears in the record, that he might sell at private sale, protects in the best manner the interests of all concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The court below held that the contract made the parties to it copartners, and the decree was framed accordingly. But, as the provisions of the decree conform in all respects to our view\u2019s, this theoretical error constitutes no ground of reversal. A wrong reason was given for what was properly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201d The litigation app\u00e9ars to have been conducted in a spirit of candor and fairness on both sides, which is eminently creditable to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">We find no error in the record, and the decree of the Circuit Court is.

The interlocutory decree declares that Price, byi virtue of that agreement, \u201c was entitled, as an equal copartner in the property, to one equal .half of the profits made, or to be made, from the sale of the lands that the lands were purchased by Price as an \u201cinvestment . on joint account of himself and said Seymour,\u201d and that the sales made, and to be made, were \u201c to be deemed and taken as made, and to be made, on joint account.\u201d And in the final decree the court administers the property on what it declares to be \u201cjust partnership principles.\u201d It provides for the payment out of the fund of. all the costs and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>penses, and that \u201c the balance which shall remain [of the funds then on hand], being clear profits of the <em>partnership </em>land purchase and sale up to the present time, be equally divided.\u201d And it speaks of \u201c closing and settling the partnership land accounts, so far as the sales and collections have progressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">And the case was presented to this court both in the oral and printed arguments of counsel upon the question whether a copartnership was created between Price and Seymour by the agreement of 1835, or any interest vested in Price in the lands purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We shall consider at some length both parts of this quesr tion, and in disposing of them, we shall dispose, in our judgment, of the entire merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">We do not consider the agreement as creating any partnership between the parties, oras vesting in Price any interest, legal or equitable, in the lands purchased. It provides simply for services to be rendered by Price for Seymoiir, and a contingent compensation to be made to him for such services. It stipulates on the part of Price, that he shall devote his time and best judgment to the selection and purchase of land to an amount hot exceeding five thousand dollars, in certain designated States and Territories, or in such of them as- he may find most advantageous to the interest of Seymour; that the purchases shall be made during the then existing year, and that the contracts of purchase shall be made and the conveyances taken in the name of Seymour; and on the part of Seymour, that he shall furnish the five thousand dollars, that the lands purchased shall be sold within five .years afterwards, and that of the profits made, by <em>such </em>purchase and sale, one-half shall be paid to'Price, and be in full for his services and expenses. And as if to prevent any possible misconstruction, the agreement closes with a declaration that no payment for those services or expenses shall be made except from such profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">By the express terms of the agreement the ownership of the property was to be in Seymour; the lands were to be selected and purchased for his general interest, and the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>was to be taken in his name. The special interest of Price was only in the profits as a means of compensation for his services; and the interest was not in profits which might be made at any time, upon any future sale, however remote, but upon a sale within five years. He was to receive for his compensation one-half that might be realized above cost, interest, and taxes, from the rise of the property within that period.. If language is to be interpreted in its natural and ordinary sense, the contract means that, arid means nothing more nor less. The purchases, it says, shall be made during the present year. The sale shall be made within five years from that time, and one-half the profits from <em>such </em>purchase and sale,.not from purchases or sales made at any other time, shall be paid to Price, not as profits, but as compensation for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">-The provision for the sale in five years was not merely directory-and ..modal; which might be waived by Price without affecting his rights. The subsequent clauses securing a; compensation to him are limited to a sale within the period designated. He was to have half of the profits arising upon <em>such </em>sale; the moiety of the profits made upon such sale was to be in <em>full </em>for his compensation, and he was not to receive anything for services or expenses, except a participation in the profits made \u201c <em>as </em>aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXA\">' To one who is familiar with the history of the growth of the West, there is nothing singular or even unusual in a contract of this kind. With the immense tide of immigration setting in that direction, lands of comparatively little value one day sometimes in a few months become the sites of villages,'and cities, and the source of affluence to their possessors. It is not strange, therefore, that in 1885, a year somewhat noted for its speculative tendencies, a gentleman of capital should propose to one of energy and experience in such matters, that he advance the money, and the latter invest it in lands in- the States and Territories of the West, \u201c on or near the sites, or expected sites, of towns or places of business,\u201d upon a consideration that the latter should receive by way of compensation one-half of the profits which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>be made from the rise of the property iti value within a designated period.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Nor is there anything in contracts of this character which iniposes the obligations or confers the rights of copartners between the parties. There is no copartnership where the relationship boisyeeu the parties is that of master and servant, or of employer and employee, though the compensation of the latter may be in proportion to the profits, or be paid entirely out of them. Under some circumstances parties thus-receiving a portion of the profits may be held, as respects third persons, subject to the liabilities of partners; but as between themselves, aud in the adjustment of their respective rights, no such relation obtains. This has been settled law for more than half a century. Thus, in <em>Hesketh </em>v. <em>Blanchard,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided in 1803, the plaintiff had furnished goods purchased by him on credit, to one Robinson, the testator of the defendants, to take to Africa for purposes of trade, upon an agreement that if any profit should arise from the adventure, he should have one-half for his trouble. The plaintiff having paid for the goods, brought an action for the amount. It was objected in defence, that as the parties were to divide the profits, if any, they must be equally liable for any loss, aud that, therefore, a partnership was constituted between them. But the objection was not sustained, and Lord Elleuborough said that \u201cQuoad third parties it [the agreement] was a partnership, for the plaintiff was to share half the profits; but as between themselves, it was only ah agreement for so much as a compensation for the plaintiff\u2019s trouble, and for lending Robinson his credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In <em>Hazard </em>v. Hazard,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> this doctrine was applied to a case where one of two parties agreed to devote his time to the management of the concerns of factories belonging to the other party, for one-fourth of the profits of the business for the first year, and one-third of the profits for each year after until the expiration of the agreement, which portion of the profits was to be the sole reward for his services. It was held that there was no partnership between the parties. \u201c A mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>participation in the profits,\u201d' said Mr. Jnstice Story, \u201c will not render the parties partners <em>inter sese, </em>whatever it may do as to third persons, unless they so intend it. If A. agrees to give B. one-third of the profits of a particular transaction or business for his labor and services therein, that may make both liable to third persons as partners, but not as between themselves;\u201d and he refers in support of the doctrine to the case already cited of <em>Hesketh </em>v. <em>Blanchard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Similar adjudications have been repeatedly made, we believe, in the highest courts of every State in the Union. Some slight differences exist in them as to the extent in which a participation in the profits of a business, by way of compensation, will render a party liable as a partner to third persons; but there is entire concurrence in the conclusion that such participation alone does not create a partnership between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Cabot and </em>others,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the question presented to the -Supreme Court of Massachusetts was, whether the defendant Cooper was a partner with Cabot, Appleton &amp; Co. The agreement between them was substantially this: Cabot, Appleton &amp; Co. were to furnish Cooper stock to be manufactured into cloth at his mill on their account, and Cooper was to manufacture the cloth and deliver it to them, and was to receive from them a stipulated sum per yard, and one-third part of the net profits of the business. It was held that the parties were not partners, either between themselves or as to third persons; that the agreement-only provided the manner in which the compensation to Cooper for his services in manufacturing the cloth was to be ascertained, and that he had no title to any share of the cloth or any lien thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">In <em>Loomis </em>v. Marshall,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> a case, in some respects, similar to that of <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>was before the Supreme Court of Connecticut, and the liability of a party who receives a portion of the profits of a business as compensation for his services was very elaborately and ably considered. The agreement in the case was substantially this: A. was to furnish B., who occupied a factory, a supply of wool for two years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>to be manufactured into cloths. B. agreed' to manufacture the cloths, and to devote the use of the factory to that purpose, and the net proceeds of the cloths, after deducting incidental expenses and charges of sale, were to be divided so that A. should have fifty-five per cent, and B. forty-five peleen t. The cost of the w-arp used, and the expense of insurance on the wool or cloths, were to be borne by them in the same ratio, and in case of destruction of wool or cloth by fire, the amount received from the,, insurance was to be divided between them, according to the loss of each. It was held that the agreement did not create a partnership between the parties; that the case was properly referable to that class' pf cases in which one party receives a share of the profits or avails as a compensation for services rendered, labor performed, and expenses incurred in the business; and the court observed, that if it should hold that the agreement constituted a partnership, it would change the existing law as to factors, brokers, agents, shipmasters, and seamen, who shar\u00e9 in the profits by way of compensation, or in lieu of .wages, and introduce great perplexity in the adjustment of their legal rights and remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Now, if a party does not become a partner with others in business, general or special, as is above clearly established by the authorities, from the fact that by way of compensation he participates with them in the profits of the business, it follows that he does not, by r\u00e9ason\u2019of such participation, acquire any interest, legal or equitable, in the property which constitutes the basis of the business. It is only upon the-theory that the services rendered by one party are to be considered as an equivalent to the capital advanced by the-other, that a common interest of both in'the property can be asserted. This theory, not resting upon any solid foundation, the inference deduced therefrom, of course, fails. The sharing of the profits not changing the relation of the party as ageut to the one who furnishes the capital,\"the ownership of the property acquired by such capital is not affected. The case of <em>Smith </em>v. Watson<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is conclusive upon this point. In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>one Sampson (whose assignees in bankruptcy were the plaintiffs) employed one Gill, a broker, to purchase whalebone, and, by agreement, was to pay him one-third of the profits made-on the sale of it for his trouble. The defendants were bankers, with whom Sampson kept his account; and the suit was brought to recover an amount in the defendant\u2019s hands, which was the. proceeds of a bill drawn by Sampson on account of a parcel of whalebone which he had sold. Gill claiming to be a partner of Sampson, by means of the agreement, indemnified the bankers and received the money. It was held that the plaintiffs, as assignees of Sampson, were entitled to recover. Bayley, J., said:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201c A right to share in the profits of a particular adventure may have the effect of rendering a person liable to third persons as a partner in respect of transactions arising out of the particular adventure, in the profits of which he is to participate; but it does not give him any interest in the property itself which was the subject-matter of the adventure. Gill\u2019s right to claim property in the whalebone must arise out of the terms of the bargain with Sampson; and looking to them, it appears clearly that it was not joint property. It may be assumed that 'it was purchased in the name of Sampson only, for Gill was a mere agent, and was to have a proportion of the profits in lieu of brokerage. Considering the question in this view, I am clearly of opinion that Gill had no property in the whalebone, or in the proceeds of the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Holroyd, J., said:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. \u201c Assuming it to have been agreed between Sampson and Gill that the latter should make purchases of whalebone, and in lieu of brokerage, should have one-third of the profits arising out of the sales, and that he should even bear a certain proportion of the losses, I am of opinion that although such an agreement might make Gill liable as a partner to third persons, yet that it did not vest in him any interest in the whalebone purchased with the money'of Sampson. Such an agreement would not convert that which was obtained by the separate property of Sampson into the joint property of Samp'son. and Gill. It may be collected from tbp evidence, that the latter did not furnish any part of the money required'to. pay for the whalebone, and that the contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ftir sale were made not in his name, but in that of Sampson, for Gill was to act as a broker only, and to receive a share of the jprpfits in lieu of his brokerage. The money paid for the whalebone being, therefore, Sampson\u2019s separate property, and the contracts being tnade in his name as the purchaser, the property in the thing.purchased would vest, by virtue of the contracts, in him alone.\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">There is no difference in principle between this case and the one under consideration. Price was emploj\u2019ed to purchase land, and Gill was employed to purchase whalebone. Price was to receive one-half of the profits made <em>upon a </em>sale of the land for his services and expenses, and Gill was to receive one-third of the profits on the sale of the whalebone for his trouble. Gill was held not to be a partner with Sampson who employed him, or to have any joint interest with him in the whalebone; and upon the same principle it should be held, in our judgment, that Price was not a partner with Seymour, and did not possess any joint interest with him,, in the land purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">IF the decision in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Watson </em>is sound law, and it has not, that we are aware of, ever been questioned, but, on the contrary, has been uniformly approved by the highest courts of England and of the United States, it is impossible for the complainants to sustain the present suit. The suit proceeds and the decree is rendered, as we have here already stated, upon, the theory that Price and Seymour were copartners, and that the property purchased was co-partnership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">We have shown, as we think conclusively, that Price was not a copartner with Seymour under the contract between them, and that he' did not possess any interest with him in the lands purchased, but that the lands constituted the separate property of Seymour. Price was, it is true, interested in the profits to be made in the sale of the land, according to the terms of the agreement. It was not, howev\u00e9r, the interest df a partner, but the interest which every party to an executory contract has in having the stipulations in his favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>performed by the other party. A personal 'action \u00bfgainst the delinquent party, or his persona] representatives, is the remedy for the breach of an agreement of this character. Resort can be had to equity only when special circumstances intervene to render the action at law unavailable. Undoubtedly Price could have maintained an action at law against the representatives of Seymour had a sale of the property been refused within the five years specified in the agreement, and recovered, as damages, a sum equal to one-half the. difference between the value of the property and the amount of its cost, interest thereon, and expenses. That he did not institute any such action, or make any claim upon them, is explained by the admission accompanying the record, that the property was at that time unsalable, and that it was uncertain whether, if a sale could have been made, it would have brought enough to repay the original investment and interest. The subsequent conduct of Price shows very clearly that' he regarded his right to compensation dependent upon the possibility of effecting a sale at a profit at that time. He lived until July, 1854, more than fourteen years after the expiration of the five years, and he never asserted any claim under the contracty He never requested that the lands be sold, or asserted any interest in them or their proceeds. He uniformly treated the contract as at' an end, and the heirs of Seymour as the exclusive owners of the land and its proceed a,- He subsequently acted as agent for them in paying taxes upon the property. He lived near the property, and it was natural that he should be employed for that purpose. But if funds, even of trifling amounts, were not forwarded to him, he did not advance the money, but allowed the property to be sold. It is difficult to reconcile this conduct with,the theory that he considered himself at the time as having a claim eith\u00e9r upon the land or its proceeds. And it is still more difficult.to account for his entire silence to all the world, to his own relatives and agents, as well as to the heirs of Seymour, respecting any claim upon the property or its proceeds, if he considered that m fact he possessed any. It remained for the administrator of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>estate, nearly three years after his death, to discover that he possessed, during his life, unknown to himself, large and valuable interests in property which he had purchased for others, and in their name, twenty-two years before. The claim now asserted is contrary to the express terms of the contract, and the construction-given to it by Price himself. And even the administrator acted as agent for the heirs in paying taxes upon the property and in negotiating sales for' them until he made the discovery of the supposed rights of his intestate. \\</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It is urged as an objection to the case made by the defendants that they did not produce the letters of Price to them.' It is assumed without any intimation to that effect on the part of the complainant, that those letters might have contained, and not being produced, must be presumed to have contained something against the interests of the defendants. The objection may be answered-by the suggestion that the complainant did not produce the letters of the heirs of Seymour to Price. If they had contained any recognition of the claim now asserted On-behalf of Price\u2019s estate, there can \u2022be no doubt that they would have been brought forth. If it be proper .to invoke presumptions in respect' to the Contents of papers not produced, even when not called for, the presumption against the claim.of. the complainant must be regarded as very -great It is highly improbable that no allusion would be made by the heirs of Seymour to \u2022 the interest of Price in the property, or to his. claiming ah interest, during a correspondence of fourteen years, if,.in truth, he possessed or claimed any.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The case of <em>Stow </em>v. Robinson,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> decided by the Supreme Court of Illinois, presents similar features to the one under consideration, and is authority upon the point, that the remedy of Price, if a sale within the five .years had been refused, whs at law, for breach. Of the contract, and not in equity. The case was this.: Robinson was the owner of a block of land in or near Chicago, and it was agreed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>him and one Eathway that the block should be subdivided, and that Eathway should dispose of the lots for one-fourth cash, the remainder to be secured- by notes payable in one, two, and three years, with interest, Eobinson to give bonds for deeds on receiving the notes, and to execute conveyances \u25a0when the notes were paid. Out- of the proceeds obtained Eobinson was to receive the purchase-money of the block, with interest, and the balance was to be'equally divided between the parties; and for his share upon this division Eathway was to plat, survey, or subdivide the block, and advertise and sell the same at his own expense. Eathway, under the agreement, subdivided the block into lots, and sold a portion of them', when Eobinson stopped the sale, and refused to allow any further sale, or to execute any more title-papers. Eathway having died, his heirs and personal representatives filed their bill to compel a performance of the agreement. The court held that by the agreement Eathway did not acquire any vested interest-- in the land itself, and if he was prevented from executing his part of the agreement, he had his remedy by an action at law for damages, and that his remedy was clearly not in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The difference between this case and the one under consideration is circumstantial; the principle is the same in both. The services- rendered in each were the meritorious cause for the compensation to be made by the owner of the land. In the case cited it was the platting, surveying, subdividing, advertising, and selling the land; in the ease-at bar it was the selection .and purchase of'the' land. The difference in the services is not material. The contract stipulating for the services in the case cited created in Eathway no interest in the land held by Eobinson; and for the same reason the contract in- the case at bar, in our judgment, created in Price no interest in the land held by Seymour. If Price possessed no such interest, there can be no pretence that the land was subject to any trust for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In our judgment the decree below should be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> 4 East, 144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"> 1 Story, 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\"> 6 Metcalf, 83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\"> 12 Connecticut, 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> 2 Barnewall &amp; Cresswell, 401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\"> 24 Illinois, 532.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
