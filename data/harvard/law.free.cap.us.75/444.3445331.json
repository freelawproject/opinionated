The mortgage was given to secure a bond for the payment of a certain sum in gold and . silver coin, lawful money of the United States. The payment relied on was a tender of United States notes equal in nominal amount to the sum due on the bond and mortgage. The Supreme Court of New York held the tender sufficient, and adjudged satisfaction ; and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and was now here for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-13\">\n<em>Mr. J.
