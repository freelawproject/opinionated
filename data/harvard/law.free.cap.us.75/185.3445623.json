The claimant <em>also had a license to take out certain </em>articles, a schedule of.'which was attached to the safe conduct given by the military commander.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">The purchasing agent of the Treasury Department of Norfolk appointed a sub-agent to proceed on board of the vessel and to be in charge of the outward cargo contained in the schedule, and not deliver the same to the claimant until he should have delivered to such agent on board the vessel three times its value in cotton. The outward voyage was made without hindrance, and having arrived at Chowan River, the claimant delivered the cotton to the sub-agent on board the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">On her return voyage, the vessel and the cargo were seized by order of a naval commander on duty in the inland waters of North Carolina. After being detained several days, the vessel and cargo were released. She again set off on her course towards Norfolk, and before arriving there was again seized by the order of the admiral commanding the squadron in those waters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-8\">The vessel was afterwards sent to Washington, D. C., where she was libelled, at the instance of the United States, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting in admiralty, where, however, a decree, with costs, passed for the claimant. No record of that suit, however, was produced hero.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-9\">No proceedings were ever taken against the cotton, and it was ultimately, though after some months\u2019 detention, restored to the claimant. It was then taken to New York, but the price of the article had greatly fallen during the detention, arid the price received on the sale of it was correspondingly less than if the voyage had not been arrested, and if the cotton had been sold on its prompt completion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">The United States, were now called on in the suit to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>good the loss caused by the wrongful conduct of its naval officers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">Upon the facts, the Court of Claims ruled, among other things:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">That the contracts with the agent of the treasury, for the sale and delivery of the cotton, were valid and lawful contracts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">That the seizure and detention of the claimant\u2019s vessels and cargo, by the officers of the navy, were unlawful and unauthorized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">That' the judgment of the Court of Admiralty was conclusive; that the voyage was a lawful and proper one, and conducted according to the prescribed regulations of the trade in which the claimant and his vessel were engaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-9\">That such acts constituted a breach of the contracts between the claimant and the United States, and entitled him to such damages as he sustained thereby.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-10\">\n<em>Mr. Dickey, Assistant Attorney-General</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0z\">(having set forth all the statutes, treasury regulations, &amp;c., bearing on the case, as already given by the reporter, who is indebted for them to Mr. Dickey\u2019s brief), <em>for the appellant; Mr. Hoar, Attorney-General, maintaining the same side:</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-11\">1.

March 31st, 1863, the Revised Treasury Regulations of September 11th, 1863, the act of July 2d, 1864, the Treasury Regulations of July 29th and 30th, 1864, and those of S\u00e9ptember 24th, 1864, and the President\u2019s proclamation of September 24th, 1864, make it plain, that everywhere commercial intercourse with those parts of the insurrectionary States which were within the control of rebels, was absolutely forbidden, from the beginning of the war, unless, indeed, it may be in' the act of July 2d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>1864, and the regulations and President\u2019s proclamation made thei\u2019eunder. But these, in truth, make no change in this regard. If it were intended by that act and the practice under it, to license such trade, it is not so specifically provided, and' is manifested only, if at all, by the want of express words of limitation in the act. It authorizes - the \u25a0 \u201c purchase \u201d for the United States of \u201c any products of States declared in insurrection, at such places therein as shall be designated by \u201d the Secretary of the Treasury.. It does not say, expressly, that these provisions -relate only to products found within the Federal lines; but is not that the fair construction ? Such trade with a public enemy is forbidden without statute, according to the laws of war among all civilized nations; and when that non-intercourse had been' so often and so fully proclaimed by all the departments of the government, from the beginning of the war, are we to construe these general words as.changing this policy ? This .construction, limiting the provisions of this act to thos\u00bf parts of the States in insurrection, which were, for the time, within our military lines, is strengthened by the fact that the pro-hi\u00ed\u00fations of the act of July 13th, 1861, were extended by the 4th section of this act of July 2d, 1864, <em>even </em>\u201cto commercial intercourse by and between persons residing or beitig within the lines of National military occupation, in districts declared in insurrection\u201d <em>\u201cwith each other.\u201d </em>This construction is strengthened, too, by the fact, that section 9 of this act repeals so much of the act of July 1861, as made it lawful for the President to license and permit trade by private citizens in such districts, eveu within the Federal lines, except to supply necessaries to loyal persons, and to authorize persons within the Federal lines to bring to the loyal States products of their.own labor, or of freedmen, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">This construction is fortified also by the language of Regulation 3 of the Treasury Regulations of July 30th, 18\u00cd34.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-7\">2. The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims depends, of course, upon the acts of'Congress which established it; and these, as all know, give it jurisdiction of \u201call claims founded upon any law of Congress, or upon any regulation of an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ecutive department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States.\u201d The only ground which can be pretended here is \u201c contract.\u201d But the United States never contracted with the claimant that its naval officers would not seize and detain his vessel and cotton, and claimant -has, therefore, no cause of action which the Court of Claims can, within its jurisdiction, enforce.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-5\">The grievance or wrong for which 'this suit is brought was the capture and detention of his steamer and his cargo of cotton'by the naval officers, and afterwards by the officers of the Treasury Department. In fact, this capture and detention, which is a <em>tort, </em>not anything founded on contract, is the gist of claimant\u2019s action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-6\">The' Court of Claims, however, have no jurisdiction in cases of tort. Claims arising out of damage to, or destruction of, property in the Southern States taken or destroyed by any part of the army or navy, must be referred to Congress.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-7\">\n<em>Mr. T. J. D. Fuller, contra :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-8\">1. Lane was the undisputed owner of the cotton prior to, and at the making of, the contract. He agreed to sell, and the United States to buy, this cotton, <em>j </em>The price to be paid, the place it was to be delivered at, was agreed upon by the contracting parties. ' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-9\">The law authorized it: the agents of the United States were fully empowered to contract. Whatever some other statutes and regulations may have meant, the act of July 2d, 1864, and the regulations and proclamation under it, permitted what was done. To understand the act we must read -it by the light of surrounding circumstances,, circumstances found in the public history of the day. The United States, it is to be remembered, wanted cotton at this time,. Grievously. France and England were so greatly sufieringrtrom the want of it, as to be tempted <em>tb </em>acknowledge the independence of the Confederate States. The.people of the North, . themselves, greatly .wanted it. Public necessity rendered a relaxation of former rules indispensable.. - The 8th section of the act. of July 2d, 1864, which made it lawful for the Sec <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>retary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to authorize agents to purchase for the Middle States any products of the States declared to be in insurrection, conferred the power to license trading within the military lines of the enemy. The Regulations of September 24th, 1864, which were meant to allow the trading authorized by the act of July 2d, previous, do not adopt the prohibition against non-intercourse contained in the' prior regulations of July 2d. They thus sliow that it was meant to b.e abandoned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-6\">2. But even if the view we thus take were not correct, the-United States are estopped from denying its correctness' by the judgment of their own courts. -The judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, sitting as a court, of prize, between the United States and Lane, was on this\u2019 same subject-matter, to wit, the steamer. The steamer could not be free from liability, and the cotton su-h ect to condemnation. The Supreme Court of the District, by restoring the vessel, established the lawfulness of the whole voyage; for if the voyage was unlawful, the steamer would have been condemned. The judgment is, moreover, conclusive upon all the world, and estops the United States from calling in question the legality and regularity of the voyage. It was a judgment of a eourt.of competent and <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction, and binds all the world.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>Reply:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-8\">It is attempted to conclude the whole question by an estoppel of record. But the record set up as an estoppel is not produced. Never favored, ayi estoppel which seeks to protect \u2014 both in the face of general law and special statutes forbidding it \u2014 trading with an enemy who is at once an enemy and a rebel \u2014 will not be received..</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-9\">Mr. Justice DAVIS</author>\n<p id=\"A73\">delivered tifie opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">In the view we take of this case it is unnecessary, to discuss the question \u2014 conceding the contract to be lawful\u2014 whether the actiob of the naval authorities could -be a ground of claim for damages far a br\u00e9ac[i of this contract against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>United States, because, in.our opinion, the'contract was unauthorized, and had no power to bind the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u2022It appears, .by the findings of the Court of Claims, that Chowan River, in North Carolina, the \u2019place where the cotton was purchased, was within the lines held by the insurrectionary forces, and that the military safe-conduct protected as well the return as the outward voyage, for Lane was permitted to- take out an outward cargo, under the supervision of a person, styled in the record a sub-agent of the purchasing agent at Norfolk, whose duty it was to retain possession of the cargo until he should have received from Lane on board the vessel, three times its value in cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"ASF\">At the time this contract purports to have been made, this country was engaged in war with a formidable enemy, and by a universally recognized principle of public law, commercial intercourse between states at war with each other, is interdicted.' It needs no special declaration on the part of the sovereign to accomplish this result, for it follows from the very nature of war that trading between the belligerents should cease. If commercial intercourse were allowable, it would oftentimes be used as a color for intercourse of an entirely different character; and in such a case the mischievous consequences that would ensue can be readily foreseen. But the rigidity of this rule can be relaxed by-the sovereign, and the laws of war so far suspended as to permit trade with the enemy. Each state settles for itself its own policy, and determines whether its true interests are better promoted by granting or withholding licenses to trade with the enemy. It being the rule, therefore, that business, intercourse with the enemy is unlawful unless directly sanctioned, the inquiry arises, whether -there was any law of Congress in force at the time that .sanctioned this transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">At an early period in the history of the war, Congress legislated on this subject. By an act passed on the 13th of July, 1861,. all commercial intercourse between citizens of States in insurrection and citizens of the rest of the United States was declared unlawful; but liberty was given to the President, in his discretion, to license trade with.the enemy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>if he thought it would conduce to the public interests to do so. In so far, however, as it was licensed by him, the manner of conducting it was left to be regulated by the Secretary of the Treasury. In the administration of this law, we do not find any regulation prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury allowing commercial intercourse within the rebel lines. On the contrary, the trade regulations which were issued by him on the 31st of March, 1863, and the 12th of September of the same year, expressly say that commercial intercourse with those parts, of the insurrectionary States within the control of the rebels is absolutely forbidden. Has this policy since then been changed ? It certainly has, if this proceeding was authorized; for-if Risley in his capacity of treasury agent, could lawfully contract with Lane, a citizen of a State not in rebellion, to purchase from him cotton in the country of the public enemy, which he did not own or control, but must procure after he got there, and had the power to assist him in this enterprise, by allowing him to take out a cargo of goods to facilitate the purchase of the cotton, and to furnish for his protection a sub-agent and a \"military safe-conduct, then it is clear the door was left open for general trading with the enemy. If one citizen of a State, not in insurrection, could lawfully obtain from a treasury agent the right to transport goods to a place under tfie control of the insurgents, where he could exchange them for cotton or other products of the country, and could also have safe-conduct to take his property there, and to bring out the property he should buy, with the promise on the part of the agent to protect and purchase it,,%o could any other citizen \u2014for in this matter equality niust-be the rule \u2014 and in this way it is easy to see a free commercial intercourse with the enemy would'be opened, and a radical change effected in the manner of conducting the war. \u25a0 Was this result contemplated by Congress in the act of July 2d, 1864 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">It is contended that the 8th section of this act, which says that it shall be lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to authorize ageuts.to purchase for the United States any products of States declared in in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>-surrection,-conferred the power to license trading within the military lines of the enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">If this were so, and it was the intention of Congress to allow- this trading, providing it was done on government account, why was it not manifested by a specific provision in the law ? Why leave such an important change of policy to be inferred from the general words of the act, and the absence of express words of limitation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">That the Secretary of the Treasury, who, it is natural to suppose, having the administratio\u00f1 of the law in his hands was, before it was passed, consulted about it, did not give this interpi\u2019etation to it, is very clear, for, within a short time after the passage of the act, he adopted, with the approval of the President, a new series of rules regulating commercial intercourse, which were intended to supersede all others, and the third rule absolutely prohibits all intercourse beyond our military lines, and declares further, \u201c that no permit will be granted for. the transportation of any property to any place under the control of the insurgents.\u201d (See Treasury Regulations,.and Rules for Commercial Intercourse, of July 29th, 1864.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">It is argued, as the regulations which were issued on the 24th of September following, for the express purpose of enforcing that provision of the act rel\u00e1ting to the purchase for the United States of the products of insurrectionary States, do not, in terms, readopt this prohibition against non-intercourse, that therefore it was abandoned. But this does not follow, for there is nothing in these regulations inconsistent with its continuance, and if not expressly revoked, it remained in force. Aside, however, from the construction adopted by the Secretary of the Treasury, we are able to see, by reference to other provisions of the same act, that Congress did not mean to change, by the 8th section, the non-intercourse policy which had prevailed. By the 4th section of this act the prohibitions of the act of July 13th, 1861, were extended <em>even </em>to commercial intercourse -by and 'between persons residing, or being within the lines of National military occupation in districts declared in insurrection, \u201c with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>each other;\u201d and the 9th section repeals so much of the act of July, 1861, as made it lawful for the President to license and permit trade by private citizens, in such districts, even within the Federal lines, except to supply the actual wants of the loyal people, aud to authorize persons within the Federal lines to bring to the loyal States the products of their own labor, or of freedmen, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The incorporation of these sections in the law is irreconcilable with the idea that Congress intended, notwithstanding these prohibitions, to confer power on the Secretary of the Treasury to allow citizens of loyal States on government account to trade withizi the actual military lines of the iusuz\u2019gents. If this is not the nature of the power conferred, it is asked what'authority did Congress intend to give the' secretary, and how was it to be exercised <em>\u20191 </em>There is 'no difficulty-in answei\u2019iug these questions aud reaching the true meaning of this particular provision, when we consider the entire act, and the treasury regulations adopted to carry into effect the 8th section, in connection with the history of the times/ The law7 was designed to remedy existing evils. The mischiefs atteiiding private trading with the enemy, even, in those parts of the-insurrectionary districts which were for the time withizi our military .lines, had been seriously felt in the conduct of the war, and the best interests of the couutry required that it should cease. It was deemed important, however, to still maizitain some species of commercial intez*coui\u2019se w'ith the insui'gents, for it is well known that the government desired to have, if it did not interfere with military opez\u2019ations, the products of the South, and particularly cotton, brought within our lines. To accomplish this end, and at the same time avoid the complications and embarrassments incidental to private trading, requii\u2019ed the inauguz\u2019ation of a'new-system. This was done by withdrawing from the citizen the privilege of trading with the enemy, and allowing the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, -to p\u00fanchase through agents, for the United States, any pi\u2019oducts of States declared in insurrection. The inquiry is made, how could these agents pui\u2019chase these products' if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>privat\u00e9 citizens were denied the right of trading in the insurrectionary districts, whether they happened t\u00f3 be within the National or Confederate military lines?/ It would not do to let the army be' used for this purpose, and the only other way left open was to hold out inducements for the.insurgents themselves to bring thejr products to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">If they could be induced to do this, we would obtain their products which we needed, and in the manner of obtaining them, would avoid the evils inseparable from private trading. The inducements for the insurgents to pursue this course \u25a0were very strong, for besides the liability of having their principal product \u2014 cotton\u2014confiscated or destroyed, they were, as is well .known, in want of many of the necessaries of life. They were substantially told in the Regulations of the Treasury Department, \u201cIf you will bring your cotton within our lines, we will not only not seize it, but will buy. it from you, and you are at liberty to go to the nearest treasury agent in \"an insurrectionary district to sell it, or if you prefer, you can leave it under the control of some one who can go to the agent and sell - it for you.\u201d \u25a0 If this were not enough to accomplish the object, the President of the United States, by way of further inducement^ in an executive order of the same date with the Treasury Regulations, said to them: \u201cYou can purchase such articles of merchandise as you need, not contraband of war, to one-third of the aggregate value of the products sold by you, and return with them, and I will guarantee you safe conduct.\u201d Why this limited permission to buy, after the delivery of the products, unless the privilege was for the benefit of thednsurgents ? If private persons, living in the Loyal States, could engage in a venture like this of the claimant, they would need, as he did, to make the venture remunerative, to take with them a cargo of goods to exchange for Southern products; but there was no authority for this. The permission of the President is limited to the taking of a return cargo, bought with part of the proceeds of Southern products, previously sold and delivered to a purchasing agent of the Treasury Department. Indeed, so particular is the direction on this subject, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>military officer commanding at the place of sale, was not authorized to permit a person who had sold Southern products -to buy merchandise,-unless he exhibited to him a certificate of the purchasing agent, setting forth the fact of the purchase and sale, the character and quantity of products, and the aggregate amount paid therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Enough has been said, without pursuing this investigation further, to show there is nothing in the act. itself, the Regulations of the Treasury Department, or the order of the President, to justify Risley in dealing in the manner he did, with Lane. It follows, therefore, that the voyage itself was illegal, as were the contracts and arrangements by which it was undertaken, and that the vessel and cargo were properly seized for being engaged in illegal trading with the enemy.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although Risley was not authorized in making any contract with a person occupying the status of Lane, still, if he were, he could only do it in the manner and for the purposes pointed out in the Treasury Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">By these regulations the purchasing agent could not act at all until the person desiring to sell Southern products made application, in writing, that he owned or controlled them,, stating their kind, quality, and location, and then the power of- the purchasing agent before the delivery of the products was limited to a stipulation (the form is prescribed) to purchase, and to the giving a certificate that such application was made, and requesting safe conduct for the party and his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">There is nothing in the petition, or the-findings of the court below, to show that. Lane complied with these provisions. On,the contrary, it is clear from his own statement that he neither owned tor controlled the cotton when he contracted to sell'it, but that,.after the contract was made, he procured it within the rebel lines. . Neither the law, nor the regulations through which it was administered, were intended to protect a speculation of this sort. The purchasing agent had no authority to negotiate even with any one in relation to-the purchase of Southern products, unless at the time of the negotiation he either owned or controlled them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>(See Regulations for the purchase of products of insurrectionary States on government account, of September 24th, 1864, and executive order same date.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The Court of Claims find that no proceedings were taken against the cotton, and that it was restored to the claimant, but that the vessel was libelled at. the instance of the United States, in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, where a decree, with costs, passed in favor of the claimant. It is argued, and was so ruled by the court below, that this decree concludes the United States. But the inquiry arises, how far the United States are concluded by it? The record of the admiralty court is not before us, and we only know from the record in this case, that that court refused to render a decree of forfeiture against the vessel, and awarded costs against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On what ground the court put its decision \u2014 whether for want of proof, insufficient allegations, or on the merits of the ease \u2014 we have no means of determining.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">It may well be that the United States could not re-seize the vessel, or take further proceedings against the cotton, and yet be at perfect liberty to litigate the right of the claimant to damages, in a direct proceeding brought against them to test that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">There is nothing in this record to show that the Supreme-Court of this District, in decreeing to the claimant the restoration of his vessel, adjudicated on the question of his right to damages. As that court had the power to award damages \u2014and the record is silent on- the subject \u2014 it is clear, either that the court refused damages, or that the claimant did not insist on the court considering the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">The United States are, therefore, not concluded on this point, and the case is relieved of all difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court, with directions to enter</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">An order, dismissing the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
