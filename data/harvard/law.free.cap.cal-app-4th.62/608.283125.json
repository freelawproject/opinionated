J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">Anthony L. Johnson was convicted of numerous violent sexual offenses, kidnappings and robberies. He was sentenced to five consecutive life terms plus four hundred forty years. On appeal, he contends he was denied his right to testify in his own defense, one count was not supported by substantial evidence, he should not have been convicted of both kidnappings and kidnappings for robbery based on the same conduct and he contends the abstract of judgment must be modified to conform to the oral pronouncement of judgment. We conclude the court erred in denying Johnson his constitutional right to testify but find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We also agree the simple kidnapping convictions on counts 9, 14, 40, 48 and 67 should be reversed and the abstract of judgment should be corrected to conform to the oral pronouncement of judgment. .In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Because of the nature of the issues on appeal, it is not necessary to set out a detailed recitation of the facts of each of the sexual assaults, except as to one victim which we discuss in more detail in the unpublished part of this opinion. The evidence shows Johnson kidnapped, robbed and committed brutal sexual offenses against seven different women over a period of several years. Six of the offenses involved a distinctive modus operandi of approaching the victim very late at night as she was getting out of her car or shortly thereafter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> forcing her back into the driver\u2019s seat while the assailant sat in the backseat, threatening to kill the victim if she did not obey, directing her to drive the car only a short distance (i.e., a matter of blocks), having her park the car and then pulling her into the backseat where he sexually assaulted her. As to the remaining victim (discussed in more detail in the unpublished part), Johnson assaulted her early in the morning while she was jogging near a college campus. In all the cases, Johnson raped and sodomized the victims, usually more than once and often in cycles. Johnson also had most of the victims orally copulate him or he orally copulated them. Johnson demanded money from the victims and went through most of their purses before leaving. After the attack, all of the victims had physical injuries or a demeanor consistent with having been forcibly raped and sodomized.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Two of the victims identified Johnson in a lineup. DNA evidence recovered in 5 of the cases matched Johnson with a random match probability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>1 in 3,600,000. Additionally, Johnson\u2019s fingerprints were recovered from two of his victim\u2019s vehicles, including one of the two cases where no DNA evidence was recovered. As to the one remaining victim where there was neither DNA nor fingerprint evidence, blood testing indicated Johnson could not be excluded as a donor of the sperm found in the victim and a pubic hair with characteristics similar to Johnson\u2019s pubic hair was found in the victim\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Johnson did not present any evidence except a stipulation that, if called to the stand, a police detective would testify he interviewed a witness who saw a person matching the description of the victim who was attacked near the college campus followed by a Black man (Johnson is Black) but did not pay much attention to them as they both appeared to be \u201chomeless types.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We set out in more detail the circumstances surrounding his denial of his right to testify. At trial, after the prosecution had completed its case-in-chief, defense counsel requested and was granted an in camera hearing. Johnson was present during the in-chambers conference. Defense counsel told the court he had \u201can ethical conflict\u201d with Johnson about Johnson\u2019s desire to take the stand and testify. Defense counsel explained, \u201cI cannot disclose to the court privileged communications relating to that, but I\u2019m in a position where I am not willing to call Mr. Johnson as a witness despite his desire to testify.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s question, Johnson indicated defense counsel had accurately described the situation and defense counsel indicated he would \u201c[n]ot voluntarily\u201d call Johnson as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The court, misunderstanding the situation, told Johnson that his attorney had decided it was not in Johnson\u2019s \u201cbest interest to testify\u201d and confirmed Johnson wanted to testify. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, this is not a trial tactic issue. This is an ethical conflict. If it were just a trial tactic, you know, in other words, a decision of what\u2019s the best choice, I always defer to the client\u2019s wishes in circumstances like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u201cThe Court: What exactly are you trying to tell me . . . that you won\u2019t examine him if he takes the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I think under the\u2014based upon the information I have, I would be ethically barred from calling him as a witness under the law as I have come to know it and very specifically researched it regarding this particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. [1]] It\u2019s always very difficult for a trial judge based on my experience at least to sit in on these. It is like having both your hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>tied behind your back because you have to make a decision. If your call based on what you know is that you have an ethical problem that will compel you not to call him and that that\u2019s over his objection, then I\u2019ll note it for the record. He will not be called\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014Based on that. And we\u2019ll go forward. And you have in essence done everything you are required to do as an attorney by placing it on the record. And at this point in time I\u2019m going to have to abide by it because you\u2019re the one that\u2019s making the call on the ethical issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes. I just want to be clear that this isn\u2019t a judgment situation that falls in the realm of a trial tactic. It\u2019s more than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. [H] I will note, then, that you believe that there are ethical reasons, strong ethical reasons, apparently, because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be sitting in here right now,\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014That cause you to come to the conclusion that you cannot under any circumstances call the client. And I will note that. And I will note that it\u2019s over his objection, and that he desires to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Johnson did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">A. <em>Development of the Right to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Under the early common law, interested parties, including persons accused of committing a crime, were disqualified from presenting sworn testimony. (97 C.J.S. (1957) Witnesses, \u00a7 120, p. 545; <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1961) 365 U.S. 570, 573 [81 S.Ct. 756, 758-759, 5 L.Ed.2d 783].) This disqualification of parties from presenting sworn testimony was clearly established by the end of the 16th century in civil cases on the basis the party\u2019s testimony was untrustworthy. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>at p. 573 [81 S.Ct. at pp. 758-759].) Disqualification of criminal defendants \u201cseems to have come somewhat later. In the sixteenth century it was necessary for an accused to conduct his own defense, since he was neither allowed to call witnesses in his behalf nor permitted the assistance of counsel. [Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The criminal trial of this period has been described as \u2018a long argument between the prisoner and the counsel for the Crown, in which they questioned each other and grappled with each other\u2019s arguments with the utmost eagerness and closeness of reasoning.\u2019 [Citation.] In the process the defendant could offer by way of explanation material that would later be characterized as testimony. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 573-574 [81 S.Ct. at p. 759].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">By the 17th century in England, a criminal defendant was allowed to call witnesses and by 1701 had the right to call witnesses to testify under oath but the defendant himself was still precluded from giving sworn testimony. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 574 [81 S.Ct. 756, 759].) This rule deeming criminal defendants incompetent to give sworn testimony was adopted in this country. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">By the mid-19th century, parties and interested witnesses in civil cases were allowed to give sworn testimony in England and in most states in this country. (O\u2019Neill, <em>Vindicating the Defendant\u2019s Constitutional Right to Testify at a Criminal Trial: The Need for an on-the-Record Waiver </em>(1990) 51 U. Pitt. L.Rev. 809, 813, citing inter alia Popper, <em>History and Development of the Accused\u2019s Right to Testify </em>(1962) Wash. U. L.Q. 454, 458.) The elimination of the disqualification was based primarily on an argument that \u201c. . . a witness\u2019s motive for lying should go to the weight, not the admissibility, of testimony.\u201d (51 U. Pitt. L.Rev. at p. 813.) As one legal commentator argued in 1835: \u201c \u2018[A]ll evidence should be taken at what it may be worth, that no consideration which has a tendency to produce conviction in a rational mind should be excluded from the consideration of the tribunals.\u2019 \u201d (Lord Macaulay\u2019s Legis. Minutes, 1835, pp. 127-128, as quoted in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 575 [81 S.Ct. 756, 760].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Criminal defendants, however, were still deemed incompetent to testify. The two main arguments against permitting criminal defendants to testify were: (1) criminal defendants were so likely to commit perjury to avoid conviction that their testimony was inherently untrustworthy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) permitting criminal defendants to testify would erode the constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>remain silent and the presumption of innocence because suspicion would fall on the defendant who failed to <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Maine was the first state to enact' a statute providing that a criminal defendant was competent to testify. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570. A Maine Supreme Court justice was a primary proponent of deeming criminal defendants competent to testify. He \u201cjustified competency as a necessary protection for the innocent\u201d and \u201cbelieved that incompetency had served the guilty as a shield and thus disserved the public interest. Competency, he thought, would open the accused to cross-examination and permit an unfavorable inference if he declined to take the stand to exculpate himself.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 579-580 [81 S.Ct. at p. 762].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Within 20 years most states, including California, had eliminated the prohibition against criminal defendants providing testimony. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 577 &amp; fn. 6 [81 S.Ct. 756, 760-761].) Finally, by 1960, all states except Georgia, had provided a criminal defendant was competent to testify in his own behalf. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570.) \u201cExperience under the American competency statutes was to change the minds of many who had opposed them. It was seen that the shutting out of his sworn evidence could be positively hurtful to the accused, and that innocence was in fact aided, not prejudiced, by the opportunity of the accused to testify under oath. An American commentator discussing the Massachusetts statute in the first year of its operation said: \u2018We have always been of the opinion, that the law permitting criminals to testify would aid in the detection of guilt; we are now disposed to think that it will be equally serviceable for the protection of innocence.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 580-581 [81 S.Ct. 756, 762].) Another commentator who had strongly opposed allowing criminal defendants to testify (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>changed his opinion after the incompetency laws had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>been changed: \u201c T am convinced by much experience that questioning, or the power of giving evidence, is a positive assistance, and a highly important one, to innocent men, and I do not see why in the case of the guilty there need be any hardship about it. ... A poor and ill-advised man ... is always liable to misapprehend the true nature of his defence [sic], and might in many cases be saved from the consequences of his own ignorance or misfortune by being questioned as a witness.\u2019 1 Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England, pp. 442, 444.\u201d <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 582 [81 S.Ct. 756, 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In 1960, the United States Supreme Court struck down the last remaining state statute (in Georgia) which provided a criminal defendant was incompetent to give sworn testimony. <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570.) The court held Georgia\u2019s statute which permitted only unsworn testimony by a criminal defendant denied the defendant his right to assistance of counsel during every step of the proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 596 [81 S.Ct. at p. 770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In 1975, the United States Supreme Court recognized that a criminal defendant had a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to act as his own attorney and, in dicta, referred to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to testify. <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806, 834, fn. 45 [95 S.Ct. 2525, 2450, 45 L.Ed.2d 562].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In 1987, the United States Supreme Court explicitly held a criminal defendant had a constitutional right to testify on his own behalf. <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 44 [107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37].) The Supreme Court stated the right to testify \u201cis one of the rights that \u2018are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 51 [107 S.Ct. at p. 2709] ) and was protected by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution <em>(id. </em>at pp. 51-53 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 2708-2710] ). The court explained, \u201cThe opportunity to testify is ... a necessary corollary to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against compelled testimony\u201d since the privilege against self-incrimination \u201c \u2018is fulfilled only when the accused is guaranteed the right \u201cto remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d . . . The choice of whether to testify in one\u2019s own defense . . . is an exercise of the constitutional privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 52-53 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 2709-2710].)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The court also found the right to testify \u201cin the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which grants a defendant the right to call \u2018witnesses in his favor\u2019 \u201d since \u201c[l]ogically included in the accused\u2019s right to call witnesses whose testimony is \u2018material and favorable to his defense,\u2019 [citation] is a right to testify himself, should he decide it is in his favor to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>so.\u201d <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52 [107 S.Ct. 2704, 2709].) Indeed, as the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>\u201c. . . the most important witness for the defense in many criminal cases is the defendant himself.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Further, the court stated, the Sixth Amendment \u201c \u2018grants to the accused <em>personally </em>the right to make his defense\u2019 \u201d which includes the \u201cright to present his own version of events in his own words.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The court also held \u201c. . . the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no one shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law [which includes the] right to be heard and to offer testimony,\u201d necessarily includes the criminal defendant\u2019s right to testify in his own behalf. <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 51 [107 S.Ct. 2704, 2708].) The Supreme Court concluded: \u201cThere is no justification today for a rule that denies an accused the opportunity to offer his own testimony. Like the truthfulness of other witnesses, the defendant\u2019s veracity, which was the concern behind the original common-law rule, can be tested adequately by cross-examination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52 [107 S.Ct. at p. 2709].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify is unlike other matters of trial strategy which are in the control of defense counsel. A criminal defendant has the right to take the stand even over the objections of his trial counsel. As our Supreme Court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 205, 215 [85 Cal.Rptr. 166, 466 P.2d 710]: \u201c[T]he right to testify in one\u2019s own behalf is of such fundamental importance that a defendant who timely demands to take the stand contrary to the advice given by his counsel has the right to give an exposition of his defense before a jury. [Citation.] The defendant\u2019s insistence upon testifying may in the final analysis be harmful to his case, but the right is of such importance that every defendant should have it in a criminal case.\u201d (Fn. omitted; see also <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 572 F.2d 1071, 1078-1079 (dis. opn. of Godbold, J.) [the defendant\u2019s \u201cdesire to tell \u2018his side\u2019 in a public forum may be of overriding importance to him. . . . [f] . . . HQ . . . The wisdom or unwisdom of the defendant\u2019s choice does not diminish his right to make it.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">B. <em>An Attorney\u2019s Obligation Not to Present Perjured Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">A problem arises, as in this case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> where the defendant asserts his right to testify and his attorney knows or suspects the defendant will give perjured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>testimony. A conflict then arises between the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify (and his Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel) and the attorney\u2019s ethical obligation not to present perjured testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Attorneys have long been prohibited by the attorney rules of professional conduct from participating in the presentation of perjured testimony. (See <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 157, 166 [106 S.Ct. 988, 994, 89 L.Ed.2d 123], noting the first rule of professional conduct adopted by the American Bar Association in 1908, canon 32, prohibited an attorney from rendering \u201cany service or advice involving disloyalty to the law\u201d and that canon 37 of the 1928 rules provided an exception to the attorney rule of confidentiality when the client announced an intention to commit a crime.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The California Rules of Professional -Conduct require an attorney to \u201cemploy, for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to the [attorney] such means only as are consistent with truth\u201d and prohibits him from seeking \u201cto mislead the judge, judicial officer, or jury by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.\u201d (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-200.) The Business and Professions Code echoes the California Rules of Professional Conduct, which are made binding on all members of the California State Bar. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6077.) Business and Professions Code section 6068, inter alia, provides: \u201cIt is the duty of an attorney . . . ffl . . . ffl] [t]o employ, for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to him or her such means only as are consistent with truth, and never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The American Bar Association\u2019s Model Code of Professional Responsibility (hereafter Model <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disciplinary rule DR 7-102(A)(4) provides: \u201cIn his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not . . . [k]nowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The American Bar Association\u2019s Model Rules of Professional Conduct (hereafter Model Rules), rule 3.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u201c(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u201c(1) make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">\u201c(2) fail to disclose a material fact to a tribunal when disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201c(4) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201c(b) The duties stated in paragraph (a) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 [generally preventing an attorney from disclosing confidential information from his client].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201c(c) A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence that the lawyer reasonably believes is false. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">C. <em>Solutions to the Problem of a Client\u2019s Intended Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">There has been much scholarly discussion of what an attorney should do when faced with a client who intends to commit perjury. Solutions range from the attorney providing full cooperation to his client in presenting the testimony to the attorney refusing to permit his client to testify. Intermediate solutions include persuading the client to not testify falsely, disclosing the perjurious intent to the court, making a motion to withdraw, or allowing the defendant to testify in a \u201cfree narrative\u201d fashion. We examine these various options.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">1. <em>Full Cooperation With Presenting Defendant\u2019s Testimony Even When Defendant Intends to Commit Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">Professor Freedman argues an attorney should fully cooperate with putting on his client\u2019s testimony even when the client intends to commit perjury. (See Freedman, <em>Professional Responsibility of the Criminal Defense Lawyer: The Three Hardest Questions </em>(1966) 64 Mich. L.Rev. 1469; Freedman, <em>Understanding Lawyers\u2019 Ethics </em>(1990), excerpt reprinted in Zitrin &amp; Langford, Legal Ethics in the Practice of Law (The Michie Co. 1995) pp. 280-282; see also Silver, <em>Truth, Justice, and the American Way: The Case Against the Client Perjury Rules, supra, </em>47 Vand. L.Rev. 339, 424-426, advocating counsel conduct the defense as if he believed the defendant.) Professor Freedman argues the importance of client confidentiality and, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>well, the attorney\u2019s duty to provide effective representation by gathering all necessary information are more important than an attorney\u2019s duty to be candid with the court. Therefore, Professor Freedman argues defense counsel must sometimes permit his client to commit perjury and be prepared to argue the client\u2019s peijurious testimony to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">No court has endorsed this view. Freedman\u2019s approach has also been much criticized by the legal commentators because it conflicts with legal ethics rules prohibiting an attorney from knowingly participating in presenting perjured testimony as well as rules requiring an attorney to disclose a client\u2019s intention to commit a crime. (See, e.g., Collett, <em>Understanding Freedman\u2019s Ethics </em>(1991) 33 Ariz. L.Rev. 455; Lefstein, <em>Client Perjury in Criminal Cases: Still in Search of an Answer </em>(1988) 1 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 521, 524-525.) One commentator has stated, \u201cFreedman\u2019s approach may seem practical. However, in practice, a lawyer\u2019s use of this approach may likely end in disciplinary action.\u201d (Note, <em>Criminal Defendant Perjury: A Lawyer\u2019s Choice Between Ethics, the Constitution, and the Truth </em>(1994) 28 New Eng. L.Rev. 881, 905.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">2. <em>Persuading the Client Not to Commit Perjury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">All the legal commentators agree that when faced with a client who indicates he will commit perjury, an attorney should first attempt to persuade the client to testify truthfully.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has held an attorney acted consistently with professional rules of ethics and did not deny the defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel by persuading the defendant not to commit perjury. <em>(Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, supra, </em>475 U.S. 157, 169 [106 S.Ct. 988, 995] [\u201c. . . at a minimum the attorney\u2019s first duty when confronted with a proposal for perjurious testimony is to attempt to dissuade the client from the unlawful course of conduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The persuasion solution, when it succeeds, is the ideal solution since it involves neither the presentation of peijured testimony nor disclosure of client confidences. Yet, it does not answer the question of what should be done when the client insists on testifying falsely despite his attorney\u2019s best efforts to dissuade him.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>3. <em>Withdrawal From Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Model Rules and Model Code provide an attorney should make a motion to withdraw from representation when the representation will result in a violation of law or rules of professional conduct. (Model Rules, rule 1.16(a)(1); Model Code, DR 2-110(B)(2); Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 3-700(B)(2), (C)(1)(b) &amp; (c).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the California case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1335, 1339-1340, footnote 1 [250 Cal.Rptr. 762], the court, in reliance on the California ethical rules for attorneys,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> stated that if an attorney is unable to dissuade his client from committing perjury, \u201cthe attorney must make a motion to withdraw so as to not give implied consent to the use of perjurious testimony.\u201d The court stated, \u201cWhen faced with a criminal defendant who insists on testifying perjuriously, it is clearly appropriate under California law, even necessary, for counsel to present a request to withdraw to the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1339, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">This approach, while it protects the attorney\u2019s interest in not presenting perjured testimony, does not solve the problem. The court may deny the motion to withdraw. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1335, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>1340-1342.) Even if the motion to withdraw is granted, the problem remains. As the court stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gadson </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1700, 1710, footnote 5 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 219]: \u201c[W]e note that permitting defense counsel to withdraw does not necessarily resolve the problem. That approach could trigger an endless cycle of defense continuances and motions to withdraw as the accused informs each new attorney of the intent to testify falsely. Or the accused may be less candid with his new attorney by keeping his perjurious intent to himself, thereby facilitating the presentation of false testimony. Lastly, there is the unfortunate possibility that the accused may find an unethical attorney who would knowingly present and argue the false testimony. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s withdrawal from the case would not really solve the problem created by the anticipated perjury but, in fact, could create even more problems.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">One court has described the withdrawal solution as an \u201costrich-like approach\u201d which does little to resolve the problem.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">4. <em>Disclosure to the Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Another alternative is that the attorney should disclose the perjury to the court. Initially, we note that some of the other proposed solutions involve some disclosure, i.e., implicit in solutions of making a motion to withdraw or having the defendant testify in a narrative manner is, at least, an implicit disclosure to the court that the attorney believes the defendant may commit perjury. Disclosure has been criticized because it compromises the attorney\u2019s ethical duty to keep client communications confidential<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and results in a significant conflict of interest between the attorney and his client if the attorney discloses to the court that the defendant has perjured himself. (See Silver, <em>Truth, Justice, and the American Way: The Case Against the Client Perjury Rules, supra, </em>47 Vand. L.Rev. 339, 415-418.) Additionally, until the defendant actually takes the stand and testifies falsely, there is always a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>chance the defendant will change his mind and testify truthfully.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, disclosure is only a partial solution. If the disclosure occurs before the defendant has taken the stand, the disclosure will require some additional action, i.e., a decision as to whether the defendant\u2019s statement is, in fact, false and a further decision whether the defendant will be permitted to testify and in what form and manner. Disclosure before the defendant testifies could result in a mini-trial on the perjury issue before the defendant has had the opportunity to take the stand and testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">5. <em>The Narrative Approach</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Under the narrative approach, the attorney calls the defendant to the witness stand but does not engage in the usual question and answer exchange. Instead, the attorney permits the defendant to testify in a free narrative manner. In closing arguments, the attorney does not rely on any of the defendant\u2019s false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In the early 1970\u2019s, the American Bar Association adopted the narrative approach in its Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Defense Function. Standard 7.7 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\u201cTestimony by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201c(a) If the defendant has admitted to his lawyer facts which establish guilt and the lawyer\u2019s independent investigation establishes that the admissions are true but the defendant insists on his right to trial, the lawyer must advise his client against taking the witness stand to testify falsely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201c(b) If, before trial, the defendant insists that he will take the stand to testify falsely, the lawyer must withdraw from the case, if that is feasible, seeking leave of the court if necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\u201c(c) If withdrawal from the case is not feasible or is not permitted by the court, or if the situation arises during the trial and the defendant insists upon testifying falsely in his own behalf, the lawyer may not lend his aid to the perjury. Before the defendant takes the stand in these circumstances, the lawyer should make a record of the fact that the defendant is taking the stand against the advice of counsel in some appropriate manner without revealing the fact to the court. The lawyer must confine his examination to identifying the witness as the defendant and permitting him to make his statement to the trier or the triers of the facts; the lawyer may not engage in direct examination of the defendant as a witness in the conventional manner and may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>later argue the defendant\u2019s known false version of facts to the jury as worthy of belief and he may not receive or rely upon the false testimony in his closing argument.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 915, 944, fn. 8 [248 Cal.Rptr. 467, 755 P.2d 917].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This standard, adopting the free narrative approach \u201cwas not included in the 1980 second edition of the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (hereafter ABA Standards). The editorial note to that edition explained, \u2018the question of what should be done in situations dealt with by the standard has been deferred until the ABA Commission on Evaluation of Professional Standards reports its final recommendations.\u2019 In the 1983 Model Rules of Professional Conduct, standard 7.7 was rejected by rule 3.3 (lawyer has duty to disclose falsity of evidence, even if disclosure compromises client confidences.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 944, fn. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The narrative approach has been criticized on the basis the attorney participates in committing a fraud on the court. (See <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>State </em>(1992) 206 Ga.App. 273, 275 [424 S.E.2d 816, 818, fn. 1] [appellant\u2019s \u201csuggestion he should have been permitted to testify in narrative form would constitute the attorney\u2019s participation in fraud, and thus is no answer\u201d].) The narrative approach has also been criticized as communicating to the jury that the defendant is committing perjury. One court has stated, \u201cThis procedure could hardly have failed to convey to the jury the impression that the defendant\u2019s counsel attached little significance or credibility to the testimony of the witness, or that the defendant and his counsel were at odds. Prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case by this trial tactic was inevitable.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1976) 290 N.C. 56, 67 [224 S.E.2d 174, 180].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Another commentator has stated: \u201cby telegraphing her own belief in the inveracity of the accused, the defendant\u2019s lawyer arguably violates the ethical prohibitions against counsel serving as a witness and against expressing a personal opinion about the client\u2019s \u2018credibility . . . or . . . guilt or innocence\u2019 and also contravenes the evidentiary restrictions on opinion evidence and on testimony presented without oath or affirmation or the laying of a proper foundation.\u201d (Silver, <em>Truth, Justice, and the American Way: The Case Against the Client Perjury Rules, supra, </em>47 Vand. L.Rev. 339, 422, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">6. <em>Refusing to Permit the Defendant to Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The opposite extreme from Professor Freedman\u2019s solution of full cooperation by the attorney in presenting the defendant\u2019s testimony is a refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>permit the defendant to testify at all. This solution is justified by the theory that an attorney has an ethical obligation not to participate in the presentation of perjured testimony and the defendant has no right to commit pequry. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curtis </em>(7th Cir. 1984) 742 F.2d 1070, 1076; <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>206 Ga.App. 273, 275 [424 S.E.2d 816, 818].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Preclusion of the testimony as a solution has been criticized because it essentially substitutes defense counsel for the jury as the judge of witness credibility; it puts the determination of whether the defendant is telling the truth or a lie into the hands of defense counsel. (See Rifkin, <em>The Criminal Defendant\u2019s Right to Testify: The Right to Be Seen But Not Heard </em>(1989) 21 Colum. Hum. Rts. L.Rev. 253, 272.) Further, under this approach, a determination is made that the defendant will commit perjury before he has even taken the witness stand. As we noted before, until the defendant is actually on the stand, there is always the possibility the defendant will change his mind and testify truthfully. (See, e.g., <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, supra, </em>475 U.S. 157 [defendant told his attorney he would testify falsely, but once on the stand, he testified truthfully].) Further, a determination of whether the defendant will commit perjury may result in a mini-trial, with the attorney essentially \u201ctestifying\u201d against the defendant. Finally, this approach, while safeguarding the attorney\u2019s ethical obligations not to participate in presenting perjured testimony, results in a complete denial of the defendant\u2019s right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">7. <em>California Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Two California cases, <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Gadson, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1700, in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel claims, have expressly approved use of the narrative approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In <em>Guzman, </em>defense <em>counsel, </em>outside the presence of the jury, informed the court that the defendant, charged with murder, would be testifying against his advice and in a free narrative fashion. The court advised the defendant to follow his attorney\u2019s advice and warned him of the drawbacks of testifying.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant elected to testify and testified in a narrative fashion. Defense counsel did not argue defendant\u2019s testimony to the jury although defendant\u2019s second counsel referred to some of the defendant\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The defendant argued use of the free narrative approach resulted in a denial of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. He contended \u201ccounsel improperly failed to elicit his version of the facts, and [contended] that questions from counsel would have ensured a more complete and coherent presentation. Further, he argue[d], his attorney-client privilege was violated. Finally, [he contended] his attorney\u2019s approach was the product of a conflict of interest resolved against him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 942, fn. omitted.) The <em>Guzman </em>court rejected these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The <em>Guzman </em>court first concluded neither the United States Supreme Court nor the California Rules of Professional Conduct prohibited use of the narrative approach. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 944.) The court observed, \u201cCounsel\u2019s conduct in this case closely followed that formerly prescribed by the American Bar Association (ABA) Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Defense Function (Approved Draft 1971) standard 7.7. The standard recognizes that, although counsel need not elicit what he thinks will be perjured testimony, an accused has an absolute right to testify over counsel\u2019s objection.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 944, fn. omitted.) The court noted that the approach taken \u201cwas counsel\u2019s best effort to reconcile their duty of representation with their ethical obligations as officers of the court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 945.) The court, citing <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Cardwell </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 575 F.2d 727, also noted that there had also been approval of the \u201c \u2018passive refusal to lend aid to what is believed to be perjury\u2019 \u201d as is done in the narrative approach. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 945-946.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The <em>Guzman </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument the jury had \u201cclear notice that his counsel did not believe him,\u201d explaining: \u201cNone of this, however, is inconsistent with the jury surmising that defendant desired to testify unhampered by the traditional question and answer format. In fact, defendant\u2019s testimony was presented in as clear and coherent a fashion as that of other witnesses. Unlike <em>Lowery, </em>counsel\u2019s conduct in no way signalled to the jury that they disbelieved their client.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 946.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Finally, the <em>Guzman </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument he had been improperly forced to represent himself, i.e., that \u201cby using the free narrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>he waived his right to counsel, but that the waiver was neither knowing nor intelligent because the court did not inform him that the jury was likely to infer he was lying.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 946.) The <em>Guzman </em>court responded: The defendant had been \u201c \u2018forced\u2019 to represent himself only with respect to his own direct testimony\u201d; otherwise counsel had been available and participated in the trial and therefore warnings about self-representation were not necessary; the court had expressly advised the defendant of the dangers of the free narrative approach; and defendant had \u201cunderstood the dangers and had time to consider them before he insisted on testifying.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gadson, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1700, defense counsel informed the court that the defendant would be testifying against his advice and would call two witnesses. The court advised the defendant he would be \u201c \u2018allowed to testify in a free-flow narrative way\u2019 \u201d and noted the drawbacks of presenting such testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1705.) The defendant indicated he understood arid wanted to testify and present the witnesses. He did so. The court allowed both defense counsel and the defendant to present closing argument. On appeal, the defendant contended he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his defense counsel acceded to his requests to testify and call witnesses. He contended he was forced to represent himself although he had not requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The <em>Gadson </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments, noting \u201c[i]t is well settled that a criminal defendant has an absolute right to testify over the objection of trial counsel\u201d; \u201c[i]t is also equally well settled that a defense counsel\u2019s refusal to participate in the presentation of perjurious testimony from the accused does not deny the client effective assistance of counsel [citing <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 171 [106 S.Ct. at p. 996]]\u201d; and that \u201cneither of those precedents nor the California Rules of Professional Conduct state the appropriate course of action if defense counsel believes the client will lie and the client insists on the right to testify.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gadson, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1700, 1710, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The <em>Gadson </em>court, after reviewing the <em>Guzman </em>case, which had found no ineffective assistance of counsel in use of the narrative approach, concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u201cThe solution employed [i.e., the narrative approach] properly reconciled the competing interests which intersected in this situation. Defendant was able to testify on his own behalf; trial counsel refrained from actively participating in the presentation of false testimony; defendant was still afforded the assistance of trial counsel; and the integrity of the adversarial system of justice was not compromised.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gadson, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1700, 1711.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">8. <em>The Narrative Approach Represents the Best Accommodation of the Competing Interests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">None of the approaches to a client\u2019s stated intention to commit peijury is perfect. Of the various approaches, we believe the narrative approach represents the best accommodation of the competing interests of the defendant\u2019s right to testify and the attorney\u2019s obligation not to participate in the presentation of perjured testimony since it allows the defendant to tell the jury, in his own words, his version of what occurred, a right which has been described as fundamental, and allows the attorney to play a passive role.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In contrast, the two extremes\u2014fully cooperating with the defendant\u2019s testimony and refusing to present the defendant\u2019s testimony\u2014involve no accommodation of the conflicting interests; the first gives no consideration to the attorney\u2019s ethical obligations, the second gives none to the defendant\u2019s right to testify. The other intermediate solutions\u2014persuasion, withdrawal and disclosure\u2014often result in no solution, i.e., the defendant is not persuaded, the withdrawal leads to an endless chain of withdrawals and disclosure compromises client confidentiality and typically requires further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">We disagree with those commentators who have found the narrative approach necessarily communicates to the jury that defense counsel believes the defendant is lying. As was pointed out in <em>Gadson, </em>the jury may surmise the \u201cdefendant desired to testify unhampered by the traditional question and answer format.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 946.) Because the defendant in a criminal trial is not situated the same as other witnesses, it would not be illogical for a jury to assume that special rules apply to his testimony, including a right to testify in a narrative fashion. We do not believe the possibility of a negative inference the defendant is lying should preclude the use of the narrative approach since the alternative would be worse, i.e., the attorney\u2019s active participation in presenting the perjured testimony or exclusion of the defendant\u2019s testimony, neither of which strikes a balance between the competing interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The danger that the defendant may testify falsely is mitigated by the fact that the defendant is subject to impeachment and can be cross-examined just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>like any other witness. The jury is no less capable of assessing the defendant\u2019s credibility than it is of any other witness. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44, 52 [107 S.Ct. 2704, 2709]: \u201cLike the truthfulness of other witnesses, the defendant\u2019s veracity, which was the concern behind the original common-law rule, can be tested adequately by cross-examination.\u201d Further, to preclude the defendant\u2019s testimony entirely based on a possibility that defendant may lie, deprives the jury of making that assessment and may deprive the jury of hearing other, nonperjurious evidence to which the defendant would have testified about had he been given the opportunity. In utilizing the narrative approach, the jury has the benefit of hearing the defendant\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The narrative approach also avoids having a pre-perjury hearing, a mini-trial on whether the defendant might commit perjury if called to the stand; a hearing which could result in the attorney testifying against the client and which would require the court to be able to see into the future and determine that an individual who has stated only an intention to testify falsely (at least as according to his attorney) will actually testify falsely once on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We further note that not only has the narrative approach received approval in California <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gadson, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.4th 1700) but it has also been approved by several other jurisdictions (see <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Cardwell, supra, </em>575 F.2d 727, 731; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alaska 1980) 621 P.2d 869, 881; <em>State </em>v. <em>Waggoner </em>(1993) 124 Idaho 716, 721-722 [864 P.2d 162, 167-168]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Taggart </em>(1992) 233 Ill.App.3d 530, 558-559 [174 Ill.Dec. 717, 599 N.E.2d 501, 521]; <em>Matter of Goodwin </em>(1983) 279 S.C. 274, 277 [305 S.E.2d 578, 580]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Layton </em>(1993) 189 W.Va. 470, 484-485 [432 S.E.2d 740, 754-755] [\u201c. . . the trial court appropriately weighed the conflicting interests involved and, in this Court\u2019s opinion, adopted a procedure which allowed the defendant to testify, which shielded the attorney from unethical and illegal conduct, and which advanced the societal interest in the administration of justice\u201d]; see also <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Jermyn </em>(1993) 533 Pa. 194, 200 [620 A.2d 1128, 1131]).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We conclude the narrative approach best accommodates the competing interests of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify and the attorney\u2019s ethical obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">9. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Solution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">The trial court here followed the solution of excluding the defendant\u2019s testimony on the basis counsel had an \u201cethical conflict\u201d with calling Johnson as a witness because, presumably, Johnson would commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The trial court\u2019s approach, i.e., of precluding Johnson\u2019s testimony based only on his attorney\u2019s assertion of an \u201cethical conflict,\u201d attempted an impossible task, i.e., to determine, as a matter of fact, that Johnson would perjure himself once he took the stand. This is an impossible task since there is always the possibility a defendant will be persuaded by counsel\u2019s arguments and testify truthfully. Further, the defendant\u2019s allegedly false testimony may not be a matter of \u201cperjury\u201d but of having remembered additional details upon further reflection; the change in the defendant\u2019s intended story may be the result of an effort to be more truthful. (See <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Alderman </em>(1981) 292 Pa.Super. 263 [437 A.2d 36, 39] [\u201c. . . a defendant may say one thing to his lawyer and later contradict it, when for one reason or another\u2014new information, for example\u2014his memory has been refreshed and he concludes that his first account was mistaken\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Moreover, the trial court\u2019s approach substitutes the defendant\u2019s attorney for the jury as the trier of fact and determiner of witness credibility. As one legal commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">\u201cIf a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to be heard\u2014to tell his story\u2014it does not make sense to say he may only tell a story that conforms to someone else\u2019s view of the truth. Under our system of justice, the factfinder makes credibility determinations. If the defendant has a constitutional right to tell his or her story, that right is to tell it to the jury, so that it may make the ultimate credibility determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">\u201cThus, if a defendant has a constitutional right to be heard, it cannot be predicated on counsel\u2019s determination that what the jury will hear is the truth. The right to be heard is a personal, fundamental right of the accused, and the lawyer has no right to prevent a client from exercising it.\u201d (Rieger, <em>Client Perjury: A Proposed Resolution of the Constitutional and Ethical Issues </em>(1985) 70 Minn. L.Rev. 121, 143.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The trial court\u2019s approach precluded the jury from hearing additional evidence, i.e., Johnson\u2019s version of the events. While Johnson\u2019s version may have been false (at least in part),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it is the jury\u2019s function to determine the credibility of witnesses. Like other witnesses, Johnson\u2019s veracity could have been tested through cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Additionally, the trial court\u2019s approach did not achieve any balance between the competing interests of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>testify and the attorney\u2019s duty not to participate in the presentation of perjury. The trial court\u2019s approach completely subordinated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the attorney\u2019s interest. The defendant\u2019s right to testify has been described as fundamental and is guaranteed by the constitution. <em>(Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>483 U.S. 44.) Even under the common law when a criminal defendant was barred from giving sworn testimony, English judges, seeking mitigation of the rule disqualifying defendants from testifying, permitted the defendant to make a statement. As one English judge stated: \u201c T would <em>never </em>prevent a prisoner from making a statement, though he has counsel. He may make any statement he pleases before his counsel addresses the jury, and then his counsel may comment upon that statement as a part of the case. If it were otherwise, the most monstrous injustice might result ....\u2019\u201d (Statement of Baron Alderson, quoted in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>365 U.S. 570, 583 [81 S.Ct. 756, 764].) \u201cThe custom grew up in England out of a spirit of fairness to give an accused, who was otherwise disqualified, an opportunity to tell his story in exculpation.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. <em>Louviere </em>(1929) 169 La. 109, 119 [124 So. 188, 192].) It seems particularly unjust at this date, when the defendant\u2019s right to give sworn testimony in his own behalf has been recognized as being constitutionally guaranteed, to bar a defendant from telling his story to the jury in his own words based only on an attorney\u2019s assertion of an \u201cethical conflict\u201d in calling the defendant to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Finally, we note that in California, no statutes, judicial decisions or ethical rules require preclusion of a defendant\u2019s testimony when the attorney believes or \u201cknows\u201d a client will commit perjury. California case law has approved of the narrative approach, which avoids the problems of prior factual determinations by defense counsel (and/or the court) that the defendant will commit perjury, allows a defendant to exercise his constitutional right to testify, permits defense counsel to play a passive role and places the factfinding and credibility determinations with the jury as should be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Attorney General argues the court properly excluded Johnson\u2019s testimony and points to language in United States Supreme Court cases<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> stating that while a defendant has a constitutional right, to testify, the defendant has no right to commit perjury. (See <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, supra, </em>475 U.S. 157, 173 [106 S.Ct. 988, 997] [\u201c[w]hatever the scope of a constitutional right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>testify, it is elementary that such a right does not extend to testifying <em>falsely\u201d]; Harris </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 222, 225 [91 S.Ct. 643, 645, 28 L.Ed.2d 1] [the right to testify \u201ccannot be construed to include the right to commit perjury\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Initially, we note neither of these cases involved a holding that a defendant was properly precluded from testifying because he might commit perjury; in both cases the defendant actually testified. In <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>the defendant testified truthfully. The Supreme Court held the defendant was not denied ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s conduct in persuading the defendant not to testify falsely, including counsel\u2019s threats to withdraw from the case and impeach the defendant if he testified falsely. Nothing in the <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside </em>case provides that a court must prohibit a defendant from testifying if his attorney states a belief or knowledge the defendant will testify falsely if called to the stand. Indeed, as noted by our Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 915, 944, <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside </em>did not prescribe any particular course which should be followed by a California lawyer when faced with a defendant who has stated an intention to commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Similarly, in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>the issue was not whether a defendant should be prohibited from testifying based upon his attorney\u2019s belief or knowledge the defendant might commit perjury. <em>Harris </em>involved the issue of whether a defendant who elected to testify could be impeached with prior inconsistent statements taken in violation of his Miranda<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> rights. In the course of so holding, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201cEvery criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own defense, or to refuse to do so. But that <em>privilege cannot be construed to include the right to commit perjury. </em>[Citations.] Having voluntarily taken the stand, petitioner was under an obligation to speak truthfully and accurately, and the prosecution here did no more than utilize the traditional truth-testing devices of the adversary process. Had inconsistent statements been made by the accused to some third person, it could hardly be contended that the conflict could not be laid before the jury by way of cross-examination and impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">\u201cThe shield provided by <em>Miranda </em>cannot be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense, free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225-226 [91 S.Ct. 643, 645-646], italics added, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Taken in context, it is clear the Supreme Court in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York </em>was not holding a criminal defendant should be denied his right to testify based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>on his attorney\u2019s belief he might commit perjury. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York </em>held only that <em>Miranda </em>may not be used as a shield to commit perjury: A defendant who testifies is subject to impeachment and cross-examination with prior inconsistent statements, including statements taken in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In sum, neither of these cases holds a trial court should (as did the trial court here) deny a defendant his constitutional right to testify based on the possibility or probability the defendant might commit perjury. Rather, the Supreme Court held that a defendant is not denied effective assistance of counsel when his counsel persuades him not to testify falsely and that once a defendant elects to testify, he is subject to cross-examination and impeachment, including with statements taken in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We conclude the trial court erred in denying Johnson his constitutional right to testify. The trial court should have followed the narrative approach, which has been approved by the courts in California and which would have best accommodated the conflicting interests of Johnson and his defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">D. <em>Standard of Reversal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Johnson argues that the court\u2019s error in denying his right to testify requires reversal per se. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">While the 1987 case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 819, 823 [236 Cal.Rptr. 680], states reversal is required whenever a defendant is improperly denied his right to testify, we note a more recent case from this court, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1226 [280 Cal.Rptr. 578] has stated, albeit as dicta, that the <em>Chapman</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>harmless error analysis should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1226, 1234, footnote 11, we stated: \u201cMost errors do not mandate automatic reversal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 666, 674-676 [238 Cal.Rptr. 406, 738 P.2d 752] [aside from errors which abort the basic trial process, strong presumption that errors tested under Chapman].) Other courts which have examined identical claims have tested the error under the \u2018harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard enunciated by <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]. (See <em>Ortega </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>(7th Cir. 1988) 843 F.2d 258, 262-263 [denial of right to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>tested under Chapman]; <em>Alicea </em>v. <em>Gagnon </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 675 F.2d 913, 925-926 [error in preventing defendant from testifying based on noncompliance with \u2018alibi-notice\u2019 statute tested under Chapman]; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Estelle </em>(5th Cir. 1977) 549 F.2d 971, affd. 572 F.2d 1071 (in bank).) The Supreme Court has tested analogous claims under a harmless error standard. (See <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 683, 691 [90 L.Ed.2d 636, 645-646, 106 S.Ct. 2142] [harmless error test applied to erroneous exclusion of defense evidence].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Our research has revealed additional cases which have applied the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error analysis to a denial of the defendant\u2019s right to testify. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(7th Cir. 1997) 128 F.3d 1105, 1109; <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1995) 78 Hawaii 115, 125 [890 P.2d 702, 712], overruled on other grounds in <em>Tachibana </em>v. <em>State </em>(1995) 79 Hawaii 226, 235-236 [900 P.2d 1293, 1302-1303]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Solomon (Am. Op.) </em>(1996) 220 Mich.App. 527, 535 [560 N.W.2d 651, 655]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Flynn </em>(1994) 190 Wis.2d 31, 53-57 [527 N.W.2d 343, 353]; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Tavares </em>(D.C. Cir. 1996) 100 F.3d 995, 999 [321 App.D.C. 381] [no reasonable probability testimony would have changed the verdict, standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claim]; <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Rodriquez </em>(1992) 222 Conn. 469, 478 [610 A.2d 631, 636, fn. 9], overruled on other grounds in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden </em>(1994) 229 Conn. 178 [640 A.2d 601]; but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosillo </em>(Minn. 1979) 281 N.W.2d 877, 879; <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Dugger </em>(M.D.Fla. 1992) 829 F.Supp, 372, 376-377 [finding defect \u201cstructural\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Supreme Court has explained \u201c. . . the harmless-error doctrine is essential to preserve the \u2018principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 279, 308 [111 S.Ct. 1246, 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d 302].) The Supreme Court has further stated, constitutional violations which are subject to harmless-error analysis are errors that \u201coccurred during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 307-308 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1264].) Under the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error test, a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right does not require reversal when it can be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that a \u201ctrial error\u201d (as opposed to \u201cstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism\u201d) did not contribute to the guilty verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 309 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1265]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [87 S.Ct. 824, 828].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>We agree with those cases which have held the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to testify is a \u201ctrial error.\u201d Such an error, resulting in exclusion of evidence, is not reversible per se but subject to the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error analysis. Accordingly, we review the record to determine if the error in not permitting Johnson to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Here, Johnson concedes the evidence was generally overwhelming<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> except as to one particular count which we address in the unpublished part and find the evidence strongly supports conviction on that count. Johnson does not argue the exclusion of his testimony was prejudicial or that his testimony might have changed the verdict. Johnson argues for reversal per se which we have rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We agree with Johnson that the evidence was overwhelming. Not only was there a distinctive modus operandi involved in the assaults against six of the victims (i.e., attacking victims very late at night, forcing them back into their cars, directing them to drive to a location only a few blocks away, sexually assaulting the victims in the backseat, and demanding money) but also there was strong DNA and fingerprint evidence as well as blood, hair and lineup evidence connecting Johnson to these crimes. Additionally, there was strong evidence, both medical and by persons who observed the victims shortly after the attacks, establishing the victims had been forcibly raped and sodomized rather than had engaged in consensual sex. Further, here there was no offer of proof as to what Johnson would have testified about. Thus, we have before us no evidence which could support a finding that Johnson was harmed by exclusion of his testimony; any such finding would necessarily be based on mere speculation. (Cf. <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>128 F.3d 1105, 1109 [omission of description of what defendant\u2019s testimony would have been \u201ccoupled with the overwhelming evidence of [his] guilt, establishes that any error causing him not to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d]; but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Silva, supra, </em>78 Hawaii 115, 126 [890 P.2d 702, 713] [error held not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, noting the record did not indicate to what the defendant would have testified].)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We conclude that while the trial court erred in precluding Johnson from testifying, based on the record we have before us on appeal, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The convictions for simple kidnapping on counts 9, 14, 40, 48 and 67 are reversed and the abstract of judgment should be accordingly amended.
