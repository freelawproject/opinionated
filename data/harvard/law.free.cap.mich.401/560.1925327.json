The limitation on rehearings is not a denial of equal protection. The classification to which the three-month limitation is applicable embraces all persons interested in all matters within the jurisdiction of the probate court except juvenile orders. That is, save for orders concerning juveniles, all parties with claims involving matters subject to the jurisdiction of the probate court are uniformly affected. The classification is not \"suspect\u201d and the limitation rationally furthers the object of the Probate Code. The legislative policy favors the prompt and final settlement of the various claims on an estate, and the limitation on rehearings rationally furthers this purpose.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b644-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>Frank J.

Her husband was appointed guardian and ordered to fully reimburse the state for her care. The required reimbursement was subsequently reduced to 10% of the cost of care, Mrs. Kasuba was released from the hospital in April, 1957 and was readmitted on June 3Q, I960 as a public patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Mr. Kasuba died on September 23, 1965 and Rose Kasuba became possessed of her survivor\u2019s interest in a home in Presque Isle County and 80 acres in Otsego County.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Delores Rickie, appellant in this case, was appointed guardian in 1968. On June 27, 1971, Mrs. Rickie filed a petition to sell real estate and an order for hearing on claims was set for October 6, 1971. The Revenue Division of the Treasury Department of the State of Michigan filed a claim for reimbursement for the aforementioned care in the amount of $40,423.75. A hearing on the claim was scheduled and adjourned to December 1, 1971. On that date a hearing was held at which plaintiff and defendant appeared. The hearing resulted in an order allowing the state\u2019s claim. Copies of the order were mailed to the parties on June 20, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On July 3, 1972, the state filed a petition for an order to show cause why the guardian should not be removed for failure to sell the property and pay the claim, and on August 9, 1972 it filed an additional petition requesting reimbursement from Mrs. Kasuba\u2019s children. On October 12, 1972 the guardian filed a petition for rehearing. On October 19, 1972 the Presque Isle County Probate Court dismissed the state\u2019s petitions for removal of the guardian and reimbursement from Mrs. Kasuba\u2019s children, and granted a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The decision of the probate court was affirmed in the Presque Isle County Circuit Court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Court of Appeals reversed on the grounds that \"regardless of whether one counts from December 1, 1971, the date on which the order was filed, or June 20, 1972, the date on which copies of the orders were mailed to the parties, more than 90 days had elapsed, with the result that the probate court lost jurisdiction\u201d. <em>In re Kasuba Estate, </em>65 Mich App 25, 28; 236 NW2d 751 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We granted leave to appeal limited to the issue of the constitutionality of the three-month limitations period on the power of probate courts to grant rehearings contained in MCLA 701.19(6); MSA 27.3178(19X6) and the said statute as currently in effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 397 Mich 812 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We hold that the legislative limitation on the jurisdiction of the probate court to grant rehearings violates neither the Michigan Constitution nor the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Appellant first contends that under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, which grants to the Supreme Court the power to make rules governing practice and procedure in the courts of the state, the statutory limitation period must give way to General Court Rule provisions, GCR 1963, 701 <em>et seq., </em>for seeking relief from an order of the probate court. See GCR 1963, 16; <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing) </em>373 Mich 531; 130 NW2d 4 (1964). Specifically, the argument is that obedience to the limitation language of the statute in question means that in some instances a circuit court would be unable to remand a case to probate court for further proceedings and, therefore, GCR 701.10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could not have been followed even where the circuit court determined that the interests of justice required a remand, thus resulting in impermissible legislative invasion of a solely judicial prerogative. Assuming, without deciding, that a case could not be remanded to probate court after three months had passed from the date of the order appealed from, we believe the argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 15 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\"The <em>jurisdiction, </em>powers and duties of the probate court and of the judges thereof shall be provided by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">We have said in considering the three-month limitation upon the authority of a probate court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>modify and set aside orders and to grant rehearings passed under a similar grant of power to the Legislature in Const 1908, art 7, \u00a7 13, that the jurisdiction of the probate courts is defined entirely by statute and that action by a probate judge beyond the three-month period is void for want of jurisdiction. <em>In re Dowling\u2019s Estate, </em>308 Mich 129; 13 NW2d 233 (1944); <em>Smolenski v Kent Probate Judge, </em>301 Mich 8; 2 NW2d 900 (1942). See also <em>In re Cummings Estate, </em>355 Mich 210; 93 NW2d 881 (1959). The Constitution provides for statutory definition of the jurisdiction of probate courts and our power to make rules of practice and procedure cannot be used to expand that jurisdiction without legislative consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">MCLA 701.19(6); MSA 27.3178(19X6) is also attacked for providing a limitation period so short that Mrs. Kasuba has effectively been deprived of property without due process of law. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">It is well established that due process is primarily concerned with providing the opportunity for <em>a </em>full and fair trial on the merits. <em>Ridenour v Bay County, </em>366 Mich 225; 114 NW2d 172 (1962). Where an ample hearing is afforded, due process does not require a state to provide a rehearing of the same matter or a new trial, <em>Pittsburgh, C C &amp; St L R Co v Backus, </em>154 US 421; 14 S Ct 1114; 38 L Ed 1031 (1894); <em>James v Appel, </em>192 US 129; 24 S Ct 222; 48 L Ed 377 (1904), or even an appellate review, <em>United States v MacCollom, </em>426 US 317; 96 S Ct 2086; 48 L Ed 2d 666 (1976); <em>Griffin v Illinois, </em>351 US 12; 76 S Ct 585; 100 L Ed 891 (1956); <em>McKane v Durston, </em>153 US 684; 14 S Ct 913; 38 L Ed 867 (1894); <em>J F Hartz Co v Lukaszcew</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>ski, </em>200 Mich 230; 167 NW 18 (1918); <em>Messenger v Teagan, </em>106 Mich 654; 64 NW 499 (1895).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In the case at bar, a hearing was held in the probate court after the guardian filed notice of contest to the state\u2019s claim. There is no claim regarding the adequacy of that hearing. A rehearing could have been applied for. Appeal of the order was available to the circuit court which was empowered to make any order or render any judgment that should have been made or rendered in the probate court or grant any other relief required by justice, and none was taken. GCR 1963, 701.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Our cases holding that limitations periods must a\u00edford a reasonable time within which a suit must be brought are of no avail to appellant. See <em>Dyke v Richard, </em>390 Mich 739; 213 NW2d 185 (1973); <em>Price </em>v <em>Hopkin, </em>13 Mich 318 (1865). They are concerned with limitations on an original cause of action. The grant of jurisdiction to the probate court to order rehearings within a limit of three months does not cut off the right to <em>any </em>hearing on a claim. Appellant does not call attention to any case of this Court finding a limitation period on the right to <em>rehearing </em>as being unreasonable. Appellant has not been deprived of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Appellant contends finally that the challenged statutory provision deals arbitrarily with a mentally ill person subject to the jurisdiction of the probate court in violation of the equal protection provision of the state and Federal Constitutions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>because the three-month limitation on rehearings applicable to the incompetent is not applicable to others before our courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is argued that if the state or any other party had a claim against Mrs. Kasuba and were she not incompetent, the circuit court would have had jurisdiction to determine the claim and, pursuant to GCR 1963, 528,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> could have granted relief from the judgment during a period in excess of three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">With exceptions not pertinent here, one of two standards is generally applied in scrutinizing legislation to determine whether it creates impermissible classifications. Where the legislative classification discriminates against a \"suspect\u201d class or impinges on a \"fundamental\u201d right, courts will examine it with \"strict scrutiny\u201d to identify some compelling state interest justifying the classification. If neither a suspect class nor fundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rights are involved, the classification will be upheld if it rationally furthers the object of the legislation. <em>San Antonio Independent School District v Rodriguez, </em>411 US 1; 93 S Ct 1278; 36 L Ed 2d 16 (1973); <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655; 232 NW2d 636 (1975). Under this second test, a legislative classification will only be found invalid where persons are treated differently on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated in a rational way to the objective of the statute. <em>Reed v Reed, </em>404 US 71; 92 S Ct 251; 30 L Ed 2d 225 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The classification to which the three-month limitation on rehearings is applicable embraces <em>all </em>persons interested in <em>all matters </em>within the jurisdiction of the probate court except juvenile orders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The Legislature has given the probate court jurisdiction over a variety of matters including decedents\u2019 estates, trusts, minors\u2019 estates and incompetents\u2019 estates. In limiting rehearings to three months, with the exception noted, it treats all such matters equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We would also point out that the provision may work to the benefit of a person like Mrs. Kasuba. Estates of incompetent persons, and others subject to the probate court\u2019s jurisdiction, are, by virtue of the statute under attack, not subject to rehearings on the claims of creditors where there is some claim of mistake or newly discovered evidence. That is, save for orders concerning juveniles, all parties with claims involving matters subject to the jurisdiction of the probate court are uniformly affected by the three-month limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We do not employ the \"strict scrutiny\u201d standard in examining the legislative classification in issue. It does not, by purpose or effect, create a constitutionally suspect classification. Suspect classifications include race, and in some settings national origin, alienage, indigency and illegitimacy. <em>San Antonio Independent School District v Rodriguez, supra </em>(Stewart, J., concurring). Nor does the legislation impinge on a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the constitution. As we have said in part II, <em>supra, </em>due process does not guarantee the right to a rehearing at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The correct standard, then, against which the legislation assigning selected matters to the jurisdiction of the probate court and limiting rehear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ings to three months should be measured is whether it rationally furthers the object of the Probate Code. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Classifications are not required to be made with mathematical precision. <em>Dandridge v Williams, </em>397 US 471; 90 S Ct 1153; 25 L Ed 2d 491 (1970). The classification in question is one which entrusts certain matters to the probate courts and treats all parties uniformly with respect to those matters. At issue in the case at bar is the administration of estates. Typically, the settlement of estates will concern the rights and claims of multiple parties with respect to a fixed aggregation of property that may fluctuate in value. The legislative policy in limiting rehearings on such matters is one favoring the prompt and final settlement of the various claims on an estate. We believe the limitation on rehearings rationally furthers this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-7\">Kavanagh, C.

The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than 1 year after the judgment order or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion under subrule 528.3 does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not actually personally notified as provided in subrule 528.2 above, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished, and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\"> As to juvenile proceedings, MOLA 712A.21; MSA 27.3178(598.21) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\"Sec. 21. Any interested person, at any time while the child is under the jurisdiction of the court, may file a petition, in writing and under oath, for a rehearing upon all matters coming within the provisions of this chapter, and upon the rehearing the court may affirm, modify or set aside any order so reviewed. If parental rights have been terminated by an order entered in the proceedings and custody of the child has been removed from the parents, guardian or other person, the petition for rehearing shall be filed within 3 months from the date of entry of the order terminating parental rights; and the petition shall set forth in detail the place, manner and all other information requested by the court in reference to the proposed future custody of the child.
