Bursley School District Equalization Act of 1973 in allocating funds to intermediate school districts for the 1973-74 school year. For the 1973-74 school year, the State School Aid Act, 1972 PA 258, as amended by the Bursley Act, 1973 PA 101, MCLA 388.1101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1919(501) <em>et seq., </em>provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\"From the amount appropriated in section 11,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is allocated to intermediate districts as established under the school code of 1955, the sum necessary but not to exceed $8,350,000.00 to provide state aid to intermediate districts. There shall be allocated to each intermediate district a sum obtained by multiplying the number of pupils in membership in the constituent districts of the intermediate district by $8.00 each, which shall be reduced by a sum equal to .2 mill on the state equalized valuation of the property in the intermediate district, or for any intermediate district having a fixed allocation of less than .2 mill adopted as a separate limitation pursuant to section 6 of article 9 of the state constitution of 1963, shall be reduced by a sum equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the fixed allocation levied on the state equalized valuation of the property in the intermediate district. However, an intermediate district shall not receive less than a 10% increase nor more than a $1.50 per pupil increase, in state aid under this subsection in 1973-74 over the state aid received under sections 81 and 82 in 1972-73.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Defendants used the following process to allocate the $8,350,000 of state aid among the state\u2019s 58 intermediate districts. First, defendants computed a base amount of state aid for each intermediate district by using the per pupil/state equalized valuation formula set out in the second sentence of \u00a7 81(1). Defendants then determined whether that base amount fell within the limits set by the last sentence of \u00a7 81(1) \u2014 more than a 10% increase, but less than a $1.50 per pupil increase \u2014 over 1972-73 state aid. If so, then the computed base amount of state aid was allocated to the district. If the base amount was less than a 10% increase over 1972-73 state aid for a given district, defendants allocated additional funds to reach the 10% increase level. If the district\u2019s computed base amount exceeded a $1.50 per pupil increase over 1972-73 state aid, defendants reduced that district\u2019s base amount to the amount representing a $1.50 per pupil increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Defendants\u2019 process of computation resulted in funding for 18 intermediate districts at the base amount computed by using the per pupil/state equalized valuation formula. For 27 districts, the base amount would be increased to provide 10% more state aid than in 1972-73, while for 13 districts the base amount would be decreased to the figure representing $1.50 per pupil more state aid than 1972-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">When defendants added together the amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>allocated to each district, they discovered that the total was $176,055 more than the $8,350,000 appropriated by \u00a7 81(1) of the Bursley Act. Defendants then performed one final computation. They multiplied each district\u2019s allowance by .97933432 to achieve a pro-rata reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">Plaintiff commenced an original mandamus action in the Court of Appeals, asking that defendants be compelled to pay over an additional $23,-944 in state aid for the 1973-74 school year. Plaintiff\u2019s base amount of state aid, computed using the per pupil/SEV formula, was $684,311. But plaintiff had received $1,053,332 in 1972-73. Thus, plaintiff was one of the 27 districts eligible for 10% increased funding. Plaintiff\u2019s claim of $23,944 represents the amount plaintiff\u2019s allocation was reduced by proration.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Plaintiff contends, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that defendants violated the Legislature\u2019s mandated 10% increase in subjecting plaintiff\u2019s allocation to pro-rata reduction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">We find defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 81(1) a reasonable construction of the statute and decline to affirm the Court of Appeals issuance of a writ of mandamus. In <em>Magreta v Ambassador Steel Co, </em>380 Mich 513, 519; 158 NW2d 473 (1968), we quoted with approval the following language of the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Moore, </em>95 US 760, 763; 24 L Ed 588, 589 (1877):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\" 'The construction given to a statute by those charged with the duty of executing it is always entitled to the most respectful consideration and ought not to be overruled without cogent reasons.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Defendants correctly interpreted the Legislature\u2019s allowance of $8,350,000 total funds for intermediate districts for the 1973-74 school year as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>absolute maximum. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 17. Defendants interpreted the three alternative funding provisions to require computation at the outermost limit of each alternative. That interpretation, while not the only possible interpretation, was not unreasonable. That construction gave maximum effect to the legislative intent as we perceive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The Court of Appeals correctly noted that the Legislature, by enacting the Bursley Act, radically altered the method of allocating funds to intermediate school districts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in an attempt to equalize state aid. To ameliorate the drastic changes from prior year funding that would have resulted for some districts through use of the new per pupil/ SEV formula, the Legislature modified the formula by enacting the alternate provisions of the last sentence of \u00a7 81(1). By performing its calculations at the outer limits of the alternative provisions of \u00a7 81(1), defendants achieved a result allowing maximum interplay among the elements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">But defendants\u2019 calculations resulted in total funding exceeding the amount appropriated by the Legislature. Defendants\u2019 pro rata reduction of all allocations was consistent with their established practice in similar situations and preserved the legislative funding scheme inherent in \u00a7 81(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Although the Bursley Act itself did not explain what was to be done when allocations exceeded appropriations, the general educational appropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tion contemplates pro-rata reduction. Section 11 of the Bursley Act appropriates from the school aid fund \"the sum necessary to fulfill the requirements of this act\u201d. Monies reached the school aid fund for the 1973-74 school year via 1973 PA 108, the general appropriation for the Michigan Department of Education. Section 15 of 1973 PA 108 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\">\"There is appropriated to the state school aid fund from the general fund of the state for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974, such sum as may be necessary to pay the amount of state aid for schools as authorized by Act No. 258 of the Public Acts of 1972 [the State School Aid Act], as amended, being sections 388.1101 to 388.1279 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Section 5 of 1973 PA 108 provided for pro-rata reduction when an appropriation was insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\"Except as otherwise provided by law, where the amount herein appropriated is less than the amount called for or required to be distributed by existing law, the state official, or body responsible for the administration of the particular appropriation shall reduce the payments under the appropriation made in this act upon a pro rata basis in such manner that the payments shall not exceed the appropriations herein contained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Defendants\u2019 application of the legislative directive of \u00a7 5 to payments under the Bursley Act was a reasonable interpretation of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Mandamus is not a matter of right. Issuance of a writ of mandamus is discretionary. <em>Schwartz v Secretary of State, </em>393 Mich 42, 50; 222 NW2d 517 (1974); <em>McLeod v State Board of Canvassers, </em>304 Mich 120; 7 NW2d 240 (1943). Discretion in this case requires judicial restraint.. We find no cogent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>reason for overruling the administrative interpretation of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">Issuance of a writ of mandamus is governed by equitable principles. <em>Franchise Realty Interstate Corp v </em>Detroit, 368 Mich 276; 118 NW2d 258 (1962). An equitable principle provides a cogent reason for denial of mandamus in this case. When plaintiff brought its action, the entire appropriation for the 1973-74 school year had been distributed. The monies necessary to pay plaintiff the $23,944 it claims would necessarily have to come from appropriations to other districts not parties to this proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find the injurious effect on the rights of others a cogent reason why mandamus should not issue. See 52 Am Jur 2d, Mandamus, \u00a7 33, p 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Court of Appeals is reversed. No costs, this being a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-5\">Kavanagh, C.
