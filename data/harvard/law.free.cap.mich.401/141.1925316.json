The police recorded the calls, and the recordings were subjected to spectrographic (voiceprint) analysis. The results of that analysis were admitted at the trial, ov\u00e9r objection, to corroborate the undercover agent\u2019s identification of Tobey as the person with whom he had conversed on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed Tobey\u2019s conviction on the ground that there was not an adequate foundation in this case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for admission of voiceprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The people contend that the foundation was adequate, and that spectrographic evidence is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Tobey, on cross appeal, contends that the trial judge erred in refusing to sever the two charges for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We affirm the Court of Appeals, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We are of the opinion that the people failed to discharge their obligation of establishing that identification by use of the sound spectrograph has gained general acceptance in the scientific community; therefore, sound spectrographic evidence is not admissible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The two informations charged distinct and separate offenses, and Tobey was entitled to a separate trial on each offense. On remand the prosecutor shall determine on which charge he first wishes to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">This Court recently reconsidered, in light of scholarly criticism,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Frye<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rule, adopted in earlier decisions of this Court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> limiting the admission of scientific evidence to a technique which has become \"sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs\u201d, and reaffirmed our adherence to that rule. <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352, 358, 406; 255 NW2d 171 (1977). In holding that polygraph (lie detector) evidence may be considered by a judge in deciding whether to grant a new trial but is not admissible at trial, this Court declared that general scientific recognition may not be established without the testimony of \"disinterested and impartial experts\u201d, \"disinterested scientists whose livelihood was not intimately connected with\u201d the new technique. <em>Id, </em>pp 358, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In the instant case, the people sought to establish the admissibility of voiceprint evidence through the testimony of Dr. Oscar Tos\u00ed and Lt. Ernest Nash.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The original voiceprint work was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>done by Lawrence Kersta for Bell Laboratories. Nash, an experienced police officer but not a scientist, was Kersta\u2019s pupil and assisted Tosi, a professor of audiology, in planning and conducting the study from which he concluded that voiceprints are reliable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither Nash nor Tosi, whose reputations and careers have been built on their voice-print work, can be said to be impartial or disinterested.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Reviewing this history, the supreme courts of California and Pennsylvania concluded recently that voiceprint evidence has not \"achieved that degree of general scientific acceptance as a reliable identification device which will permit the introduction of voiceprint evidence\u201d. <em>People v Kelly, </em>17 Cal 3d 24, 28; 130 Cal Rptr 144; 549 P2d 1240 (1976). <em>Commonwealth v Topa, </em>471 Pa 223; 369 A2d 1277 (1977). Maryland\u2019s intermediate appellate court reached the contrary conclusion that such evidence is admissible. <em>Reed v State, </em>35 Md App 472; 372 A2d 243 (Ct Spec App, 1977), <em>cert granted, </em>No. 62/Sept 1977 (Md Ct Apps, June 29, 1977). Nash or Tosi or both had testified in all three cases. Indeed, the work or testimony of Kersta, Tosi or Nash has been the principal evidence offered in support of the reliability of voice-prints in almost every case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The essential difference between the approaches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of the Maryland court and of the California and Pennsylvania courts is that the Maryland court did not require independent and impartial proof of general scientific acceptability, and the California and Pennsylvania courts require such proof, as does this Court, <em>People v Barbara, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The California court, after considering the work of Kersta and Tosi, and Nash\u2019s testimony, concluded that \"additional and impartial evidence regarding general acceptance\u201d was required before the people would be deemed to have carried \"their burden of establishing the reliability\u201d of voiceprint evidence. <em>People v Kelly, supra, </em>pp 38, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Pennsylvania court, expressing its respect for Lt. Nash\u2019s \"considerable expertise in the area of spectrography\u201d, similarly stated that \"his opinion, alone, will not suffice to permit the introduction of such scientific evidence into a court of law. Admissibility of the evidence depends upon the <em>general </em>acceptance of its validity by those scientists active in the field to which the evidence belongs.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v Topa, supra, </em>p 231; 369 A2d 1281 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The Pennsylvania court concluded, after reviewing the criticism of Kersta\u2019s and Tosi\u2019s work in articles published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \"that the reliability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sound spectrograph and voiceprint identification has not, as yet, been generally accepted by the scientific community concerned with acoustical science\u201d. <em>Id, </em>p 232; 369 A2d 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We conclude that the people have failed to demonstrate that voiceprint evidence has achieved general scientific acceptance as a reliable identification device, and therefore the trial court erred in admitting the voiceprint evidence. We echo the statement of the California Supreme Court that this \"decision is not intended in any way to foreclose the introduction of voiceprint evidence in future cases * * * where there is demonstrated solid scientific approval and support of [this] new method\u201d of identification. <em>People v Kelly, supra, </em>p 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The Court of Appeals rejected the people\u2019s contention that \"the two offenses, which occurred 12 days apart, constitute a single transaction for purposes of double jeopardy and, therefore, must be tried together\u201d, but concluded that the trial judge had discretion which he did not abuse by denying Tobey\u2019s motion for separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In <em>People v Johns, </em>336 Mich 617; 59 NW2d 20 (1953), this Court reviewed its earlier opinions and ruled that separate and distinct offenses may be charged as separate counts in an information and joined for trial where they are \"committed by the same acts <em>at the same time </em>and the same testimony must be relied on for conviction\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \"It is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>be noted that this Court has emphasized that the offenses charged in the several counts must arise out of substantially the same acts <em>committed at the same time.\u201d People v Johns, supra, </em>p 623 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">While Tobey\u2019s conduct in selling heroin on different days to the same person is substantially similar conduct, it is not the same conduct or act. For double jeopardy and joinder purposes each sale is separate conduct, a separate act and transaction, and, as the Court of Appeals correctly noted, a separate and distinct criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299, 301-302; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932), the defendant was convicted of three sales of morphine to the same purchaser and sentenced to serve five years and pay a fine on each count, the terms of imprisonment to run consecutively. The United States Supreme Court, affirming the convictions and sentences, rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the second and third sales constituted but one offense because they were made to the same person on successive days:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\"The sales charged in the second and third counts, although made to the same person, were distinct and separate sales made at different times. It appears from the evidence that shortly after delivery of the drug which was the subject of the first sale, the purchaser paid for an additional quantity, which was delivered the next day. But the first sale had been consummated, and the payment for the additional drug, however closely following, was the initiation of a separate and distinct sale completed by its delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">\"The contention on behalf of petitioner is that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>two sales, having been made to the same purchaser and following each other with no substantial interval of time between the delivery of the drug in the first transaction and the payment for the second quantity sold, constitute a single continuing offense. The contention is unsound. The distinction between the transactions here involved and an offense continuous in its character is well settled, as was pointed out by this court in the case of <em>In re Snow, </em>120 US 274 [7 S Ct 556; 30 L Ed 658 (1887)].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Reference has been made to the ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance which permit joinder of offenses which \"are of the same or similar character\u201d, or which \"are based on the same conduct or on a series of acts connected together or constituting parts .of a single scheme or plan\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The standards also provide, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>that when offenses have been joined \"solely on the ground that they are of the same or similar character, the defendant shall have a right to a severance of the offenses\u201d, and that in the other situations where joinder is permitted the court shall grant a severance \"whenever * * * it is deemed appropriate to promote a fair determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of each offense\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Since we conclude that the two sales were not the \"same conduct,\u201d or \"a series of acts connected together\u201d, or \"a series of acts * * * constituting parts of a single scheme or plan\u201d, and therefore the only basis for joining the two offenses in the instant case is that they \"are of the same or similar character,\u201d Tobey, under these standards, had a right to severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The commentary accompanying the standards explains that \"same conduct\u201d refers to multiple offenses \"as where a defendant causes more than one death by reckless operation of a vehicle\u201d. \"A series of acts connected together\u201d refers to multiple offenses committed \"to aid in accomplishing another, as with burglary and larceny or kidnapping and robbery\u201d. \"A series of acts * * * constituting parts of a single scheme or plan\u201d refers to a situation \"where a cashier made a series of false entries and reports to the commissioner of bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ing, all of which were designed to conceal his thefts of money from the bank\u201d;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> similarly see <em>People v McKinney, </em>10 Mich 54, 94-95 (1862).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">While Tobey\u2019s conduct in selling heroin on February 17 and February 29 was of a \"same or similar character\u201d it was not the \"same conduct\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">While the same person was the purchaser at each sale, two sales 12 days apart are not \"connected\u201d in the sense in which that term is used in these standards. <em>People v Johns, supra, </em>illustrates a series of connected acts properly joined. Counts charging Johns with maintainng a gaming room table and with keeping a place where gambling was permitted were joined. \"The acts committed, proof of which was essential to a conviction on each of the counts, occurred within an hour and a half and out of substantially the same transaction.\u201d <em>Id, </em>p 624. Similarly, if a person were to escape prison, steal an automobile and take hostages, all the offenses might be tried together as a series of connected acts. The fact that here there is but one seller and one purchaser cannot alone \"connect\u201d acts 12 days apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Nor is there a single scheme or plan. The undercover police agent testified that he never gave Tobey his telephone number or address. Accordingly, Tobey had no way of locating the officer to consummate any scheme or plan to make continuing sales of drugs to him; nor is there any evidence that Tobey had any such scheme or plan. The officer stated that he \"always called down\u201d any time he wished to see Tobey to make a purchase, and responded affirmatively to the question whether the sales and purchases were \"always initiated\u201d by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We adhere again to our earlier precedents<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and hold: a judge must sever two or more offenses when the offenses have been joined for trial solely on the ground that they are of the \"same or similar character\u201d and the defendant files a timely motion for severance objecting to the joinder; and a judge has no discretion to permit the joinder for trial of separate offenses committed at different times unless the offenses \"are based on the same conduct or on a series of acts connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance, Standard l.l.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">\"It seems to me unanswerable that no man should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>prejudiced in this manner when on trial for a capital offense. He has a right to be warned by the complaint and warrant of what he is accused, and ought not to be convicted of two different crimes, committed at different times, under one information, with the evidence of each confounded as a whole, and used indiscriminately to convict him of both. Such a proceeding violates every principle of justice, and places him at the mercy of the prosecutor; and, as, in this case, evidence not competent to prove one of the offenses, but admissible as to the other, is used to establish both crimes. Such a trial must necessarily be an unfair and illegal one.\u201d <em>People v Aikin, </em>66 Mich 460, 472; 33 NW 821 (1887).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Conviction reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-6\">Kavanagh, C.
