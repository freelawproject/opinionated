Jaques appeals as of right the State Bar Grievance Board\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>affirming imposition of a three-year suspension of his privilege to practice law, plus payment of costs ordered by a hearing panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The complaints filed against Mr. Jaques by the Grievance Board charged him with violating former Canon 28 of the Canons of Professional Ethics, Canon 2, DR 2-103(A) and DR 2-103(0; DR 2-104(A)(5); and DR 2-105(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Rule 15, \u00a7 2(2); 15, \u00a7 2(3) and 15, \u00a7 2(4) of the Supreme Court Rules relating to the State Bar of Michigan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It was alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Mr. Jaques personally and through the employment of others sought to and did solicit victims and survivors of the December 11, 1971 Port Huron tunnel explosion and that he personally urged certain persons to bring a lawsuit to compel an inquiry into the cause of the explosion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>This case is before us following lengthy proceedings below. A request for investigation and then a formal complaint were served upon Mr. Jaques in the first half of 1972, more than five years ago, following a general investigation of allegations of misconduct arising out of the tunnel explosion. The matter was assigned to Wayne County Hearing Panel No. 17 which heard the testimony of six witnesses. Appellant then offered to plead nolo contendere to charges as amended by an oral stipulation and his plea was accepted. The panel ordered a one-year suspension from practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The State Bar Grievance Board eventually set aside appellant\u2019s plea and remanded to Hearing Panel No. 17 to complete the formal hearing to the conclusion of the testimony. Two months prior to the filing of the board\u2019s order a second request for investigation was served on Mr. Jaques and it was followed by a second formal complaint. The two complaints were consolidated for trial and assigned to Hearing Panel No. 12, Panel No. 17 having disqualified itself. Panel No. 12 was thereafter also disqualified and the case was reassigned to Hearing Panel No. 2. The members of Panel No. 2 were furnished an edited transcript of the testimony and exhibits produced at the earlier, truncated hearing. Panel No. 2 then heard ten more days of testimony during the period between Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ber 1974 and May 1975 and entered an opinion and an order of discipline. The State Bar Grievance Board affirmed the findings and modified the order of discipline only as to the amount of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Mr. Jaques appeals the findings below, asserting nine instances of error which raise essentially the following three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">1. Whether Mr. Jaques was afforded a fair hearing in accordance with the applicable rules;</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">2. Whether it is unethical to solicit persons to join in a class action which has not yet been filed; and</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">3. Whether the findings of misconduct are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Mr. Jaques claims the hearing afforded him was defective because: Hearing Panel No. 2 merely read the transcripts but did not hear the testimony of witnesses who appeared before Panel No. 17; the State Bar Grievance Administrator did not call all res gestae witnesses to the alleged misconduct; the hearing panel quashed a subpoena of counsel for the State Bar Grievance Administrator, denying appellant\u2019s alleged right to call and examine him; the hearing panel did not conduct itself as an impartial arbiter; and, finally, the formal complaint gave insufficient notice of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Due process is the underpinning of these allegations of error. What we are concerned with, then, is that Mr. Jaques must have been afforded a fair hearing as well as one conducted in accordance with the rules adopted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">A good deal of appellant\u2019s argument is put to us by way of analogy to criminal cases. We have long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>recognized that discipline and disbarment proceedings are quasi-criminal in character. <em>State Bar of Michigan v Woll, </em>387 Mich 154; 194 NW2d 835 (1972). In light of that recognition we have imposed some of the same safeguards applied in criminal proceedings to grievance procedures for the protection of attorneys faced with charges of professional misconduct. For example, we have held that the allegedly errant attorney has a right to cross-examine witnesses, <em>State Bar of Michigan v Murphy, </em>387 Mich 632; 198 NW2d 289 (1972), and to be fairly and specifically informed of the charges against him, <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Freid, </em>388 Mich 711; 202 NW2d 692 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">It is important, however, to remember that we are dealing with the disciplinary procedures of the State Bar of Michigan. As Justice Levin said in concurring in <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Estes, </em>390 Mich 585, 602; 212 NW2d 903 (1973), \"the Grievance Board is part of the administrative structure of this Court\u201d. The State Bar Rules \"shall be liberally construed for the protection of the public, the courts and the legal profession\u201d. State Bar Grievance Rule 16.34(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">In the State Bar Rules and in previous cases we have accordingly approved variances between disciplinary proceedings and the rigorous standards applied in the trial of criminal cases. We impose discipline if misconduct is proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Jackson, </em>390 Mich 147; 211 NW2d 38 (1973); Grievance Rule 16.13. The cases are tried before panels of lawyers and the applicable rules provide that hearings are to be conducted in the same fashion as civil trials in nonjury cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">It is fundamental that Mr. Jaques, as an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ney whose privilege to practice law is at stake, is entitled to a full and fair hearing. We do not believe, however, that we must apply the law of criminal trials to disciplinary proceedings at every turn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\"Due process * * * is a term that 'negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\u2019 <em>Cafeteria Workers v McElroy, </em>367 US 886, 895 [81 S Ct 1743; 6 L Ed 2d 1230] (1961). Determining what process is due in a given setting requires the Court to take into account the individual\u2019s stake in the decision at issue as well as the State\u2019s interest in a particular procedure for making it.\u201d <em>Hortenville Joint School Dist No 1 v Hortenville Education </em>Association, 426 US 482, 494; 96 S Ct 2308; 49 L Ed 2d 1 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Having said this much, we proceed to consider the individual allegations of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">We first hold that the hearing panel erred in receiving and considering as substantive evidence the edited transcript of the testimony of the witnesses who appeared before Panel No. 17. We need go no further than the State Bar Rules to reach this conclusion, although even without the rule our notion of fundamental fairness leads to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Rule 16 of the State Bar Rules created the State Bar Grievance Board as an arm of this Court for the discharge of our exclusive constitutional duty to supervise the State Bar. Rule 16 and the associated Procedural and Administrative Rules prescribe the conduct of hearings on complaints issued by the State Bar Grievance Administrator. State Bar Rule 16 assigns to hearing panels the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>duty of holding public hearings, making findings of fact and ordering discipline, and requires that their actions be reported to the State Bar Grievance Board. Grievance Rule 16.3 provides that two members of the panel constitute a quorum and that action shall be by vote of a majority. Grievance Rule 16.10 allows the board to \"reassign a complaint when the hearing panel fails to convene or complete its hearing within a reasonable time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Grievance Administrator argued and the hearing panel agreed that when a case is reassigned it is not necessary to hear anew the testimony of witnesses who had appeared at an earlier hearing before the first panel. Under the circumstances present in the instant case, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Although the rules contemplate the reassignment of cases, Grievance Rule 16.3.3(b) is also relevant. It provides that hearing panels shall \"[r]eceive evidence and make written findings of fact\u201d. We believe the directive of Grievance Rule 16.3.3(b) establishes a preference for the hearing panel that makes the initial finding of fact to likewise receive the testimony of witnesses. Where, as in the case at bar, the demeanor of witnesses may be an important factor in the resolution of disputed facts, Grievance Rule 16.3.3(b) controls and, absent an agreement to the contrary, the hearing panel to which a case is reassigned may not simply consider the record testimony of the witnesses who have appeared and resume the hearing where the former panel left off. See generally, 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 11.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Our holding assures that where conflicting testimony must be resolved, a quorum of a hearing panel will personally hear and observe all the witnesses whose testimony is to be considered unless the Grievance Administrator properly es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tablishes justification for their non-appearance, as for example where a witness is shown to be unavailable and his testimony is therefore admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Of the six witnesses who testified at the hearing before Panel No. 17 in the instant case, three did not appear at the second. Appellant did not agree to the second panel\u2019s consideration of their recorded testimony and the Grievance Administrator\u2019s belated attempts to argue their unavailability do not satisfy the requirements of our case law for the use . of former testimony. See <em>Rotter v Detroit United Railway </em>217 Mich 686; 187 NW 271 (1922); <em>Karwick v Pickands, </em>181 Mich 169; 147 NW 605 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Hearing Panel No. 2 found that Mr. Jaques violated disciplinary rules in four instances, which for the sake of convenient reference we characterize as findings I, II, III and IV, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I. That Mr. Jaques personally solicited the local laborer\u2019s union and some of its members to join in a class action Mr. Jaques was planning to file to compel the Coast Guard to investigate the tunnel explosion, in violation of DR 2-103(A) and DR 2-103(C). See also DR 2-104(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">II. That Mr. Jaques requested the agent for the local union, Robert J. McLaughlin, to recommend him to persons who had claims arising out of the explosion. DR 2-103(0 prohibits a lawyer from requesting another to recommend his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">III. That Mr. Jaques visited the home of Mrs. Rose Woolstenhulme, whose husband and grandson died in the explosion, and requested to be employed to represent her in violation of DR 2-103(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">IV. That Mr. Jaques requested William Rounso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ville, steward of the local laborer\u2019s union, to recommend him to survivors of victims of the tunnel explosion, violating DR 2-103(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Findings III and IV were based in substantial part upon the testimony of the witnesses Rose Woolstenhulme, Madalene Williams and William Rounsoville who appeared before Panel No. 17 but not before Panel No. 2. The State Bar Grievance Board affirmed. For the reasons stated, we reverse those two findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The erroneous use by Panel No. 2 of the transcript of the earlier testimony does not, however, vitiate the entire proceeding. See <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975). We reject Mr. Jaques\u2019 contention that it does. It was not simply the hearing panel\u2019s reading of the transcript which causes us to reverse findings III and IV, but its use as substantive evidence to support those findings. In making findings of misconduct I and II, the hearing panel did not rely upon the challenged transcript, but upon other witnesses the panel did see and hear. The unfairness which resulted from the panel\u2019s improper reliance upon the transcript relates to findings III and IV only, and is amply rectified by our reversal of the Grievance Board\u2019s findings with respect thereto. In so concluding, we believe appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>People v Ramsey, </em>385 Mich 221; 187 NW2d 887 (1971) to be misplaced. <em>Ramsey </em>holds that in a criminal nonjury trial the presiding judge may not view the preliminary examination transcript. That decision is based on MCLA 768.26; MSA 28.1049 concerning the use of former testimony in criminal trials and the policy underlying a court rule<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requiring, in the absence of consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>that the judge who conducted the preliminary examination should not also try the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The requirements of a fair hearing are not technical. Mr. Jaques had a full evidentiary hearing before the hearing panel. The State Bar Grievance Board reviewed the entire record. Mr. Jaques is now before us on an appeal as of right. The members of this Court are bound to review the entire record to determine whether the findings, as affirmed by the Grievance Board, \"have proper evidentiary support\u201d. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Estes, supra, </em>593; <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Beck, </em>400 Mich 40; 252 NW2d 795 (1977); Grievance Rule 16.24(h). Recognizing Mr. Jaques\u2019 substantial stake in the outcome of this case, we believe the procedures afforded him satisfy the requirements of due process. We will, therefore, consider findings I and II and proceed to determine whether those findings have \"proper evidentiary support\u201d, and whether the hearing afforded Mr. Jaques was otherwise fairly conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appellant next contends that Grievance Rule 16.5.2(b) which directs counsel for the State Bar Grievance Administrator to \"[p]resent all available evidence relating to complaints\u201d imposes upon him the same duty as that imposed upon the prosecutor in a criminal case to produce and examine all of the res gestae witnesses unless their testimony would be cumulative. <em>Hurd v People, </em>25 Mich 405 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The duty to present all res gestae witnesses to a transaction or event has been applied only in criminal cases and, even then, is a duty imposed only upon the people. Its roots are in this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>historic concern that when the full investigative and prosecutorial power of the state is annoyed with an accused in a criminal case, the people\u2019s duty is not met where only such evidence as points toward guilt is produced when there exists other evidence which may suggest innocence. It is a product of judicial policy that the prosecutor may not pick and choose which witnesses will fairly present the whole picture, but requires the production of all witnesses to an alleged crime, leaving it to the trier of fact to decide whether in the totality guilt is proven. We have discovered no authority, and the appellant has invited our attention to none, suggesting the duty to call res gestae witnesses applicable to bar discipline proceedings. We decline to so extend the rule of criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">We do agree, however, that although not bound by the prophylactic rule of criminal law concerning res gestae witnesses, counsel for the Grievance Administrator does have the duty to seek justice and to develop a full and fair record. See ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 7, Ethical Consideration 7-14 concerning government lawyers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Grievance Administrator\u2019s duty was satisfied in the instant case. The two remaining charges against Mr. Jaques arose out of one incident. Counsel for the Grievance Administrator presented the testimony of two witnesses to that incident. Appellant called and examined several other persons present on the occasion. We believe the hearing was a fair one in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The hearing panel quashed a subpoena served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>by appellant on Eugene LaBelle, counsel for the State Bar Grievance Administrator at the proceedings before both hearing panels. Relying on <em>People v Davis, </em>52 Mich 569; 18 NW 362 (1884), and <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975), appellant claims he was denied an opportunity to reach material matters. The subpoena here in question was served on Mr. LaBelle in March of 1975, after the hearing panel had heard seven days of testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The reason given for calling Mr. LaBelle was to determine why some res gestae witnesses had not been called; whether any promise had been made to an attorney who was a chief witness against Mr. Jaques and who was associated with him during the period concerned here, that no complaint would be brought against the witness by the administrator in exchange for the testimony; and what conversations, if any, Mr. LaBelle had with other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Appellant was afforded an opportunity to confront and cross-examine all of the witnesses against him. His claim, then, is that in the denial of an opportunity to question counsel, he was deprived of a fair hearing. The administrator, an assistant administrator and two investigators did testify before the hearing panel. Although we believe Mr. LaBelle could have testified, we do not believe the action of the hearing panel in quashing the subpoena deprived Mr. Jaques of a fair hearing. We will not extend <em>Reed, supra, </em>to disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Appellant next alleges he was denied a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>hearing because the members of the hearing panel were not impartial and because they became \"embroiled in the advocacy of the cause\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The allegation consists of several parts. We have already dealt with the effect of the hearing panel having viewed the transcript of the prior hearing. As to the alleged hostility of members of the hearing panel, we have reviewed the record and we are of the opinion that the <em>conduct </em>of the panel was entirely fair throughout the lengthy hearing and its members did not improperly examine witnesses. A trial judge may examine witnesses and call witnesses not called by either party. <em>Nicholson v Davis, </em>327 Mich 115; 41 NW2d 494 (1950); <em>Masters v Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins Co, </em>349 Mich 98; 84 NW2d 462 (1957), and neither logic nor cited authority suggests the hearing panel may not do likewise. We must remember the nature of these proceedings and that we liberally construe the rules for the protection of the public, the courts and the profession. Grievance Rule 16.34. Appellant was not prevented from calling or cross-examining any witnesses or from getting important evidence into the record. We believe the record shows appellant\u2019s defense was not undermined. See <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Beck, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Appellant also complains of the hearing panel\u2019s ruling sustaining objections to questions put to it by his counsel concerning the appointment of members of the panel and possible previous connection with other discipline proceedings. We held in <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Baun, </em>395 Mich 28; 232 NW2d 621 (1975), that the administrative connection between the Grievance Administrator, the hearing panel and the Grievance Board is sufficiently attenuated so that, without more, the discipline procedures are not inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>defective. Absent specific allegations of facts indicating bias or improper composition of the hearing panel, we perceive no denial of due process. See <em>Baun, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Finally in this connection, appellant complains of alleged <em>ex parte </em>communications between members of the hearing panel and the grievance administrator. None of the citations to the record show any communications resulting in denial of a fair hearing. We do not believe a miscarriage of justice resulted from advice by counsel for the grievance administrator to members of the hearing panel that the administrator would oppose motions filed by appellant and his brief discussion concerning scheduling of hearing dates with one member, or from a member somehow hearing that appellant had served a subpoena on a potential witness. The members of the hearing panel stated that they had not discussed the merits of the case with counsel. Grievance Rule 16.34(c). See <em>Beck, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellant\u2019s last due process argument concerns the addition of the second complaint and a claimed variance between the charges of the formal complaint and the findings of the hearing panel. We believe, first, that the complaints fairly informed appellant of the charges and that the findings we review here do not vary from the charges in those complaints. The charges are recited in footnote 3. A more definite statement could have been requested if one was desired and a conference could have been ordered on request to narrow the issues. GCR 1963, 115; Grievance Rule 16.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Moreover, we do not believe there was a failure to give advance notice of the charges which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>deprive appellant of due process. <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 US 544, 550; 88 S Ct 1222; 20 L Ed 2d 117 (1968). Although the second complaint added more explicit detail regarding the charge of solicitation of and through McLaughlin concerning the class action, we believe the factual allegations of the original complaint were sufficient notice of that charge, particularly when the entire complaint is considered. It specified violation of DR 2-104(A)(5) which directly concerns class actions. See footnote 1. Indeed the first hearing opened with argument by counsel for Mr. Jaques that DR 2-104(A)(5) condoned his conduct. The State Bar argued that Mr. Jaques\u2019 interpretation of the rule was incorrect. This is not a case of charges being amended in the middle of a hearing to trap an attorney by his own testimony. Compare <em>Ruffalo, supra. </em>For the same reason we believe the addition of DR 2-103(A) by the second complaint was not unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Similarly we are not persuaded that continuation of the hearing on the original charges after the Grievance Board allowed Mr. Jaques to withdraw his nolo contendere plea to the stipulated complaint amendments which involved solicitation of one survivor, Mrs. Woolstenhulme, and of Robert McLaughlin concerning a class action was unfair. We will not, as appellant requests, extend the principle of <em>People v McMiller, </em>389 Mich 425; 208 NW2d 451 (1973), to discipline proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The principal policy reasons underlying the decision in <em>McMiller </em>to prohibit the imposition of charges of a greater offense following successful appeal of a plea-based criminal conviction were two, and were stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\"Allowing trial on a higher charge following reversal of a plea-based conviction of a lesser offense would (1) discourage exercise of the defendant\u2019s right to appeal a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>conviction claimed to be based on an improperly accepted plea, and (2) tend to insulate from appellate scrutiny non-compliance with the guilty plea procedure established by the statute and the court rule.\u201d 389 Mich 432.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Overriding those considerations was the statistical reality that 75% of this state\u2019s criminal cases are disposed of by guilty plea and the <em>McMiller </em>Court\u2019s apparent desire to encourage a continuing high rate of plea-based dispositions in order to avoid the injustice inherent in criminal case docket backlog.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Those considerations are not applicable to bar discipline proceedings in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Mr. Jaques contends that it is not improper for a lawyer to contact others for the purpose of obtaining their joinder to an action in the nature of a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Mr. Jaques had been retained on December 13, 1971 by the father of a deceased tunnel worker. At the hearing Mr. Jaques testified that he telephoned Robert J. McLaughlin, the union\u2019s business agent, for the purpose of discussing the possibility of the union and others joining in a class action he was going to bring to compel the Coast Guard to investigate the tunnel explosion. On December 15 a meeting was suggested and eventually agreed on and Mr. Jaques arranged for a room at a Holiday Inn near Port Huron. The meeting was held later that same day. McLaughlin, a number of union members invited by him (none of whom were victims or survivors of victims), and Father Luigi Maggioni, who represented the families of two victims, attended. Mr. Jaques took along some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>newspaper clippings about a successful suit he had initiated similar to the class action he was proposing to file and some \"agreements to represent\u201d by which potential plaintiffs could join the suit. The agreements provided no fee would be charged. Several other persons who attended the meeting gave testimony which corroborated the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Appellant argues that DR 2-104(A)(5) recognizes a privilege to \"contact others for the purpose of obtaining their joinder\u201d and that consequently he should not be disciplined for this activity. The State Bar argues that the disciplinary rule allows only the acceptance of employment, not solicitation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">DR 2-104(A) establishes a general prohibition on the acceptance of employment by lawyers who have given unsolicited legal advice. It then provides, however, five exceptions. The fifth, which is in issue here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\"If success in asserting rights or defenses of his client in litigation in the nature of a class action is dependent upon the joinder of others, a lawyer may accept, <em>but shall not seek, </em>employment from those contacted for the purpose of obtaining their joinder.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Without judging Mr. Jaques\u2019 determination that an action in the nature of mandamus to compel the Coast Guard to investigate the explosion was appropriate, or that the suit would be more likely to be successful if brought as a class action, we believe the disciplinary rules adopted by this Court are not tolerant of the sort of conduct in which Mr. Jaques was here engaged. Although Mr. Jaques had a client, no suit had yet been filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in-person meeting was <em>initiated by Mr. Jaques </em>four days after the tragic tunnel explosion and involved persons with whom he had no prior professional contact. We are not here concerned with court-approved notice to members of a court-approved class.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The entire thrust of the disciplinary rules is that it is unprofessional for an attorney to seek out and solicit persons with whom he or she has no preexisting relationship in order to suggest litigation begin. DR 2-103(A) prohibits a lawyer from recommending his employment to a nonlawyer who has not sought his advice regarding employment of a lawyer, and under DR 2-103(C) he m\u00e1y not request another to recommend his employment. We believe DR 2-104(A)(5), although allowing acceptance of employment under certain circumstances, represents continued disapproval of personal solicitation by lawyers of specific claims. See ABA Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances, Formal Opinion No. Ill (May 10, 1934); ABA Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Informal Opinion No. 1283 (November 20, 1973); <em>Halverson v Convenient Food Mart, Inc, </em>458 F2d 927 (CA 7, 1972). Although we acknowledge and will consider that Mr. Jaques suggests a plausible interpretation of the rule, we do not believe it is a correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Mr. Jaques attacks the findings of the hearing panel as being unsupported by the evidence. We have reviewed the record to determine whether there is proper evidentiary support for the two remaining findings of misconduct, I and II.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The hearing panel first found, as discussed above, that Mr. Jaques had personally solicited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>local union and others to join in a class action that would be commenced. Mr. Jaques\u2019 own testimony is sufficient proof of this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">It was also found that Mr. Jaques requested the union agent, Mr. McLaughlin, to recommend him to persons who had claims arising out of the tunnel explosion. It is undisputed that Mr. Jaques telephoned Mr. McLaughlin, ostensibly for the purpose of getting the union to join the contemplated class action. McLaughlin\u2019s testimony at the second hearing supports the findings. He testified that he told Mr. Jaques that most of the families of the tunnel victims had not retained an attorney. Mr. Jaques suggested the two should meet. It is also fairly clear that Mr. Jaques gave Mr. McLaughlin a number of business cards and contingent fee contracts. Mr. Jaques\u2019 associate testified before Panel No. 2 that there was a one- to two-inch high stack of Jaques\u2019 business cards on a table at the motel, as well as a number of the standard contracts which Mr. Jaques\u2019 personal injury claim clients generally signed. Other witnesses who attended the meeting testified they did not see any cards or contracts on any table. Mr. Jaques claims the contracts given to McLaughlin concerned only the class action. However, McLaughlin testified on cross-examination that the contracts contained the word \"death\u201d which does not appear in the \"authority to represent agreement\u201d Mr. Jaques produced at that later hearing and claimed was the only agreement distributed at the Holiday Inn. McLaughlin testified that Mr. Jaques told him in regard to the business cards that he could \"meet with my people\u201d and pass them out, \"my people\u201d being the surviving family members of the deceased laborers. McLaughlin apparently did not actively distribute the agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In view of the foregoing we conclude that the findings that Mr. Jaques violated DR 2-103(A) and DR 2-103(0 by personally soliciting McLaughlin and members of the local laborer\u2019s union to join in a class action he was planning to file, and DR 2-103(C) by requesting McLaughlin, the agent for the local union, to recommend him to persons who had claims arising out of the tunnel explosion, heretofore described as Grievance Board findings I and II respectively, are supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">As indicated, we reverse Grievance Board findings III and IV, the alleged solicitation of Rose Woolstenhulme and the alleged request of William Rounsoville to recommend Jaques to survivors of explosion victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Conduct violating rules of ethics adopted by this Court and conduct exposing the profession to obloquy, contempt, censure or reproach are grounds for discipline.

In <em>Bates v State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 US 350; 97 S Ct 2691; 53 L Ed 2d 810 (1977), the United States Supreme Court held that a rule which would punish truthful newspaper advertisement concerning the availability and terms of routine legal services is violative of the first Amendment. The Court specifically pointed out, however, that the problems of in-person solicitation and the attendant possibilities for the exertion of undue influence were not before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The instant case presents a situation not of impersonal advertising of routine services directed to the public in general. Rather, we are concerned with direct solicitation of specific claims by an attorney. In addition, it is clear from Mr. Jaques\u2019 own testimony that he took to Port Huron newspaper clippings relating his accomplishments as a lawyer. The decision in <em>Bates, supra, </em>also reserved decision on whether restrictions could be placed on claims as to the quality of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Since <em>Bates </em>does not reach the constitutionality of the disciplinary rules violated by Mr. Jaques, it is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b626-8\">Blair Moody, Jr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agp\"><em>(concurring in part). </em>I concur with the analysis and conclusion that the appellant improperly contacted and sought employment from members of a union to join in a class action and asked a union official to solicit clients for him.

Jaques solicited persons to join his clients, the parents of a victim of the Port Huron tunnel explosion, in a class action seeking a Coast Guard investigation of the explosion and asked a union business agent to recommend him to other persons who had claims arising out of the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The Court affirms the board\u2019s determination of professional misconduct on the grounds that Jaques acknowledged in his testimony at the griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>anee hearing that he had solicited the union to join his clients in a class action and there was substantial evidence supporting the charge that he asked the union official to recommend him to persons who had claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A disciplinary rule permits a lawyer to communicate with others for the purpose of obtaining their joinder in \"litigation in the nature of a class action\u201d where \"success in asserting rights or defenses of his client * * * is dependent upon the joinder of others\u201d. Code of Professional Responsibility and Canons, DR 2-104(A). The Court states that because no action had as yet been filed in behalf of Jaques\u2019 clients the communications seeking joinder were improper. This limitation is not found in the rule and conflicts with its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">There was indeed substantial evidence that supports the finding that Jaques asked a union official to recommend him to persons who had claims. The hearing panel, in findings adopted by the grievance board, said that \"crucial\u201d to this determination was the testimony of a young former associate of Jaques.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was some other evidence, but there would not have been substantial evidence without her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A theory of the defense was that she had facilitated the solicitation of victims\u2019 families in a manner which gave the impression that Jaques had done so, and that she testified against him in the expectation that the grievance administrator would refrain from bringing charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The associate acknowledged that she asked Eu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>gene LaBelle, attorney for the grievance administrator, shortly before she testified, whether she would be charged and said he responded that he did not believe it was likely. Jaques\u2019 lawyer was not permitted to question LaBelle regarding his conversations with this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In finding against Jaques, the panel declared \"that there has been no demonstration of any motive on the part\u201d of the associate to testify falsely. Its refusal to allow LaBelle to be questioned may have prevented Jaques from establishing such a motive by showing that, as a result of conversations between this witness and LaBelle there was a basis for a reasonable expectation on her part that if her testimony supported the allegations against Jaques she would not face charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We would reverse and remand for further proceedings because Jaques had a right to seek to impeach this witness by attempting to show that her discussions with LaBelle provided a basis for a reasonable expectation of forebearance or leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Two days after the December 11th tunnel explosion, the Woods retained Jaques to recover damages for the death of their son; they entered into a contingent fee agreement. There is no claim that Jaques obtained these clients or, indeed, any other client, in violation of the canons or disciplinary rules. The claim is that he solicited, apparently unsuccessfully, for additional clients who had claims arising out of the tunnel explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The hearing panel found that on \"December 14 * * * Jaques decided that the United States Coast Guard should be required to investigate the tunnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>explosion as he was of the opinion they were more competent than the state agencies\u201d. In another case he had obtained Federal court order compelling the Coast Guard to make an investigation of an accident that occurred on Lake Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Jaques telephoned the business agent for the local union of which 19 of those who died in the explosion were members, to arrange a meeting to discuss a class action to compel the Coast Guard to conduct an investigation of the explosion. Jaques was accompanied to the meeting by his associate. The business agent invited six union members and a priest to the meeting. None of those present was a victim or related to a victim. The priest was interested in the families of two who died in the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Jaques made a presentation urging the union and others to join his client in an action to compel a Coast Guard investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The business agent testified that the discussion at the meeting concerned Jaques\u2019 efforts to obtain joinder in an effort to obtain a Coast Guard investigation. He said that because he was concerned with finding lawyers to represent \"[his] people\u201d he believes he asked Jaques for business cards. He recalled receiving agreement forms. By the time of the hearing he had discarded all the forms. He could not describe the contents of the form, but when shown Jaques\u2019 form contingent fee agreement he said it \"looked like\u201d the forms he received at the meeting. He denied that Jaques suggested that he \"ought to get him some clients\u201d or recommend him to victims\u2019 families.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Jaques testified that the forms he gave McLaughlin were \"agreement to represent contracts\u201d, applicable only to the proposed class action, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that they specifically provided that no fee would be charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The associate confirmed that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the proposed class action and that during the presentation Jaques told the audience there would be no charge for participation. She testified further, however, that Jaques piled a \"fist full\u201d of contingent fee agreement forms and a stack of business cards on a table in the meeting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The associate also testified that Jaques had given $100 to a union steward to cover expenses on a trip to Indiana to talk to widows of victims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the findings of the grievance board concerning solicitation through this person are set aside for the reasons set forth in my colleague\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Two of the union members who were present at the meeting and the priest said they did not recall seeing either stacks of business cards or of forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The Court infers from the business agent\u2019s affirmative response to the isolated question whether the form contained the word \"death\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the business agent thereby identified the forms he received as contingent fee forms. The thrust of the business agent\u2019s testimony, however, was that Jaques never asked him to solicit clients, and that Jaques\u2019 only concern was the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">It is apparent that the only substantial evidence supportive of the finding that Jaques \"requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>the [business] agent for the local union </em>* * * to recommend him to persons who had claims arising out of the explosion\u201d was the testimony of his former associate. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">There was no evidence that the business agent passed out any of the forms or that he himself solicited or caused anyone to solicit any of the victims\u2019 families. The only proper conclusion on this record is that none of the victims\u2019 families were solicited as a result of any effort by the business agent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">After the associate completed her testimony, LaBelle and Jaques\u2019 lawyer entered into a number of stipulations, one of which was that the associate\u2019s testimony recounting conversations with La-Belle was incomplete. The panel refused to accept this stipulation and ordered that she reappear. On her further appearance, in response to a question concerning the omitted portion of the conversation, she said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\"In any event, indirectly related to this case was that I asked Mr. LaBelle if he though \u2014 and this was after I told him my version of the story \u2014 if he thought that anything I did would likely give rise to a complaint against me by the bar, and his answer was that, well, one never knows for sure about those things, but, having heard the facts, he did not believe that it was likely, that there would be any \u2014 .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Jaques subpoenaed LaBelle who refused to be sworn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing panel granted a motion to quash the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The panel found that in arranging the meeting and urging the union to join in a class action to compel a Coast Guard investigation Jaques had, on his own testimony, personally solicited employment in violation of the disciplinary rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">A disciplinary rule provides that a lawyer may not seek employment from non-lawyers who have not sought his advice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jaques contends that he was not seeking employment but, rather, joinder in litigation in the nature of a class action as permitted by another disciplinary rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\"If success in asserting rights or defenses of his client in litigation in the nature of a class action is dependent upon the joinder of others, a lawyer may accept, but, shall not seek, employment from those contacted for the purpose of obtaining their joinder.\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility and Canons, DR 2-104(A)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The administrator contends that \"shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>seek\u201d modifies both \"employment\u201d and \"joinder\u201d and that the rule therefore prohibits seeking either employment or joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The Court notes that while the Woods had hired Jaques, no action \"had yet been filed\u201d when the meeting took place. It concludes that an attorney may not \"seek out and solicit persons with whom he or she has no pre-existing relationship in order to suggest litigation begin\u201d and that the \"disciplinary rules * * * are not tolerant of the sort of conduct in which Mr. Jaques was here engaged\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The phrase in the disciplinary rule, \"from those contacted for the purpose of obtaining their joinder\u201d, manifestly means that it is proper to communicate with others to obtain their joinder. The principal limitation is that a lawyer may not seek employment from persons with whom he communicates; the rule permits him to accept employment from such persons if offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Implicit in the rule is that a lawyer seeking joinder must have a client, but neither the language nor policy of the rule requires that an action have been commenced before solicitation of joinder in that action or in an ancillary action; \"presuit communications\u201d are permitted. <em>Halverson v Convenient Food Mart, Inc, </em>458 F2d 927, 930-931 (CA 7, 1972). The only limitations in that regard are that the litigation be \"in the nature of a class action\u201d and that the client\u2019s success in asserting rights or defenses in such litigation is \"dependent upon the joinder of others\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Delay in seeking joinder might be a disservice to the lawyer\u2019s client, playing into the hands of an adversary who might argue that the delay in seeking joinder should be counted against the client should the lawyer seek to add parties in an action already commenced or to commence an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ancillary class action. It might be of utmost importance to assemble all the forces at the outset to persuade the judge of the substantiality of the claim or the significance of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">All who testified, including the associate, agreed that Jaques made it clear to the audience that those joining in the class action would not be charged; the hearing panel so found. The proposed class action did not seek a money recovery but simply an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">There is no finding that the meeting was a pretext and that the real purpose was to solicit the families of victims to employ Jaques to represent them on a contingent fee basis. On the contrary, the panel found that Jaques\u2019 \"purpose\u201d in calling the business agent was to solicit the union and others to join in the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Jaques subsequently filed an action in the United States District Court in the name of the Woods to compel a Coast Guard investigation. (Neither the union nor any of the other victims joined in this action. The action was not successful.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The rule differentiates between solicitation for the purpose of obtaining joinder and solicitation of employment. It is not unethical for a lawyer to solicit other claimants to join with his client in a class action \"if his motive is not to secure fees for himself\u2019. <em>Halverson v Convenient Food Mart, Inc, supra, </em>p 931.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Jaques had a client when he communicated with the business agent and sought the union\u2019s joinder in the class action. He may not properly be disciplined for expeditiously seeking joinder of others in the action to compel a Coast Guard investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In finding that Jaques gave the business agent contingent fee forms and requested that he solicit clients for him, the panel relied primarily on the testimony of Jaques\u2019 former associate. Her credibility was, therefore, as the panel itself observed, of \"crucial\u201d importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Jaques sought to impeach her. He said that she had lied to him on several occasions, and that they were not on good terms when she left his employ. Witnesses contradicted various aspects of her testimon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>It was Jaques\u2019 position that it was she who was guilty of misconduct. A witness testified that she gave him Jaques\u2019 contingent fee forms and business cards. Jaques said this was without his knowledge. The priest said that the associate called him within two days after the meeting to question him regarding the two families in which he had an interest. Jaques testified that the associate would receive a percentage of the legal business she brought to his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Jaques sought to prove that the associate was fearful that she would be charged with misconduct and agreed to testify against him in an effort to avoid being charged herself. The panel erred in denying Jaques\u2019 lawyer the opportunity to question LaBelle regarding any discussion or understanding with the associate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>People v Davis, </em>52 Mich 569; 18 NW 362 (1884); <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342, 354; 224 NW2d 867 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Evidence of a witness\u2019s interest or motive for testifying has a direct bearing on credibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The issue is never collateral.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The panel relied fundamentally on the associate\u2019s testimony in finding that Jaques had requested the business agent to solicit clients for him. The panel chose to believe her in preference to the conflicting testimony of Jaques, the business agent and other witnesses because \"there has been no demonstration of any motive on [her] part * * * [w]hile, on the other hand, Jaques\u2019 motive to fail to be completely truthful and honest with the panel can be explained only by either his failure to have the integrity to tell the truth and/or his desire not to be punished for the offense which appears to this panel to be clear\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The associate acknowledged that she was apprehensive she might be charged. If the panel had believed Jaques it is possible she would have been charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\"[Agreements regarding the testimony of a witness materially affect the bias or interest of a witness and should be placed before the trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if there has been no actual promise of leniency, it is proper \"to show a belief or even only a hope\u201d of securing favorable treatment, in return for testimony. <em>Farkas v United States, </em>2 F2d 644, 647 (CA 6, 1924).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Jaques was not bound by the associate\u2019s statement denying that LaBelle had made any commitment. She \"was certainly not as reliable or objective a source of testimony\u201d regarding her motives for testifying as LaBelle who was likely to know under what, if any, pressures she may have been; LaBelle\u2019s testimony \"may well have differed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>substantial degree from the testimony given by\u201d the associate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The associate was in a most difficult position. She was concerned that she might face grievance board action. The administrator\u2019s case depended on her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The associate\u2019s initial testimony regarding her discussions with LaBelle was incomplete as La-Belle and she subsequently acknowledged. LaBelle, who was not personally involved, could be expected to be more objective than the associate and fully straightforward in his testimony. His testimony would have cleared the air and resolved any doubt regarding expectations of leniency engendered by explicit or tacit understandings with the grievance administrator or LaBelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The confidence of the profession and of the public in the administration of grievance proceedings is not served by the refusal of the administrator\u2019s counsel to be sworn and testify fully regarding any circumstances which might affect the legitimacy of the evidence on which the administrator relies in asserting that a lawyer has not conducted himself in accordance with the standards of the profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The discipline imposed by the grievance board, three years suspension, manifestly was based on the findings of solicitation of victims\u2019 families set aside by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The reduced discipline, two years suspension, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>cannot, in light of the discipline imposed by other hearing panels and the grievance board, be justified on the findings that are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">\u2014In two cases lawyers were <em>reprimanded </em>for soliciting worker\u2019s compensation claims through runners.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\u2014In one case the lawyers offered a police officer compensation to refer arrested persons to them; paralleling the facts here, no referrals were made and there was no further communication between the lawyers and the officer. The lawyers were reprimanded.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">\u2014A <em>two-month suspension </em>was imposed where the lawyer pled nolo contendere to two of five counts charging solicitation of clients in traffic court; the other counts were dismissed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">\u2014The grievance board increased the 120-day suspension imposed by the hearing panel to a <em>one-year suspension </em>\"for solicitation of three personal injury claims where the evidence disclosed money was paid layman <em>[sic] </em>for referring clients to him\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The novel construction of the disciplinary rule aside, neither the union nor any other person joined Jaques\u2019 client in the class action. There is no evidence that the business agent or anyone acting at his suggestion solicited anyone to employ Jaques; Jaques obtained no client and no fees from the asserted request for clients. It is not claimed that he promised the business agent any compensation; the business agent was not a police officer or other public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The discipline is excessive and appears to be imposed on the evidence supportive of the findings of actual solicitation by or for Jaques of families of victims that have been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">We would reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b641-5\">Kavanagh, C.
