Prior to trial, defendant made a timely motion to quash the information and suppress evidence based on the claim that the police had no probable cause to arrest defendant. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and the Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for interlocutory appeal of this denial. Defendant appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals as of right. The Court of Appeals reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded for a new trial, finding that the seizure of heroin was unlawful because the police did not have probable cause to arrest defendant. 64 Mich App 138; 235 NW2d 85 (1975). We granted leave to appeal limited to the issue of whether the stop and arrest of defendant was unlawful, thereby rendering the evidence found at the scene of the arrest inadmissible. 396 Mich 812 (1976). We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Defendant was arrested for possession of narcotics at about 1 a.m. on February 28, 1971, by the Benton Township police, who were acting on an anonymous telephone tip. According to police testimony, the informant phoned the Benton Township Police Department at about 8:20 p.m. on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>27, 1971, and requested to speak with Captain Paul Farris. The caller was given a phone number at which Captain Farris could be reached. The informant called Captain Farris, insisted on remaining anonymous, and, according to Farris, told him that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\"Ulysses Walker left town a short time ago going to Detroit to pick up a load of dope, and that he would be driving either a bronze-colored Cadillac four-door with Indiana license plates or a black-over-yellow Oldsmobile four-door with Michigan plates, and that there would be two women in the car with him, and that they would be returning to Benton Harbor in approximately five hours and going to 668 Superior Street in the City of Benton Harbor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">After receiving the anonymous call, Captain Farris learned from the Benton Harbor Police Department that a Lucille Gayten lived at 668 Superior Street, and a LEIN report indicated that a 1969 Oldsmobile with 1970 Michigan plate GKV 275 was registered under the name of Ms. Gayten. Officers drove to 668 Superior Street and saw a bronze-colored Cadillac in the garage but not the Oldsmobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Captain Farris testified that after he received the anonymous tip he called Sergeant Lester at the police station, told him of the information he had received concerning defendant, and ordered him to determine which of the two cars were at the Superior Street address and then set up a surveillance to locate the other vehicle coming into Benton Harbor and to stop and make an arrest. At about 1 a.m., Sergeant Spencer and two other officers, who were waiting on the Main Street penetrator in an unmarked police car, spotted a black-over-yellow 1969 Oldsmobile with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>1970 Michigan license plate GKV 275 going west on the 1-94 business loop into Benton Harbor. As the police car approached the Oldsmobile, the Oldsmobile switched lanes and then made a left turn about 100 yards down the road. Sergeant Lester testified that at this point, the police thought that they had been spotted by the people in the Oldsmobile so they then turned on the siren and the red flashing lights. The driver of the Oldsmobile testified that the unmarked car did not sound a siren or flash its lights. The police stopped the Oldsmobile by forcing it over to the side of the road. When the three police officers got out of their car the Oldsmobile \"lurched\u201d forward another three feet before again stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Sergeant Spencer testified that he drew his gun, told the occupants of the Oldsmobile that they were under arrest, and ordered them all to get out of the car. Officers Spencer and Peters testified that as defendant hurriedly exited from the right rear door, he bent over low and made a quick underhanded \"throwing motion\u201d. Peters saw a \"white powdery substance flying through the wind\u201d and after approaching defendant, saw a strip of white powder on the ground near the right rear tire and patches of white powder on the right rear door of the Oldsmobile. The powder was removed from the road and the car and identified as heroin at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The decisive issue in this case is whether the police had probable cause to make a valid arrest, thereby rendering the heroin found at the scene of the arrest admissible into evidence against defendant. We hold that an anonymous tip may be the basis for probable cause to make an arrest if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>information in the tip is sufficiently corroborated by independent sources. Since we find that the police had probable cause to make a valid arrest of defendant, we need not address plaintiffs alternative theory that despite the fact that the police, with guns drawn, told the occupants of the stopped vehicle that they were all under arrest, the transaction constituted an investigatory stop, in accordance with <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 US 1; 88 S Ct 1868; 20 L Ed 2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The test for determining when probable cause may be established solely upon the basis of information from an informant or upon such information and corroborating facts has been developed in <em>Aguilar v Texas, </em>378 US 108; 84 S Ct 1509; 12 L Ed 2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v United States, </em>393 US 410; 89 S Ct 584; 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969). In <em>Aguilar, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that probable cause for a warrantless arrest is established if the informant\u2019s tip meets two requirements: (1) \"some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were\u201d must be disclosed, and (2) \"some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant * * * was 'credible\u2019 or his information 'reliable\u2019 \u201d must be shown. 378 US 108, 114. This two-prong test was further developed in <em>Spinelli, </em>where the affiant swore that his informant was reliable, but gave the magistrate no grounds to support his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In regard to the first prong of the test, the <em>Spinelli </em>Court said that \"[i]n the absence of a statement detailing the manner in which the information was gathered, it is especially important that the tip describe the accused\u2019s criminal activity in sufficient detail so that the magistrate may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation\u201d. 393 US 410, 416. The Court in <em>Spinelli </em>found the detail provided by the informant in <em>Draper v United States, </em>358 US 307; 79 S Ct 329; 3 L Ed 2d 327 (1959), a \"suitable benchmark\u201d. 393 US 410, 416. In <em>Draper, </em>the informant reported that the accused was selling narcotics and that he would return from Chicago by train on one of two days with narcotics. The informant also described Draper and his clothing and said that he would be carrying a tan zipper bag and that he habitually walked \"real fast\u201d. As the Court explained in <em>Spinelli, </em>\"[a] magistrate, when confronted with such detail, could reasonably infer that the informant had gained his information in a reliable way\u201d. 393 US 410, 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In the instant case, the anonymous informant indicated to Captain Farris that defendant had just driven to Detroit to pick up a \"load of dope\u201d and would return to Benton Harbor in approximately five hours. Further, the informant revealed that defendant would be riding in one of two automobiles, which he described in detail, and would be riding with two women. Finally, the caller said that defendant would be going to 668 Superior Street upon his return to Benton Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We believe that the tip received by Captain Farris described defendant\u2019s criminal venture in sufficient detail so that the police could reasonably infer that they were relying on \"something more substantial than a casual rumor\u201d or information based on \"an offhand remark heard at a neighborhood bar\u201d. <em>Spinelli, supra, </em>393 US 410, 416, 417. Indeed, the informant revealed where defendant was going, the illegal purpose of the trip, a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>scription of the two automobiles to which he had access, the approximate time of his return, the number of people with whom he would be traveling, and the address of his eventual destination. To be sure, the facts supplied by the anonymous informant in the instant case were substantially more numerous and detailed than those contained in the tip received in <em>Spinelli.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, we hold that, as in <em>Draper, </em>the informant\u2019s tip in the instant case contained sufficient self-verifying detail to warrant an inference that the informant obtained his information in a reliable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Defendant argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that the fact that the informant in <em>Draper </em>had supplied reliable information in the past precludes the drawing of an inference in the instant case that the detailed nature of the tip given to Captain Farris indicated that the information was gained in a reliable way. We find, however, that reliance on this distinguishing fact is misplaced, for the fact that an informant has given reliable information in the past is supportive of the conclusion that he is trustworthy, rather than the conclusion that the informant gained his information in a reliable way. Indeed, there was no evidence in <em>Draper </em>as to how the informant obtained his information, and this accounts for the importance which the Court attached to the detailed nature of the tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Upon satisfying the first prong of the <em>Aguilar </em>test, it is then necessary to turn to the second prong, concerning the credibility or reliability of the informant himself. One recognized method of establishing the trustworthiness of the informant is a disclosure that the informant provided infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>mation on past occasions which later proved to be correct upon investigation. <em>McCray v Illinois, </em>386 US 300; 87 S Ct 1056; 18 L Ed 2d 62 (1967). In the instant case, however, the informant was anonymous, and thus there was no prior experience upon which to base the informant\u2019s reliability. In <em>Spinelli, </em>the Court explained how the veracity of an informant may be established extrinsically when there is otherwise no basis upon which to establish the informant\u2019s veracity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\"If the tip is found inadequate under <em>Aguilar, </em>the other allegations which corroborate the information contained in the hearsay report should then be considered. At this stage as well, however, the standards enunciated in <em>Aguilar </em>must inform the magistrate\u2019s decision. He must ask: Can it fairly be said that the tip, even when certain parts of it have been corroborated by independent sources, is as trustworthy as a tip which would pass <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>tests without independent corroboration?\u201d 393 US 410, 415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In the instant case, independent police work corroborated several of the details provided by the anonymous informant. Through independent investigation the police learned that the Oldsmobile described by the informant was registered to a woman living at the specified address on Superior Street. Also, the police found that a bronze Cadillac meeting the description by the informant was in the driveway of that house, and thus focused their surveillance on the Oldsmobile. Further, the police spotted the Oldsmobile registered to the woman living on Superior Street heading west on the 1-94 business loop leading into Benton Harbor at approximately the time the informant stated that defendant would be returning from Detroit.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">When Captain Farris initially received the anonymous tip, he had no adequate basis to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that the information was not a complete fabrication. After several details of the tip were corroborated by independent police work, however, the police could reasonably conclude that this was an informant whose reliability had been clearly demonstrated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">\"Once again, <em>Draper </em>provides a relevant comparison. Independent police work in that case corroborated much more than one small detail that had been provided by the informant [in <em>Spinelli]. </em>* * * It was then apparent that the informant had not been fabricating his report out of whole cloth; since the report was of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way, it was perfectly clear that probable cause had been established.\u201d <em>Spinelli, supra, </em>393 US 410, 417-418.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In conclusion, we find that the informant\u2019s tip in this case, upon being corroborated by independent sources, was sufficient to provide the basis for probable cause to make an arrest. Therefore, we hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b666-8\">Williams, Coleman, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\"> Repealed by 1971 PA 196. <em>See </em>MCLA 335.341(4)(a); MSA 18.1070(41)(4)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\"> The tip received in <em>Spinelli </em>merely indicated that Spinelli was using two specified telephones and that these phones were being used in gambling operations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b666-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAD\"><em>(dissenting). </em>Ulysses Walker was convicted of possession of heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The issue is whether heroin found when he was arrested should be suppressed because the police did not have probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">The police acted on (i) information telephoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>by an anonymous informant that Walker had left town to pick up a \"load of dope\u201d and would be returning in a few hours, (ii) corroboration, as a result of investigation, of details, in themselves innocent, furnished by the informant concerning the means and time of the journey, and (iii) police suspicions that Walker was a dope dealer based on his conviction one year earlier for possession of marijuana and other unspecified information, admittedly insufficient to justify an arrest, that he was peddling narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The Court of Appeals, reversing the trial court, declared that \"the corroborative evidence offered here is essentially neutral and cannot be made to look suspicious by the informant\u2019s tip\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">This Court, pursuing Aguilar\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \"two-pronged\u201d analysis, concludes that the police were justified, on investigative corroboration of \"self-verifying\u201d details furnished by the anonymous informant, in concluding that he had obtained his information in a reliable manner, that he was reliable, and there was probable cause to believe his assertion that Walker was in possession of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We would affirm the Court of Appeals decision reversing Walker\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Where the informant is unknown, there is no information regarding his reliability. His reliability cannot reasonably be inferred on verification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>innocuous information there is no reason to believe the accused would conceal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Corroboration of innocent details tends to show that the informant is acquainted with the accused, but does not tend to show present criminal activity absent the \"track record\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the reliable informant who can tell the police when, without shooting in the dark, there is reason to proceed against the accused. Without a track record there is no way of knowing whether the anonymous tipster is acting on anything more substantial than personal animus<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or his suspicions \u2014 of less, certainly no greater, probity than a police officer\u2019s suspicions,</p>\n<p id=\"A2s\">Suspicion shared by more than one or any number of officers is not probable cause. Police suspicion bolstered by an anonymous informant\u2019s assertion not shown by some evidence of present criminal activity to be other than the product of suspicion has no greater dignity. Suspicion corroborated by suspicion is not probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The corroboration in the instant case of innocent details supplied by the anonymous informant and the unspecified suspicions that Walker dealt in narcotics did not establish the reliability of the anonymous tip that he would on this occasion be returning with a load of dope.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>circumstances known to the police \"of which they had reasonably trustworthy information\u201d were not \"sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing\u201d that Walker \"was committing an offense\u201d. <em>Beck v Ohio, </em>379 US 89, 91; 85 S Ct 223; 13 L Ed 2d 142 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">A person who refused to identify himself telephoned a Benton Township police officer and told him that Walker had \"left town a short time ago going to Detroit to pick up a load of dope\u201d and that he would be \"returning to Benton Harbor in approximately five hours\u201d and going to 668 Superior Street. \"He is driving either a bronze-colored four-door Cadillac with Indiana license plates or a black-over-yellow four-door Oldsmobile with Michigan plates.

A bronze-colored Cadillac was in the garage but not the Oldsmobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">About five hours after receipt of the tip officers watching for the Oldsmobile saw it going west on the 1-94 business loop leading into Benton Harbor. The officers pulled behind the Oldsmobile in their unmarked car. The Oldsmobile changed from the right to the left lane and made a left turn. The right rear window was partially open (it was February) but not in the process of being rolled down.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The officers turned on flashers and began sounding a siren and honking their horn. The Oldsmobile was forced off the road approximately 100 feet from the intersection. It lurched forward another three feet before finally coming to rest. Three officers, their weapons drawn, identified themselves as police officers and told the occupants they were under arrest. Three women and two men got out of the car, including Walker who made a throwing motion of a white powdery substance later determined to be heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The officer who received the anonymous tip and ordered the arresting officers to watch for and stop the Oldsmobile and arrest Walker was aware that he had been convicted one year earlier of possession of marijuana and that three months before his arrest, Walker had been under surveillance for peddling narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Draper,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Aguilar, <em>Spinelli,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Whiteley</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and Harris<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \"frame but do not entirely solve the problem here presented\u201d. <em>United States v Canieso, </em>470 F2d 1224, 1230 (CA 2, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\"><em>Draper </em>and <em>Whiteley </em>considered whether police officers had probable cause to <em>arrest. Aguilar, Spinelli </em>and <em>Harris </em>considered the sufficiency of a showing on affidavit to a magistrate of probable cause for a <em>search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>All the cases, except, it would appear, <em>Whiteley, </em>concern tips supplied by a confidential informant <em>known </em>to the police. In the instant case, the tip was supplied by an anonymous informant <em>unknown </em>to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">While the ultimate question in <em>Draper </em>and the instant case (where the defendants were arrested without a warrant), and in <em>Aguilar, Spinelli </em>and <em>Harris </em>(concerning search warrants) and in <em>Whiteley </em>(arrest on a defective warrant) is the sufficiency of the showing of probable cause,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the primary focus in the warrant cases was whether the magistrate had been furnished with adequate information so that he could make an independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Two-pronged analysis, developed in <em>Aguilar </em>and extended in <em>Spinelli </em>in the <em>confidential </em>informant situation, obliges police seeking a warrant to detail their knowledge of the informant, the underlying information he provided and any other facts and circumstances on which they rely so that the magistrate, independently of the officer\u2019s conclusory allegations, can assess whether the informant is reliable and whether he appears to have obtained his information in a reliable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Where, as here, the defendant is arrested without a warrant the inquiry does not concern the contents of an affidavit \u2014 there is none \u2014 but whether the officers themselves had information constituting probable cause for an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In <em>Aguilar </em>there was no occasion to discuss the adequacy of the probable cause showing because the affidavit so plainly was conclusory and defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>cient in every respect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Spinelli </em>the Court sought to refine <em>Aguilar </em>by elucidating the kind of information that did <em>not </em>and the kind of information that <em>might </em>provide a magistrate with a basis for finding that the informant was reliable and his information was obtained in a reliable manner and of probable cause but, having concluded that the showing was inadequate,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> could not decide what <em>would </em>constitute a sufficient showing of probable cause. Despite the length and care of the <em>Spinelli </em>analysis, all that it tells us is what is <em>not </em>an adequate showing of probable cause in a <em>con\u00f1dential </em>informant situation, not what <em>is </em>sufficient in an <em>anonymous </em>informant situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>In <em>Whiteley, </em>where a conclusory affidavit was declared insufficient, the Court concluded that the other information of which the arresting officers were aware did not establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"><em>Draper </em>and the lead opinion in <em>Harris </em>alone show what the Court regards as a sufficient showing of probable cause in the <em>con\u00f1dential </em>informant situation. They can only hint at the standards to be applied in the <em>anonymous </em>informant situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">This Court, relying principally on <em>Spinelli </em>and <em>Draper, </em>concludes that the requirements of two-pronged analysis have been satisfied because the tip \"contained sufficient self-verifying detail to warrant an inference that the informant obtained his information in a reliable manner\u201d and that \"[a]fter several details of the tip were corroborated by independent police work * * * the police could reasonably conclude that this was an informant whose reliability had been clearly demonstrated\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">This, however, is but one-pronged analysis. Saying that self-verifying detail has been corroborated is but another way of saying that detail deemed self-verifying has also been otherwise verified.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In <em>Draper </em>(arrest without a warrant) there was information <em>separate and apart </em>from the \"self-verifying\u201d detail regarding the informant\u2019s reliability. In <em>Draper, </em>as in <em>Harris,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the officers were satisfied, based on their dealings with the informant, that he was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The <em>(pre-Aguilar) Draper </em>Court concluded, without the intricacies of <em>Spinelli </em>analysis,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the officer had verified the details provided by his informant \u2014 whom he had \"always\u201d found to be accurate and reliable \u2014 he had reasonable grounds to believe the unverified \"critical fact\u201d that Draper was carrying narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Although <em>Spinelli </em>(which found the probable cause showing inadequate) in distinguishing <em>Draper </em>(which found it adequate) refers to the detailed report given by the <em>Draper </em>informant and the corroboration by the police of all the details except the allegation that Draper was carrying narcotics, <em>Draper </em>itself does not contain particularized analysis of the substantiality of the officer\u2019s belief that his informant was reliable or of the sufficiency of the detail to establish that the information he supplied had been compiled in a reliable way.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The <em>Draper </em>Court\u2019s emphasis on the informant\u2019s history of accuracy and reliability<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> negatives this Court\u2019s apparent conclusion, reached by applying Spinelli\u2019s confidential informant analysis in an anonymous informant case, that <em>Draper </em>would have been decided the same way if the tip had been anonymous. <em>Draper </em>does not hold that the police can arrest a person debarking from a train or plane when someone who knows him well enough to describe his dress, appearance, gait and movements (commonplace, readily verifiable details), telephones ahead his time and place of arrival and charges that he will be carrying contraband. \"To hold otherwise would result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>completely unacceptable and dangerous precedent. Any unverified and unverifiable tip would result in any passenger being detained and searched merely on a phone call giving a time, a flight and description accompanied by an accusation of criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Nor can an arrest be made merely because the report is more credible because the accused has been suspected by the police of engaging in the very criminal activity described by the anonymous tipster. Otherwise a person harboring malice or suspicions might harass anyone with a criminal record or suspected by the police who, on nothing more than a telephone call describing him and his anticipated movements, could be arrested.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Absent incriminating evidence that substantiates the suspicion or anonymous assertion that the accused is currently engaged in criminal activity he cannot be arrested for the apparent purpose of conducting a search for evidence of criminal activity as an \"incident\u201d of a \"lawful arrest\u201d. We have not yet, I hope, reached the point where there is year-round open season on ex-convicts and those whom the police suspect that can be hair-triggered by an anonymous telephone call and substantiation of innocuous details any acquaintance and many strangers could provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">A judgment that there is evidence of criminality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>may be reasonable where the informant, as in <em>Draper, </em>has always supplied accurate and reliable information of criminality or, as in <em>Harris,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>provides information against his penal interest. Absent such a record of reliability or other substantial reason to believe the assertions of present criminal activity, there is no thread of criminality elevating suspicion to probable cause unless further investigation or other information provides some evidence of present criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><em>Draper </em>cannot properly be invoked in this case where there is no evidence whatsoever of the accuracy and reliability of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The inherent unreliability of an anonymous informant distinguishes confidential informant cases like <em>Draper </em>from this case. The analysis appropriate to resolution of the question whether there was probable cause for an arrest in this case is to be found upon examination of other anonymous informant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In <em>Whiteley </em>a business establishment was broken into. The sheriff \"acting on a tip\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> signed a complaint charging the accused and another person with committing the offense. A bulletin was put out on the radio which described the two suspects and the automobile in which they probably would be riding. They were arrested the next day. Although their car matched the car described in the radio bulletin and the accused was known to the sheriff as a person who committed such offenses, the Court concluded that there was not sufficient information to justify an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The Court declared that while resort may be had to information gathered by the arresting officers where the information supplied by the informant is inadequate, \"the additional information acquired by the arresting officers must in some sense be corroborative of the informer\u2019s tip that the arrestees <em>committed the felony </em>or, as in <em>Draper </em>itself, were in the process of committing the felony\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Since \"the arresting officer was not himself possessed of any factual data tending to corroborate the informer\u2019s tip that Daley and Whiteley <em>committed the crime\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> he did not have probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The emphasis on corroboration of the asserted criminality finds expression and application in the decisions of Federal and state courts which have considered the question in the anonymous informant context.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In <em>Canieso </em>the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs obtained information from an informant that a Philippine diplomat would be carrying 20 kilograms of heroin in two blue plastic suitcases from southeast Asia to New York City and that he would be traveling with a Chinese national. Agents observed the two suspects, seated across an airplane aisle, travel halfway around the world exchanging glances but not recognition, and, after the diplomat had cleared his luggage at Kennedy Airport without customs inspection, on signal from the diplomat get into the same taxicab and travel to a Manhattan hotel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>despite ample corroboration of innocent details, that the tip failed to pass either prong of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>test. Stressing the culprits\u2019 studied avoidance of each other on the airplane and recognition after the suitcases had cleared customs the court declared that \"the <em>observation of acts as suspicious as those </em>in this case affords a basis for probable cause far more solid than a routine recitation meeting the tests of <em>Aguilar\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court said that where a tip, in itself insufficient, generates \"police investigation and this has developed significant corroboration or other <em>'jprobative indications of criminal activity </em>along the lines suggested by the informant\u2019 \u201d it \"may be used to give such additional color as is needed to elevate the information acquired by police observation above the floor required for probable cause\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit sustained a search where the police corroborated by surveillance that, as the informant had advised, the defendant was a black man with a wide-brimmed hat who drove a Pontiac Grand Prix and verified that his first name was Cleveland, and had observed at a distance two transactions between the defendant and other persons in a neighborhood where narcotics transactions occurred and saw him deposit something with a white cloth cover in the trunk of his car after they said they thought he had spotted them. This, in the view of the majority \"was a highly suspicious circumstance\u201d.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Judge McCree agreed with the analysis but took a different view of the facts. He observed in dissent that the officers were not in uniform and expressed his opinion that the transfer of the article to the trunk was neither a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>criminal act nor inherently suspicious. He agreed with the majority \"that an otherwise insufficient tip can be augmented to the point of affording probable cause by police observation which might verify the information provided by the tip. This verification may, in some cases, satisfy both requirements: that the information was obtained in a reliable way and that the informer was trustworthy. But when a tip is received from a completely <em>unknown </em>source, there must be some <em>independent veri\u00f1cation of the fact that criminal activity has occurred\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a tip from an apparently anonymous informant \"that a vehicle of a described make with an identified license number will be proceeding toward Los Angeles from El Centro at a certain time is <em>information that could be readily obtained by any bystander observing the vehicle on the road </em>from El Centro to Los Angeles or, as in <em>Spinelli, </em>that 'could easily have been obtained from an offhand remark heard at a neighborhood bar.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In holding a search invalid, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\"Nothing about the described features of the car or its direction <em>points to anything suspicious, let alone criminal. </em>That a vehicle matching the description was spotted along a highway from El Centro in the general direction of Los Angeles <em>corroborates nothing except, possibly, the ability of the informant accurately to relay what he has seen or what he has overheard. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The court contrasted the \"few innocuous details\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>with the details in another case which \"were themselves suspicious\u201d.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded that there was probable cause \"based upon the specific detailed information of the [anonymous] informant\u2019s reports, in addition to the agents\u2019 observations of the appellants\u2019 activities <em>indicating criminal conduct\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">In holding that officers did not have probable cause to arrest defendant on deplaning in Detroit, the United States District Court declared that <em>Draper </em>was \"clearly distinguishable\u201d because the informant in that case \"had, from past experience, proved to be reliable to the satisfaction of the police\u201d. Recognizing that a tip from an unknown informant may be corroborated by other information, the court declared that \"in every instance examined, the later information which corroborated the tip was substantial and was of a nature which might reasonably lead to the conclusion that an <em>illegal activity was ongoing\u201d.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Another judge of the same court declared that there was no probable cause where the officers had observed nothing that was \"inconsistent with com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>pletely innocent behavior. There was nothing to suggest that the defendant was engaged in any <em>criminal conduct\".</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in a case where the police received an anonymous tip that 15 minutes earlier Alfred L. \"Sonny\u201d Truitt, Jr., \"was enroute from Dallas to Greenville with approximately ten pounds of marihuana in his gold Firebird automobile,\u201d and officers dispatched to intercept the automobile observed a gold Firebird slow and leave the expressway and stopped it, distinguished <em>Draper </em>on the ground that \"the informant was <em>completely anonymous </em>and not shown to be credible. To allow the informant\u2019s brief conversation to constitute probable cause would be in effect allowing it to serve as the 'underlying circumstance\u2019 for determining his veracity\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Citing <em>Whiteley, </em>the court declared that \"the additional information acquired by the arresting officers must in some sense be corroborative of the informer\u2019s tip that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the arrestee committed the felony, or was in the process of committing the felony\u201d.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Colorado Supreme Court declared that there was no probable cause for an arrest where the police received a number of telephone calls from unknown informants regarding the activities of Loretta Ann and Bobby Joe Williams. One caller said that Loretta Ann was making trips to Texas to obtain heroin, the other related that she would be returning from Texas that evening and would be met by Bobby Joe. The officers had no prior communication with the informants and \"had had no independent corroboration that a crime was in fact being committed. Nevertheless, acting on this information, they proceeded to the airport and arrested [Loretta Ann] after she arrived at the airport and was met by [Bobby Joe].\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\"The information imparted by [the anonymous informants] lacked the detail which would clearly manifest its reliability. Finally, the corroborating facts gathered by the officers prior to arrest <em>con\u00f1rmed only innocent incidents of the tip, i.e., </em>that [Loretta Ann] was on a flight from El Paso and that Bobby Joe Williams was awaiting her arrival. The officers had no independent information that either [Loretta Ann] or Bobby Joe Williams was involved in <em>criminal activity </em>apart from these anonymous telephone calls.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Rhode Island police received an anonymous tip that \"a tall, white male hitchhiker, who was dressed in a khaki jacket, dungarees and a ski-type toque, had just alighted from [the informant\u2019s] automobile and could be found hitchhiking on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Tower Hill Road at the intersection of Routes 1 and 138. [The informant] further advised that he believed the described person possessed marijuana and possibly other drugs\u201d.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter the hitchhiker was arrested. The state claimed that the tip had been corroborated because \"a person who precisely fitted the tipster\u2019s description as to appearance, attire and activity had been seen at the time when and at the place where the informer had advised that such a person would be found\u201d.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In holding that there was no probable cause for an arrest the court distinguished <em>Draper, </em>saying that the informant in that case was \"a special employee of the Bureau of Narcotics who had previously furnished reliable information regarding narcotics violations; in this case it came from an unidentified source who had not established his reliability and who, although he expressed a 'belief that defendant possessed narcotics, did not furnish the police with any basis, support or underlying reason for that belief\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\"For aught they knew his reported 'belief was no more than a baseless suspicion or spiteful prank. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">\"In sum, what was relayed to the arresting officer concerning defendant\u2019s appearance and where he would be found, while accurate, was insufficient as a basis for an arrest unless accompanied by 'reasonably trustworthy information\u2019 placing him in <em>criminal circumstances, </em>and in that aspect the knowledge supplied the arresting officer was deficient.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Other state courts have declared that where the officer\u2019s information regarding the reliability of a confidential informant is inadequate, information obtained as a result of further investigation, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sertedly corroborative of the tip, is insufficient where it \"related only to innocent activity\u201d,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> or where the \"police observed nothing that could be described as furtive or suspicious in any of this conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">This Court has ruled that the police may not act on an anonymous tip. In <em>People v Charles D </em>Walker, 385 Mich 565; 189 NW2d 234 (1971), the police, in their unmarked automobile, cut in front of defendant\u2019s automobile after it left the expressway and entered Grand Rapids. The police jumped out with guns drawn, arrested the occupants and seized heroin. At the hearing, the officer was reluctant to give any information but did say that the police had received information about \"this Pontiac\u201d over the telephone and had information on the driver \"dating back some time\u201d. This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\"From both the Michigan and Federal cases, it is clear that while police officers may proceed upon the basis of information received from an informer and need not disclose the identity of the informer, in order to establish probable cause there must be a showing that the <em>information was something more than a mere suspicion, a tip, or anonymous telephone call, and that it came from a source upon which the officers had a right to rely.\u201dId, </em>p 575 (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Similarly, see <em>People v Guertins, </em>224 Mich 8, 10; 194 NW 561 (1923), declaring that \"an officer has not the right to arrest a person without a warrant and upon information which is given anonymously,\u201d and <em>People v Zeigler, </em>358 Mich 355, 360; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>100 NW2d 456 (1960): \"There was no other information, free from the infirmity of being anonymous * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Requiring probable cause assures that a citizen will not suffer unjustified intrusions upon his privacy. Simply stated, probable cause requires that there be good reason for an arrest. In the instant case the police acted on an anonymous tip setting forth innocent facts in support of an allegation of criminal activity. The tip did not reveal the basis of the informant\u2019s allegation and therefore we do not know whether his information was based on personal observation, a report of a person he believed to be reliable or mere rumor. Since the informant was anonymous there is no way of substantiating his personal reliability. The corroboration was weak; no criminal activity was observed, only part of the story related by the informant was verified.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The additional information in the possession of the police (defendant\u2019s marijuana conviction and the earlier surveillance for reasons unspecified and with a result not disclosed other than that there was no probable cause for arrest), did not substantiate the charge of current criminal activity. This amalgam of rumor, unsubstantiated allegation and unspecified suspicion does not rise to the level of probable cause. It operated in this case not as a reason for an arrest but as an excuse.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Clearly there was an arrest<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and just as clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the arrest was without probable cause.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The fruits of the arrest, the evidence that Walker was in possession of narcotics, should, accordingly, be suppressed.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>We would affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-6\">Kavanagh, C.
