He acted reasonably to protect the lives of his fellow officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">At approximately 9 p.m. on May 11, 1971, Detective Sergeants Edward Ewald and Lawrence Kelly of the Detroit police department received a radio message directing them to investigate a robbery and shooting at a Detroit bar. They arrived at the bar at approximately 9:15 p.m. There they were told that sometime between 8:30 p.m. and 8:50 p.m. two men armed with handguns had robbed the bar and killed the bartender. One of the handguns used in the crime had already been recovered. They were also told that one of the robbers had been wounded, captured and taken to Detroit General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">At approximately 11:30 p.m. Ewald and Kelly went to the hospital and spoke with the wounded robber. He told them that the other robber\u2019s name was Claude Crawl and that Crawl was the one who had shot the bartender. He gave them a rough description of Crawl and the address of an apartment in Highland Park where Crawl could be found. He also said a third man was involved in the robbery, but he did not name or describe the man or say where the man could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Ewald and Kelly left the hospital and radioed the Highland Park police department for assist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>anee. Soon a Highland Park scout car with three uniformed officers joined them and the group drove towards the Highland Park address where Crawl was said to be. They arrived at the address shortly after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The address was a two-story apartment building. The wounded robber had said Crawl would be in apartment 204. The Highland Park officers warned Ewald and Kelly that there had been trouble, including shootings, at this apartment building in the past. One Highland Park officer drove the scout car into an alley behind the building and remained with the car. Ewald, Kelly and the remaining Highland Park officers approached the building\u2019s front entrance. They pinpointed the location of apartment 204. Ewald positioned himself in an alcove from which he could observe the apartment\u2019s windows and the front of the building. Kelly and the two officers continued upstairs to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">When Kelly and the two officers reached the apartment, Kelly knocked on the door. One of the occupants of the apartment opened the door and admitted the three policemen into a small hallway. Straight ahead the hallway led to the living room and kitchen. Three steps from the door on the left side of the hallway was the entrance to a small bedroom. The occupants were scurrying all through the apartment. The three policemen ran through the apartment looking for Crawl and trying to bring the occupants under control.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Meanwhile, Ewald observed from his position downstairs a man climb out one of the apartment\u2019s windows and jump to the ground. Ewald shouted for the man to halt and identified himself as a police officer. The man walked a few steps and then halted. Ewald determined that the man was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Claude Crawl, placed him under arrest and ordered him back to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Approximately two minutes after Kelly and the two officers were admitted to the apartment, Ewald and Crawl appeared at the door. The door was open and Ewald directed Crawl, who was now handcuffed, inside. Ewald turned Crawl over to the control of one of the officers. Another man and two women were in the living room. They were milling or running around. There was much confusion. Kelly and the other officer were trying to persuade the occupants to sit down and stay still. At this point, Ewald looked in the bedroom. No one was there. Ewald then looked under or on the bed and saw a small black barber\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He opened the unlocked case and found a chrome plated handgun, live and spent shells, barber\u2019s tools and identification cards belonging to Crawl. Ewald did not look anywhere else in the bedroom. He seized the case and its contents, and took these items to police headquarters along with Crawl and the three occupants, who had been arrested on narcotics charges. Crawl was charged with first-degree murder after confessing to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Before trial, Crawl filed a motion to suppress the items seized at the apartment. After an evidentiary hearing, the motion was denied. The items were admitted into evidence against Crawl at his trial. Several witnesses identified the gun as looking like one of the guns used in the robbery. A ballistics expert testified that tests run on the gun and bullets found at the scene of the robbery showed that the gun was used in the robbery. Crawl testified that he was a barber. The identification cards found with the gun were Crawl\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Justice Levin contends that at the point Sergeant Ewald entered the bedroom there was no justification for seizing and opening the barber\u2019s case. He says that \"there was no danger that anyone in the apartment could grab the bag and * * * make use of any weapon contained in the bag\u201d. I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">When Sergeant Ewald captured Crawl outside the apartment, he was not thereby prohibited from returning to the apartment to assist his fellow officers. When he entered the apartment, about two minutes after the raid began, the situation was not under police control. An unidentified man and two women were milling or running around the living room of this small apartment. There was a great deal of confusion. The man could have been the third robber. The other handgun used in the crime was not accounted for. The officers had every reason to believe they were in a life-endangering situation. There had been trouble, including shootings, at this apartment building in the past. It was dark and late at night. They were looking for a murderer and an accomplice who might well be prepared to kill again.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Under these circumstances, I cannot say that Sergeant Ewald\u2019s cursory search was unreasonable or illegal. The lack of police control and the dangerousness of the situation justified his proceeding without first obtaining a search warrant. To have delayed would have needlessly endangered the lives of his fellow officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Justice Levin relies heavily upon <em>Chimel v California, </em>395 US 752; 89 S Ct 2034; 23 L Ed 2d 685 (1969), and <em>United States v Chadwick, </em>433 US 1; 97 S Ct 2476; 53 L Ed 2d 538 (1977), to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>conclusion that the search in this case was illegal. The limits on the scope of warrantless searches established by these cases do not come into play until arrests have been made and the police are in control of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In <em>Chimel, </em>three policemen were admitted to the defendant\u2019s home by the defendant\u2019s wife and waited for the defendant to return from work. When he arrived, the police arrested him for burglary of a coin shop. Then, accompanied by the defendant\u2019s wife, the police conducted a detailed 45-minute search of every room in the house. In <em>Chadwick, </em>federal officers seized a double-locked footlocker they suspected to contain marijuana. The footlocker was transported to a Federal police building where it was locked in an evidence storage room. A few hours later, at their convenience, the officers opened and searched the footlocker.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Neither <em>Chimel </em>nor <em>Chadwick </em>involved uncontrolled and potentially life-endangering situations like the situation in the case at bar. Also, the searches in those cases were much more intrusive than the quick, protective search undertaken here. Thus, I do not find either of these cases to be controlling or convincing precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The case at bar is much more like <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v Hayden, </em>387 US 294; 87 S Ct 1642; 18 L Ed 2d 782 (1967). There the police were told that an armed robber had just entered a certain address. The police went to the address, a two-story house, and knocked on the door. A woman answered the door and admitted the police. The police knew the robber was armed, but they did not know where in the house he was. They immediately fanned out through the house looking for the robber and for weapons. In the course of the next few minutes, one policeman found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>robber in an upstairs bedroom and arrested him. Ammunition for a handgun and a cap worn by the robber during the robbery were found underneath the mattress of the robber\u2019s bed and ammunition for a shotgun was found in a bureau drawer. A sawed-off shotgun and a handgun were found on the main floor inside a toilet flush tank and clothing worn by the robber during the robbery was found in the basement inside a washing machine. The United States Supreme Court upheld the search for and seizure of all these items, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">\"They [the police] acted reasonably when they entered the house and began to search for a man * * * and for weapons which he had used in the robbery or might use against them. <em>The Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others. Speed here was essential, </em>and only a thorough search of the house for persons and weapons could have insured that [the robber] was the only man present and that the police had control of all weapons which could be used against them or to effect an escape.\u201d <em>Warden v Hayden, supra, </em>298-299. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In the case at bar, although the police knew where Crawl was and had already arrested him, three other persons, one of whom could have been the third participant in the robbery and murder, were milling or running around the small apartment. The situation was not under control. The police had every reason to believe that their lives were in danger. Sergeant Ewald\u2019s cursory search, limited to the discovery and opening of the barber\u2019s case (a logical place to hide a small handgun), was a minor intrusion into the defendant\u2019s privacy necessary to insure that the police had control of the other handgun used in the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>so that it could not be used against them by one of the three persons not yet under police control or arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Justice Levin suggests that the police had other alternative courses of action that could have insured their safety just as well. Upon leisurely reflection, that may or may not seem true. However, we must remember that a police officer acting in a crisis situation does not enjoy the luxury of calm contemplation and collegial discussions before he or she must make on-the-scene decisions that may mean the difference between life and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Obviously, a line must be drawn somewhere. The sanctity of the home is an important value that must be protected. In drawing a line, however, other values must be weighed in the balance. The value of protecting police officers\u2019 lives and of bringing a dangerous felon to the bar of justice are two that come to mind. These values must be carefully weighed according to the circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Here, the search was quite limited in scope and it occurred contemporaneously with an ongoing situation potentially dangerous to the officers\u2019 lives. The officers did not know what they would be facing when they entered the apartment. Sergeant Ewald only looked in one very logical place, the barber\u2019s case laying on the bed, to find the missing handgun. The handgun and shells used in the crime were, in fact, in the case. He well could have judged that the security of all depended on finding and seizing the gun. In his place, I believe that my reaction would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Sergeant Ewald acted reasonably under exigent circumstances. I would not draw the line as finely or as narrowly as Justice Levin has done today. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Neither legal precedent nor moral values nor the need for a lesson to the police in self-restraint require a complete reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of this search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">None of the other issues raised by the defendant warrant a complete reversal and the granting of a new trial. However, because his case was held in abeyance for the decision in <em>People v Carter, supra, </em>on the procedural issue of whether instructions on second degree murder must be given in felony murder cases, and because he requested such instructions at trial, he should receive the benefit of the <em>Carter </em>decision. Therefore, I would remand to the trial court for resentencing on a conviction of second-degree murder, or, upon the motion of the prosecutor for a new trial on the original charge of first-degree murder.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-5\">Ryan, J., concurred with Coleman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-13\"> Justice Levin\u2019s opinion is dicta to the extent that it attempts to decide whether the holding in <em>People v Carter </em>is to be retroactively applied to cases preceding <em>Carter </em>that were not held in abeyance for the decision in that case. It should also be noted that none of the cases cited by Justice Levin in footnote 2 of his opinion discussed whether <em>Carter </em>should be retroactively applied to nonabeyance cases. All of the cited cases were decided by peremptory orders and there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>fore should not be interpreted as controlling precedents on the issue of <em>Carter\u2019s </em>retroactivity. The question of the extent of <em>Carter\u2019s </em>retro-activity is still open.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\"> Ewald originally said he saw the case \"under\u201d the bed, but thereafter consistently testified that he saw it lying on top of the bed when he looked in the bedroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b97-6\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIa\"><em>(concurring in part; dissenting in part). </em>I concur in the view that, under <em>People v Carter, </em>395 Mich 434; 236 NW2d 500 (1975), this case should be remanded to the trial court for entry of a judgment of conviction of second-degree murder and for resentencing accordingly, with the option in the prosecutor, if the ends of justice would be better served and upon notification of the trial court before resentencing, to have the judgment and conviction vacated and defendant retried for first-degree murder. (See the opinion of Levin, J., footnote 2.) I concur that the search of the bedroom and the seizure of the gun were not violative of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Although I find Justice Levin\u2019s analysis of the present law of search and seizure both complete and accurate, my analysis of the facts is different from his and closer to that of Justice Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Justice Levin states (at page 24 of his opinion) that:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\"While warrantless 'protective* searches may be justified when 'reasonably * * * necessary to prevent the dangers that [a] suspect at large in the house may resist or escape\u2019, <em>Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v Hayden, </em>387 US 294, 299; 87 S Ct 1642; 18 L Ed 2d 782 (1967), <em>once all persons occupying the residence are under supervision and control </em>and there is no reason to believe that anyone else is present, the rationale for a 'protective\u2019 search no longer obtains and a further search may not be conducted.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">As I understand the record, \"all persons occupying the residence\u201d were not \"under supervision and control\u201d when Sergeant Ewald found the gun, and he had reason to so believe. Sergeant Ewald testified that on entering the apartment \"I set Mr. Crawl down and one of the officers stayed with him and we looked around the rest of the apartment to see if there [were] any other people there\u201d. He testified that when he entered \"[t]hey were milling all over the place and the officers were trying to get them to sit down and stand still\u201d. Officer Kelly corroborated this, saying on admittance \"people started scurrying all over the apartment * * * they were scurrying in the bedrooms, kitchen and et cetera, and then Sergeant Ewald returned a minute or two after we had entered the apartment with * * * Claude Crawl in custody.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In short, under these circumstances of \"milling all over the place\u201d and the close proximity of the rooms, especially at night in search of murderers and in a building where \"they have had trouble * * * shootings, that sort of thing\u201d, I find that a \u201cprotective\u201d search was justified and reasonably necessary for self-protection and the safety of the other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">All other issues raised on appeal are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Conviction of first-degree murder reversed with remand for entry of a judgment of conviction of second-degree murder, reserving the option in the prosecutor to have the judgment and conviction vacated and to re-try defendant for first-degree murder.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-7\">Blair Moody, Jr., J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b99-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcR\">Claude Crawl was convicted of first-degree murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the killing of a bartender during a robbery of a Detroit bar. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 47 Mich App 749; 209 NW2d 809 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">We conclude that there was error in refusing to instruct on second-degree murder and in allowing introduction of evidence obtained during an impermissible search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">If the only error was a failure to instruct on second-degree murder, Crawl\u2019s conviction could be affirmed as second-degree murder with remand for resentencing unless the prosecutor opts for a new trial on first-degree murder. Since there is other error which affects the validity of a conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>second-degree murder, Crawl is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Evidence seized from a barber bag in an apartment was introduced at trial over objection. Assuming it was lawful, following Crawl\u2019s arrest outside the apartment, to conduct a \"protective\u201d search of the apartment, the warrantless search of the barber bag discovered in that search and the seizure of its contents were not within any of the narrowly circumscribed exceptions to the warrant requirement of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 11 and the Fourth Amendment. The arresting officer had determined that no one was in the bedroom who might destroy evidence or use a weapon that might be contained in the bag. The evidence seized (a revolver and shells) was not in plain view as the officer searched for a suspect in the bedroom. There were no circumstances, exigent or otherwise, justifying the warrantless search of the bag and the seizure of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In <em>People v Carter, </em>395 Mich 434, 437; 236 NW2d 500 (1975), this Court held \"that there are lesser included offenses to first-degree felony-murder. Second-degree murder is always a lesser included offense of first-degree murder\u201d. In the companion case of <em>People v Jenkins, </em>395 Mich 440, 442-443; 236 NW2d 503 (1975), this Court declared that: \"in every trial for first-degree murder, including felony murder, the trial court is required to instruct the jury <em>sua sponte, </em>and even over objection, on the lesser included offense of second-degree murder\u201d but added that \"[tjhis decision shall apply to this case and to all cases tried after January 1, 1976\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In a number of subsequent decisions, this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>pursuant to <em>Carter, </em>modified <em>pre-Carter, pre-Jenkins </em>convictions of first-degree felony-murder, where the issue was preserved at the trial level by objection or request to charge on second-degree murder, by reducing the degree of conviction from first- to second-degree murder and remanding for resentencing with an option in the prosecuting attorney, if he is \"persuaded that the ends of justice would better be served, upon notification to the trial court before resentencing\u201d, to have the judgment and conviction vacated and a new trial for first-degree murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In this case, the judge refused defense counsel\u2019s \"request that your Honor charge second-degree murder\u201d. The judge\u2019s ruling was erroneous. <em>People v Carter, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Two men<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> robbed a Detroit bar at approximately 8:30 p.m. on May 11, 1971. The bartender was fatally shot when he offered resistance. Howard Wilson, one of the robbers, was wounded in the shootout and taken to a hospital. He informed the police, about 45 minutes after the robbery, that Crawl and another man participated in the robbery and that Crawl could be found at his cousin\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The police arrived at the apartment building shortly after midnight. Officer Edward Ewald re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>mained outside the building while Officer Larry Kelly and two or three other officers entered the building and proceeded to the apartment. Ewald, standing outside, saw Crawl flee through a window and arrested him after he descended.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Ewald took Crawl into the building and up to the apartment, assertedly because Ewald was still looking for a third suspect; according to Ewald, \"[i]t was an assumption that he could be there, too\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As Ewald was arresting Crawl, Kelly and the other officers went to the apartment, \"knocked on the door and we were admitted\u201d. The two women and one man who were present \"started running around the apartment at that time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">When Ewald and Crawl entered the apartment, the three other occupants were still \"milling all over the place and the officers were trying to get them to sit down and stand still\u201d, but all three were \"[i]n the living room at the time\u201d. Crawl was handcuffed and turned over to another officer. Ewald entered a bedroom located about three steps from the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Conceding that Crawl and the three other persons were in the living room when Ewald entered the bedroom, the people argue that Ewald was justified in entering the bedroom because Wilson had told the officers that he and two other persons had been involved in the robbery and a search was necessary to determine whether the third robber was in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Ewald testified on direct examination that he walked into the bedroom and found a barber bag or small brief case <em>under </em>the bed; on cross-examination he testified that the bag was <em>on </em>the bed. Ewald opened the bag and found and seized evidence, including a revolver and spent shells, tend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ing to connect Crawl with the robbery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Crawl and the three other persons, who were arrested on narcotics charges, were then taken to police headquarters for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We would hold that Ewald was not justified in searching the barber bag and that the evidence seized was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\"The primacy of the warrant requirement is well established.\u201d <em>People v </em>Tyler, 399 Mich 564, 571; 250 NW2d 467 (1977); <em>United States v Chadwick, </em>433 US 1; 97 S Ct 2476; 53 L Ed 2d 538 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> [T]he most basic constitutional rule in this area is that 'searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 The exceptions are 'jealously and carefully drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coolidge v New Hampshire, </em>403 US 443, 454-455; 91 S Ct 2022; 29 L Ed 2d 564 (1971).

At the time of their arrest, no arrestee was in the bedroom and, therefore, the search was not in \"the area from within which [the arrestee] might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d \"The search here went far beyond the petitioner\u2019s person and the area from within which he might have obtained either a weapon or something that could have been used as evidence against him. There was no constitutional justification, in the absence of a search warrant, for extending the search beyond that area.\u201d <em>Chimel v California, </em>395 US 752, 763, 768; 89 S Ct 2034; 23 L Ed 2d 685 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">An arrest in a residence does not justify a general search of the residence.

The Court held that, although the warrantless entry of the apartment and seizure of a shotgun in plain view in a room full of people were lawful, the search of the dresser drawer and suitcase was unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\"The thorough search of the room, and the seizure therein of a pistol from a dresser drawer and of drugs and drug paraphernalia from a suitcase in a closet, after all persons had been cleared from the room, was impermissible (cf. <em>People v Floyd, </em>26 NY2d 558, 563; 312 NYS2d 193, 195-196; 260 NE2d 815, 817 [1970]). There was no reason to fear an assault by a person with a weapon within reach, i.e., in the dresser, since there was no one in the room. Even though the officer could legally look into the closet to assure himself that no one who might harm him was hiding there, he had no right to open and examine the suitcase he found therein. Any weapons which might have been contained in the suitcase were certainly out of reach of the persons in the next room.\u201d <em>People v Thompson, </em>50 App Div 2d 874, 875; 377 NYS2d 149, 151-152 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The warrant requirement embodies the fundamental precept that a search must be preceded by a neutral and objective determination of probable cause and of the proper scope of the search, \"[Bypassing a neutral predetermination of the <em>scope of </em>a search leaves individuals secure from Fourth Amendment violations 'only in the discretion of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347, 358-359; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967) (emphasis by the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The exceptions to the warrant requirement are narrowly circumscribed and are available only where exigent circumstances <em>(e.g., </em>the need to protect arresting officers, the likelihood of destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion of evidence or of escape) require immediate action, precluding a neutral determination of probable cause or of the scope of the search; \"[t]here being no exigency, it was unreasonable for the Government to conduct this search without the safeguards a judicial warrant provides\u201d. <em>United States v Chadwick, supra, </em>p 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Having determined that no one was in the the bedroom who might destroy evidence or endanger the safety of the officers, the officers had no justification for opening the bag and seizing its contents. If upon sight of the bag there was reason to believe it contained evidence, the officers, after taking Crawl and the others into custody, should have sought a warrant to conduct a search. They could have done so without fear for their safety, or that anyone in the apartment would destroy evidence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\"We are not dealing with formalities. The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals. * * * And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the police before they violate the privacy of the home.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald v United States, </em>335 US 451, 455-456; 69 S Ct 191; 93 L Ed 153 (1948).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The evidence seized was inadmissible.

Crawl\u2019s application for leave to appeal to this Court raised this question but the people\u2019s answer did not respond on search and seizure and did not direct our attention to the failure of Crawl\u2019s appellate counsel to raise the question in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Ordinarily we will not consider an issue that has not been preserved at the trial level and presented to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Requiring preservation of error at the trial level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>provides the trial judge an opportunity to rule correctly and to avoid unnecessary retrials, and also provides a record for appellate review. In this case, the search and seizure issue was preserved before and at the trial, an evidentiary record was developed and the trial court had an opportunity to suppress the evidence. The need for a new trial is not attributable to Crawl\u2019s failure to raise the issue, but, rather, to the people\u2019s proffer of inadmissible evidence and incorrect rulings by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The rule requiring that appellate issues first be presented to the Court of Appeals seeks to lighten this Court\u2019s burden of decision by disposing of issues at the intermediate appellate level and by providing this Court with the benefit of the analysis and judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The failure of Crawl\u2019s appellate counsel to raise the search and seizure issue on appeal was a serious mistake. Appellate courts have considered claims based on the introduction of illegally seized evidence even where the issue was not preserved at the trial level where it appears there may be a different result at a new trial at which the evidence is not introduced.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>For the same reasons that the failure of the trial judge to suppress this evidence was not harmless error,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it cannot be said that a new trial should not be granted because Crawl would inevitably be convicted of first-degree murder at a trial in which the evidence is suppressed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It would be disproportionate to regard the failure to raise this issue in the Court of Appeals as a waiver, and not to treat as a waiver of that failure the prosecutor\u2019s failure to call our attention to it. The . rule requiring presentation of appellate issues first to the Court of Appeals is of no greater dignity than the constitutional prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. If an accused person\u2019s right to protection against impermissible searches and seizures can be waived by the carelessness or ineptitude of counsel, then, by like principle, the rule requiring that appellate issues be presented first to the Court of Appeals can be waived by the prosecutor\u2019s failure timely to call our attention to noncompliance with this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Compliance with the rule requiring presentation of appellate issues first to the Court of Appeals is of great importance to this Court. Accordingly, we could remand the cause to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the search and seizure issue. Under the circumstances that we granted leave to appeal on all issues raised in the application for leave to appeal and, accordingly, should consider such issues, and that the search and seizure issue has been fully briefed, argued and considered at conference, we have chosen to consider and decide that pervasive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Crawl also contends it was error to permit the prosecutor to show that Howard Wilson, an important witness for the prosecution, had admitted his participation in the robbery-killing by pleading guilty to murdering the bartender, and had been sentenced.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">As a long-established rule of the common law, an accomplice\u2019s plea of guilty<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or conviction following a trial<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is not admissible against another person.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>On cross-examination, Wilson was asked about his statements to the police shortly after the robbery; the purport of the questioning was that Wilson made the statements in the hope of obtaining leniency. On redirect, Wilson was asked whether he had pled guilty and been sentenced; the people contend that these questions were responsive to the cross-examination and were asked to rebut the intimation that Wilson\u2019s testimony was motivated by self-interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">While the cross-examination was limited to the time sequence shortly after the robbery, the tendency of the questions was not simply that Wilson had a personal motive for assisting the police but also that he had a personal motive for testifying against Crawl.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In these circumstances, the prosecutor was entitled to attempt to rebut the implication that Wilson\u2019s testimony was motivated by self-interest with evidence showing the nature of the concessions made to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Such disclosure should, however, be full and complete to avoid misleading the jury.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The disclosure here was far from adequate.

Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">While Wilson had pled guilty \"in this matter\u201d and had been sentenced, he was allowed to plead guilty to a less serious offense than Crawl was then on trial for. Wilson had received a relatively light sentence in comparison to the sentence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Crawl faced on conviction of first-degree murder. Wilson, who admitted his participation in the robbery-killing, and, accordingly, faced conviction of first-degree murder and a mandatory sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole, was permitted to plead guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to serve a term of 5 to 15 years, which made him eligible for parole in approximately 3-1/2 years. Wilson was paroled in 1974, about 3 years after the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The implication of the redirect questioning, that Wilson had not benefited and would not benefit from his testimony and had no personal motivation to testify falsely, was misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">While Wilson had been sentenced, he was still subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board and whether he served a minimum or greater sentence depended in part on whether the authorities were of the opinion that he had been \"rehabilitated\u201d. A person in his position might reasonably conclude that his chances of an early parole were greater if he continued to cooperate with the authorities by testifying against Crawl.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">While the prosecutor was entitled to inform the jury of Wilson\u2019s true status, the jury should have been fully and accurately informed<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> of all the pertinent facts and circumstances so that it could properly assess whether his testimony may have been motivated by self-interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Crawl also contends that a confession introduced at the trial was involuntary because it was induced by a beating, promises of leniency and threats, including a threat to use ballistics tests on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the revolver seized from the barber bag to implicate him in the robbery-killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Following a <em>Walker </em>hearing held after the trial had begun, and after it had been decided that the evidence obtained from the barber bag had not been unlawfully seized, the judge ruled that the confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Crawl\u2019s testimony that the police threatened to use the gun to tie him to the robbery was uncontradicted.

The issue, however; is not whether there was probable cause but whether the police were required to submit the evidence of probable cause to a magistrate for his independent determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\"It is apparent that the agents in this case acted with restraint. Yet the inescapable fact is that this restraint was imposed by the agents themselves, not by a judicial oificer. They were not required, before commencing the search, to present their estimate of probable cause for detached scrutiny by a neutral magistrate. They were not compelled, during the conduct of the search itself, to observe precise limits established in advance by a specific court order. Nor were they directed, after the search had been completed, to notify the authorizing magistrate in detail of all that had been seized. In the absence of such safeguards, this Court has never sustained a search upon the sole ground that officers reasonably expected to find evidence of a particular crime and voluntarily confined their activities to the least intrusive means consistent with that end. Searches conducted without warrants have been held unlawful 'notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause,\u2019 <em>Agnello v United States, 269 US 20, 30 </em>[46 S Ct 4; 70 L Ed 145; 51 ALR 409 (1925)], for the Constitution requires 'that the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer * * * be interposed between the citizen and the police * * * .\u2019 <em>Wong Sun v United States, </em>371 US 471, 481-482 [83 S Ct 407; 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963)]. Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth] Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes,\u2019 <em>United States v Jeffers, </em>342 US 48, 51 [72 S Ct 93; 96 L Ed 59 (1951)], and that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz v United States, </em>389 US 347, 356-357; 88 S Ct 507; 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\"> The Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\"It is true that, like the footlocker in issue here, automobiles are 'effects\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, and searches and seizures of automobiles are therefore subject to the constitutional standard of reasonableness. But this Court has recognized significant differences between motor vehicles and other property which permit warrantless searches of automobiles in circumstances in which warrantless searches would not be reasonable in other contexts. <em>Carroll v United States, </em>267 US 132 [45 S Ct 280; 69 L Ed 543; 39 ALR 790] (1925) [first recognizing the 'automobile exception\u2019 to the warrant requirement]; <em>Preston v United States </em>[376 US 364], at 366-367 [84 S Ct 881; 11 L Ed 2d 777] (1964); <em>Chambers v Maroney, </em>399 US 42 [90 S Ct 1975; 26 L Ed 2d 419] (1970).

Identification testimony is often unreliable. <em>See People v Anderson, </em>389 Mich 155; 172-180, 205 NW2d 461 (1973).
