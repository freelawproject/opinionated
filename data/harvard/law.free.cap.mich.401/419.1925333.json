It provides that a claim for review filed by a self-insured employer or a carrier from a worker\u2019s compensation award entered by a hearing referee shall <em>not </em>operate as a stay of payment to the claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The statute also provides, in its disputed part, that if the weekly benefit is reduced or rescinded by a final determination upon appeal, the self-insured employer or carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund for compensation paid during the appellate process in excess of the amount finally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The appellant employers, insurance carriers and self-insurers contend that the foregoing legislative enactment is unconstitutional. They maintain, <em>inter alia, </em>that the instant statute violates (a) various due process guarantees, both procedural and substantive, as articulated in both the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution of 1963; (b) traditional equal protection guarantees as set forth in both Constitutions, and (c) certain proscriptions against the impairment of contracts as found in both Constitutions. Lastly (d) the appellants maintain the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board exceeds the scope of its authority when it dismisses appeals for noncompliance with the 70% statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">We have examined all of appellants\u2019 contentions in the light of the broad philosophical tenets underpinning Michigan\u2019s Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act; we have scrutinized both the specific language of the 70% statute and the legislative intent underlying the act; and we have looked to established legal precedent in both our jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tion and others in examining the appellants\u2019 legal and constitutional positions. We conclude that 1975 PA 34, the \"70% statute\u201d, is constitutional on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision which held the instant statute constitutional and found that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board does not exceed its authority by dismissing the appeals of appellants who do not comply with the statute\u2019s mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">There is no dispute as to the \"facts\u201d in the instant case. Therefore, we adopt the Court of Appeals statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\"This case consists of several consolidated appeals from orders of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (hereinafter Appeal Board) dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeals from decisions of hearing referees for failure to comply with 1975 PA 34; MCLA 418.862; MSA 17.237(862). The appeals are by leave granted and challenge the constitutionality of that statute and the Appeal Board\u2019s authority to enforce the statute by dismissing appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\"The factual setting for this appeal is illustrated by the history of <em>Turner v General Motors. </em>Turner was awarded weekly benefits by a workmen\u2019s compensation hearing referee. Defendant filed an application for review with the Appeal Board. Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to dismiss for defendant\u2019s failure to comply with 1975 PA 34. Defendant objected to the motion, asserting that the act was unconstitutional. The Appeal Board notified defendant that failure to comply with the act might result in dismissal of its appeal. Defendant failed to comply with the act, and the Appeal Board dismissed defendant\u2019s appeal. The instant appeal followed.\u201d <em>Turner v General Motors Corp, </em>70 Mich App 532, 535; 246 NW2d 631 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>As the Court of Appeals implies, the factual sequences in <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co </em>and <em>Stricklin v American Chain &amp; Cable Co, </em>the consolidated cases, are identical to the <em>Turner v General Motors </em>sequence. Furthermore, the legal arguments presented by the defendant-appellant employers and insurance carriers as to the constitutionality of 1975 PA 34 are virtually identical in all these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">This Court granted leave in the <em>Turner et al </em>cases on October 13, 1976, and consolidated them with <em>Michigan Self-Insurers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>70 Mich App 565, 566-567; 246 NW2d 316 (1976). The legal issues in <em>Self-Insurers </em>are identical with those in <em>Turner et al. </em>The Court of Appeals pointed out this fact in its brief opinion in <em>Self-Insurers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\"Defendants [Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation] appeal as of right from the December 8, 1975, order of the Ingham County Circuit Court granting a summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff [Michigan Self-Insurers\u2019 Association] and declaring unconstitutional 1975 PA 34; MCLA 418.862; MSA 17.237(862), and permanently enjoining enforcement of the act by the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\"This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Turner v General Motors, </em>70 Mich App 532; 246 NW2d 631 (1976), answers the meritorious issues raised by the parties to this appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\"[T]he act is not invalid under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the injunction is hereby dissolved. No costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Therefore, the Michigan Self-Insurers\u2019 Association joins the various employers and carriers as the appellants herein. Turner, McAvoy, Stricklin and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Bureau <em>et al </em>are the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>II. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">This Court perceives the principal issue in this case to be whether 1975 PA 34, MCLA 418.862; MSA 17.237(862) provides for a taking of property from self-insured employers or carriers without procedural or substantive due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">1975 PA 34 provides for the following legislative schema:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\"A claim for review filed pursuant to sections 859 or 861 shall not operate as a stay of payment to the claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit required by the terms of the hearing referee\u2019s award. Payment shall commence as of the date of the hearing referee\u2019s award and shall continue until final determination of the appeal or for a shorter period if specified in the award. Benefits accruing prior to the referee\u2019s award shall be withheld until final determination of the appeal. If the weekly benefit is reduced or rescinded by a final determination, the carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement in a sum equal to the compensation paid pending the appeal in excess of the amount finally determined. Reimbursement shall be paid upon audit and proper voucher from the second injury fund established in chapter 5. If the award is affirmed by a final determination, the carrier shall pay all compensation which has become due under the provisions of the award, less any compensation already paid. Interest shall not be paid on amounts paid pending final determination. Payments made to the claimant during the appeal period shall be considered as accrued compensation for purposes of determining attorneys\u2019 fees under the rules of the bureau.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Appellants maintain that this statute denies them procedural due process<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that it requires payment of 70% of the hearing referee\u2019s award pending appeal \u2014 without the traditional stay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>payment during the appellate process. Appellants further contend that this \"70%\u201d provision effectively denies them their right to appeal as guaranteed by Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellants also maintain that the 70% statute denies them substantive due process in that any reimbursement which they receive after a hearing referee\u2019s award is reversed must come from the Second Injury Fund, a fund which the appellants themselves are required to keep solvent. Appellants contend that this reimbursement procedure constitutes a confiscatory taking of property and thus renders the statute unconstitutional. We will examine these two due process issues separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>A. Procedural Due Process: Stays</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\"A claim for review filed pursuant to sections 859 or 861 shall not operate as a stay of payment to the claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit required by the terms of the hearing referee\u2019s award. Payment shall commence as of the date of the hearing referee\u2019s award and shall continue until final determination of the appeal or for a shorter period if specified in the award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The threshold question for this Court is whether the foregoing language of the 70% statute violates procedural due process in that it does not provide for an automatic stay of a hearing referee\u2019s award to a claimant pending an appeal by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The test by which courts decide whether a particular legislative enactment comports with due process has been stated and restated <em>ad in\u00f1nitum. </em>We prefer the traditional statement found in <em>Nebbia v New </em>York, 291 US 502, 525; 54 S Ct 505; 78 L Ed 940 (1934):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\"The Fifth Amendment, in the field of federal activ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ity, and the Fourteenth, as respects state action, do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare. They merely condition the exertion of the admitted power, by securing that the end shall be accomplished by methods consistent with due process. And the guaranty of due process, as has often been held, demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. It results that a regulation valid for one sort of business, or in given circumstances, may be invalid for another sort, or for the same business under other circumstances, because the reasonableness of each regulation depends upon the relevant facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">See also <em>Grubaugh v City of St Johns, </em>384 Mich 165; 180 NW2d 778 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In determining, then, whether the 70% statute is \"unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious\u201d, and whether the means selected bear \"a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained\u201d, we must look to (1) the overall objective of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act and (2) the specific objective of the 70% provision itself, and how that objective is implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Professor Larson, in his classic treatise on worker\u2019s compensation law, succinctly stated the social philosophy underlying any worker\u2019s compensation system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\"The ultimate social philosophy behind compensation liability is belief in the wisdom of providing, in the most efficient, most dignified, and most certain form, financial and medical benefits for the victims of work-connected injuries which an enlightened community would feel obliged to provide in any case in some less satisfactory form, and of allocating the burden of these payments to the most appropriate source of payment, the consumer of the product.\u201d 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 2.20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Any worker\u2019s compensation schema has, therefore, as its primary goal the delivery of sustaining benefits to a disabled employee as soon as possible after an injury occurs, regardless of any traditional tort concepts of liability. The objective of the social legislation is to provide the disabled worker with benefits <em>during </em>the period of his disability so that the worker and his dependents may survive (literally) the catastrophe which the temporary cessation of necessary income occasions. The inherent rationality of worker\u2019s compensation legislation has stood unchallenged for decades. Its real and substantial relation to a valid legislative objective has successfully withstood due process challenges and is firmly established as a bellwether of Twentieth Century social legislation. See, for example, <em>New York C R Co v White, </em>243 US 188; 37 S Ct 247; 61 L Ed 667 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Historically, however, a profound injustice has plagued this piece of social legislation in Michigan, as well as in other states. Due to both the increasing number and sophistication of appeals by employers and carriers of worker\u2019s compensation awards, workers who have been awarded benefits and are indeed ultimately found entitled to such benefits because of legitimate disabilities, must often wait years to begin receiving compensation while the appellate process slowly grinds to a final conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In the interim, workers and their families are denied the benefits which were intended under the initial philosophy of worker\u2019s compensation to sustain them through this period of disability. The appellate process hamstrings the delivery of immediate benefits and contributes to the very social ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>which worker\u2019s compensation acts sought to remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">It is from this perspective that we must examine the advent of the 70% statute. 1975 PA 34 represents an attempt by the Legislature to instill new vitality into the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. The Legislature evidently realized that the ultimate goal of the worker\u2019s compensation schema was being thwarted by an appellate process which was merely a traditional carry-over from existing tort concepts of liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Workers were not receiving the benefits awarded by the referees and were often subject to being whipsawed into settlements for lesser benefits in order to avoid the lengthy appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The Rhode Island Supreme Court recognized these very same abuses in commenting upon the enactment by its Legislature of a similar \"no-stay\u201d provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\"The injured worker was confronted with an even more acute problem when the employer appealed. He did not receive his compensation promptly. At a time when he was unable to work and usually in need of medical attention with no income to support himself and his family, he was faced with what appeared to be a seemingly endless and costly litigation. As a result, either claims were abandoned or the injured worker was harassed into accepting an inadequate lump-sum settlement. It was obvious that the Legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 28-35-33, intended to eliminate the evils connected with the then existing law by providing that an injured worker who has successfully prosecuted his petition would be promptly compensated * * * .\u201d <em>Mer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>chants Mutual Ins Co v Newport Hospital, </em>108 RI 86, 91; 272 A2d 329, 331 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Accord <em>Employers\u2019 Mutual Ins Co v Industrial Commission, </em>65 Colo 283; 176 P 314 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The Michigan Legislature remedied this social ill by providing that \"[a] claim for review * * * shall not operate as a stay of payment to the claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit required by the terms of the hearing referee\u2019s award\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">It is <em>not </em>this Court\u2019s role to decide whether the Legislature acted wisely or unwisely in enacting this statute. We will not substitute our own social and economic beliefs for those of the Legislature, which is elected by the people to pass laws. <em>Ferguson v Skrupa, </em>372 US 726; 83 S Ct 1028; 10 L Ed 2d 93 (1963). We are only concerned that the enacted law shall not be \"unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In the case at bar, the Legislature decided not to stay, pending appeal, 70% of the weekly benefits due a claimant, after a hearing referee\u2019s award. We do not find that this legislative enactment violates procedural due process. The employers and carriers receive a fair, impartial and full initial determination before an administrative judge (hearing referee); this they do not deny. Their right to appeal that award remains intact. The worker/claimant does not receive the entire award; only that percentage of the award which statistically reflects the ratio of ultimate affirmances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given the general social philosophy under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>lying the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act and the abuses which have arisen under the traditional 100%-stay-pending-appeal system, we cannot agree that the 70% statute impinges upon any of the appellants\u2019 traditional due process rights. Due process does not necessarily guarantee appellant employers and carriers a right to a complete stay of benefits while an award, which was entered with full due process accorded, is appealed to a higher tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In fact, this Court recognizes that it is arguable that the staying of <em>all </em>benefits awarded, pending appeal, could conceivably constitute a denial of <em>claimants\u2019 </em>due process rights. In <em>California Dep\u2019t of Human Resources Development v Java, </em>402 US 121, 134; 91 S Ct 1347; 28 L Ed 2d 666 (1971), the United States Supreme Court alludes to the same problem.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While <em>Java </em>admittedly arose out of different factual context and dealt with the complex interplay of Federal-state guidelines regarding the prompt payment of unemployment benefits, the underlying policy issue is the same one at issue here. The Court required the payment of substitute wage benefits to a claimant without a stay pending appeal when a claimant has been awarded those benefits after a full initial hearing. The Supreme Court reasoned thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\"It would frustrate one of the Act\u2019s basic purposes\u2014 providing a 'substitute\u2019 for wages \u2014 to permit an employer to ignore the initial interview or fail to assert and document a claimed defense, and then effectuate cessation of payments by asserting a defense to the claim by way of appeal. If the employer fails to present any evidence, he has in effect defaulted, and neither he nor the State can with justification complain if, on a <em>prima facie </em>showing, benefits are allowed. <em>If the employer's defenses are not accepted and the claim is </em>allowed, <em>that also constitutes a determination that the bene\u00f1ts are \u2019due. \u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The \"no-stay\u201d provision of 1975 PA 34 not only comports with procedural due process guarantees as regards employers and carriers, but it also extends a quantum of due process to disabled employees who have been awarded benefits but are denied them by a strangulating appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Appellants further contend that the \"no-stay\u201d provision of 1975 PA 34 (a) effectively denies their right to judicial review of administrative decisions as guaranteed by the Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, and (b) allows for the payment of 70% benefits even after an appellate tribunal has reversed the hearing referee. Both contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Appellants are correct in their assertion that Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, guarantees judicial review of administrative decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\"All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This review shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings, rulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, whether the same are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record. Findings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">However, we find nothing in the 70% statute or the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act as a whole which violates this constitutional mandate. The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act <em>does </em>provide for a review of the decisions made by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Bureau:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">\"If a claim for review is filed, the board shall promptly review the order, together with the records of the hearing; it may hear the parties, together with such additional evidence as it in its discretion may allow them to submit and shall file its order with the records of the proceedings. The review and hearing may be held at its offices in Lansing, or elsewhere, as the board deems advisable. Where the employer or carrier files a claim for review to the board or appeals to the court of appeals or supreme court, a copy of the testimony, depositions and other documents necessary for the appeal shall be furnished by the employer or carrier to the employee or his attorney.\u201d MCLA 418.859; MSA 17.237(859).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\"The findings of fact made by the board acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. The court of appeals and the supreme court shall have power to review questions of law involved in any final order of the board, if application is made by the aggrieved party within 30 days after such order by any method permissible under the rules of the courts of the laws of this state.\u201d MCLA 418.861; MSA 17.237(861).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The constitutional provision cited was concerned with (1) providing for judicial review of rulings by administrative agencies, and (2) establishing a standard of review for the findings of fact made by administrative agencies. Nowhere in this constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tional stricture is it stated or implied that this right to review includes an automatic stay of the initial award made by the hearing referee (administrative judge). It would be inaccurate to contend that art 6, \u00a7 28, guarantees an unencumbered, <em>de novo </em>right to appeal. The very wording of the provision states otherwise. Article 6, \u00a7 28, specially provides that such rulings \"shall be subject to direct review by the courts <em>as provided by law\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The phrase \"as provided by law\u201d clearly vests the Legislature with the authority to exert substantial control over the mechanics of how administrative decisions are to be appealed. <em>Viculin v Dept of Civil </em>Service, 386 Mich 375; 192 NW2d 449 (1971). We believe that it is perfectly reasonable, given the aforementioned problems with delivering worker\u2019s compensation benefits to disabled employees, that the Legislature decide that the original award shall not be stayed pending the appeal. Certainly such a \"no-stay\u201d provision does not constitute a denial of the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">It is recognized that the 70% \"no-stay\u201d provision of 1975 PA 34 might limit or inhibit strategically or tactically the number of appeals taken by an employer or carrier. However, as we construe the legislation, this is precisely one of the ancillary goals of the act: to discourage marginal or frivolous appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Certainly no employer or carrier will be discouraged from pursuing a meritorious appeal. The 70% no-stay \"payment shall commence as of the date of hearing referee\u2019s award and shall continue until final determination of the appeal\u201d. If an employer or carrier is successful upon appeal and \"the weekly benefit is reduced or rescinded by a final determination\u201d, the employer or carrier will have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>only paid the 70% benefits for the interim period between the initial award and its subsequent reduction or rescission. It is patently illogical to assume that an employer or carrier will not press a meritorious appeal simply because he is required to pay 70% benefits before an appeal can be completed. Nor does such payment render the appellate process meaningless when one considers the potential liability present in many cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Furthermore, we do not agree with the construction that the interim 70% payments continue even though the hearing referee\u2019s award is overturned at some juncture during the appellate process. The statute specifically provides that \"[pjayment shall commence as of the date of the hearing referee\u2019s award and shall continue <em>until \u00f1nal determination of the appeal </em>* * * \u201d. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">It would yield an absurd result to construe the phrase \"until final determination of the appeal\u201d as \"until completion of the entire appellate process\u201d. See <em>In re Petition of State Highway Commission, </em>383 Mich 709; 178 NW2d 923 (1970). The entire appellate process could conceivably include appeals either by the claimant or by the employer or carrier to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, Court of Appeals and Supreme Court. The logical consequence of the statute\u2019s wording indicates that a claimant is entitled to 70% benefits awarded by a hearing referee until such time as the hearing referee\u2019s award is reduced or rescinded upon an appeal. If the hearing referee\u2019s award, the prerequisite for putting the entire legislative schema in motion, is vacated at any appellate stage, the 70% benefits are terminated. If at any point on appeal the benefits are reduced, the 70% no-stay provision applies only to the new award (provided, of course, another appeal is taken).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Likewise, if a hearing referee\u2019s award which was vacated or modified at a lower appellate level is reinstated at a higher appellate level, the 70% benefits resume.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This interpretation is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent as we read the statute. The hearing referee\u2019s initial award is the catalyst which initiates the 70% benefits. During the various appellate steps, it is that initial hearing referee\u2019s award and its eventual disposition which governs when 70% benefits are to be paid or not paid, until the appellate process is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Thus, it can readily be seen that the 70% \"no-stay\u201d provision of 1975 PA 34 ultimately encourages all parties to expedite appeals. Employers and carriers certainly will seek prompt appellate relief in cases where they believe unjustified benefits are awarded. Claimants will also seek prompt appellate finalization in most cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because they will wish to obtain the 30% benefits held pending final disposition. In the meantime, the 70% benefits initially awarded will sustain the claimants during this sometimes lengthy process and remove any unfair bargaining leverage employers or carriers exercise during the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">We find nothing unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious about this legislative plan and believe the means selected, to wit, the 70% no-stay provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>bears a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\n<em>B. Substantive Due Process: Reimbursement</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\"If the weekly benefit is reduced or rescinded by a final determination, the carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement in a sum equal to the compensation paid pending the appeal in excess of the amount finally determined. Reimbursement shall be paid upon audit and proper voucher from the second injury fund established in chapter 5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Appellant carriers contend in this case that the reimbursement provision of 1975 PA 34 provides for an unconstitutional taking of property without substantive due process of law because the reimbursement to which appellants are entitled, if they are successful on appeal, must come from the Second Injury Fund,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and not from the recipients of the 70% benefits. Appellants reason that since they are required to finance the Second Injury Fund they are, in fact, required to reimburse themselves for benefits paid but not owed. This, they maintain, constitutes a confiscatory taking of property without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">While we agree with appellant carriers\u2019 reading of the statutory provision, we do not agree that provision provides for an unconstitutional \"taking\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The clear wording of the statute provides that reimbursement for benefits paid' during the pendency of an appeal, which subsequently reduces or rescinds those benefits, \"shall be paid * * * from the second injury fund\u201d. The word \"shall\u201d clearly means that payment is mandatory or imperative from the fund. <em>Southfield Twp v Drainage Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>for 12 Towns Relief Drains, </em>357 Mich 59; 97 NW2d 821 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">However, appellant carrier\u2019s position regarding the constitutionality of this reimbursement scheme is premised on two incorrect assumptions: (1) that reimbursement is constitutionally mandated and (2) that reimbursement from a state insurance fund, such as the Second Injury Fund, constitutes \"self-reimbursement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">While 1975 PA 34 provides for reimbursement, we submit that the \"no-stay\u201d provision of the statute would still be constitutional even if <em>no </em>method of reimbursement were provided for in the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature reasonably found that the withholding of compensation due claimants pending appeal operated to frustrate the general purpose of the act. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the Legislature, within the constitutional exercise of its police power, could require employers and their carriers to bear the risk of paying benefits during the limited pendency of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The New Hampshire Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in construing the \"no-stay\u201d provision in its worker\u2019s compensation act. The Court held the lack of a reimbursement clause did not render its no-stay provision constitutionally infirm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">\"Secondly, we agree that the statute makes no provision for recoupment of payments made, in the event that the decision of the commissioner is overturned on appeal. We hold that no such right of recoupment was implied or intended. <em>See Hagerty v Great American Indemnity Co, </em>106 NH 425; 213 A2d 424 (1965). The absence of provision therefor is to us an indication of the legislative intent that no such right should arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\"It has long been established that workmen\u2019s compensation is remedial in character, designed to provide, in substitution for unsatisfactory common-law remedies in tort, a liability without fault for limited compensation, capable of ready and early determination. <em>Mulhall v [Nashua Manufacturing] Co, </em>80 NH 194, 196-199; 115 A 449, 453 (1921); <em>see Carbonneau v [Hoosier Engineering] Co, </em>96 NH 240, 244; 73 A2d 802, 806 (1950). The provisions of the 1971 amendment were designed to further this purpose, and to assure prompt payment of compensation to workmen found to be entitled thereto, after administrative hearing of the parties involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\"Granted that in the event of successful appeals by employers, the statute will place upon them a new or additional burden. The legislature could reasonably find that the withholding of compensation by employers pending appeal had operated to frustrate the purposes of the law. Hence in the exercise of the police power, it could properly require employers, and more broadly the enterprises which they represent, to bear for a limited period the risk of payments made during appeal, rather than the injured employee, who as the plaintiffs point out is usually in no financial position to carry that risk.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co v Duvall, </em>113 NH 28, 31; 300 A2d 732, 734 (1973).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The rationale and holding of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, to which we subscribe, reflects what we perceive to be the majority position in most states which have incorporated no-stay provisions into their worker\u2019s compensation schemes. The Legislature has an option as to whether or not it wishes to provide for reimbursement. However, the Legislature\u2019s choice regarding provision for reimbursement in no way affects the ultimate constitutionality of the no-stay provision. See, for example, <em>Merchants Mutual Ins Co v Newport </em>Hospital, 108 RI 86; 272 A2d 329 (1971). Also see <em>St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins Co v Treadwell, </em>263 Md 430; 283 A2d 601 (1971); <em>Tompkins v George Rinner Construction Co, </em>196 Kan 244; 409 P2d 1001 (1966), and the cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Michigan Legislature elected to provide for a unitary system of reimbursement for carriers via the Second Injury Fund; this was the Legislature\u2019s prerogative, and we respect it. However, the constitutionality of 1975 PA 34\u2019s no-stay provision does not hinge on the Legislature\u2019s so providing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>While we need not address appellant carriers\u2019 second assumption since reimbursement is not constitutionally mandated, nevertheless we would reject outright the notion that reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund constitutes \"self-reimbursement\u201d and is therefore a confiscatory taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The Second Injury Fund is a <em>state </em>insurance fund created by the Legislature to insure carriers and self-insured employers against certain losses occurring due to worker\u2019s compensation claims. MCLA 418.501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(501) <em>et seq. </em>See also <em>Copperweld Steel Co v Industrial Commission, </em>143 Ohio St 591; 56 NE2d 154 (1944). The Second Injury Fund does <em>not </em>belong to the carriers. No employer or carrier has a direct or vested interest in the fund. Rather, the carriers and self-insured employers pay annual assessments to the fund. Once paid, these assessments become state or public moneys. Like any insurance scheme, the Second Injury Fund spreads the risk of worker\u2019s compensation among all the self-insured employers and carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">It would be improper to conclude that because self-insured employers and carriers are required by law to pay into the fund, reimbursements received from the fund constitute \"self-reimbursement\u201d. Pursuant to traditional insurance concepts, the <em>state </em>reimburses the self-insured employers or carriers from assessed premiums. Some employers and carriers receive substantial reimbursements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>from the fund; others receive nothing. Nevertheless all involved are required to pay insurance premiums into the fund, predicated upon their proportional share of the total funds disbursed during the previous year.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since the Second Injury Fund is a creature of the state, no property right would inure to the employers or carriers. Without a corresponding property right, it could not be maintained that the instant reimbursement provision constitutes a confiscatory taking without due process of law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">III. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Appellants raise several issues concerning the constitutionality of 1975 PA 34 under the equal protection clauses of the United States and Michigan Constitutions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Only one of those issues merits discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The appellant self-insured employers and carriers submit that 1975 PA 34 denies them equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>protection of the law because the legislative classifications are arbitrary, and not reasonably related to the object of the legislation. Specifically, the appellants suggest that the \"70% statute\u201d invidiously discriminates among a common class of litigants: namely, all appellants of worker\u2019s compensation decisions. The appellants maintain that employers and carriers are inordinately burdened by the statute because they must pay 70% of the hearing referee\u2019s award pending appeal and are therefore discouraged from exercising their right to appeal. On the other hand, some appellants assert 1975 PA 34 encourages claimants to press frivolous appeals since they continue to receive benefits not due.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We have examined this argument, at least tangentially, under our due process analysis and rejected it. We also reject this argument under equal protection analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The appellants\u2019 position is based upon two obviously erroneous premises: (1) that the legislative classification drawn involves <em>all </em>appellants of worker\u2019s compensation awards, and (2) that the classification system, whatever it may be, is either arbitrary or not reasonably related to the object of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The test to be applied in deciding whether a particular statute comports with equal protection guarantees was stated by this Court in <em>Alexander v Detroit, </em>392 Mich 30, 35-36; 219 NW2d 41 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\"The question whether or not a particular legislative enactment violates equal protection for want of proper classification of subject individuals or entities is not susceptible to facile determination. Voluminous case law exists on the subject of the appropriate test to be utilized in such an analysis. In three relatively recent majority opinions of this Court, Chief Justice (then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Justice) T. M. Kavanagh pulled together the threads of past opinions of our Court and the United States Supreme Court, essentially elucidating two tests to guide judicial scrutiny of suspect enactments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">\"(1) Are the enactment\u2019s classifications based on natural distinguishing characteristics and do they bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\"(2) Are all persons of the same class included and affected alike or are immunities or privileges extended to an arbitrary or unreasonable class while denied to others of like kind?\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In <em>Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655, 668; 232 NW2d 636 (1975), this Court discussed the two-tiered approach to equal protection and its shifting burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\"If the interest is 'fundamental\u2019 or the classification 'suspect\u2019, the court applies a 'strict scrutiny\u2019 test requiring the state to show a 'compelling\u2019 interest which justifies the classification. Rarely have courts sustained legislation subjected to this standard of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\"Other legislation, principally social and economic, is subjected to review under the traditional equal protection test. The burden is on the person challenging the classification to show that it is without reasonable justification. It has been said that '[a] statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it\u2019. A classification will stand unless it is shown to be 'essentially arbitrary\u2019. Few statutes have been found so wanting in 'rationality\u2019 as to fail to satisfy the 'essentially arbitrary\u2019 test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">In the case at bar, it becomes immediately apparent that the thrust of the legislation challenged is primarily social and economic. The legislation involved deals with property rights, not fundamental rights. Therefore, the burden is on the appellants to show the classification is arbitrary and does not bear a rational relation to the object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the legislation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The appellants fail to meet their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The appellants erroneously maintain that the class drawn by the legislature in 1975 PA 34 is <em>all </em>appellants of worker\u2019s compensation decisions. Accordingly, appellants contend that immunities-privileges extended to worker\u2019s compensation appellants who happen to be employees-claimants are denied to other appellants, <em>i.e., </em>self-insurers and carriers. The problem with appellants\u2019 contention is that they misconceive the class drawn by the Legislature. The class is <em>not </em>\"all appellants\u201d, but rather \"all self-insured employers and carriers\u201d. Then the question naturally becomes whether all self-insured employers and carriers are treated the same? The answer to this rhetorical question is \"yes\u201d; all employers and carriers are required to pay claimants 70% benefits pending any appeal taken <em>by them (i.e., </em>employers and carriers) from an award.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The class as conceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>by the Legislature treats carriers and self-insurers as similarly situated persons and is obviously reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">However, even granting appellants\u2019 premise that the class created by 1975 PA 34 (\"all appellants\u201d) treats self-insured employers and carriers differently on appeal from employees-claimants, we would still find that the legislative classification scheme is not essentially arbitrary and bears a rational relation to the object of the legislation. The Court of Appeals ably discussed this point in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\"The object of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is to provide compensation to persons suffering a disability-arising from their employment. Such compensation, to be effective, obviously must be provided promptly. So the act provides. MCLA 418.801; MSA 17.237(801). Public Act 34 effectuates this purpose by providing for payment to the claimant of part of the award granted by a hearing referee. Why the claimant should not be entitled to such payment pending the employer\u2019s appeal is not answered by the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\"Pending appeal, money representing part of the amount awarded by the hearing referee is going to be in the hands of either the employer or the employee. It certainly doesn\u2019t fly in the face of reason to conclude that the disabled worker should receive part of that award during that period of time. The hearing referee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>has previously determined that the employee is entitled to the award. Because of his disability, the employee needs the money immediately, not months or years hence. Any discrimination against the employer by the imposition of a heavier risk of appeal under this procedure is clearly not irrational or unrelated to the object of the act.\u201d <em>Turner, supra, </em>540-541.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Finally, appellants\u2019 claim that employees-claimants are encouraged by the 70% statute to press frivolous appeals is patently illogical. Unless the hearing referee initially finds disability, the 70% benefits are never \"triggered\u201d. Therefore, when the hearing referee finds for the employee-claimant, the next move, <em>i.e., </em>to appeal or not to appeal, belongs to the employer or carrier. The employees-claimants will always be the <em>appellees </em>at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">As we explained <em>supra, </em>if the claimant\u2019s award is rescinded or reduced, the benefits are then terminated or modified. It is only at this stage that the claimants become the <em>appellants. </em>Hence, it becomes apparent that 1975 PA 34 does not encourage employees-claimants to drag along useless appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">IV. Retroactivity</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The appellants in these consolidated cases next challenge the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s application of 1975 PA 34 to cases involving injuries or appeals which occurred prior to the effective date of the act, May 6, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Specifically, appellants contend that the application of the 70% statute to cases involving injuries incurred or appeals taken by employers before the effective date of the act constitutes an unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tional impairment of contractual obligations.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Appellants reason that a self-insured employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s liability to an injured employee cannot exceed the statutory limit in effect on the date of injury. Appellants maintain that this is true because the liability for benefits is essentially <em>contractual; </em>therefore the existing employment contract establishes the extent of that liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Appellants also contend that any retroactive application of the act improperly alters existing substantive law in that it changes the amount of an employer\u2019s liability, his right to reimbursement, and the right of the employer to defend against claims of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As the Court of Appeals pointed out, appellants\u2019 arguments are once again inaptly premised. (1) The Legislature possesses the requisite authority to alter the <em>method </em>of enforcing pre-existing rights. The Legislature can elect to modify the remedies for the enforcement of a contract without violating \"impairment of contract\u201d prohibitions. (2) The 70% statute does not increase an employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s substantive liability for injuries incurred or appeals taken by employers before the act\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">It must be remembered from the outset that 1975 PA 34, and Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act as a whole, is essentially <em>remedial </em>legislation. <em>Van Dorpel v Haven-Busch Co, </em>350 Mich 135, 154; 85 NW2d 97 (1957). Furthermore, this Court has held that remedies for the enforcement of a contract may be modified without violating the impairment of contract clauses. In <em>Lahti v Fosterling, </em>357 Mich 578; 99 NW2d 490 (1959), this Court specifically held that medical benefits due under the existing worker\u2019s compensation act could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>extended without impairing existing contractual relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Our Court, relying on a New York decision, reasoned thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\"In <em>Matter of Schmidt v Wolf Contracting Co, </em>269 App Div 201; 55 NYS2d 162 [1945], the court considered the aims and purposes of the workmen\u2019s compensation law in attempting to arrive at the intent of the legislature to apply a retroactive amendment to workmen injured prior to the effective date of the act, held the legislature had the right to so amend, and applied retrospectively the amended provisions. It further stated it was unreasonable to assume that the legislature intended that a workman who suffers injury on one date is any less affected than one injured on a subsequent date of the same year. With reference to the defense that the contract between the employer and its insurance carrier is impaired by such an amendment and that the statute violates the due process clauses of the State constitution and the Constitution of the United States, the court said (pp 207, 208):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\" 'That argument is without merit. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\" 'Liability under the workmen\u2019s compensation law is contractual, the amendment is not thereby violative of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States. The police power of the State may be exercised to affect the due process of law clause as well as the impairment of contract clause of the Federal Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\" 'The subject matter of workmen\u2019s compensation reposes within the control of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\" 'A law enacted pursuant to rightful authority is proper, and private contracts are entered into subject to that governmental authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lahti, supra, </em>592.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The Court in <em>Lahti </em>reached the identical conclusion we posit in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">\"Believing as we do that no vested right or contractual right exists that prohibits the legislature from making a change in the remedies afforded employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>under the workmen\u2019s compensation law, and keeping in mind the express primary purpose of the act to transfer to industry the expense of injuries to employees growing out of and in the course of their employment, it is apparent to us that the legislature intended * * * [citation omitted] to substitute for the existing remedies under the act some expansion thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As for appellants\u2019 second contention, the 70% statute clearly does not retroactively alter existing substantive law by changing the amount of the employer\u2019s liability. The 70% statute only effectuates a <em>procedural </em>change; employers and carriers are now required to make immediate payment pending the appeal. However, the substantive benefits (the \"100%\u201d total) ultimately owed, or not owed, remain exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Finally, amendatory statutes relating to procedure, such as the one we are concerned with in the instant case, are intended to be applied retroactively in any event, absent legislative expression to the contrary. <em>Hansen-Snyder Co v General Motors Corp, </em>371 Mich 480; 124 NW2d 286 (1963). On June 16, 1975, the Legislature went so far as to specifically declare that 1975 PA 34 was to be applied to cases arising before the act\u2019s effective date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\"It was also the clear and distinct intent of the Michigan Legislature, when enacting Act No 34 of the Public Acts of 1975, that section 862 was to be construed retroactive concerning all cases, pending an appeal, as well as new cases on appeal after the date of May 6, 1975 * * * .\u201d Senate Concurrent Resolution No 164, 1975 Senate Journal, No 70, pp 1230-1231.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Therefore, we hold that 1975 PA 34 neither impairs existing contracts nor retroactively changes existing substantive law. The act only retroactively changes existing procedural remedies; those changes were consciously provided for by legislative fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">V. Dismissal: Noncompliance</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In their final issue, appellants contend that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) exceeds its authority in dismissing appeals by employers or carriers for noncompliance with 1975 PA 34.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>We agree with the Court of Appeals that power of the WCAB to dismiss appeals for noncompliance with 1975 PA 34 is necessarily implied from the statute itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\"The power of the Appeal Board to dismiss an employer\u2019s appeal for failure to comply with PA 34 is necessarily implied from the act. Were it not, the act would become meaningless; the very problem PA 34 was designed to alleviate would persist \u2014 the award of the disabled worker remaining unpaid while judicial enforcement of the act is sought. We cannot read the Legislature\u2019s intent as being directly contrary to its clear expression of policy.\u201d 70 Mich App 544.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The WCAB also correctly reasoned that the 70% statute operates as a condition precedent for the perfection of an appeal and that failure to comply with the statute\u2019s mandate necessitates a dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\"It is clear that this legislation is a prerequisite for the perfecting of an appeal and that failure to comply with the statutory mandate or this order will result in a dismissal. Should defendant, therefore, refuse to comply then a subsequent order dismissing its claim for review will issue forthwith in the same manner that such orders are issued for failure to properly perfect an appeal as where there is a failure to file a transcript.\u201d <em>Karbel v Greyhound Food Management, </em>1975 WCABO 1851, 1859.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Also see <em>Java, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The appellants in these consolidated cases were all given written notice that dismissal orders would enter if they did not comply with 1975 PA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>34. Furthermore, the WCAB\u2019s decision in <em>Karbel, </em>a precedential determination, accompanied that notice.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">We affirm the Court of Appeals. The \"70%\u201d statute, 1975 PA 34, MCLA 418.862; MSA 17.237(862), is constitutional. However, we reverse the Court of Appeals finding that reimbursement is not mandated from the Second Injury Fund, MCLA 418.501 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(501) <em>et seq. </em>The clear wording of the statute mandates exclusive reimbursement from the Second Injury Fund for 70% benefits paid pending appeal in excess of the amount finally determined. Finally, we hold that the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s authority to dismiss appeals for noncompliance is necessarily implied from the act or the act becomes meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Affirmed as modified.

This aspect of the matter presents a rather more troublesome issue since literal application of the Act would require that defendant not only commence payment of seventy (70) percent of the weekly benefit but also pay seventy (70) percent of the amounts accrued since the hearing referee\u2019s decision. It seems clear, however, from the plain language of the amendment that the legislature intended only to provide those who had obtained a favorable decision at the hearing referee level with some immediate ongoing source of sustenance and not with accruals on the award. Thus, the Act expressly provides that benefits 'accruing prior to the referee\u2019s award shall be withheld until final determination of the appeal.\u2019 <em>It would, accordingly, seem incongruous with, if not patently contrary to, this obvious legislative intent to issue orders requiring payment of amounts accrued prior to the effective date of the amendment. </em>Accordingly, defendant should he ordered to commence payment of seventy (70) percent of the weekly benefit provided for in the hearing referee\u2019s decision from May 6, 1975 (date signed by the Governor), and until further order of the Bureau.\u201d 1975 WCABO 1859. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">This Court agrees with <em>Karbel. </em>No benefits under the 70% statute shall commence before the date of the act, May 6, 1975. Thus, \"back\u201d 70% benefits, those benefits accrued before the effective date of the 70% statute, are not owed to claimants who received a hearing referee\u2019s award before May 6, 1975. However, those claimants who received awards prior to the effective date of the act are entitled to 70% benefits from May 6, 1975, \u2014 even if the injury, the award and the employer\u2019s appeal all occurred before the effective date of 1975 PA 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Accordingly, if a hearing referee\u2019s award was in effect as of May 6, 1975, 70% benefits are due the claimant from May 6, 1975.

Although not the focus of the opinion, the Court did note a section providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\"if the final decision of a referee affirms the initial or an amended determination, or the appeal board affirms the final decision of a referee, allowing benefits, such benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter be taken, but if such decision is finally reversed, no employer\u2019s experience record shall be charged with benefits so paid\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The Court was concerned that this \"would render administrative action superior to recognized judicial power\u201d and make the court review provisions \"a nullity\u201d. It said the section, if applied, \"would render due process of law, expressly recognized and provided for in the act, nugatory and a senseless gesture\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The same section was reviewed in <em>Chrysler Corp v Unemployment Compensation Commission, </em>301 Mich 351, 356, 360; 3 NW2d 302 (1942). The Court held it unconstitutional for \"the fundamental reason\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">\"otherwise the controverted issue of claimants\u2019 right to be paid compensation would in effect be finally decided and the compensation paid without affording an adverse party any opportunity whatever to have obtained a <em>judicial </em>determination of the rights of the respective parties; and thereby the party contesting the employees\u2019 claim to compensation would be deprived of the right to due process which is afforded by both the State Constitution and the Federal Constitution whenever the controversy involves property rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The provision would \"deprive the courts of any effective review or supervisory control of awards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>compensation to applicants therefor regardless of whether or not they were entitled to same under the terms of the act\u201d the Court said.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In fn 10 of his opinion, Justice Moody says that \"[i]nsofar as <em>Chrysler Corp v Unemployment Compensation Commission </em>* * * is inapposite\u201d to <em>California Dep\u2019t of Human Resources Development v Java, </em>402 US 121; 91 S Ct 1347; 28 L Ed 2d 666 (1971), \"our reliance on <em>Java </em>renders that decision nugatory\u201d. In the opinion, he does acknowledge that <em>Java </em>\"arose out of a different factual context and dealt with the complex interplay of Federal-state guidelines regarding the prompt payment of unemployment benefits\u201d. He does not acknowledge that <em>Java </em>involves <em>statutory interpretation </em>rather than <em>constitutional law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The <em>Java </em>court held the California procedure was inconsistent with the Social Security Act which requires benefits to be paid when due.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In reviewing the California procedures, the Court said \"it can be seen that the interview for the determination of eligibility is the critical point\u201d. This initial determination \"is effective in insuring that benefits are limited to legally eligible claimants\u201d. The Court found that \"95%-98% of ineligible claimants are screened out at this stage\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The Michigan workmen\u2019s compensation situation is not analagous to California\u2019s unemployment compensation situation. Here, the WCAB proceeding is the critical stage as to facts, as demonstrated above. Also, the courts are constitutionally assigned the function of reviewing for legal errors. The statistics are much different. From July 1, 1974 to July 1, 1975 the WCAB handled 518 cases by opinion and order: 302 were affirmed; 136 modified; 69 reversed; 11 remanded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Thus, in 216 or nearly 42% of those 518 cases, the WCAB did not accept the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I believe the procedures established by Constitution and statute are the minimum necessary to insure that claims are handled fairly. The WCAB has an important review function; the appellate courts have a different but equally important review function. The imposition of liability and irreparable damage upon companies and carriers before these reviews are completed deprives them of procedure essential to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Justice Moody notes that eligible workers \"must often wait years to begin receiving compensation while the appellate process slowly grinds to a final conclusion\u201d. The \"appellate process hamstrings the delivery of immediate benefits\u201d. Eligible employees are \"whipsawed into settlements for lesser benefits in order to avoid the lengthy appellate process\u201d. We have a \"strangulating appellate process\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">If all this is true, it is also true for other plaintiffs, but this opinion rests primarily on due process rather than equal protection. However, the solution is obvious and does not involve curtailing basic procedural rights of one or more parties to the dispute. We should not punish any party for judicial failure to speedily process these cases or legislative failure to provide a constitutional solution. We cannot in good conscience deprive one party of due process of law in order to favor another. In the event of conflicting constitutional rights, a balancing may be necessary. Such is not the case here where we balance constitutional rights of one party against convenience to another. Our sympathies here undeniably lend weight to convenience. The question is how far we should go in sacrificing the basic rights of one party to sympathy for the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Plainly stated the question is: Is this the key to unlock the door through which we allow the due process doctrine to escape?</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">III. Confiscation of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act to date has enjoyed judicial findings of constitutionality primarily because it has maintained a balance \u2014or trade-off \u2014 between opposing legal rights. For example, the worker gives up the right to sue the employer in tort and the employer gives up defenses available in tort, such as negligence of the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">However, 1975 PA 34 boasts no such virtue. It is plainly confiscatory in nature. There is no balancing of rights, no trade-off, no way that carriers can be made whole. It is no solution to rationalize that the losses will be passed on eventually to the consumer. Nor are all employers big and rich corporations. The corner grocery store, the small hardware store, the elderly person with a household helper also are included.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The act purports to provide for reimbursing those carriers forced to pay benefits to claimants who, on review, are found to be ineligible. However, as the trial court in the <em>Self-Insurers </em>case noted, 1975 PA 34 requires carriers \"to bear the burden of appeal as well as the support of the individual claimant while the decision is being appealed\u201d. If successful, \"the insurer is reimbursed out of a fund which it helps finance\u201d. All other insurers also are being \"reimbursed\u201d from that fund, so defendants not only are receiving back money they put in in the first place but are paying other insurers in like situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The non-reimbursed cost is passed on to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>employer and, if the employer is in business or industry, thence to the consumer. If a governmental unit is the employer, it is passed on to the taxpayer. If the employee is a household helper, the homeowner absorbs the cost. If the employer is self-insured, the \"self\u2019 in the \"self-insured\u201d absorbs the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">A. Reimbursement from Employee-Claimants</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Court of Appeals conceded that 1975 PA 34 might be unconstitutional if construed as \"limiting reimbursement only from the Second Injury Fund\u201d and noted that reimbursement also could be sought from the employee-claimant. I agree with Justice Moody that the 70% act provides only one means of reimbursement, thereby excluding reimbursement from the employee who was wrongfully paid and also excluding any other means of reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">However, my colleagues go further and say that the carrier should be required to pay the 70% of what is <em>not </em>owed and that <em>no </em>reimbursement is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">At least the Court of Appeals recognized a long line of Michigan cases holding that we cannot deprive a party of recoupment of money not owed but paid to a worker or beneficiary. This constitutional concept is basic and the 70% statute fails partially because it violates this tenet.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Certainly I cannot agree with Justice Moody that \"the legislation involved deals with property rights\u201d and therefore \"not fundamental rights\u201d. The fallacy is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">In <em>Kirchner v Michigan Sugar Co, </em>206 Mich 459, 463, 465; 173 NW 193 (1919), the state accident fund by mistake overcompensated a worker. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>fund sought reimbursement. The industrial accident board ordered \"that the total sum overpaid * * * shall be applied on the future compensation payable * * * until such overpaid amount is entirely consumed\u201d. The Court affirmed saying the worker was \"entitled to receive, and his employer is obligated to pay, no more and no less than the statute compensation\u201d. The board had authority \"to make such an order * * * to bring about, so far as possible, such desired and lawful result\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In <em>Webster v Rotary Electric Steel Co, </em>321 Mich 526, 532; 33 NW2d 69 (1948), the plaintiffs husband was killed while working. She and an infant daughter received benefits. When plaintiff remarried, a dispute arose concerning the child\u2019s benefits. On appeal the Court reduced the benefits. It also ordered that if overpayments were made, the amount \"shall be deducted from future payments\u201d. Also see <em>Samels v Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co, </em>323 Mich 251, 259; 35 NW2d 265 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\"One of the purposes of the compensation act is to afford the injured employee prompt relief and not permit it to be withheld while the employer delays payment by the filing of a petition or petitions to reduce compensation. * * * Nevertheless, where there has been no laches by the employer, the commission, when called upon by proper petition, should determine whether there has been an overpayment under the facts, as are presented in this case, and order the return of such overpayment either directly or by a credit on future payments. <em>The act seeks just compensation, but not a penalty\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">These cases were reviewed in <em>Danford v Contract Purchase Corp, </em>333 Mich 559, 567; 53 NW2d 377 (1952), where plaintiff, a widow, received a lump-sum advance payment to cover 129 weeks of benefits. Before that time expired, she remarried. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The company sought reimbursement which the commission granted and this Court affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\"Her right to further compensation under the statute was terminated by her. Under the facts presented here we are in accord with the holding of the compensation commission that under the statute, reasonably interpreted, <em>the amount paid to her in anticipation of future payments that it was assumed she would be entitled to receive must be regarded as an overpayment. </em>In ordering the return the commission did not exceed its authority.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">MCLA 418.827; MSA 17.237(827) permits an employee receiving compensation to begin \"an action to enforce the liability of a third party\u201d. However, any recovery \"after deducting expenses of recovery, shall first reimburse the employer or carrier for any amounts paid or payable * * * to the date of recovery and the balance * * * shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future payments of compensation benefits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The plaintiff in <em>Pelkey v Elsea Realty &amp; Investment Co, </em>394 Mich 485; 232 NW2d 154 (1975), claimed that the statute above violated due process and equal protection guarantees by crediting money received for pain and suffering. We noted that at one time the employee had to elect a remedy \u2014 workmen\u2019s compensation or tort. Now, the employee can pursue both. We did \"not find the provision for reimbursement to be an arbitrary denial of a property right\u201d. The reimbursement \"is justified by the abrogation of the election of remedies requirement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">These cases underscore a conclusion that a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>pany or carrier has a right to be fully reimbursed for being required to pay benefits to undeserving claimants. Full reimbursement means a dollar back for a dollar paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">B. Skcond Injury Fund</p>\n<p id=\"AgYF\">1975 PA 34 does not provide full reimbursement. The company or carrier is paid from the Second Injury Fund. That fund was created \"to compensate workmen for successive injuries which leave them totally and permanently disabled\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>White v Weinberger Builders, Inc, </em>397 Mich 23; 242 NW2d 427 (1976), we adopted the Court of Appeals analysis that the fund is \"to protect the totally and permanently disabled employee who is entitled to compensation * * * from inflation by passing on legislative improvements in benefits without assessing a single employer for benefits not in effect at the time of injury\u201d. 49 Mich App 430, 436; 212 NW2d 307 (1973). The fund was intended to promote hiring of handicapped persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The fund\u2019s money is provided by assessing each carrier. Every year the workmen\u2019s compensation director determines the total disbursements from the fund during the preceding year. This figure is multiplied by 175% and the result is reduced by \"the amount of net assets in excess of $200,000.00\u201d in the fund. This is the total assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The director must then determine each carrier\u2019s share of the total. He first finds the ratio of total compensation benefits paid by each carrier (with certain deductions) to the total compensation benefits paid by all carriers. This ratio is applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>total assessment and the resulting figure becomes the individual carrier\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The Second Injury Fund was not created to reimburse carriers. It was designed to spread the cost of certain workers\u2019 benefits among all carriers. It was designed to channel funds to deserving claimants without overburdening individual carriers. It was not designed to be a self-reimbursement fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">As described above, the fund is financed by an assessment on each carrier. Under 1975 PA 34, each carrier forced to pay benefits to an undeserving claimant is reimbursed with its own money, with money it was required to pay. Further, by using Second Injury Fund money to reimburse, 1975 PA 34 lowers the balance of net assets in the fund, thus increasing the total assessment. This means each carrier\u2019s assessment will increase. The initial injustice is compounded in perpetuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In situations where reimbursement is warranted, 1975 PA 34 has operated to require a carrier to make payments to an undeserving claimant. The carrier is out of pocket a certain sum. It is reimbursed from a fund into which it is required to pay. The \"reimbursement\u201d, in turn, will have the effect of requiring the carrier to pay more into the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The carrier will never be made whole for payments which it was wrongly forced to make. All carriers must dip into their own money to \"reimburse\u201d themselves and then pitch in to replace the money paid to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">On the other hand, the unsuccessful claimant will have received as a gift 70% of what would have been paid if he or she had been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The result is to chill the right of appeal by an employer or carrier under this \"no-win\u201d concept. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Far from being frivolous, most defendants-appellants\u2019 appeals to this Court bring forth questions of substance. Some are of major jurisprudential importance, as, for instance, the effects of childhood or congenital psychiatric and physical disorders upon compensation under varied circumstances. (What is compensable and what is not?) Statutory interpretations of an imprecise and complex act frequently are in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In short, we cannot gloss over defendant appeals as \"frivolous\u201d in order to sustain a 70% payment of a possibly erroneous referee\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The core of the problem is that taking money to place in the Second Injury Fund from one pocket and taking it out again as reimbursement to place in the other pocket \u2014 only to have to remove some of it to replace that taken from the fund in the first place \u2014 does not really add up to recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">It is a fiction which is not avoided by saying that the money changes character by placement in the fund and thus becomes the \"state\u2019s\u201d money\u2014 which must be replaced by the same carriers who reimburse themselves from it. It is not part of the general fund. It is a special fund for a special purpose and funded by those same carriers which are now required to take the money out with one hand and replace it with another. It does not involve tax dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">We cannot (or should not) avoid reality in this analysis or we open wide the door to like confiscatory fictions in other concepts. We should not emulate the ostrich and bury our heads so that we do not see what we do not wish to see.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">C. Retroactivity</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">My colleagues also hang much on the nail of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\"remedial legislation\u201d. Of particular note is the reply in part IV to appellants\u2019 arguments against retroactivity. They find no impairment of contractual obligations because the amendment, like the parent workmen\u2019s compensation act, is termed \"remedial\u201d not \"substantive\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">It is argued that the Legislature simply altered the <em>\"method </em>of enforcing pre-existing rights,\u201d and that the 1975 statute did \"not increase an employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s substantive liability for injuries incurred or appeals taken by employers before the act\u2019s effective date\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">One fallacy immediately apparent is that even in the <em>absence </em>of pre-existing rights, plaintiff receives the greater part of the benefits and keeps it while the non-liable appellant can never fully recover the money paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">This is not a <em>method </em>of paying <em>what is due. </em>This is substance, not form. It contains new \"rights\u201d and \"duties\u201d as opposed to rules and remedies by which substantive law is administered. It places <em>new </em>burdens on employers and carriers and those to whom those burdens are passed. It bestows <em>new </em>rights upon the losing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Our jurisprudence as a whole will suffer from the precedent that because an act is initially considered remedial, all amendments must also be considered remedial whether or not new substantive obligations (and concomitant benefits) are imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Unless the meaning of \"substantive law\u201d is corrupted, the Michigan scheme of 1975 PA 34, even if made constitutional by judicial fiat, should not be retroactive in application.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">IV. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">1975 PA 34 is confiscatory, providing for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>taking of property without due process of law. It bestows upon unsuccessful plaintiffs a non-returnable gift of 70% of what they would have received had they been successful. The successful defendant could never be fully reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The point of entry into the process for purposes of payment is prior to final finding of disputed facts (in WCAB) and prior to any review of disputed law. The function of WCAB as the final fact-finder is overcome by this statute in practical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Although defendants (whether industrial giants, small businesses or individual employers of household help and whether self-insured or insured by another \"carrier\u201d) may be found <em>not </em>liable for a disputed injury, nevertheless 70% of the initial referee\u2019s award must be paid to the plaintiff and plaintiff need not ever return the money. It is in the nature of a windfall to a plaintiff without a valid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Most importantly, the carrier cannot be fully reimbursed for such losses from the Second Injury Fund. Carriers place the money in the fund to encourage the hiring of handicapped people and to distribute the costs among the carriers. They are now to reimburse themselves from the same fund for the 70% losses. This lowers the fund, which in turn requires them to pay again into the fund to bring it up to level. They are bound to lose and on increasing levels. They cannot be made whole under this particular scheme. Their property is in fact confiscated.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">1975 PA 34 proposes to raid the Second Injury Fund for a purpose other than encouraging the hiring of the handicapped. The effect of this raid is unpredictable. It could result in such a serious depletion that people for whom the fund was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>intended could not benefit from it. Even the deepest pocket has a bottom. In this no-win situation, the right of a defendant to appeal is \"chilled\u201d. For many, it may be \"frozen\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Further, the statute is substantive in that it bestows new \"windfall\u201d benefits upon losing plaintiffs and creates new financial obligations upon winning employers and carriers which they cannot in reality recover. This is not simply a different method of payment to deserving plaintiffs so as to justify the term \"remedial legislation\u201d. Therefore, my colleagues\u2019 decision that the statute is constitutional should not bear with it any obligations incurred by its terms prior to its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Because I would find 1975 PA 34 unconstitutional, retroactivity would not need to be considered nor would the Court of Appeals decision that recoupment could be obtained from the plaintiff-employee <em>(supra). </em>I would find the statute void and sever it from the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act. The Legislature could then proceed to create a scheme preserving constitutional rights to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In my opinion, the laudable purpose of the statute cannot properly overcome the serious constitutional defects. The basic rights of <em>all </em>parties must be protected or the fundamental rights of none are safe. So far as the basic rights of one party are diminished, so are our own \u2014 and so are the rights of the employee-claimants designated as the recipients of this Court\u2019s well-intentioned beneficence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">I would reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">A \"claim for review filed pursuant to sections 859 or 861 shall not operate as a stay of payment to the claimant of 70% of the weekly benefit required by the terms of the hearing referee\u2019s award. Payment shall commence as of the date of the hearing referee\u2019s award and shall continue until final determination of the appeal or for a shorter period if specified in the award. Benefits accruing prior to the referee\u2019s award shall be withheld until final determination of the appeal. If the weekly benefit is reduced or rescinded by a final determination, the carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement in a sum equal to the compensation paid pending the appeal in excess of the amount finally determined. Reimbursement shall be paid upon audit and proper voucher from the second injury fund established in chapter 5. If the award is affirmed by a final determination, the carrier shall pay all compensation which has become due under the provisions of the award, less any compensation already paid. Interest shall not be paid on amounts paid pending final determination. Payments made to the claimant during the appeal period shall be considered as accrued compensation for purposes of determining attorneys\u2019 fees under the rules of the bureau.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> MCLA 418.601(c); MSA 17.237(601)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28:</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\"All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer or agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect private rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law.
