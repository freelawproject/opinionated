Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">The BIA properly concluded that Hernandez-Flores was not prejudiced by the IJ\u2019s failure to notify him of pre-conclusion voluntary departure at his removal proceedings. His due process claim therefore fails. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring both error and \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d to prevail on a due process challenge in removal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-17\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of Hernandez-Flores\u2019 application for post-conclusion voluntary departure. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), 1229c(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-18\">Hernandez-Flores\u2019 remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b666-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
