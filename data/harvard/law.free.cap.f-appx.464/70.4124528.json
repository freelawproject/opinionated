On appeal, Marks challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-28\">Because we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of this case, we will summarize the facts and procedural history only briefly. On September 22, 2010, a federal grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Marks. The indictment alleged that Marks, a licensed pharmacist, conspired with others to illegally distribute and dispense controlled substances via telemarketers and the internet. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Marks pled guilty to the first three counts of the indictment, which, respectively, charged Marks with: 1) conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; 2) causing misbranded drugs to be moved in interstate commerce in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(k), 333(a)(2), and 353(b)(1); and 3) money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The District Court held a sentencing hearing on June 23, 2011. The probation office\u2019s presentence investigation report recommended a sentence within the guideline range of fifty-one to sixty-three months. Marks requested a variance, arguing that he should be sentenced to less than two years\u2019 imprisonment based on the nature of his offense; his relatively minor role in the conspiracy; his age and health problems, which included sleep apnea, hypertension, and osteoarthritis; and the low likelihood that he would recidivate, since he was no longer a practicing pharmacist.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">After considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Marks\u2019s age and physical condition, the District Court sentenced Marks to fifty-one months of imprisonment (the bottom of the guideline range) and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Tomko, </em>562 F.3d 558, 567 (3d Cir.2009) (en banc). Where, as here, a defendant makes no procedural challenge to the District Court\u2019s sentence, our inquiry is limited to the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness. <em>See id. </em>at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Marks argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because, in imposing his sentence, the District Court gave \u201cshort shrift\u201d to his variance request and, as a result, imposed a sentence that was greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing in light of Marks\u2019s age, health conditions, and likelihood of recidivism. \u201cThe touchstone of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 is whether the record as a whole reflects rational and meaningful consideration of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 571 (3d Cir.2007). Here, the record reflects that the District Court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reasonably concluded that a fifty-one-month sentence was necessary. In explaining its decision not to grant Marks\u2019s request for a variance, the Court noted that Marks had ignored a warning from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), had recruited other people to participate in the illegal drug sales, and had been involved in the sale of a significant quantity of drugs. The Court also explained that Marks\u2019s physical health did not necessitate a reduced sentence because \u201cthe proper institution to which he is assigned can take care of that.\u201d Marks\u2019s sentence, which fell at the bottom of the guideline range, was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm the sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
