He pleaded guilty to four other charges. The district court sentenced him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the \u00a7 924(c) charge, and as the statute provides this sentence runs consecutively to the 60-month sentence on the other four convictions, for a total sentence of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-23\">Agents found the gun\u2014a loaded .22 caliber revolver\u2014on a shelf in Buffman\u2019s home immediately below 61.5 grams of cocaine. Before the grand jury, the prosecutor asked Buffman whether he kept the gun to protect his drug-distribution business. He replied: \u201cI guess, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d This admission was introduced at trial, and the judge inferred from Buffman\u2019s answer, plus the proximity between the gun and the drugs, that the weapon had been possessed \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the drug crime. That was a rational inference for the trier of fact to draw; we reject Buffman\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-24\">Buffman contends that making the firearms sentence consecutive to the drag sentences violates the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the eighth amendment. Yet the total sentence of imprisonment, for a multi-kilogram drug operation plus a weapons conviction, was only ten years. The Supreme Court held in <em>Harmelin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), that life in prison for distributing 650 grams of cocaine is permissible under the eighth amendment. Buffman\u2019s 120-month sentence for a larger quantity of drugs, plus a weapon, is much lower. Nothing in the Constitution forbids marginal deterrence for extra crimes; if the sentence for the firearm were concurrent with the sentence for distributing the cocaine, then there would be neither deterrence nor punishment for the extra danger created by mixing guns with drugs. Buff-man\u2019s total sentence is 150 months below the low end of the range computed under the Sentencing Guidelines. He has been treated leniently and has no complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
