GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">A Wyoming jury convicted Kent Proffit of conspiracy to commit murder, a result the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed. After unsuccessfully seeking state post-conviction relief, Mr. Proffit eventually filed a federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court, however, dismissed Mr. Proffit\u2019s petition after determining it was untimely, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), and that none of the potential grounds for statutory or equitable tolling of the limitations period could save the petition. Seeking to appeal that dismissal, Mr. Proffit asked the district court for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the court denied. Now before this court, Mr. Proffit renews his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We may issue a COA only if the petitioner makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). And where, as here, the district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition on procedural grounds, we may issue a COA only if \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We see no way, however, in which reasonable jurists might debate the district court\u2019s analysis that Mr. Proffit\u2019s petition is time-barred. Accordingly, Mr. Proffit\u2019s application for a COA is denied and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b799-10\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
