In case numbers 11-1983, 11-1990, 11-1996, and 11-1998, Boyd appeals the district court\u2019s orders adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s reports and denying relief on Boyd\u2019s claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006). We have reviewed the records and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Boyd v. KLLM Transport Servs., </em>No. 3:10-cv-03208-JFA (D.S.C. Aug. 12, 2011); <em>Boyd v. City of Columbia, </em>No. 3:11-cv-00013-JFA (D.S.C. Aug. 12, 2011); <em>Boyd v. Bi-Lo, Inc., </em>No. 3:10-cv-03209-JFA (D.S.C., Aug. 12, 2011); <em>Boyd v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>No. 3:11-cv-00845-JFA (D.S.C. Aug. 12, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-29\">In case numbers 11-2143 and 11-2144, Boyd seeks mandamus relief directing the district court and the magistrate judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>two of the above cases to provide additional citations to the record. We conclude that Boyd is not entitled to the requested relief. Mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances; it may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir.2003). Further, mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Boyd has not met these standards, and therefore, we deny his petitions for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We grant Boyd\u2019s motion to have his \u201cmitigative briefs\u201d considered as his informal briefs, but deny his remaining motions, including his motion for waiver of service, his motion to deconsolidate, and his motion to direct the district court to provide him with a certified copy of the record. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nos. 11-1983, 11-1990, 11-1996, 11-1998: <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Nos. 11-2143, 11-2144: <em>PETITION DENIED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
