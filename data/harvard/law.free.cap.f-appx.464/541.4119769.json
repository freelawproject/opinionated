The district court revoked Temple\u2019s supervision and imposed a term of nine months\u2019 reimprisonment to be followed by two more years of supervised release. On appeal Temple challenges the revocation, the term of reimprisonment, and a special condition of his supervised release that will require a mental-health evaluation. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">Temple operated a sham investment company for 5 years and defrauded 80 victims out of more than $1 million. In 2004 he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and money laundering, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). The district court sentenced him to 72 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. The terms of Temple\u2019s supervision included requirements that he report to a probation officer as directed, submit a monthly financial report, and give notice of his convictions to readers of his financial publications. The court also recommended that Temple undergo a mental-health evaluation while in prison. We affirmed his convictions and sentence. <em>United States v. Temple, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 545 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">Temple completed his prison sentence in November 2009. In December 2010 his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>probation officer petitioned to revoke his supervised release after Temple allegedly had omitted pertinent financial information from two of his monthly reports and missed a meeting scheduled to discuss the omitted information. Temple denied the charges and countered with his own motion for early termination of his supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(e)(1). If he was not constrained by his conditions of supervised release, Temple asserted, he could engage in more-lucrative work and pay restitution more quickly to his victims. The district court denied that motion with the explanation that Temple had \u201cshown no good reason\u201d for early termination and advised that, in any event, the judge would not consider such a motion unless the probation office supported it. Temple\u2019s probation officer then submitted a supplemental report accusing him of failing to include the required notice of his convictions in three financial articles he had written.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">At the revocation hearing, Temple\u2019s probation officer detailed the charges against him. She explained that in two of his monthly reports Temple had listed income from \u201cconsulting\u201d but provided no documentation to support those earnings. And when she directed him to attend a meeting to clarify the income, Temple had responded that there was \u201cno way\u201d he could make the meeting with only a few hours\u2019 notice. The probation officer also explained that she had discovered three financial articles written by Temple that did not have the required notice of his convictions. Temple, who chose to represent himself at the hearing, maintained that he had complied with each condition of his supervised release. In his view he provided adequate information in the reports because he previously had spoken with his probation officer about the consulting work. And he did not attend the meeting, Temple continued, because he was not given adequate notice. He explained the omitted disclosure of his convictions by speculating that someone must have reprinted his online articles without his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The district court concluded that a preponderance of evidence established that Temple had committed each charged violation and revoked his supervised release. Temple\u2019s recommended reimprisonment range was three to nine months, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3)(B), 7B1.4(a), and the court chose a term at the top of that range to reflect Temple\u2019s \u201cabhorrent\u201d behavior and to hold him accountable for his actions. The court also imposed a new term of two years\u2019 supervised release and ordered Temple to undergo a mental-health evaluation and comply with any recommended treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">On appeal Temple reiterates that he complied with each condition of his supervised release and insists that any deviation from the terms, at worst, was \u201ctechnical.\u201d Temple fails to appreciate, however, that supervised release is \u201ca period of conditional liberty\u201d during which he must adhere to the imposed conditions. <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>630 F.3d 699, 703 (7th Cir.2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Supervised release may be revoked if a violation is proven by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v. Musso, </em>643 F.3d 566, 570 (7th Cir.2011). Temple <em>admitted </em>violating two of the conditions, and the monthly reports introduced by the probation officer establish the third violation. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Temple\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Temple also maintains that the term of nine months\u2019 reimprisonment is \u201coverkill\u201d in light of his desire to resume productive work and pay more restitution. (Temple has completed the 9-month term, but the claim about the length of reimpris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>onment is not moot because he now is serving the term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Lanas, </em>324 F.3d 894, 906 n. 1 (7th Cir.2003).) The district court considered this argument at the revocation hearing but opined that \u201cthe last thing [Temple] want[s] to do is to make any money\u201d to repay his victims. Temple\u2019s unwillingness to follow the law and refusal to accept responsibility for his actions, the court continued, warranted a term at the top of the recommended range. This explanation reflects adequate consideration of the applicable policy statements and sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), and thus the term is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>512 F.3d 427, 438 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>408 F.3d 852, 854 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Next, Temple contends that the district court abused its discretion by ordering him to undergo a mental-health evaluation and, if indicated, undergo treatment as a special condition of his new term of supervised release. Special conditions must be reasonably related to the underlying offense and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(1), and the court must make an individualized inquiry into the need for the condition, <em>see United States v. McKissic, </em>428 F.3d 719, 722-23 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Springston, </em>650 F.3d 1153,1155-56 (8th Cir.2011). The district judge had been managing Temple\u2019s case since his indictment in 2003 and thus had a number of opportunities to observe and assess his demeanor over the course of time. On top of his history of fraud, Temple had displayed arrogant indifference to his probation officer\u2019s instructions and also tried to explain away his recent misconduct as \u201ctechnical\u201d mistakes. The judge\u2019s concern about a possible mental-health issue is understandable, and we cannot conclude that the decision to order an evaluation was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Monteiro, </em>270 F.3d 465, 469 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>154 F.3d 658, 667 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Wynn, </em>553 F.3d 1114,1120 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Finally, Temple argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the appropriate factors before denying his motion to terminate his supervised release. Courts have wide discretion when evaluating motions for early termination, and we have clarified that a court \u201cmust give some indication that it has considered the statutory factors\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Lowe, </em>632 F.3d 996, 998 (7th Cir.2011); <em>see United States v. Hook, </em>471 F.3d 766, 771 (7th Cir.2006). But when Temple filed his motion, his probation officer already had petitioned to revoke his supervised release, and the district court had scheduled a revocation hearing. No further explanation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We have reviewed Temple\u2019s other contentions, but none has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
