In imposing sentence, the district court stated that the variant sentence was warranted by Olds\u2019 need for intensive drug therapy and the need to protect society from his ongoing drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Olds appealed, arguing that his sentence was plainly unreasonable. We affirmed. However, the Supreme Court subsequently vacated the judgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). <em>United States v. Olds, </em>420 Fed.Appx. 260 (4th Cir.), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 452, 181 L.Ed.2d 291 (2011). In <em>Tapia, </em>the Supreme Court held that sentencing courts are precluded \u201cfrom imposing or lengthening a prison term to promote an offender\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2391.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Tapia </em>when it determined Olds\u2019 sentence. To give the district court an opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Tapia, </em>we conclude that resentencing is necessary. Accordingly, the sentence is vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not adequately aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
