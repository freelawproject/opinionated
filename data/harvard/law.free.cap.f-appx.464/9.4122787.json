May 4, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A078 731 083 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 31, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. <em>See Mei Chai Ye v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>489 F.3d 517, 523 (2d Cir.2007). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Shu Wen Sun v. BIA </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. In finding Sila not credible, the agency reasonably relied in part on inconsistencies among his asylum application, supporting affidavit, and hearing testimony before the IJ. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, Sila\u2019s asylum application, affidavit, and testimony contained inconsistent statements regarding when and how he learned of his father\u2019s death. When Sila was asked to explain the inconsistencies between his application and his testimony, he faulted the person who had prepared his application and contended that his affidavit had been submitted to correct the record. Given that Sila\u2019s affidavit contained additional material deviations from his testimony and further undermined his credibility, the agency was not required to credit his explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Further, because these inconsistencies go to the heart of Sila\u2019s claim of past persecution, i.e., his father\u2019s death and the rape of his family members, and related to an event of major importance cited in support of his asylum application, the agency reasonably concluded that Sila\u2019s inconsistent statements were sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 77 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that date inconsistencies relating to when petitioner learned of \u201cdistressing information\u201d are \u201cnot the sort of \u2018minor and isolated\u2019 discrepancies so plainly immaterial\u201d to an asylum claim), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is further supported by inconsistencies between Sila\u2019s affidavit and his testimony regarding whether his cousin had been raped. Despite Sila\u2019s arguments to the contrary, this inconsistency supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding because, as noted above, the discrepancy goes to the heart of Sila\u2019s claim of past persecution. <em>See Chen Yun Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that an IJ may base an adverse credibility determination on discrepancies that go to the \u201cheart of the asylum claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">Ultimately, given the inconsistent statements Sila provided regarding his father\u2019s death and the rape of his cousin, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Shu Wen Sun, </em>510 F.3d at 379-80. Since the only evidence of a threat to Sila\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was a proper basis for the denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\">. In <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008), we recognized that the REAL ID Act abrogated in part the holding in <em>Secaida-Rosales </em>for cases filed after May 11, 2005, the effective date of the Act. <em>Id. </em>Because Sila's application was filed before this date, <em>Secaida-Rosales </em>remains good law. <em>See Zheng v. Mukasey, 552 </em>F.3d 277, 287 n. 6 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
