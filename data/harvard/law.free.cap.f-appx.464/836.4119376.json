The ALJ\u2019s decision was affirmed on administrative appeal, making it the final determination of the Commissioner. Raniolo now appeals to this Court, arguing that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute and regulations determining eligibility for disabled widow\u2019s benefits, which the ALJ applied in her case, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">When an agency rule adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking, which occurred in this case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> interprets a statute that the agency is charged with administering, we must defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation if the statute is ambiguous. <em>See Christensen v. Harris Cnty., </em>529 U.S. 576, 586-87, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (discussing scope of deference). Because the statute at issue may be deemed ambiguous, we must sustain the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation so long as it is reasonable. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (requiring deference where the statute does not \u201cdirectly address[ ] the precise question at issue\u201d). In this case, the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation is a plausible, and therefore acceptable, reading of the statute. <em>See Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir. 2000) (accepting agency interpretation where it \u201ccomes within the range of reasonable choices\u201d in interpreting statutory text).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Having concluded that the regulation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute,\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, we next determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is entitled to deference. An agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless it is \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). We do not find the interpretation of the regulation in this case either implausible or \u201cinconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-6\">. There is no question in this case that the Commissioner's regulation, enacted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a), is endowed with the \"force of law\u201d necessary to receive the deference owed under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 229, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (recognizing that agency actions are entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference where Congress enabled the agency \"to speak with the force of law\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
