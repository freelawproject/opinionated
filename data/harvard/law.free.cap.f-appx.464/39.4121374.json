Williams has abandoned his claim based on Amendment 489. <em>See LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (claim not raised in appellate brief is deemed abandoned). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination as to whether the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Williams, 551 </em>F.3d 182, 185 (2d Cir.2009). Section 3582 provides that a district court may reduce a term of imprisonment \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Upon review, we conclude that Williams\u2019s appeal is without merit substantially for the reasons articulated by the district court in its order. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>No. 96-cr-938, Docket Entry No. 128 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
