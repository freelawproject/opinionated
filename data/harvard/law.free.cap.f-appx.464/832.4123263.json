No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">On appeal, Coleman argues that he should not have been sentenced as a career offender because his Alabama conviction for possessing marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use,\u201d in violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l), does not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 dBl.Ra).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review this issue for plain error because Coleman did not raise it in the district court. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">A defendant is a career offender if, among other things, he has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined as an offense under federal or state law punishable by a year or more of imprisonment \u201cthat prohibits ... the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 481.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">In examining the meaning of section 13A-12-213 in a similar context, we concluded that although it \u201cdoes not define the phrase \u2018for other than personal use,\u2019 the section necessarily punishes possession for someone else\u2019s use. In other words, section 13A-12-213 punishes the possession of marijuana <em>with the intent to distribute </em>to another.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1296 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis added) (discussing whether section 13A-12-213 is a serious drug offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)). Based on this interpretation, a violation of section 13A-12-213 also constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of section 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Coleman acknowledges our decision in <em>Robinson </em>but argues that the case was decided wrongly because there are \u201crare\u201d circumstances in which a person could possess marijuana for \u201cother than personal use,\u201d but not have the requisite intent to distribute it. This argument fails. \u201c[I]n determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes, we apply a \u2018categorical\u2019 approach\u2014 that is, we look no further than the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)). Under that approach, we focus on whether \u201cthe elements of the offense, in the ordinary case\u201d satisfy the definition of a controlled substance offense. <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (examining whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA). Because we accept the principle that the elements of possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d\u2014in the ordinary case\u2014involve the intent to distribute it, it qualifies as a controlled substance offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Thus, the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Coleman as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-9\">. Coleman concedes that his federal felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base qualifies as a controlled substance offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">. Under plain-error analysis, Coleman must show that \"(1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected his substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\" <em>United States v.
