E*TRADE provided financing for the purchase. Several years later, after discovering material defects in the home, Palmer filed suit against E\"TRADE, alleging that various statements made by E \"TRADE\u2019S representatives incident to his purchase of the home were misrepresentations. At issue in this appeal are Palmer\u2019s claims for negligent and intentional misrepresentation. Palmer also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to file a third amended complaint to add a claim for fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Under California law, the general rule is that a lender owes no duty to a borrower with respect to an appraisal procured for its purposes as a lender. <em>See Nymark v. Heart Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>231 Cal.App.3d 1089, 283 Cal.Rptr. 53 (1991). The district court correctly found that the statements made by E*TRADE\u2019s representatives were either true or opinions that did not rise to the level of actionable misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Palmer already had two opportunities to amend his complaint and cannot show good cause to file a third amended complaint. Therefore, the district court properly denied Palmer\u2019s motion to file a third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b673-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
