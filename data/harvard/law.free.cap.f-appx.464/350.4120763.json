He challenges his sentence, contending the district court erred: by declining to grant him a minor-participant adjustment; and by not considering his cooperation with the Government as a basis for a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>mate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines-sentencing range is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Regarding the district court\u2019s declining to grant Cano a minor-participant adjustment pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2(b), whether he was a minor participant is a factual finding, reviewed for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). Based upon the record as a whole, including that Cano was one of only two indicted conspirators who purchased and passed off the counterfeit currency at issue, the district court\u2019s finding that Cano was not a minor participant is plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Contrary to Cano\u2019s contention, the record indicates that the district court did consider his cooperation with the Government but nevertheless chose not to vary downward, based upon Cano\u2019s extensive criminal history, as well as the need for adequate punishment and deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Essentially, Cano urges our court to engage in impermissible \u201csubstantive second-guessing of the sentencing court\u201d. <em>Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 767. He fails to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
