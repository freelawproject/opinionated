Bishop seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint and the district court\u2019s order to show cause. We dismiss the appeals for a lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">In Appeal No. 11-2127, we dismiss because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on August 9, 2011. The notice of appeal was filed on October 14, 2011. Because Bishop failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">In Appeal No. 11-2129, we again dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order Bishop seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
