He argues for the first time on appeal that the district court did not provide a rationale for imposing the curfew, and that a curfew is not related to his prior criminal history or the district court\u2019s purported aim of protecting the public. As one \u201ctool\u201d to limit Whitfield\u2019s opportunities for recidivism and to protect the public, however, the curfew is a reasonable condition on Whitfield\u2019s supervised release, and does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Following a 911 call, Kalamazoo police officers approached Whitfiled at the Interfaith apartment complex in Kalamazoo, Michigan at approximately 3 a.m., and chased Whitfield on foot when he fled. When the officers caught him, he had a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun tucked in his waistband and a loaded magazine in his right front pants pocket. Whitfield had been paroled only two weeks earlier, after serving seven and a half years in jail for gross negligence causing a miscarriage. R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Whitfield was tried and convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). R. 1, Indictment. The district court sentenced Whitfield to 120 months imprisonment, followed by 3 years of supervised release, as well as a $2,500 fine and $100 special-assessment fee. After evaluating the Section 3553(a) factors, the district court justified Whitfield\u2019s 120-month sentence by describing Whitfield\u2019s long criminal history, which culminated in the death of unborn twins after he fled from police officers and crashed into a vehicle with a pregnant woman inside. R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 32-33. The district court found that 120 months was \u201can appropriate sentence, even a necessary sentence, to achieve deterrence with respect to Mr. Whitfield and public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The district court also imposed a curfew as a condition of Whitfield\u2019s supervised release. Under the terms of the curfew, \u201con weekdays he [is to] be in his residence by 10 p.m. and on weekends [Friday, Saturday, Sunday] by 11 p.m., ... until 6 a.m.[,] unless approved in advance by the probation officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. When imposing the curfew, the court noted that \u201cI don\u2019t [impose a curfew] very often, particularly for a person who will be around 40 years old by the time of release, but, again, I think it\u2019s an important element and tool to promote public safety in the case of Mr. Whitfield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40^41. Neither the Government\u2019s nor Whitfield\u2019s sentencing memorandum addressed the need for a curfew. Appellant Br. at 5; <em>See also </em>R.30, Sentencing Memorandum by USA; R. 31, Sentencing Memorandum by Whitfield. The Presentencing Report, which recommended the statutory maximum sentence of 120 months, was also silent on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">After discussing the sentence and the special condition, the district court asked the government and defense counsel if they had any \u201clegal objections\u201d to the sentence. R.44, Sentencing Tr. at 41. To this, defense counsel replied: \u201cNone. General.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">On appeal, Whitfield argues that the district court abused its discretion when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>imposed a curfew upon Whitfield as a special condition of his supervised release. Imposition of the curfew, however, was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Plain-error review applies because Whitfield did not clearly articulate to the district court his objection to the curfew. <em>United States v. Kingsley, </em>241 F.3d 828, 835 (6th Cir.2001). In response to the district court\u2019s inquiry as to whether either party had \u201clegal objections\u201d to the sentence, defense counsel vaguely replied, \u201cNone. General.\u201d R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 41. This response was of such a \u201chigh-degree of generality\u201d that the district court was unable to respond to or note the objection, <em>See United States v. Simmons, </em>587 F.3d 348, 357 (6th Cir.2009), and thus we will review the curfew under the heightened plain-error standard. <em>Kingsley, </em>241 F.3d at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show: (1) an error; (2) that was \u201cobvious or clear\u201d; (3) that \u201caffected defendant\u2019s substantial rights\u201d; and (4) that \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). In this case there was no error, and in any case no error that affected defendant\u2019s substantial rights or seriously affected the fairness of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The district court did not commit a procedural error at sentencing. The curfew imposed was procedurally proper because the district court stated its rationale for imposing this special condition in open court. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>463 F.3d 526, 529 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Kingsley, </em>241 F.3d at 836 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)). During sentencing, the district court stated that the curfew is \u201can important element and tool to promote public safety in the case of Mr. Whitfield.\u201d R.44, Sentencing Tr. at 40-41. By mentioning \u201cthe case of Mr. Whitfield,\u201d the district court effectively referred to its lengthy discussion of Whitfield\u2019s criminal history, <em>id. </em>at 31-32, 35, 37, 39, which supported the district court\u2019s concern for public safety, and more explanation than this brief rationale was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The brevity of the rationale provided at sentencing also did not affect Whitfield\u2019s substantial rights and did not affect the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings. Although the district only briefly discussed its rationale for imposing the curfew, the district court repeatedly expressed its concern for public safety throughout the sentencing hearing, <em>id. </em>at 31, 39, 41, in light of Whitfield\u2019s extensive criminal record and history of recidivism. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 37. With these concerns, it was reasonable for the district court to impose a curfew in an effort to hinder Whitfield\u2019s opportunities to participate in further criminal activity, aiding his own rehabilitation and enhancing public safety. A district court\u2019s failure to explain its reasons for imposing a special condition amounts to harmless error if the reasons are clear from the record, <em>Carter, </em>463 F.3d at 529 n. 2, and \u201cthe subject special condition is related to the dual major purposes of probation, namely rehabilitation of the offender and enhancement of public safety.\u201d <em>United States v. Brogdon, </em>503 F.3d 555, 564 (6th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Berridge, </em>74 F.3d 113, 119 (6th Cir. 1996). Because the brief rationale provided sufficient reasoning for the curfew, Whitfield\u2019s substantial rights were not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">There was no plain error with respect to Whitfield\u2019s substantive challenge to the curfew because there was no error\u2014the condition is reasonable. The district court carefully considered and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as incorporated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>relevant factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense; Whitfield\u2019s history and characteristics; the need to provide adequate deterrence of future criminal conduct; the need to protect the public; the need to provide for Whitfield\u2019s rehabilitation; recognition of the applicable sentencing range; and consideration of any pertinent policy statements by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5). To the extent that the district court did not discuss the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), this omission did not sufficiently undermine the substantive reasonableness of the curfew under plain-error review. There was also no need to provide restitution to victims because there were none for this particular offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As a preliminary matter, the district court discussed Whitfield\u2019s sentencing range, based upon the applicable category of the offense committed and his applicable category as a defendant, and recognized that the sentencing range was limited by the statutory maximum. R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 9; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The factors considered by the district court were reasonably related to the imposition of the curfew. First, the curfew is reasonably related to the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d because the underlying conviction, as well as at least one other of Whitfield\u2019s felonies, occurred at night. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). In this instance, the police arrested him at 3 a.m., brandishing a gun with an obliterated serial number and frightening the residents of an apartment complex. R.46, Testimony of Wolbrink at 5; R.44, Sentencing Tr. at 35. In <em>Kingsley, </em>we held that a prohibition on operating all motor vehicles was reasonable, even though the underlying offense was for being a felon in possession of firearms, because \u201cthe vehicle\u2019s involvement ... materially contributed to [the offense\u2019s] overall nature.\u201d 241 F.3d at 838. Similarly, the fact that Whitfield\u2019s offense occurred at night contributed to its \u201coverall nature\u201d; for instance, it is arguably easier to brandish a weapon and threaten others with it during the middle of the night than in broad daylight.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Second, the curfew is also reasonably related to \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Considering Whitfield\u2019s recidivism, R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 37, and the fact that the events for the underlying conviction occurred just two weeks into his parole, <em>id. </em>at 33, it is understandable that the district court wanted to impose a condition in an attempt to limit any further criminal misconduct. It was also reasonable for the district court to consider Whitfield\u2019s long criminal history, including six juvenile convictions and three felonies as an adult, <em>id. </em>at 32, when determining that a curfew would be necessary to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Though the district court did not explicitly relate Whitfield\u2019s curfew to the need to provide adequate deterrence of future criminal conduct and to provide for Whitfield\u2019s rehabilitation, the district court considered these factors when determining the totality of Whitfield\u2019s sentence, which included the supervised release and any related special conditions. During sentencing, the district court noted the \u201cneed to provide rehabilitation\u201d to Whitfield, \u201cand the need to provide deterrence, both generally to ... the public who might be inclined to similar forms of misconduct but also to the person in front of the Court.\u201d R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 30-31. In light of these concerns, the district court could assume that a curfew that restricts Whit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>field\u2019s activities to the daytime could limit Whitfield\u2019s opportunities for recidivism, thus aiding his rehabilitation and protecting the public. In addition, a curfew could help deter others from brandishing a firearm in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Finally, the curfew is reasonable and consistent with the pertinent policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(e)(5). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). In this statement, the Sentencing Commission suggests that a curfew may be imposed \u201cif the court concludes that restricting the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours is necessary to protect the public.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(e)(5). As discussed above, the district court imposed the curfew largely because Whitfield\u2019s extensive criminal history and \u201clack of penitent\u201d behavior created a concern for the public. R.44, Sentencing Tr. at 40-41. Therefore, the curfew in this case is consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Other circuits have found curfews to be reasonable. In <em>United States v. Musso, </em>643 F.3d 566, 571 (7th Cir.2011), the Seventh Circuit held that a curfew was reasonable after Musso was convicted of possessing child pornography because the condition was aimed at \u201cpreventing contact offenses.\u201d In <em>United States v. Asalati, </em>615 F.3d 1001, 1008 (8th Cir.2010), the Eighth Circuit held that \u201cthe nature and extent of Asalati\u2019s prior crimes ... demonstrate a continued and escalating inability to operate within the confines of the law\u201d and justified the imposition of a curfew.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Ritter, </em>118 F.3d 502, 504 (6th Cir.1997), also indicates that a special condition should not unnecessarily deprive a defendant of his liberty. The curfew in this case involved no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to protect the public and encourage Whitfield\u2019s rehabilitation. When imposing the sentence, the district court specified that Whitfield\u2019s curfew could be modified if \u201capproved in advance by the probation officer.\u201d R. 44, Sentencing Tr. at 40. Thus, if Whitfield has a legitimate reason to be out at night, such as working an overnight shift, the condition is lenient enough to allow for modifications. In <em>Kingsley, </em>this court held that the prohibition on operating a motor vehicle was reasonable in part because Kingsley could apply to the district court for a modification if he were able to prove sufficient rehabilitation or that \u201cthe absolute motorist prohibition somehow render[ed] his participation in the court-ordered treatment programs impossible.\u201d 241 F.3d at 839; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(c). Similarly, the opportunity to modify the curfew prevents the curfew from unnecessarily depriving Whitfield of his liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of a curfew during Whitfield\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
