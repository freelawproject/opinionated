Brown moves for reconsideration of the court\u2019s previous rejection of his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">The Merit Systems Protection Board issued its final order on June 16, 2011. Mr. Brown received the order on June 19, 2011. Mr. Brown submitted a \u201cpetition for review\u201d with this court on August 11, 2011, via facsimile. Per Federal Circuit Rule 25, a petition for review may not be filed via facsimile. Accordingly, no appeal was docketed. On September 9, 2011, more than 60 days after the date he received the Board\u2019s final decision, Mr. Brown filed his petition for review with the court via United States mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">Our review of a Board decision or order is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1), which provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review must be filed within 60 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision of the board.\u201d This filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir.1984); <em>see also Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">Because Mr. Brown\u2019s petition was not received within 60 days of the date he received the Board\u2019s decision, we must dismiss his petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b896-21\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b896-22\">(1) Mr. Brown\u2019s motion for reconsideration is denied, and his petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">(2) All sides shall bear their own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
