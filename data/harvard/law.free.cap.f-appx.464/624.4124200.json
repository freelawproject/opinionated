Sanchez concedes that conviction under Oregon Revised Statutes section 163.165(l)(e) \u201cdoes require an intent to injure, and that injury be caused,\u201d but he claims that \u201ceven intentional injury[] can be caused without the use of force.\u201d Categorical analysis \u201crequires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>627 F.3d 1281, 1287 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007)). Sanchez has not \u201cpoint[ed] to ... cases in which the state courts in fact did apply [section 163.165(l)(e) ] in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815), and we have found none. Indeed, in construing section 163.165(l)(a), the Oregon Supreme Court has defined \u201ccauses\u201d to mean \u201cbrings about, makes, or effects <em>by force,\u201d State v. Murray, </em>343 Or. 48, 162 P.3d 255, 257, 260 (2007) (emphasis added), and we see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>reason to define the word differently in section 163.165(l)(e). Therefore, we find \u201cno realistic probability that a person could be convicted of violating [section 163.165(l)(e) ] without having\u201d used force. <em>Lawrence, </em>627 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Because section 163.165(l)(e) sets out \u201ca felony ... that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person ... of another may be used\u201d in committing the offense, Sanchez\u2019s conviction under that provision qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). He is therefore removable as an aggravated felon, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and ineligible for cancellation of removal and asylum, <em>see Rendon v. Mukasey, 520 F.3d </em>967, 973 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">2. An applicant for withholding of removal is eligible only if he fears persecution \u201con account of one of the five protected grounds,\u201d which include \u201cmembership in a particular social group, [and] political opinion.\u201d <em>Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, 563 </em>F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2009). Sanchez\u2019s proposed group of \u201cyoung men who are deported to El Salvador [and] may be perceived as ... gang member[s] because of their tattoos\u201d is not a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 945-46 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Castellano-Chacon v. INS, </em>341 F.3d 533, 549 (6th Cir.2003). Sanchez\u2019s other proposed group, \u201cthose who have been actively recruited by gangs, but ... refused to join because they oppose the gangs,\u201d fares no better. <em>See Ramos-Lopez, </em>563 F.3d at 860; <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-46 (9th Cir.2008). And \u201cresistance to a gang\u2019s recruitment efforts\u201d does not, without more, constitute a political opinion. <em>Santos-Lemus, </em>542 F.3d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">3. An applicant for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture must prove that \u201cit is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Cole v. Holder, </em>659 F.3d 762, 762-64, 770 (9th Cir.2011) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). The Board of Immigration Appeals found that Sanchez failed to carry this burden, and we must uphold the Board\u2019s determination \u201cunless the evidence in the record compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Harvard Law School study cited by Sanchez doesn\u2019t come close to meeting this standard. Nor is it \u201chighly probative or potentially dispositive evidence\u201d that the immigration judge was required to discuss in his written decision. <em>Id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
