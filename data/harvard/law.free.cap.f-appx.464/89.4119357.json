Counsel for Nesbitt filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in denying Nesbitt\u2019s motions to dismiss and for a Franks<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> hearing. Nesbitt filed a pro se supplemental brief, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motions to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and for a <em>Franks </em>hearing and in permitting the Government to use visual aids during its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Upon review of the record, we directed supplemental briefing on the issues of whether the district court erred in denying Nesbitt\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and whether the district court abused its discretion in failing to adequately explain the sentence imposed. We now affirm Nesbitt\u2019s convictions, but we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings in its ruling on a motion to dismiss for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Kellam, </em>568 F.3d 125, 132 (4th Cir.2009). The Speedy Trial Act requires that a defendant\u2019s trial \u201ccommence within seventy days from the filing date ... of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1) (2006). The Act provides for several ex-cludable delays, including those resulting from the grant of a continuance where the district court finds that \u201cthe ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial\u201d; trial on other charges; and the filing of pretrial motions. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(B), (D), (7)(A) (West Supp.2011). If the defendant\u2019s trial does not begin within seventy days and the delay is not excludable, the district court \u201cshall\u201d dismiss the indictment with or without prejudice on motion of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>538 F.3d 300, 304 (4th Cir.2008). The defendant bears the burden of proving a Speedy Trial Act violation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162(a)(2); <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>656 F.3d 630, 633 (7th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>-S.Ct. - (U.S. Nov. 29, 2011) (No. 11-7625).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">We conclude that Nesbitt has not carried his burden of establishing a Speedy Trial Act violation. The Speedy Trial clock began running when Nesbitt appeared before a magistrate judge for arraignment on April 8, 2009. The following day, Nesbitt filed motions for disclosure of intent to use evidence of other crimes, for leave to file additional motions, and for discovery, thereby tolling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>clock. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(D). Nesbitt has not produced any evidence that these motions were disposed of prior to November 10, 2009, when he filed his motion to suppress, or at anytime thereafter. Therefore, we hold that Nesbitt has not carried his burden of showing that any time ran on the clock between his pretrial filings on April 9, 2009, and the beginning of jury selection on August 10, 2010. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Nesbitt\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We review de novo the legal determinations underlying a district court\u2019s denial of a <em>Franks </em>hearing and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>631 F.3d 164, 171 (4th Cir.2011). In order to obtain a <em>Franks </em>hearing to attack a facially sufficient warrant affidavit, a defendant must make a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement critical to a finding of probable cause was included in the warrant affidavit knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth. <em>See Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674; <em>United States v. Clenney, </em>631 F.3d 658, 663 (4th Cir.2011). \u201cThis showing must be more than conelusory and should include affidavits or other evidence to overcome the presumption of the warrant\u2019s validity.\u201d <em>Clenney, </em>631 F.3d at 663 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Nesbitt did not make a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant lied or omitted information with reckless disregard for the truth. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Nesbitt\u2019s motion for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 45, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578-79 (4th Cir.2010) (abuse of discretion standard of review applicable when defendant properly preserves a claim of sentencing error in district court \u201c[b]y drawing arguments from [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 [ (2006) ] for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed\u201d). We must begin by reviewing the sentence for significant procedural error, including such errors as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court \u2018must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586). Accordingly, a sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the particular facts presented and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons that support its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The court\u2019s explanation need not be exhaustive; it must be \u201csufficient \u2018to satisfy the appellate court that the district court has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">When, as here, the district court imposes a within-Guidelines sentence, the district court may \u201cprovide a less extensive, while still individualized, explanation.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 639 (4th Cir.2009). That explanation, however, must be sufficient to allow for \u201cmean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ingful appellate review\u201d such that we need \u201cnot guess at the district court\u2019s rationale.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 329-30 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We conclude that the district court erred in failing to provide an adequate explanation for its chosen sentence. During sentencing, the court merely stated that it \u201ccalculated and considered the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and the relevant statutory sentencing factors contained in 18 United States Code 3553(a).\u201d The district court chose not to accept either party\u2019s suggested sentence, instead sentencing in the middle of the Guidelines range, but it provided very little indication that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decisionmaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The Government argues that any error was harmless. When this court concludes that the district court committed a procedural error in sentencing, \u201cthe government may avoid reversal only if it demonstrates that the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the result and we can say with fair assurance that the district court\u2019s explicit consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments would not have affected the sentenced imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 838 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, because Nesbitt requested a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range based on his age and health and the district court imposed a different sentence without any indication that it had considered Nesbitt\u2019s argument, the Government\u2019s conclusory argument is insufficient to establish harmless error. Therefore, we must vacate Nesbitt\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed Nesbitt\u2019s pro se claims and the record in this case and find that there are no other meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm the convictions, vacate Nesbitt\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing. We deny Nesbitt\u2019s motion to consolidate briefs or terminate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">This court requires that counsel inform Nesbitt in writing of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Nesbitt requests that such petition be filed, but counsel believes that the petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Nesbitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\"> <em>Franks v.
