Counsel for Peralte, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, 386 </em>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), filed an <em>Anders </em>brief explaining in detail that there are no non-frivolous issues on appeal. Counsel has additionally filed a motion with this Court seeking leave to withdraw. Peralte did not file a response to Counsel\u2019s brief and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">For the reasons discussed below, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-19\">We write principally for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">On July 28, 2010, Peralte was arrested by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration. A two-count federal indictment followed. Count 1 charged Peralte with distribution and possession with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Count 2 charged Peralte with illegal reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), as well as 6 U.S.C. \u00a7 202(3)-(4), and \u00a7 557. On November 5, 2010, pursuant to a plea agreement, Peralte pled guilty to both counts. Paragraph 22 of the plea agreement specified that Peralte waived his \u201cright to appeal any conviction and sentence ... on any and all grounds set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742] or any other grounds, constitutional or non-constitution-alt.]\u201d The waiver provision also precluded his right to collateral appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>At sentencing on May 3, 2011, the District Court identified the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range as 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court denied Peralte\u2019s motion for a downward \u201csafety valve\u201d adjustment based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, but granted a variance to eliminate any sentencing disparity that might have been caused by the lack of a \u201cfast-track program\u201d that is sometimes available in immigration cases. As a result, Peralte was sentenced to serve concurrent sentences of 51 months on Count 1 and 24 months on Count 2. He timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>counsel may seek to withdraw representation if, after reviewing the District Court\u2019s record, he or she is \u201cpersuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit.\u201d 3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2(a); <em>see United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cThird Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a) reflects the guidelines the Supreme Court promulgated in <em>Anders </em>.... \u201d). We exercise plenary review in determining whether any non-frivolous arguments remain. <em>See Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-84 &amp; n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). To grant counsel\u2019s request, we must be satisfied that counsel \u201chas thoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues and ... explained] why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>575 F.3d 316, 319 (3d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our \u201cinquiry when counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief is thus twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the ... requirements [of 3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2(a) ]; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 300 (citation omitted). If we determine that \u201cthe Anders brief initially appears adequate on its face,\u201d the second step of our inquiry is \u201cguided ... by the <em>Anders </em>brief itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Counsel for Peralte identified three potential issues for appeal: (1) the District Court\u2019s denial of a two-level safety valve adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5); (2) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Peralte\u2019s plea of guilty on both charges; and (3) the validity of Peralte\u2019s appellate waiver. Counsel ultimately concluded that each issue is frivolous, and our independent review leads us to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The third issue is dispositive; if Peralte\u2019s appellate waiver is valid, then he has waived his right to appeal on \u201cany\u201d grounds, including the sentencing and sufficiency of the evidence issues. The seminal ease governing appellate waivers in this Court is <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557 (3d Cir.2001). Under <em>Khattak, </em>appellate waivers are valid \u201cif entered into knowingly and voluntarily, unless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558. Even \u201cthe most basic rights of criminal defendants are ... subject to waiver.\u201d <em>Peretz v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 923, 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808 (1991); <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 561. Pursuant to his plea agreement, Peralte comprehensively waived his rights, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to a direct or collateral appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">To determine whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary, we \u201clook to the colloquy between the sentencing judge and [the defendant,]\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>558 F.3d 270, 284 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 204 (3d Cir.2007)), and examine whether the sentencing judge complied with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 243 (3d Cir.2008). Rule 11 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">\u201cBefore the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the defendant may be placed under oath, and the court must address the defendant personally in open court. During this address, the court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands ... the terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 11(b)(1). Additionally, the court \u201cmust address the defendant personally in open court and determine that the plea is voluntary and did not result from force, threats, or promises (other than promises in the plea agreement).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">In the case at bar, the sentencing judge complied with the requirements of Rule 11. Through the aid of an interpreter, the District Court found that Peralte understood the effects of the plea agreement and appellate waiver and voluntarily pled guilty. Based on the record, we find that the District Court\u2019s colloquy was thorough and proper, and agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that Peralte\u2019s appellate waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See Jackson, </em>523 F.3d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Furthermore, nothing in the record indicates that enforcing the appellate waiver in this case would constitute a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 558. Peralte\u2019s situation simply does not present the type of \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d which could amount to a miscarriage of justice, such as \u201cif the sentence was ... imposed in excess of the maximum penalty provided by law or ... based on a constitutionally impermissible factor such as race.\u201d <em>Khattak, </em>273 F.3d at 562 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Additionally, pursuant to Third Circuit Local Appellate Rule 109.2(b), we certify that the present appeal \u201claek[s] legal merit for purposes of counsel filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
