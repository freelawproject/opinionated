Thaler, </em>No. 10-20732, slip op. (5th Cir. May 16, 2011). Emerson, however, has not briefed the issue on which COA was granted, <em>i.e., </em>whether, under <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383-84, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), his prior pleading should count for purposes of the successive-authorization requirement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">Contrary to Emerson\u2019s assertion in his reply brief, this court did not hold that <em>Castro </em>is applicable to his case. <em>See Emerson, </em>No. 10-20732, slip op. at 2. We stated that it is <em>arguable </em>that <em>Castro </em>is applicable. <em>See id. </em>Emerson makes no argument that <em>Castro </em>is applicable, that he was not warned <em>of </em>the consequences of the recharacterization of his 2007 pleading as a \u00a7 2254 petition, or that, because <em>Castro </em>is applicable and he was not warned, the recharacterization does not count as a pri- or petition for successive-authorization purposes. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Because Emerson has failed to brief the sole issue on which a COA was granted, he has waived that issue, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>judgment is AFFIRMED. Emerson\u2019s motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
