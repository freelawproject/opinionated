Leyja purchased six firearms on behalf of a codefendant, Osbel Grimaldo, who fronted the money for the transactions. Leyja also accompanied another codefendant, Roberto Ramon, who purchased 10 firearms on behalf of Grimaldo. Leyja and Ramon transferred the 16 firearms to Grimaldo, who intended to export the weapons to members of a Mexican drug cartel. Leyja admitted that he assumed the weapons would be exported to Mexico. He challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he was not a minor participant in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The district court held Leyja accountable for the six firearms he purchased and the 10 firearms purchased by Ramon. The court also held him accountable for trafficking the firearms because they were transferred to Grimaldo with the assumption that they would be exported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">Leyja\u2019s role with respect to the conduct for which he was accountable was only slightly less than that of Ramon. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). Without Leyja, nearly half of the weapons would not have been available for export. He was not \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than Ramon, and his role was not peripheral. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). We find no clear error. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
