The district court sentenced Slade to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence resulting from the court granting an upward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3(a), p.s., from his advisory Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Slade challenges this sentence, arguing that it is unreasonable because the district court failed to specify in writing the reasons why it imposed the upward departure. Slade also challenges both the reasonableness of the court\u2019s decision to depart above his advisory Guidelines range and the reasonableness of the extent of the departure. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">As we have explained, \u201cno matter what provides the basis for a deviation from the Guidelines range[,] we review the resulting sentence only for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 164 (4th Cir.2008). In doing so, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In assessing a sentencing court\u2019s decision to depart from a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, this court considers \u201cwhether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hemandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007). We will find a sentence to be unreasonable if the sentencing court \u201cprovides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in imposing a sentence outside the properly calculated advisory sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Slade first argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to specify in writing the reasons why it imposed the upward departure, in accordance with USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(l), p. s. We conclude, however, that any error by the district court in this respect is harmless. The district court orally explained its considered reasons for imposing the upward departure and nothing in the record indicates that, but for the court\u2019s failure to reduce these reasons to writing, Slade would have received a lesser sentence. Accordingly, this contention affords Slade no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Next, Slade argues that a sentence within the pre-departure Guidelines range would have been sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing and the court thus abused its discretion in departing upwardly from that range. We conclude that the district court acted reasonably in imposing the upward departure. The court utilized USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a), p.s., to increase Slade\u2019s criminal history from Category V to VI. Pursuant to this provision, a district court may depart upward from an applicable Guidelines range if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), p.s. To determine whether a departure is appropriate in such circumstances, the court may consider, among other factors, prior sentences not used in computing the defendant\u2019s criminal history category and prior, similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in conviction. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A), (E), p.s. Slade\u2019s multiple unscored convictions not included in his criminal history calculation and lengthy criminal history replete with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>recidivism qualify as bases for departure under this provision. The district court further concluded that Slade\u2019s conduct warranted a Category VI criminal history. We discern no abuse of discretion in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Slade also argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding that such an extensive departure was warranted in this case. However, we conclude after review of the record that the court\u2019s sentencing decision is reasonable in light of Slade\u2019s long history of recidivism, which reflects his disrespect for the law, and the need for the sentence to protect the public and to deter Slade. The court\u2019s consideration of relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and articulation of its reasons for departing from the Guidelines range support our decision to defer to the district court\u2019s determination as to the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 366-67 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2946, 180 L.Ed.2d 236 (2011) (affirming substantive reasonableness of variance sentence six years greater than the Guidelines range because it was based on the district court\u2019s thoughtful examination of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s amended judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">. We previously vacated the district court's imposition of a 365-month sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Slade, </em>631 F.3d 185, 192 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -\u2022, 131 S.Ct. 2943, 180 L.Ed.2d 234 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-11\">. Slade contends that the district court failed to \"acknowledge\u201d and \"properly consider\u201d his conduct and behavior in prison. We conclude that this contention is without merit. The record makes clear that the district court fully considered Slade\u2019s conduct and behavior in prison in deciding whether to impose a departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
