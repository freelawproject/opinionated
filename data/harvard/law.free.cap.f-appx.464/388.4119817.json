Stern, Mississippi prisoner # 130001, appeals the judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit. We deny Stern\u2019s motion for oral argument, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(C), and affirm the judgment. Also, because the record is sufficient to address Stern\u2019s arguments, we deny his request for a transcript of the March 17, 2010 pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-23\">Stern filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 lawsuit against numerous named and unnamed defendants. The named defendants included, among others, the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), MDOC Commissioner Christopher Epps, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, Deputy Attorney General Myrick Jackson, Deputy Attorney General Grant Hedgepeth, and Hinds County Circuit Clerk Barbara <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Dunn. In his complaint, Stern stated that these named defendants were being sued in their \u201cofficial and supervisory\u201d capacities. Stern alleged, among other claims, (1) that he had been injured by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in an MDOC facility; (2) that the withdrawal of funds from his and other prisoners\u2019 accounts for purchases they did not make constituted fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering; (3) that Hood, Jackson, and Hedgepeth committed perjury and obstruction of justice in Stern\u2019s criminal case; and (4) that Dunn had refused to file a court document and to provide him with copies of court documents. He alleged that his personal injuries consisted of migraine headaches, throat pain, chest pain, eye pain, lack of sleep, heart problems, and emphysema.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In subsequent pleadings, Stern alleged that a prison barber cut him with clippers during an unsanitary haircut, causing Stern to bleed and exposing him to AIDS, hepatitis, and other infections, and that he contracted an \u201cinfectious disease from haircuts while housed at a facility of MDOC.\u201d He sought $1 million in actual damages for his \u201cpersonal injury claim,\u201d $10 million for pain and suffering, $20 million in punitive damages, injunctive relief, and \u201call percentages as described under the Whistle Blower law\u201d for his allegations regarding fraud, money laundering, and embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The district court found that the State of Mississippi and its agencies are not persons within the meaning of \u00a7 1983 and dismissed Stern\u2019s claims against the MDOC and other state agencies accordingly. The district court also dismissed the claims against Hood, Jackson, and Hedgepeth, ruling that judicial officers, including prosecutors, \u201care entitled to absolute immunity for claims for damages arising out of acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions\u201d and that witnesses \u201care entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability.\u201d Order at 3, <em>Stern v. Epps, </em>No. 2:08cv33-KS-MTP (S.D.Miss. Aug. 19, 2008) (citations omitted). The district court found that Stern\u2019s claim against Dunn was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) The district court construed Stern\u2019s whistleblower claims under the federal Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), and dismissed the claims on the basis that Stern was not an employee of a government agency. Ultimately, the district court dismissed all of the remaining counts, save Stern\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against Epps regarding exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. After a trial on this remaining claim, a jury found for Epps. The district court denied Stern\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial. Stern timely filed a notice of appeal, and the district court granted him leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">On appeal, Stern raises a number of challenges, none of which succeeds. We discuss each of Stern\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">First, although Stern contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the Mississippi Attorney General, Stern\u2019s allegations in a civil lawsuit for damages did not charge the Attorney General and other public officials with a crime within the meaning of Mississippi Code \u00a7 97-11-3. A similar phrase\u2014 \u201ccharges another with a crime\u201d\u2014appears in Mississippi Code \u00a7 99-1-11 and has been interpreted to refer to criminal prosecutions. <em>See Town of Lumberton v. Peyton, </em>143 Miss. 777, 109 So. 740, 740 (1926) (construing Miss.Code \u00a7 965 (1906) (recodified at \u00a7 99-1-11)). In addition, Mississippi law grants the Attorney General \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>sole power\u201d to defend a lawsuit of statewide interest \u201con behalf of a state agency,\u201d Miss.Code \u00a7 7-5-1, and requires him to defend the State and public officials in civil lawsuits, Miss.Code \u00a7 7-5-39. The federal statutes cited by Stern\u201442 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997a and \u00a7 1997c\u2014are inapposite. Moreover, Stern was not a client of the Mississippi Attorney General, <em>see Baker Donelson Bearman Caldwell &amp; Berkowitz, P.C. v. Seay, </em>42 So.3d 474, 485 (Miss.2010), and he fails to show that the Attorney General\u2019s representation constituted a conflict of interest or presented any other ground for disqualification. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See FDIC v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>50 F.3d 1304,1311 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Second, notwithstanding Stern\u2019s argument to the contrary, the district court properly dismissed the claims against Attorney General Jim Hood and Deputy Attorneys General Myrick Jackson and Grant Hedgepeth for perjury and obstruction of justice in his state criminal trial on the ground that these defendants were entitled to absolute immunity as judicial officers and as witnesses. <em>See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, </em>509 U.S. 259, 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993). Stern also argues that these defendants committed perjury, obstruction of justice, and \u201caltering [of] records\u201d in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus proceeding, but he did not raise this claim in the district court. We will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In addition, the district court properly dismissed Stern\u2019s claim that Hinds County Circuit Clerk Barbara Dunn\u2019s actions caused him to enter a guilty plea \u201cby force.\u201d To the extent that Stern seeks damages, his claim is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, because it necessarily implies the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. To the extent that he is seeking release from confinement, his claim is in the nature of a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus proceeding. <em>See Cook v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice Transitional Planning Dep\u2019t, </em>37 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1994). However, he has already sought \u00a7 2254 relief in a separate proceeding, and the district court dismissed that case. <em>Stern v. State, </em>No. 3:09-CV-335 (S.D.Miss. Mar. 31, 2010). Stern has not moved for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2254 application as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Third, Stern challenges the dismissal of his whistleblower claims. In his complaint, Stern did not state whether he sought relief under the federal Whistle-blower Protection Act (WPA), Mississippi\u2019s whistleblower laws, or both. The district court construed Stern\u2019s whistleblower claim as seeking relief under the federal act, and Stern does not dispute that ruling. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Therefore, Stern has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s construction of his whistle-blower claim. <em>See id. </em>The court properly denied the claim because Stern was not an employee of the federal government covered by the WPA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2105, 2302(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Fourth, Stern challenges the denial of his motion to name additional defendants. The district court found that he sought to vindicate his rights only under various state statutes\u2014rights that are not protected by \u00a7 1983. <em>See Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir.2005). Stern does not dispute that finding on appeal. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>requested amendments were futile, and the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying Stern\u2019s motion. <em>See Wright v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>415 F.3d 384, 391 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Fifth, Stern argues that the district court erred in dismissing his unsanitary haircut claim under 28 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). He argues that the barbering practices in Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) facilities do not comply with the various state laws and regulations. \u201cHowever, a violation of a state statute alone is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because \u00a7 1983 is only a remedy for violations of federal statutory and constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Woodard, </em>419 F.3d at 353. Although Stern asserts that the MDOC barbering methods are \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d he does not brief any argument or cite any authorities (other than Mississippi statutes) in support of this conclusory assertion, and he does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 conduct was at most negligent and did not amount to a constitutional violation. He has abandoned this issue. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584. Stern\u2019s discussion of his barbering claims includes new allegations of discrimination that we will not consider for the first time on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass, </em>200 F.3d at 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In addition, Stern challenges the \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal of his claims against MDOC Commissioner Christopher Epps for fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering based on improper charges to Stern\u2019s prisoner account for pants that he did not purchase. He has abandoned any challenge to the dismissal of similar claims against the companies that operated the prison commissary by failing to contest it. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584. As for his claim against Epps, the dismissal was proper. Embezzlement and money laundering are crimes under Mississippi law, not private causes of action. <em>See </em>Miss. Code \u00a7\u00a7 97-23-19 (embezzlement), 97-23-101 (money laundering). Stern did not state a claim for fraud because he did not allege that he suffered any harm as a consequence of his reliance on a false representation. <em>See State v. Bayer Corp., </em>32 So.3d 496, 501 (Miss.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Stern contends that for Epps to \u201cdeprive him of his money rises to a constitutional level.\u201d To plead a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983, \u201cthe plaintiff must allege that some person has deprived him of a federal right\u201d and \u201cthat the person who has deprived him of that right acted under color of state or territorial law.\u201d <em>Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980). Stern failed to state a claim for relief because he did not allege that Epps was personally involved in the money being improperly deducted from his prisoner account. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (explaining that facts that are \u201cmerely consistent with\u201d a defendant\u2019s liability fail to state a claim for relief (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>see also Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 742 (5th Cir. 2002) (explaining that \u00a7 1983 does not create supervisory or respondeat superior liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Sixth, the MJ did not err in limiting discovery in Stern\u2019s case. <em>See Wilson v. Barrientos, </em>926 F.2d 480, 482-83 (5th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Seventh, Stern contends that the district court violated his rights by instructing the jury at his trial on his environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) claim to consider whether Epps was liable in his personal capacity instead of his official ca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>parity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Eleventh Amendment bars official-capacity claims for money damages against such prison officials. <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d at 742. Also, \u00a7 1983 \u201cdoes not create supervisory or respondeat superior liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, if the district court had not construed the ETS claim as it did, the claim would not have gone to trial in the first place. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 61 (harmless error rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Eighth, with respect to Stern\u2019s challenge to a pretrial order entered without his consent, any error was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Finally, Stern contends that someone illegally recorded phone calls with his \u201cadvisory attorney\u201d when Stern called him from jail. He did not raise this claim in the district court, and we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass, </em>200 F.3d at 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">By failing to brief any argument regarding other claims that he raised in the district court, Stern has abandoned them. <em>See Mapes, </em>541 F.3d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Having rejected all <em>o\u00ed </em>Stern\u2019s arguments, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">MOTION for oral argument DENIED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-11\">.
