Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-20\">The agency properly found Steele ineligible for cancellation of removal based upon his 1994 conviction for an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3); <em>Rendon v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 967, 976 (9th Cir.2008) (conviction for possession of marijuana for sale is categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B)); <em>see also Becker v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1000, 1002-04 (9th Cir.2007) (upholding retroactive application of the expanded \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition under Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 321,110 Stat. 3009 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-21\">The agency also properly found that Steele could not apply for both cancellation of removal and a waiver under former section 212(c). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(e)(6); <em>Becker, </em>473 F.3d at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review Steele\u2019s contentions that his conviction for violating Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 475 is not a crime involving moral turpitude under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and, alternatively, that it qualifies for the petty offense exception under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A.)(i)(II), because Steele failed to exhaust these contentions before the agency. <em>See Tall v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 1115, 1120 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
