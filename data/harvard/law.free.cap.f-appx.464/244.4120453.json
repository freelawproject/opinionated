This sentence was above the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range of 30 to 37 months but became the guidelines sentence because it was the statutory mandatory minimum in effect at the time of the offense. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). We affirm, and we deny Neal\u2019s motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">The district court rejected Neal\u2019s claim that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010(FSA), see Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, governed his sentence, finding the FSA inapplicable because Neal committed his offense before the FSA was enacted. Additionally, the court determined that a 60-month sentence was reasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">Neal committed his offense on May 7, 2010, and was sentenced on January 21, 2011. The FSA, which became effective in August 2010, amended the Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act by resetting the drug quantities required to trigger mandatory minimum sentences. Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a)(2), 124 Stat. 2372 (Aug. 3, 2010). The FSA amended \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) by increasing from 5 grams to 28 grams the amount of crack cocaine a defendant must possess before he is subject to a five-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(a)(2). In <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 214-15 (5th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 5, 2011) (11-8023) and <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 27, 2011) (11-8268), decided while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Neal\u2019s appeal was pending, we held that the penalties prescribed by the FSA do not apply to federal criminal sentencing for illegal conduct that preceded the FSA\u2019s enactment. Our precedent thus forecloses Neal\u2019s retroactivity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">As already noted, the district court selected Neal\u2019s sentence on the separate, alternative basis that it was warranted and reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a). We ordinarily review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), employing an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). That standard applies \u201cwhether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Neal\u2019s sentence\u2014which is outside the applicable guidelines range and not based on an allowed departure\u2014constitutes a non-Guidelines sentence under our precedent. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Although Neal refers to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, he does not contend that the district court failed to consider them; instead, he disagrees with the court\u2019s weighing of them. Neal\u2019s objection, therefore, is to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. It is questionable, however, whether he preserved that objection for full appellate review. <em>See United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir.1995). We pretermit the issue of what review standard applies to Neal\u2019s claim of unreasonableness, however, given that Neal cannot prevail on a claim of unreasonableness under any standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">As a substantive matter, a sentence need only be supported by the factors recited in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cA [variance] sentence unreasonably fails to reflect the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. As the record shows, the court explicitly relied on \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the upward variance. The court noted Neal\u2019s recidivism, specially remarking on the need to address the fact that Neal simply persisted in criminal conduct despite his previous incarceration in the state penitentiary. Because the district court\u2019s concerns were validly based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349. Moreover, even if we were to agree with Neal that a guidelines sentence would have been reasonable, that is \u201cinsufficient [reason] to justify reversal of the district courtf\u2019s]\u201d determination \u201cthat the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justified] the extent of the variance\u201d sentence imposed. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, we agree also with the district court\u2019s alternative reason for imposing the sentence it did. <em>See United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bueno, </em>585 F.3d 847, 850 n. 3 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
