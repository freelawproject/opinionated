He contends that he was prevented from filing a timely petition due to difficulty gaining access to his legal papers, being placed in isolation, and his transfer to a different prison facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Blach argues that due to extraordinary circumstances and his diligence to overcome those circumstances, he is entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Lakey v. Hickman, </em>633 F.3d 782, 784 (9th Cir.2011), <em>as amended. </em>But the ability to file other petitions for post-conviction relief during the AEDPA limitations period demonstrates that a petitioner also had the ability to file a federal habeas petition. <em>See Roberts v. Marshall, </em>627 F.3d 768, 773 (9th Cir.2010) (holding that the district court properly denied petitioner\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on equitable tolling where the petitioner filed several petitions for post-conviction relief containing the same arguments presented in his federal habeas petition). Blach was able to prepare a truncated twenty-four page state petition raising the same claims as his belated federal petition. The fact that Blach was able to file this post-conviction petition demonstrates the lack of extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Blach\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. \u201cTo obtain an evidentiary hearing in district court, a habeas petitioner must, in addition to showing diligence in state court, allege a colorable claim for relief.\u201d <em>West v. Ryan, </em>608 F.3d 477, 485 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). \u201cTo allege a colorable claim, he must allege facts that, if true, would entitle him to habeas relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cIf the record refutes the applicant\u2019s factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Because Blach\u2019s allegations that extraordinary circumstances precluded him from timely filing his habeas petition were not supported by the record, no evidentiary hearing was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
