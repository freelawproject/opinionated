For the following reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">Tracette House\u2019s employment with Interline Brands, Inc. (\u201cInterline\u201d), was terminated on April 14, 2008, after several absences and other violations of the company\u2019s attendance policy. On May 13, 2008, House filed a charge with the EEOC, alleging sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, and retaliation in connection with her employment at Interline. After receiving a right-to-sue letter, House filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas on January 20, 2010, naming Interline as the sole defendant, and asserting a violation of her rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. House\u2019s complaint alleges that two Interline employees made inappropriate sexual advances toward her, and that her refusal of those advances precipitated her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">On April 28, 2011, Interline moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion on June 27, 2011, first construing House\u2019s complaint as a claim for quid pro quo sexual harassment, and then holding that the record failed to support a prima facie case. House appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">\u201c \u2018This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>plying the same standards as the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Int\u2019l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mex. Corp., </em>665 F.3d 671, 679 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting <em>DePree v. Saunders, </em>588 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2009)). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a). The movant can satisfy this standard, after adequate time for discovery, by showing that an opponent \u201cfails to ... establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case ... on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The opponent must support its opposition to summary judgment by citing to materials in the record. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The district court based its summary judgment on House\u2019s failure to cite any record evidence supporting a prima facie case for quid pro quo sexual harassment and Interline\u2019s citations to record evidence negating the same. A prima facie case for Title VII quid pro quo sexual harassment requires five elements: (1) the employee belongs to a protected group; (2) the employee is subjected to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment is based on sex; (4) the employee\u2019s refusal of the unwelcome harassment causes a tangible job detriment; and (5) there exists some ground to hold the employer liable. <em>Collins v. Baptist Mem\u2019l Geriatric Ctr., </em>937 F.2d 190, 195-96 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In opposing Interline\u2019s motion for summary judgment, House relied on the following summary judgment evidence: disciplinary reports and timesheets indicating that she and other Interline employees were frequently absent or tardy; a portion of her job application to Interline; e-mails among Interline employees indicating that House requested forms to file a grievance; her EEOC charge and other documents indicating an EEOC investigation; a portion of Interline\u2019s employee handbook; a brief text-message exchange between House and another Interline employee in which the employee inquired whether House was feeling okay following a car accident; forms from a doctor\u2019s office indicating that House received certain medical treatments in Spring 2008 because of car accident injuries; letters from Interline to House documenting her violations of the company\u2019s attendance policy and her discharge for that reason; and a document from a doctor\u2019s office indicating that House suffers from mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">This evidentiary showing, although extensive, has a glaring defect: it is not directed toward the elements of a prima facie case for sexual harassment. Instead, the evidence shows that House was chronically late or absent from work, that she filed a charge with the EEOC before bringing this lawsuit, and that she has medical complications, at least some of which stem from a car accident. House purported to summarize this evidence in a forty-seven point statement of facts attached to her opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Her statement of facts, however, is totally divorced from the facts established in the record and contains no citations to the record. House also created a six-page document that she contends is a bullet point summary of her own deposition. Similar to her statement of facts, however, this summary contains no citations to the deposition transci'ipt, and, when one compares it with the transcript, which Interline furnished, House\u2019s summary appears to be a total fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Interline, on the other hand, presented evidence in the form of affidavits and deposition testimony that House was not sexually harassed at all, that she was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>charged for violating Interline\u2019s attendance policy, and that she tried to persuade a former co-worker to lie during discovery. House\u2019s failure to successfully oppose this evidence, coupled with her inadvertent success in confirming most of it, means that there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Summary judgment is, therefore, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Summary judgment exists to \u201cdispose of factually unsupported claims.\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323-84, 106 S.Ct. 2548. In this instance, the district court correctly identified a lack of factual support, and the court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-14\">. House challenges the district court\u2019s judgment, but does not argue that the court\u2019s interpretation of her complaint was incorrect. Therefore, we will treat House\u2019s claim as one for quid pro quo sexual harassment, despite her frequent use of legal terminology relating to various other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
