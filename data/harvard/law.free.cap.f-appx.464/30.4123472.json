CARNEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b56-20\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-21\">John Markou appeals from a judgment of conviction of one count of Hobbs Act robbery, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and one count of use of a firearm in furtherance of that robbery, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). In his plea agreement, Markou waived the right to appeal his conviction or sentence unless the sentence exceeded 365 months. The court sentenced him to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-22\">During the plea colloquy, the court incorrectly recited that Markou waived his right to appeal in the event that it imposed a term of 365 months or <em>more. </em>However, \u201cinvalidation of a waiver of appeal [is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>required] in every case where the sentencing court\u2019s explanation of the waiver is not completely correct.\u201d <em>United States v. Chen, </em>127 F.3d 286, 289 (2d Cir.1997). Invalidation is unnecessary when \u201c \u2018the record clearly demonstrates that the waiver was both knowing (in the sense that the defendant fully understood the potential consequences of his waiver) and voluntary.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289-90 (quoting <em>United States v. Ready, </em>82 F.3d 551, 557 (2d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also United States v. Arevalo, </em>628 F.3d 93, 98 (2d Cir.2010) (\u201c[W]e find waivers unenforceable only in very limited situations, such as when the waiver was not made knowingly, voluntarily, and competently....\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). We infer that Markou understood the appeals waiver provision based on his statement that he had attended some college; his statements that he read the plea agreement carefully, understood it, and discussed it with counsel; and the fact that the court advised him of his right to appeal a sentence above 365 months, which Markou said he understood. Cf. <em>Chen, 127 </em>F.3d at 290 (\u201cIn the absence of some affirmative evidence from which appellant\u2019s knowledge and understanding of the waiver provision could reasonably be inferred ... the magistrate judge\u2019s error rendered the waiver ineffective.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the appeal waiver is valid. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
