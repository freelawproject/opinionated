On appeal, Bennett argues that (1) the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear his case because it was later discovered that an Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) who signed the indictment had had his bar license administratively suspended; (2) the Government committed a violation pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), in failing to inform him of the AUSA\u2019s bar status; and (3) the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-21\">Bennett first argues that the AUSA\u2019s signature on the indictment deprived the district court of jurisdiction. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>federal court is without jurisdiction in a criminal prosecution where the Government lacks an authorized representative. <em>See United States v. Providence Journal Co., </em>485 U.S. 693, 708,108 S.Ct. 1502, 1511, 99 L.Ed.2d 785 (1988). Further, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c) requires that an indictment \u201cbe signed by an attorney for the government.\u201d Here, the United States Attorney, an authorized representative of the Government, also signed the indictment. The unauthorized AUSA did not participate in any further proceedings. Accordingly, the errant signature was superfluous and therefore did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to hear Bennett\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Bennett also contends that the Government committed a <em>Brady </em>violation in failing to disclose the AUSA\u2019s bar status prior to the entry of Bennett\u2019s guilty plea. \u201cIn <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court announced that the Due Process Clause requires the government to disclose \u2018evidence favorable to an accused upon request ... where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Caro, </em>597 F.3d 608, 619 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194). To prevail on a <em>Brady </em>claim, a defendant must demonstrate that the evidence was exculpatory or impeaching in nature, was material to the defense, and was suppressed by the government either willfully or inadvertently. <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>591 F.3d 263, 285 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Here, as the district court found, the evidence suggested that the Government did provide defense counsel with accurate information regarding the AUSA\u2019s professional standing. Any failure by defense counsel to relay that information to Bennett personally is not attributable to the Government.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Moreover, the information was not exculpatory evidence material to either guilt or punishment. Accordingly, the Government did not commit a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Finally, Bennett challenges the reasonableness of his 102-month sentence on the grounds that the district court failed to provide an adequate explanation and erred in refusing to grant a departure greater than fifteen percent pursuant to the Government\u2019s substantial assistance motion under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2008). We review a sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578-79 (4th Cir.2010) (abuse of discretion standard of review applicable when defendant properly preserves a claim of sentencing error in the district court \u201c[b]y drawing arguments from [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 [ (2006) ] for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed\u201d). We begin by reviewing the sentence for significant procedural error, including such errors as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court \u2018must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>50, 128 S.Ct. 586 (emphasis omitted)). Accordingly, a sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the particular facts presented and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons that support its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The court\u2019s explanation need not be exhaustive; it must be \u201csufficient \u2018to satisfy the appellate court that the district court has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, 604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th </em>Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Here, the district court\u2019s explanation was adequate. Though it must provide an explanation for its decision, in departing below the statutory mandatory minimum pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, a court is permitted to consider only \u201cthe nature, extent, and significance of the defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>191 F.3d 488, 493 (4th Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Fennell, </em>592 F.3d 506, 509 (4th Cir.2010) (noting that, under \u00a7 5K1.1, sentencing judge has discretion to award reduction \u201cconsistent with the non-exclusive list of factors, all related to the nature and quality of a defendant\u2019s assistance.\u201d). The court\u2019s discussion with counsel reflected its consideration of Bennett\u2019s assistance and both parties\u2019 arguments regarding the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We further hold that the district court\u2019s fifteen percent departure was reasonable. In support of his request for a greater departure, Bennett presented only his 'own testimony and that of a police officer. The officer acknowledged that Bennett was cooperative, but stated that the information Bennett provided was not productive to his agency. In the absence of more extensive and reliable testimony, the district court did not err in granting the Government\u2019s request for a fifteen percent departure. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 cmt. n. 3 (\u201cSubstantial weight should be given to the government\u2019s evaluation of the extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.\u201d). Thus, we find Bennett\u2019s sentence to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> Bennett does not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; moreover, ineffective assistance of counsel does not appear conclusively from the record. <em>See United States v. Baptiste, </em>596 F.3d 214, 216 n. 1 (4th Cir. 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
