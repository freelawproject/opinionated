Consolidators, Inc. and I.T.N. of Miami, Inc. (collectively \u201cITN\u201d) appeal the summary judgment the district court entered in favor of Northern Marine Underwriters Ltd., individually and as agents for Lloyd\u2019s of London, Watkins Syndicate (WTK/457) (collectively \u201cNorthern\u201d), denying ITN\u2019s insurance claims. We find that genuine issues of material fact exist and therefore VACATE the summary judgment and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">ITN, freight forwarders, purchased an open cover policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) from Northern for coverage of marine cargo for the period from August 16, 2007, through August 14, 2008. The Policy Schedule provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-12\">PERIOD: To cover all transits where risk commences on or after 16th August, 2007 for a period of twelve calendar months ending 14th August, 2008 both days inclusive!)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-13\">SUBJECT-MATTER INSURED: All goods and / or merchandise of every description incidental to the business of the Assured or in connection therewith including duty if and as applicable. Duty sum insured should be separately shown and will be subject to conditions as per the Basis of Valuation Clause!)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">The Policy provided further still, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">Basis of Valuation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-18\">It is agreed that the basis of valuation for the purpose of this Open Cover shall be the value declared for insurance, but in no case shall the valuation exceed CIF [i.e., Cost, Insurance, and Freight] + 30% unless prior written consent of the Insurer is given. In the event of declaration after loss or arrival, the basis of valuation will be CIF + 10% only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">Claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-20\">11 11.1 In order to recover under this Insurance the Assured must have an assurable interest in the subject-matter insured at the time of the loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-21\">11.2 Subject to 11.1 above, the Assured shall be entitled to recover for insured losses occurring during the period covered by this Insurance, notwithstanding that the loss occurred before the contract of insurance was concluded, unless the Assured were aware of the loss and Underwriters were not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-22\">The declaration mentioned in the \u201cBasis of Valuation\u201d provision refers to the Certificate of Marine Cargo Insurance (the \u201cCOI\u201d), which ITN issues\u2014and thereupon pays a premium\u2014for each shipment. The COI outlines the particular risk of each shipment (e.g., cargo, value, destination)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and bears on its face the statement \u2018WAR<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>RANTED: NO KNOWN OR REPORTED LOSSES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">On or about October 22, 2007, ITN arranged for shipment of electronic goods belonging to Alfa Company, S.A. (\u201cAlfa\u201d) from Miami, Florida, to Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. On the afternoon of November 7, 2007, the truck carrying the cargo traveling to the Paraguay border was hijacked, and the cargo was lost. Alfa\u2019s president learned of the loss on the evening of November 7, 2007, and reported the loss to ITN\u2019s Vice President, Fadi Aftimos, the following morning. Aftimos spoke with insurance broker Edward Tafur, who, as the district court found, reported the loss to Northern on November 8, 2007. That same day, ITN generated a COI<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Northern\u2019s website. The parties dispute whether Northern knew of the loss prior to the issuance of the COI; the court, however, found that all parties were aware of the loss when ITN generated the COI.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">ITN submitted the COI to Northern, paid the designated premium, and submitted a claim for the loss. Northern denied coverage, so ITN brought this lawsuit. At some point after this suit was brought, Northern tendered a refund of the premium to ITN. ITN refused to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Northern argued that the COI was necessary to effect coverage under the Policy and that ITN\u2019s failure to issue a COI prior to the loss rendered the shipment uninsured. Northern also argued that it did <em>not </em>know about the loss before ITN issued the COL Given this fact, Northern denied coverage on three grounds: (1) the Policy language did not cover the loss; (2) ITN breached the \u201cNo Known or Reported Losses\u201d warranty; and (3) the <em>uberrimae </em>fidei<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> doctrine precluded coverage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ITN, for its part, argued that the COI was irrelevant to the existence of insurance coverage on any shipment under the open cover policy. Essentially, ITN argued, based on the Basis of Valuation clause cited <em>supra, </em>that the policy contemplated post-loss COIs and, therefore, coverage, notwithstanding the statement of \u201cNO KNOWN OR REPORTED LOSSES\u201d on the COI. ITN argued the COI was not a condition for coverage as the Policy provided inchoate coverage and that the issuance of the COI only operated to trigger valuation of the coverage and premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">The district court found that no relevant material facts were in dispute and that the outcome of the case depended on insurance contract interpretation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a question of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. ERA Oxford Realty Co. Greystone, LLC, </em>572 F.3d 893, 897 (11th Cir.2009). The court agreed with ITN that the Policy incorporated the COI neither expressly nor by reference. After discussing generally when coverage would attach in an open cover policy, the court concluded that the insurer\u2019s agreement to bear the risk would be \u201c \u2018inchoate and incomplete\u2019 until a declaration was made by the assured.\u201d <em>I.T.N. Consolidators, Inc. v. N. Marine Underwriters Ltd., </em>No. 09-20762-CIV-LENARD/GARBER, slip op. at 16 (S.D.Fla. Mar. 25, 2010) (quoting <em>Orient Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wright, </em>64 U.S. (23 How.) 401, 406, 16 L.Ed. 524 (I860)). Nevertheless, the court found that ITN\u2019s interpretation of the Policy, in which a COI could issue and trigger coverage after a loss, would undermine the notion of risk upon which the insurance industry is based, as well as the principle of <em>uberrimae fidei </em>The court reasoned that under ITN\u2019s reading of the open cover policy, ITN would be able to forgo the issuance of COIs and the payment of premiums for shipments that arrived safely but at the same time be permitted to issue COIs, pay the premium, and collect compensation for shipments when they were lost. The court found, \u201cWith the subject of insurance no longer in existence and the loss known to both parties, ITN\u2019s subsequently-issued Certificate was without consideration and void. Thus, at the time of the hijacking, ITN\u2019s shipment was not declared to [Northern], and, therefore, was not insured by the Policy.\u201d <em>I.T.N. Consolidators, </em>slip op. at 19 (citations omitted). Northern was accordingly entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The district court was correct in stating that the particular shipment at issue in this case was \u201cnot insured <em>by the Policy.\u201d I.T.N. Consolidators, Inc. v. N. Marine Underwriters Ltd., </em>No. 09-20762-CIVLENARD/GARBER, slip op. at 19 (S.D.Fla. Mar. 25, 2010) (emphasis added). The court erred, however, when it concluded that no coverage attached to ITN\u2019s cargo at the time of its loss because a COI could not issue after a loss. In short, the court failed to consider whether Northern and ITN had nevertheless contracted, outside the Policy\u2019s conditions for automatic coverage, to insure a mutually known loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">The district court\u2019s conclusion conflicts with the Policy\u2019s plain language. To illustrate this, we consider the mechanics of how a shipment comes to be insured under ITN\u2019s open cover policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In general, an open cover policy is a contract that sets out the terms that will govern future contracts; i.e., it is \u201cmerely a contract for insurance[,] and each time the underwriter agrees to accept a risk, a contract of insurance is formed in relation to that particular risk.\u201d Baris Soyer, <em>Warranties in Marine Insurance, </em>ch. 5.43, at 150-51 (2d ed.2006); <em>see also Greene v. Cheetham, </em>293 F.2d 933, 935 (2d Cir.1961) (\u201c[In a] typical open-cover polic[y] .... [t]he assured binds the insurer by issuing a certif\u00edcate of insurance for each specific shipment and inserting therein the valuation of the shipment, the name of the vessel, and the route for which coverage is to be had.\u201d). An open cover policy, therefore, \u201cis a prospective policy which requires notice from the insured to the insurer of the particulars concerning each shipment to be made so that they can be entered on the policy which is \u2018open to receive them,\u2019 and so that the premium can be fixed.\u201d 5 Saul Sorkin, <em>Goods in Transit </em>\u00a7 42.08[1] (footnote omitted) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">By initiating the exchange of a premium for a promise to insure a shipment, the COI thus itself reflects the insurance contract as to any <em>particular </em>shipment, as Northern illustrated in its motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">The [COI] subsequently written constitutes the contract or policy of insurance. The [COI] also contains the terms and conditions of coverage and incorporates into it all the terms and conditions of the insurance policy[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-8\">The open cover set[s] forth the voyages covered ..., the types of merchandise covered, the applicable rates, and the general terms of the conditions of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">The actual insurance on specific shipments was obtained by the issuance of individual certificates under the open cover.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">Def.\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J. 5-6 (quoting <em>Indus. Waxes, Inc. v. Brown, </em>258 F.2d 800, 801 (2d Cir.1958)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The plain terms of ITN\u2019s open cover policy, however, seem to require that the loss of a shipment be unknown when the COI is issued and the premium accepted in order for coverage to attach under any given COI. Per the \u201cClaims\u201d provision of ITN\u2019s policy, \u201c[ITN] must have an assurable interest in the subject-matter insured at the time of the loss\u201d to recover under the Policy. That provision also says, however, that \u201c[ITN] shall be entitled to recover for insured losses occurring during the period covered by this Insurance, notwithstanding that the loss occurred before the contract of insurance was concluded, unless [ITN] were aware of the loss and Underwriters were not.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such a case, the lost\u2014but nevertheless insured\u2014shipment would be valued at CIF + 10%, rather than up to CIF + 30%, pursuant to the policy\u2019s valuation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">So if a shipment were lost before a COI issued, automatic coverage under the policy would be possible\u2014it would simply depend on whether ITN knew about the loss before it issued the COI for the shipment. This requirement is consistent with the policy\u2019s reduced compensation level where a loss occurs before a COI issues; all a shipper needs do to avoid this reduction is issue a COI when the shipment departs for its destination. But the open cover policy leaves the door open for an alternate practice of issuing COIs on some regular basis, without regard to the specific timing of any one shipment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All that is required is that the shipper not <em>know </em>about a loss before any <em>particular </em>COI is issued. Else, the insurer is not required to automatically insure the lost shipment. It is thus logical that the COI would bear a warranty on its face that no known loss had occurred at the time of its issuance. That warranty does not contradict any part of the open cover policy, but rather serves to bring the shipment under the automatic coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">To summarize, based on the Policy\u2019s \u201cClaims\u201d provisions, and with specific terms that provide for different valuations for lost and arrived shipments, the plain language of the Policy provides that a COI could issue and coverage could attach after a loss. The district court\u2019s holding to the contrary was in error. Our determination that the holding was erroneous, however, does not fully resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">The loss here occurred before the COI issued; by reference to the \u201cClaims\u201d provisions in the Policy, there was thus no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>\u201cinsured loss[ ]\u201d at the time ITN generated its COI. <em>Both </em>ITN and Northern knew about the loss before the COI issued\u2014and, therefore, \u201cbefore the contract of insurance was concluded.\u201d As a result, the \u201cClaims\u201d provision\u2019s exception allowing for insurance after a loss does not apply. This is thus not a case contemplated by the exception and by the no-known-loss warranty on the COI, whereby a COI is issued for a shipment not known to be lost and coverage attaches\u2014per the Policy\u2019s Claims clause\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding that the loss occurred before the contract of insurance was concluded.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because all parties knew of the loss here, a misrepresentation that no known loss had occurred could not have led Northern to rely on that statement, and would in no way constitute a material misrepresentation in breach of <em>uberrimae fidei. </em>But even with this forthright exchange of information, the plain terms of the policy indicate that Northern was not required to insure this loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">That coverage did not automatically arise for this lost shipment is not to say that Northern could not have <em>voluntarily </em>contracted to insure the lost shipment. Northern, knowing of the loss, could have nonetheless billed ITN the premium called for by the COI as if no loss had occurred. The consideration exchanged might have been, for instance, the furtherance of Northern\u2019s relationship with ITN, or the encouragement of the practice ITN claims it followed: the invariable payment of premiums on every shipment. The question, then, becomes whether ITN and Northern contracted to insure the lost shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">In sum, the issue in this case is thus not whether the COI conflicts with the terms of the open cover policy. Notwithstanding the mechanism for automatic coverage for a not-lost shipment under the open cover policy, it is entirely possible for Northern to insure a shipment that was lost before the COI issued\u2014provided that both Northern and ITN knew about the loss before hand. ITN would inform Northern of the loss, then issue the COI and submit it along with the premium. If Northern wanted to insure the shipment, it would, at this point, accept the contract formed by the COI by keeping the premium payment. To be clear, Northern was not bound by the open cover policy to accept the risk because the contract would be <em>nudum pactum </em>if solely to insure an already-lost shipment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The post-loss COI\u2014and the retention of the premium paid on it\u2014would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>reflect instead a voluntary contractual agreement. Considering that both parties knew of the loss before the COI issued, any purported misrepresentation that no loss had occurred\u2014and therefore any <em>uberrimae fidei </em>argument\u2014would be irrelevant to the contract formation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Insurance coverage in this case, then, turns on whether Northern in fact agreed to insure the lost shipment. That question in turn depends on whether Northern accepted ITN\u2019s premium payment, thereby consummating the contract to insure the lost shipment. ITN claims it paid the premium at the time the COI issued, and that Northern initially kept the payment for some time. Apparently, Northern attempted to return the premium to ITN at some point after this litigation had commenced. Therefore, in addition to resolving the convoy-requirement issue it declined to address, the district court should determine whether Northern in fact accepted ITN\u2019s premium payment such that a contract to insure the lost shipment was formed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s summary judgment is VACATED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>and the case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-23\">. The open cover policy, in and of itself, does not mention the particularized risk of any given shipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. The COI described the date of shipment, its value, and the payee (Alfa), among other terms and conditions of insurance. The COI also contained the declaration \"NO KNOWN OR REPORTED LOSSES at November 8, 2007.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. <em>Uberrimae fidei </em>refers to the requirement of \"utmost good faith\u201d called for in marine insurance policies, whereby an insured must fully and voluntarily disclose to the insurer all facts material to calculating an insurance risk. \"A misrepresentation is material if \u2018it might have a bearing on the risk to be assumed by the insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>HIH Marine Servs., Inc. v. Fraser, </em>211 F.3d 1359, 1363 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Barlow, </em>983 F.Supp. 1376, 1380 (N.D.Fla.1997)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-14\">. These arguments are effectively three ways of saying the same thing: there is no coverage because the shipment was lost before the COI issued, and any COI that did issue notwithstanding the loss was a material misrepresentation that vitiated coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b816-15\">. Specifically, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-16\">Neither party disputes the existence of the Policy Wording, Policy Schedule, Special Projects Review, [Northern's] website or the Certificate. Similarly, the Parties do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>not dispute that the Certificate was issued by ITN on November 8, 2007, <em>after </em>it knew of the loss of the shipment. Consequently, the first question this Court must answer is whether the Certificate was part of the Policy and a declaration of value was necessary for coverage to exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">Should the Court answer the first question in the negative, the second issue the Court must decide is whether ITN\u2019s method of overland shipment from Santos, Brazil[,] to Ciudad de Este, Paraguay, violated the convoy condition of the Special Projects Review and thus voided coverage. Again, the Parties do not dispute the facts regarding the shipment and its subsequent hijacking. Without any remaining material questions of fact, both dispositive issues in the Patties' cross-motions for summary judgment are ripe for the Court\u2019s determination as matters of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-12\"><em>I.T.N.

The district court did not reach the issue relating to the convoy condition, stating, \u201cHaving found that no coverage attached to ITN\u2019s hijacked cargo at the time of its loss, the question of whether the convoy condition was satisfied is rendered moot and the Court declines to address it.\u201d <em>I.T.N.

ITN argued to the district court and to this court that the COI is separate from the Policy in the sense that the COI has no bearing on whether a particular shipment is insured. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. of Law in Opposition to Defs.'

The exception merely states that there can be coverage if (1) a \"contract of insurance\u201d\u2014i.e., a COI and a premium exchanged for a promise to insure\u2014commences, (2) a loss occurs, (3) ITN notifies Northern of the loss, and (4) Northern nonetheless accepts the premium for the shipment and insures it under the Policy, effectively \"conclud[ing]\u201d the \"contract of insurance.\" Under such circumstances, there is inevitably some point in time when an \"Assured [is] aware of [a] loss and Underwriters [are] not\u201d; the clause says nothing of the exchange of knowledge about a loss as related to the timing of a COI\u2019s issuance. The mechanics of the exception thus simply allow the possibility of issuing a COI after an <em>unknown </em>loss has occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\">. <em>See, e.g., St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v.

They may indeed have been intended as a declaration or even a promise that the loss would be treated as valued,\u2019 but as promises they were without consideration, the loss being already known.

The gist of Northern\u2019s <em>uberrimae fidei </em>argument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">Because federal maritime law is well-established with respect to an insured\u2019s duty to make a full and complete disclosure on a marine insurance application, the Court must use federal maritime law to resolve an underwriter's claim that an insured\u2019s material misrepresentation voids the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\"><em>Uberrimae fidei </em>requires parties to a maritime insurance contract to deal in utmost good faith. The insurance applicant must voluntarily and accurately disclose to the insurance company all facts which might have a bearing on the insurer\u2019s decision to accept or reject the risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">Thus, applying <em>uberrimae fidei, </em>a misrepresentation on the insurance application at issue, if material, would void the contract. Here, Plaintiff is seeking to obtain insurance after it knew of the loss. This attempt defies public policy and the law of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Appellees' Br. 21-23 (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Giroire, </em>27 F.Supp.2d 1306, 1311-12 (S.D.Fla. 1998); <em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Barlow, </em>983 F.Supp. 1376, 1379-80 (N.D.Fla.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This <em>ubeirimae fidei </em>argument is, in effect, simply a misrepresentation argument. There could have been no material misrepresentation in this case based on the district court\u2019s finding that Northern knew about the loss before the COI issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">The district court indicated that there is another potential <em>uberrimae fidei </em>defense to coverage here: ITN allegedly insured its shipments selectively by, for example, not issuing post-shipment COIs\u2014and therefore not paying premiums\u2014on shipments that had already arrived or that appeared low-risk. Northern does not raise this argument; it is ITN that argues the good-faith practice of insuring every shipment creates the <em>uberrimae fidei </em>basis for insuring shipments that are lost before the COI issues. Assuming that failure to conform to this practice presents Northern an <em>uberrimae fidei </em>defense, we are unpersuaded that ITN\u2019s practices were relevant to <em>this </em>shipment. A shipper's practice of insuring every shipment regardless of risk might be relevant to coverage for a shipment that was lost and for which the insured then issued a COI <em>before learning of that loss. </em>But where, as is the case here, both parties knew of the loss before the insured could issue the COI, the fact that the insured would have issued a COI in its typical course of business seems irrelevant to the issue of coverage. That is, the open cover policy itself bars coverage for a lost shipment unless the loss is unknown when the COI issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b821-15\">. To be clear, in so determining whether a contract was formed, the district court will necessarily determine whether there was consideration\u2014such as that mentioned in part II. B, supra\u2014underlying the agreement to insure the lost shipment, and therefore whether the premium\u2014-if it was accepted\u2014backed a contract rather than simply an unenforceable promise to insure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
