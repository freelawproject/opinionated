He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 176 months of imprisonment. Before this Court is Clark\u2019s appeal of his second motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was denied by the District Court. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">In his motion, Clark argued that both the guidelines applicable to his sentence and the relevant mandatory minimum term of imprisonment have been lowered since he was originally sentenced. He pointed to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), which addressed \u201cwhether defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>dants who enter into plea agreements that recommend a particular sentence as a condition of the guilty plea may be eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2690. In opposing Clark\u2019s motion, the Government argued that <em>Freeman </em>did not apply, as the plea agreement was not pegged to a guidelines range. The District Court agreed with this reasoning, finding Clark\u2019s case to not \u201cfit within <em>Freeman </em>\u201d because his sentence \u201cwas based solely on his plea agreement\u201d and not \u201cthe guidelines range.\u201d Order n. 2, ECF No. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. While the ultimate decision to reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is committed to the discretion of the District Court, we exercise plenary review over the Court\u2019s legal analysis. <em>United States v. Styer, </em>573 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>564 F.3d 305, 307 n. 2 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">When Clark was originally sentenced, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2006) required that \u201cany person who ... in furtherance of [a drug trafficking] crime, possesses a firearm\u201d shall \u201cin addition to the punishment provided for such ... drug trafficking crime\u201d be sentenced to \u201ca term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.\u201d Meanwhile, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) (2006) imposed a ten-year mandatory minimum for possession of more than 50 grams of crack. Taken together, the mandatory minimum sentence Clark could expect was a fifteen-year term. The plea agreement to which Clark was a party reflected an understanding of such a sentence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (see Guilty Plea Agreement \u00a7 3(a), ECF No. 40), and Clark\u2019s counsel acknowledged that fifteen years was \u201cthe lowest sentence which this Court may impose\u201d (see Def.\u2019s Sentencing Memo. 6, ECF No. 46).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Several years later, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Section 2 of the Act amended the relevant subsection of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, striking \u201c50 grams\u201d and inserting \u201c280 grams.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2012). The Act also led to the promulgation of sentencing guidelines reflecting the new statutory scheme. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>648 F.3d 195, 197-98 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">We need not determine whether the modification of the guidelines could affect relief under \u00a7 3582 and <em>Freeman, </em>because Clark was sentenced to a mandatory-minimum <em>statutory </em>term that still applies to him. In <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>631 F.3d 110 (3d Cir.2010), we held that the Fair Sentencing Act is not retroactive if both the offense and initial sentencing occurred before its enactment, as is the case here. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15. A defendant is not eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if another statute or provision, such as a statutory mandatory minimum, controls his sentence. <em>See Doe, </em>564 F.3d at 312. Thus, as Clark was sentenced to the minimum time possible under the old statutory scheme, the fact that a guidelines range has changed in the interim is of no moment. Finally, to the extent that Clark attacks the constitutionality of his sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">In sum, we agree with the District Court that it could not adjust Clark\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582. We will therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-14\">. Section 3582(c)(2) allows for the sentencing court to reduce the term of imprisonment if a defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">. The sentence was reduced somewhat due to prior-custody credits that are not relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
