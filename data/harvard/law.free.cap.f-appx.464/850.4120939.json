Williams\u2019s sentence represented an 84-month upward variance from the guideline range. On appeal, Williams argues the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence, both procedurally and substantively. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). While a sentencing court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each factor, it should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decision-making authority. <em>United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors together with the parties\u2019 arguments is typically sufficient. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The appropriateness of brevity or length of a district court\u2019s reasons for accepting or rejecting an argument depends the upon the circumstances and leaves much to the court\u2019s own professional judgment. <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Where the district court imposes a non-guideline sentence, it must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted), <em>ceH. denied. </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813,179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">We do not consider sentences outside the guideline range to be presumptively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 674, 178 L.Ed.2d 502 (2010). Further, we give due deference to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the variance imposed. <em>Id. </em>In fact, there is no limit on the evidence of a defendant\u2019s background, character, or conduct that a sentencing judge may consider in imposing a sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>The length of the actual sentence imposed, as compared with the guidelines range and statutory maximum, may be considered when reviewing reasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Williams has not shown that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court gave specific reasons why it thought a sentence above the guideline range was warranted. After hearing arguments from both parties, it cited Williams\u2019s personal history extensively, along with the particular facts of the crime he was charged with, including the number of weapons Williams possessed and his propensity for weapons dealing. It also noted the lack of deterrence that Williams\u2019s current probationary status provided, referenced Williams\u2019s continuous pattern of violent criminal offenses, and recognized the sentence\u2019s need to protect the public and act as a deterrent. In addition, it cited to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during sentencing. There is thus ample support in the record that the district court did not procedurally err, and gave an adequate explanation for the upward variance it imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Nor has he shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Indeed, the record belies Williams\u2019s contention that the district court unjustifiably relied on only one \u00a7 3553(a) factor, namely, his juvenile criminal history. Rather, the district court noted the number of weapons sold, Williams\u2019s probation at the time of the instant offense, and that a guideline sentence would not, <em>inter alia, </em>address the \u201cnature and circumstances of the instant offense.\u201d The court also noted that Williams was arrested with an AK-47 rifle, a pistol, and crack cocaine only three days after he sold two firearms to an undercover officer. The repeated references to the aggravating factors of the present offense therefore demonstrate the court did not unjustifiably rely on only one \u00a7 3553(a) factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Similarly, to the extent the court did rely on Williams\u2019s criminal history, it did so reasonably, and did not overemphasize his record. As the court noted, Williams\u2019s criminal conduct began at age 11, it continued undeterred by previous probationary sentences, and included numerous violent offenses. In light of the extent of Williams\u2019s criminal record, we cannot say that the district court overemphasized that factor in imposing sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Considering all the aggravating factors, Williams has not carried his burden to demonstrate that the district court made a clear error in judgment in imposing the sentence that it did. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">. Moreover, Williams\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), is misplaced. <em>Roper </em>simply holds the execution of juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 125 S.Ct. 1183. <em>Roper </em>in no way limits the extent to which prior juvenile conduct can be used as an aggravating factor in future sentencing determinations for conduct committed as an adult. So while <em>Roper </em>might support Williams\u2019s argument that it is not irrelevant in determining culpability whether a person is a juvenile when they commit a crime, the district court here explicitly considered the fact that Williams was a juvenile when many of his prior adjudications occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
