We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-23\">The district court granted Mason a certificate of appealability on the question of whether his habeas petition was properly dismissed as untimely. Mason does not address the timeliness of his habeas petition in his appellate briefs. Accordingly, he has waived the issue. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, even if the issue were not waived, Mason\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (one-year statute of limitations for an application for a writ of habeas corpus for a person in state custody). The unexplained 356-day delay between the denial of his habeas petition in San Diego Superior Court and his filing of a habeas petition in the California Court of Appeal was unreasonable. <em>See Velasquez v. Kirkland, </em>639 F.3d 964, 967-968 (9th Cir.2011) (holding that unexplained gaps of 91 and 81 days were unreasonable). Accordingly, Mason is not entitled to statutory tolling of AED-PA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations during the gap between his state court filings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Mason\u2019s federal habeas petition was filed 295 days after the statute of limitations for the claims at issue in this appeal expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b612-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
