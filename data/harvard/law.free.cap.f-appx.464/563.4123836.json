FLETCHER, SILVERMAN, and WARDLAW, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b589-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">Appellant Varee English brought suit alleging that his former employer, Santa Anita Race Track, wrongfully terminated his employment based on race and in retaliation for a prior suit that he brought against another southern California racetrack operator. English also sued two of his former co-workers, Ronald Taggart and Mark Mattick (\u201cindividual defendants\u201d), alleging harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In addition, he sued the Federation of California Racing Associations, Inc. (\u201cFederation\u201d), of which Santa Anita is a member, based on an \u201cintegrated enterprise\u201d theory. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">While English\u2019s appeal was pending before this court, Santa Anita\u2019s parent company petitioned for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. This appeal was stayed pending the outcome of those proceedings. We took judicial notice of records from the bankruptcy proceeding. Those records demonstrate that English\u2019s attorney received notice of the bankruptcy action, the deadline for filing a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, and a proof of claim form. English never filed a proof of claim. In April 2010, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming a corporate reorganization plan and discharging all claims against Santa Anita. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1). Because English\u2019s claims against Santa Anita were among those discharged in bankruptcy, we dismiss English\u2019s appeal with respect to Santa Anita.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Any relief that English may be able to obtain from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order would have to be granted by the Delaware bankruptcy court. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9006(b)(1). We express no opinion as to the merits of any claims English might raise in the Delaware bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>English\u2019s claims against the remaining defendants are waived on appeal because he failed to support them with argument, citations to authority, or citations to the record in his opening brief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). We will not address claims that are not \u201cspecifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief,\u201d including claims that are \u201conly argue[d] in passing\u201d or are \u201cbare assertionfs] ... with no supporting argument.\u201d <em>Christian Legal Soc\u2019y v. Wu, </em>626 F.3d 483, 487 (9th Cir.2010) (citations omitted) (alterations in original). English\u2019s emotional distress and harassment claims against the individual defendants and the Federation were included in the \u201cStatement of the Case\u201d section of his opening brief, but were not mentioned or supported by authority anywhere else in the brief. English also asserts that the Federation is an \u201cintegrated enterprise.\u201d But his bare assertion without supporting argument does not properly raise the issue on appeal. We therefore dismiss English\u2019s claims against Taggart, Mattick and the Federation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
