Mireya argues she is immediately eligible for LPR status based on a Western Hemisphere priority date (\u201cWHPD\u201d) derived from her parents\u2019 immigration to the United States. For the following reasons, we deny the Chapas\u2019 petition and affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">Mireya Chapa, her husband, Eduardo Chapa Villa, and their children, Samantha Chapa Gonzalez, Eduardo Chapa Gonzalez, and Jessica Chapa Gonzalez (the \u201cChapas\u201d), are natives and citizens of Mexico who were admitted to the United States on July 17, 2001, as nonimmigrant B-2 visitors. Their visitor status expired on January 16, 2002, and they have remained in the United States without authorization. During the immigration hearings leading to this appeal, the Chapas, through counsel, have conceded their removability pending their challenge to the IJ and BIA decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">The foundation of the Chapas\u2019 appeal that Mireya Chapa is eligible for a WHPD finds its roots in the 1950s, when Mireya\u2019s parents immigrated to this country. Mire-ya\u2019s father immigrated to the United States as a lawful permanent resident on November 14, 1955. On February 26, 1956, Mireya\u2019s father and mother were married in Mexico and Mireya\u2019s mother then immigrated to the United States on May 25,1956. Mireya\u2019s parents had a son, born in the United States, in 1957. Mire-ya was born several years later in Mexico on March 31,1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-18\">On April 24, 1962, Mireya entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in accordance with then-applicable internal Operating Instruction 211 (\u201cOI 211\u201d) of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d). Her 1-94 admission form was marked \u201cFemale child admitted for permanent residence without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>immigrant visa in accordance with 01 211.\u201d At an unknown date, Mireya obtained an 1-151 (green card). However, on December 17, 1975, she voluntarily surrendered the green card in exchange for an 1-186 nonresident alien border crossing card. The 1-275 immigration form filed at the time Mireya surrendered her green card included a notation by the INS official that Mireya and her mother claimed to have been living in Mexico since 1967. Mireya continued to live in Mexico and eventually married her current husband there. The couple\u2019s three children were all bom in Mexico in 1985,1989, and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In July 2001, the Chapas entered the United States as a family based on the aforementioned B-2 visitor visas. Prior to the expiration of their B-2 visitor status, Mireya\u2019s U.S.-born older brother filed an 1-130 visa petition on December 26, 2001, on behalf of Mireya, with her husband and children listed as derivative beneficiaries. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1. On the same day, the Chapas filed 1-485 applications for adjustment of status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUS-CIS\u201d). On November 5, 2004, the 1-130 visa petition was approved, resulting in a visa priority date for Mireya, her husband, and children, of December 26, 2001, the date the 1-130 petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">On November 15, 2004, USCIS denied the Chapas\u2019 applications for adjustment of status because there were no visas \u201cimmediately available\u201d under the current immigration quota system. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(g)(1). In November 2004, at the time of the USCIS decision, it is undisputed that the then-current priority date for fourth preference Mexican immigrants, such as Mireya, was much earlier than the December 2001 priority date established by the approved 1-130 visa petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Upon the Chapas\u2019 motion, the case was reopened, with Mireya claiming her date of birth in 1962 as a visa priority date based on a savings clause in a 1976 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) (discussed below). After a second interview, USCIS again denied the Chapas\u2019 applications for adjustment of status in March 2007. The USCIS explained \u201cyou in fact obtained your residency without an immigrant visa in accordance with OI 211 and are not entitled to now use your date of birth under the savings clause as a priority date to apply toward the approved visa petition filed on your behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Based on the denial of the applications for adjustment of status, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued Notices to Appear for the Chapas on April 24, 2007, charging them -with removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as aliens who after admission as nonimmigrants remained in the United States longer than permitted. Their individual cases were consolidated and a hearing was set before an IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The IJ sustained the charges of removability in light of the Chapas\u2019 concession of overstaying their nonimmigrant visas. The Chapas informed the IJ of their intent to seek relief from removal in the form of an adjustment of status, and the court allowed them to brief the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">In their brief, the Chapas argued to the IJ that Mireya was eligible for not just one, but two, priority dates under the WHPD system established by the 1976 amendments to the INA\u2014the date of her parents\u2019 marriage in 1956 and her date of birth in 1962. The Chapas argued that Mireya\u2019s father was a \u201cWestern Hemisphere applicant\u201d and that Mireya\u2019s mother was an \u201cafter-acquired spouse.\u201d Though acknowledging that a spouse acquired after a priority date has been established cannot usually benefit from a. priority date based on the marriage, the Chapas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>argued that Mireya\u2019s mother was accorded the date of her marriage as a priority date because she was an after-acquired spouse who became a spouse during a temporary absence abroad, based on an exception found in a note to a 1970 regulation. <em>See 22 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 42.62 note 2.3 (1970). The Chapas apparently then conceded that this priority date of her parents\u2019 marriage was no longer available to Mireya because she was admitted for permanent residence in 1962 with her mother based on the use of this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">However, the Chapas asserted that as a child of an \u201cafter-acquired spouse\u201d immigrating alone, she was entitled to use her date of birth as a second, alternative priority date. Mireya argued she was entitled to use her date of birth as a priority date pursuant to the 1976 amendment to the INA, which provided that aliens from Western Hemisphere countries who had registered for immigration prior to 1977 could retain their priority dates (the above-termed WHPD) for purposes of subsequent visa petitions filed on their behalf (the 1976 \u201csavings clause\u201d). Act of October 20, 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-571, 90 Stat. 2703 \u00a7 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The IJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The IJ issued a written decision pretermitting the Chapas\u2019 applications for adjustment of status. The IJ found that Mireya was ineligible to adjust status because she could not show that an immigrant visa was \u201cimmediately available.\u201d The IJ also noted that Mireya\u2019s fourth preference visa petition (the petition filed by her brother) was filed on December 26, 2001, and that the then-current priority date for fourth preference Mexican beneficiaries as of the hearing date was December 15, 1994. Accordingly, the IJ found that Mireya failed to establish that a visa was immediately available to her on the basis of the petition filed by her brother on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The IJ further found that Mireya could not establish an earlier WHPD under the 1976 savings clause. First, the IJ concluded that the savings clause did not apply to Mireya because the provision only applies to aliens who (1) were \u201cchargeable to the numerical limitation\u201d contained in a 1965 law imposing a quota on family-based immigration from Western Hemisphere country applicants, and (2) had established a priority date with a consular official prior to the enactment of the quotas. Because Mireya entered the United States in 1962, the IJ found that she was not \u201csubject to\u201d the 1965 quota. The IJ commented that by the time the quota was established, Mireya had already gained permanent residence in the United States. Further, because Mireya was not subject to the quota, she could not, and did not, establish a priority date with a consular official. The IJ concluded that Mireya was therefore not \u201cwaiting in line\u201d for a visa when the 1976 savings clause was passed because she had already come and gone from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In the alternative, the IJ concluded that, even if the savings clause applied to Mire-ya, she had failed to establish that she had an earlier priority date available pursuant to that clause. The IJ explained that she understood the Chapas\u2019 argument as follows: (1) when Mireya\u2019s father entered the United States in 1962, he effectively petitioned for her residence at the border, and (2) the 1962 \u201cpetition\u201d was entitled to not one, but two priority dates: the date of Mireya\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage and Mireya\u2019s date of birth. The IJ then rejected this argument, finding that the Chapas had conceded that one of these dates would have been used when she entered the United States in 1962. The IJ further found the Chapas\u2019 argument that Mireya <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>should retain the other date pursuant to the 1976 savings clause \u201ccreative\u201d but \u201cunsupported by authority.\u201d The IJ noted that the Chapas cited no authority, and the IJ could find none, \u201csuggesting that an immigrant petition could entitle an immigrant to multiple priority dates for one petition.\u201d Further, the IJ found that a visa petition is a petition for a visa number which, once used, is no longer available. Because the IJ found that Mireya had used her visa number in 1962, she was not entitled to reuse a visa number based on a second priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Finally, the IJ concluded that, even if Mireya had two priority dates\u2014the date of her parents\u2019 marriage and her date of birth\u2014she was no longer a child as defined by the INA, and, accordingly, she could not use her date of birth as a priority date in any event. Therefore, the IJ was \u201cnot persuaded that [the Chapas were] entitled to use a priority date from a 1962 visa petition that was already granted.\u201d The IJ found the Chapas removable and denied their applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The BIA\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The Chapas appealed the IJ\u2019s written and oral decisions to the BIA and the BIA dismissed the appeal in an unpublished, single judge decision. The BIA found that the factual findings of the IJ were not clearly erroneous and, exercising de novo review, the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s \u201cthorough and well-reasoned decisions.\u201d The BIA noted that the Chapas argued on appeal that Mireya did not need a visa and therefore did not use her priority date when she entered as a child but agreed with the IJ that Mireya entered initially in 1962 on the basis of her parents\u2019 visa and was not subject to the 1965 quota. The BIA further agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the Chapas presented no authority for the claim that Mireya possessed two priority dates, only one of which she claimed that she had used. Finally, as the IJ found, the BIA noted that the priority date for the visa petition filed by Mireya\u2019s brother was not current. The BIA therefore agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the Chapas were ineligible for adjustment of status because a visa petition was not immediately available.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The Chapas filed a timely petition for review and now argue that the \u201cChapa family\u2019s priority date is February 26, 1956\u201d\u2014the date of Mireya\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage. Mireya no longer argues that she is eligible for a priority date based on her date of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">This court generally only has authority to review the decision of the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). However, when the IJ\u2019s ruling affects the BIA\u2019s decision, this court also reviews the decision of the IJ. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed \u201cthe Immigration Judge\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned decisions,\u201d so this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision regarding Mireya\u2019s eligibility for an earlier priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The agency\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence and factual findings are only reversed if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Gomez-Palacios v. Holder, </em>560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). Questions of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Mireya\u2019s only contention regarding the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions is that both rulings are incorrect insofar as each held that she is not entitled to a WHPD based on her parents\u2019 date of marriage under the 1976 savings clause. If Mireya is eligible to claim her parents\u2019 1956 date of marriage as a WHPD, she and her family would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>become immediately eligible for an adjustment to LPR status. If not, they must return to Mexico until their 2001 priority date becomes eligible for an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The text of the 1976 savings clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">(b) An alien chargeable to the numerical limitation contained in section 21(e) of the Act of October 3, 1965 (79 Stat. 921), who established a priority date at a consular office on the basis of entitlement to immigrant status under statutory or regulatory provisions in existence on the day before the effective date of this Act shall be deemed to be entitled to immigrant status under section 203(a)(8) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and shall be accorded the priority date previously established by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOe\">Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-571 \u00a7 9(b), 90 Stat. 2703 (Oct. 20,1976). The 1965 Act referenced in the savings clause refers to the quotas imposed on family-based immigration from Western Hemisphere countries, such as Mexico. The quotas took effect on July 1, 1968 and were initially set at 120,000. Pub L. No. 89-236, 79 Stat. 911 \u00a7 21(e) (Oct. 3,1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Interpreting the savings clause and its potential applicability to Mireya\u2019s application for adjustment of status, the IJ considered both the historical and statutory context within which the savings clause was enacted, as well as the plain meaning of the language of the clause. Summarizing the IJ\u2019s discussion, Mexican immigrants were not subject to quotas prior to 1965. After the 1965 Act mentioned in the savings clause, Mexican immigrants were subject to quotas beginning in 1968. Due to issues implementing the quotas and allocating visa petition priority dates for immigrants from Western hemisphere countries, Congress modified the system for assigning priority dates in 1976, including enacting the 1976 savings clause, to ensure that immigrants who were already \u201cin line\u201d when the quota system was put in place would maintain their spot in line.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">To maintain their spot in line, the savings clause allowed then-pending applicants\u2014termed registrants\u2014to use their old, but unused priority dates. It also allowed any derivative beneficiaries in existence on the date of original registration with immigration officials to use the unused priority dates for later applications. Derivative beneficiaries include spouses and unmarried children under 21 on the date of original filing, as well as children born later from a marriage that existed on that date. This means that children born after the passage of the savings clause in 1976 can still qualify as derivatives if their parents were married and had applied for a visa prior to the quotas going into effect. The savings clause in the 1976 legislation allows the beneficiaries and derivatives to use the original date of filing (registering) for later 1-130 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Based on this historical review, the IJ considered the language of the savings clause and interpreted the plain language to include two requirements for aliens claiming eligibility for a WHPD under the savings clause: (1) the alien must have been subject to the quotas established in the 1965 Act, based on the \u201cchargeable to the numerical limitation\u201d language in the clause, and (2) the alien must have established a priority date at a consular office prior to the effect date of the Act based on the \u201cwho established a priority date at a consular office\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Based on a plain reading of the language in the savings clause, we agree with this interpretation. See Se. <em>Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, </em>442 U.S. 397, 405, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979) (\u201c[T]he starting point in every case involving construction of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>statute is the language itself.\u201d) (quoting <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 756, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring)). Thus, when applying this plain meaning interpretation to Mireya\u2019s factual scenario, she is unable to take advantage of a WHPD based on her parents\u2019 marriage date. When Mireya entered the country in 1962 as a LPR with her parents, she was in no way \u2018subject to\u2019 the 1965 quota. By the time the quota went into effect in 1968, Mireya had long since gained permanent residence in the United States. Considering that Mireya obtained a green card sometime shortly after her entry in 1962, and did not surrender it until 1975, it would be illogical to also say she was \u201cwaiting in line\u201d for something she already possessed when the quotas went into effect in 1968. Therefore, based on a plain meaning, the savings clause does not apply to Mireya\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Mireya\u2019s argument that she was actually living in Mexico since 1967, and therefore was subject to the 1968 quotas, fails in light of the' record evidence. The 1-275 form filed by immigration officials detailing when Mireya surrendered her green card is clearly dated several times as \u201c12-17-75\u201d and thus is conclusive that Mireya possessed a green card at the time the quotas went into effect in 1968. Not only was Mireya not subject to the 1965 quota, she was also not \u201cwaiting in line\u201d for a visa as an alien who had registered for a visa but had not yet entered the United States as envisioned by the legislature when the savings clause was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Alternatively, Mireya argues that her entry into the United States in 1962 did not use the 1956 priority date she now claims because her immigration form indicated that she was \u201cadmitted without visa in accordance with 01 211.\u201d She claims that despite raising this contention before the IJ and BIA, both ignored this argument and failed to cite any authority to refute her claim that the \u201cadmitted without visa language\u201d is equivalent to not having used her parents\u2019 priority date. However, even if we were to assume Mire-ya had a valid claim to her parents\u2019 marriage date as a valid WHPD under the 1976 savings clause, we would still have to deny the Chapas\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">While the language stamped on Mireya\u2019s entry document does indeed say, in part, \u201cadmitted without visa,\u201d that language is only a portion of the notation we must consider. That language is modified by \u201cin accordance with 01 211.\u201d A review of the complete language of then-applicable 01 211 lends validity to the IJ\u2019s finding that Mireya received LPR status based on her parents\u2019 \u201capplication\u201d or \u201cpetition\u201d in 1962 and therefore she has already used the visa priority date based on her parents\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The applicable subsection of 01 211 explains that \u201ca child born subsequent to the issuance of an immigrant visa to his accompanying parent and applies for admission <em>during the validity of such a visa </em>\u201d is exempted from having to present a valid unexpired immigrant visa. 01 \u00a7 211.1(a) (emphasis added). This language, in light of the notation on Mireya\u2019s immigration form, makes clear that while she was admitted and granted LPR status without her <em>own </em>valid unexpired immigrant visa, she was only admitted based upon the \u201cvalidity of such a visa,\u201d which is a direct reference to the validity of her parents\u2019 visa petition. Stated differently, Mireya was admitted and granted LPR status in 1962 based on her parents\u2019 valid 1956 visa petition\u2014the same one she attempts to use now for a second admission to the United States. Therefore, a plain reading of 01 211 in conjunction with the facts of Mire-ya\u2019s 1962 entry into the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>would foreclose Mireya\u2019s use of her parents\u2019 visa priority date a second time. <em>See In re Villarreal-Zuniga, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 886, 889 (BIA 2006) (\u201c[0]nce an approved visa petition is used to obtain a benefit, it cannot be used again.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the Chapas\u2019 petition and AFFIRM the decision of the BIA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
