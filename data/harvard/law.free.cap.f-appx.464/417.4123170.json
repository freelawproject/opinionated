Cable, who together are the only defendants who were not previously dismissed. The action arises from knee injuries Smith suffered at the O.B. Ellis Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-26\">Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the medical defendants, Williams, Hough, Nagel, and Ray, because Smith failed to identify any genuinely con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tested issue of material fact whether any of these defendants acted with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). Although the record reveals some possibly inaccurate assessments of Smith\u2019s knee problem, due largely to his failure to cooperate and the skepticism that it generated, the plethora of summary judgment evidence in the record establishes that, despite their skepticism, the medical defendants conscientiously examined and treated Smith. He offers only his own bald conclusions, refuted by the medical record, that these defendants refused to act to remedy his medical condition. Smith\u2019s complaint is, at best, a claim of negligence, malpractice, or mere disagreement about the course of treatment. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">His brief on appeal, even when liberally construed, demonstrates that Smith has failed to make any coherent challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against correction officers Fransaw and Cable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915 &amp; 1915A and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). At best, he has offered only vague and unsupported accusations that they used excessive force, interfered with medical treatment, and retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional rights. Such unadorned accusations that these defendants caused some harm are insufficient to support a claim that constitutional rights were violated. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Smith has also failed to state a plausible or coherent claim for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In summary, Smith has failed to show any error in the dismissal of any claim against any defendant. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
