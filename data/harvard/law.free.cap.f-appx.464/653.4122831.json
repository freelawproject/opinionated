He also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court impermissibly relied on factors not enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Fisher\u2019s contentions are not supported by the record. The district court did not proeedurally err, and Fisher\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See Gall v. United </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the conduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the violator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the violator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
