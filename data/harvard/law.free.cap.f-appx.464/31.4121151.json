We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A district court\u2019s application of the principles of claim and issue preclusion is reviewed <em>de novo. See Bank of N.Y. v. First Millennium, Inc., </em>607 F.3d 905, 919 (2d Cir.2010). Likewise, we review de <em>novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Amador v. Andrews, </em>655 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Having conducted an independent and <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned report and recommendation of August 23, 2010, and the district court\u2019s decision of October 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We have considered all of Batyreva\u2019s additional arguments\u2014including her arguments that the district judge was not impartial and that the defendant tried to improperly influence the outcome of the case\u2014and And them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
