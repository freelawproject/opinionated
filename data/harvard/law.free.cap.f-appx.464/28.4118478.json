(\u201cDuferco\u201d) appeals an order confirming an arbitral award in favor of Tube City IMS, L.L.C. (\u201cTube City\u201d) and R. Kelly Freedman Holding Group, L.L.C. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to confirm an arbitration award <em>de novo </em>to the extent it turns on legal questions, and we review any findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Duferco Int\u2019l Steel Trading v. T. Klaveness Shipping A/S, </em>333 F.3d 383, 388 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">An award may be vacated if, <em>inter alia, </em>an arbitrator is \u201cguilty of misconduct ... in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3). Duferco argues such a vacatur can be based on an arbitrator\u2019s error of law even if the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard of the law. <em>See Klaveness, </em>333 F.3d at 388-90 (discussing manifest disregard). Even supposing this to be true, Duferco does not show the arbitrator erred, let alone committed an error in \u201cbad faith or so gross as to amount to affirmative misconduct.\u201d <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 40, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) (reviewing arbitrator\u2019s evidentiary determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">According to Duferco\u2019s contract to purchase scrap steel from Tube City, measurement of the impurity level of the scrap would be performed by an independent inspector and would be \u201cfinal at loadport.\u201d Duferco argues that the arbitrator misinterpreted New York law in holding that evidence from subsequent inspections\u2014 which could indicate the independent inspector grossly erred\u2014is insufficient to establish that the inspector acted in bad faith and therefore insufficient to overcome the \u201cfinal at loadport\u201d provision. But Duferco failed to present to the arbitrator any New York authority in which a court found such evidence sufficient, let alone precedent that bound the arbitrator to consider\u2014at the first phase of the arbitration\u2014the subsequent inspection as evidence that the first inspection was conducted in bad faith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Cf. Sempra Energy Trading Corp. v. BP Prods. N. Am., Inc., </em>52 A.D.3d 350, 350, 860 N.Y.S.2d 71 (1st Dept 2008) (\u201c[P]ostdischarge report ... was not material under the parties\u2019 agreement ] to allege the possibility of manifest error in the official binding predischarge report.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Finding no merit in Duferco\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
