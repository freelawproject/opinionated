Finding that he has not made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c), we deny Mr. Robledo\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Mr. Robledo was sentenced to a three-year term of incarceration on March 30, 2009, and did not appeal his conviction or sentence. <em>Robledo v. Jones, </em>No. 11-cv-2130-BNB, 2011 WL 5910411, at *1 (D.Colo. Nov.28, 2011). He filed various motions for Colorado post-conviction relief between December 2009 and July 2011, but did not appeal from the denial of any of those motions. <em>Id. </em>at *l-*2. Instead, he filed a petition for federal habeas relief in August 2011. <em>Id. </em>at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The district court was unable to determine, based upon the showing by Respondents, whether the petition was time-barred. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Instead, it denied Mr. Robledo\u2019s petition for failure to exhaust state remedies by properly presenting his claims to state appellate courts and failure to demonstrate cause for his procedural default. <em>Robledo, </em>2011 WL 5910411 at *3-*4. Given that the district court rejected his petition on procedural grounds, Mr. Robledo must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether [ (1) ] the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and ... [ (2) ] the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The district court\u2019s procedural ruling is not debatable. Mr. Robledo did not present his state post-conviction claims to state appellate courts, as required by \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). <em>See Selsor v. Workman, </em>644 F.3d 984, 1026 (10th Cir.2011). Furthermore, Mr. Robledo has not challenged the district court\u2019s procedural conclusion with any argument relating to cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Coronado v. Ward, </em>517 F.3d 1212, 1215-16 (10th Cir.2008). We need not address whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">We therefore DENY Mr. Robledo\u2019s request for a COA, DENY IFP status, and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
