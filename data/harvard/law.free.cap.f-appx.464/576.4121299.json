We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">Mendivil-Silva contends that remand is required because the district court did not recognize its discretion to vary from the advisory sentencing Guidelines range pursuant to <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). The record belies that contention. The district court understood that had discretion to vary but concluded that a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate for Mendivil-Silva.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-24\">To the extent that Mendivil-Silva also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, the contention fails. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the 78-month sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
