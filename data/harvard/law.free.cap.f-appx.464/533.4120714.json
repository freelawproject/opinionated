After examining the appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the appellant\u2019s brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In 2000 an Illinois court convicted Stanley Wofford of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment, the statutory maximum, to be followed by a 2-year term of mandatory supervised release. <em>See </em>730 ILCS 5/5-8-l(a)(1.5), (d)(2) (2000). Wofford completed the prison component of his sentence and began serving the term of mandatory supervised release in 2007 (he completed his sentence before the expiration of 20 years because of time-served and good conduct, <em>see </em>730 ILCS 5/3-6-3(a)(2.1) (2000)), but he violated the conditions of that release and was sent back to prison for the remainder of the 2-year term. He was released for good when his sentence expired in 2009. He then filed this damages action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the former chairman of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board and the former director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, claiming that they -violated the federal and Illinois constitutions by \u201ctacking on\u201d and revoking the term of mandatory supervised release so that he ended up serving additional time in prison on top of his 20-year sentence. The district court dismissed Wofford\u2019s complaint at screening. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">In his complaint, Wofford notes that the judgment of conviction issued by the state court in 2000 makes no mention of the term of mandatory supervised release. He thus assumes that the term was \u201cadded\u201d later and then revoked by the defendants. It follows, says Wofford, that he was subjected to double jeopardy and deprived of due process, among other wrongs. The district court at first concluded that Wofford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. But in response to Wofford\u2019s motion for reconsideration, <em>see </em>Fed. R.CivP. 59(e), the court decided that <em>Heck </em>does not apply because Wofford has completed his sentence and does not face a threat of further imprisonment or supervision. Still, the court reasoned, the term of mandatory supervised release was made part of Wofford\u2019s sentence by operation of law even though not mentioned in the original judgment, <em>see </em>730 ILCS 5/5-8-l(d)(2) (2000), and the later revocation of that term did not violate Wofford\u2019s federal rights. Thus the court declined to set aside its earlier dismissal. But neither did the court mention Wofford\u2019s state claim or modify its judgment to reflect the dismissal of Wofford\u2019s federal claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">On appeal Wofford disagrees with the district court\u2019s analysis of his constitutional claims, but we decline to follow the district court\u2019s lead in addressing those claims on the merits. Wofford has named only two defendants, and the simple fact is that neither can be held liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">First, these defendants did not impose the term of mandatory supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>release; it was always part of Wofford\u2019s sentence. As the district court explained, the term of mandatory supervised release was a nondiscretionary component of the sentence that was imposed in 2000 when Wofford was convicted. Even if the judgment does not say so, the mandatory supervised release was included in Wofford\u2019s sentence by operation of law. <em>See </em>730 ILCS 5/5\u20148\u20141 (d)(2) (2000); <em>People v. Whitfield, </em>217 Ill.2d 177, 298 Ill.Dec. 545, 840 N.E.2d 658, 672 (2005); <em>People ex rel. Scott v. Israel, </em>66 Ill.2d 190, 5 Ill.Dec. 580, 361 N.E.2d 1108,1109 (1977); <em>People v. Brown, </em>296 Ill.App.3d 1041, 231 Ill.Dec. 255, 695 N.E.2d 1374,1376 (1998). (Effective January 1, 2012, Illinois amended 5/5\u2014 8-1 (d) to require that a term of mandatory supervised release \u201cbe written as part of the sentencing order.\u201d The import of that amendment for future cases is not a question before us.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Second, neither defendant can be liable for the allegedly unconstitutional revocation of Wofford\u2019s mandatory supervised release. Illinois law provides that the Prisoner Review Board decides whether to revoke mandatory supervised release, and that Board is independent of the Department of Corrections. 730 ILCS 5/3-3-l(a), 5/3-3-9(a). Thus the director of the Department of Corrections was not involved in the constitutional violations allegedly arising from Wofford\u2019s revocation, and cannot be liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Knight v. Wiseman, </em>590 F.3d 458, 462-63 (7th Cir.2009); <em>Johnson v. Snyder, </em>444 F.3d 579, 583-84 (7th Cir.2006). And assuming that the chairman of the Prisoner Review Board played a personal role in revoking Wofford\u2019s mandatory supervised release (which is unclear since the 15-member Board acts through 3-member panels, 730 ILCS 5/3-3-l(b), 5/3-3-9(e)), the chairman is nonetheless absolutely immune under \u00a7 1983 because the revocation of mandatory supervised release is a quasi-judicial act. <em>Wilson v. Kelkhoff, </em>86 F.3d 1438, 1445 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">That leaves two loose ends. First, although the district court did not say so explicitly, we infer that the court implicitly declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Wofford\u2019s state-law claim when it dismissed the case as a whole, which was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Harvey v. Town of Merrillville, </em>649 F.3d 526, 533 (7th Cir.2011). And, second, after the court decided to dismiss Wofford\u2019s federal claims on the merits rather than on the basis of <em>Heck, </em>the court should have amended its judgment to be with prejudice as to the federal claims. <em>See Alejo v. Heller, </em>328 F.3d 930, 937 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Lewis v. Richards, </em>107 F.3d 549, 555-56 (7th Cir.1997). We accordingly modify the judgment so that Wofford\u2019s federal claims are dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">AFFIRMED as MODIFIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
