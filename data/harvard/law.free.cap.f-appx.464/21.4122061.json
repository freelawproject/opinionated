Candelaria sued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging deliberate indifference to his health in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u201c[W]e construe notices of appeal liberally, taking the parties\u2019 intentions into account,\u201d <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 256 (2d Cir.1995), especially with respect to <em>pro se </em>litigants, <em>see Phelps v. Kapnolas, </em>123 F.3d 91, 93 (2d Cir.1997). However, because a notice of appeal must \u201cdesignate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), our jurisdiction \u201cdepends on whether the intent to appeal from [the] decision [at issue] is clear on the face of, or can be inferred from, the notices of appeal.\u201d <em>New Phone Co. v. City of N.Y., </em>498 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Shrader, </em>70 F.3d at 256 (stating that, where a notice of appeal \u201cfail[s] to mention\u201d a specific order, we are \u201cbar[red] from considering\u201d an appellate challenge to that order). The requirements set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 3 and 4 are jurisdictional in nature, and, as a result, cannot be waived. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 208-09, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (regarding Rule 4); <em>City of N.Y. v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., </em>541 F.3d 425, 452 (2d Cir.2008) (regarding Rule 3), <em>overruled on other grounds by Hemi Group, LLC v. City of N.Y., </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 983, 994, 175 L.Ed.2d 943 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">Here, Candelaria\u2019s brief challenges both the district court\u2019s June 2005 order granting defendant Gita Ramaswamy\u2019s summary judgment motion, and its March 2010 order granting defendant St. Agnes Hospital\u2019s summary judgment motion. His notice of appeal, which was filed by counsel, contained no reference to either the June 2005 order or the March 30, 2010 final judgment, stating only as follows: \u201c[n]otice is hereby given that Mr. Juan Candelaria ... hereby appeals ... from the entire Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment ... entered in this action on the 29th Day of March, 2010 and annexed hereto.\u201d There is simply no information in Candelaria\u2019s notice of appeal that would permit an inference that he intended to appeal the June 2005 order granting Ramaswamy\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>See New Phone, </em>498 F.3d at 131. Accordingly, we lack the authority to consider Candelaria\u2019s arguments challenging that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">With respect to Candelaria\u2019s appeal from the March 29, 2010 order granting St. Agnes Hospital\u2019s summary judgment motion, we review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and ask whether the district court properly concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are \u201c \u2018required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u2019 \u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Stern v. Trs. of Columbia Univ. in City of N.Y., </em>131 F.3d 305, 312 (2d Cir.1997)). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201c[wjhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Additionally, because Candelaria appears pro se, we are obligated to read his submissions with \u201cspecial solicitude,\u201d interpreting them to raise the \u201cstrongest arguments that they suggest.\u201d <em>Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We have conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the record in light of these principles. We affirm for substantially the same reasons as those stated by the district court in its March 29, 2010 opinion and order. The district court correctly concluded that the undisputed evidence precludes a finding that the defendant\u2019s agents acted with the requisite culpable state of mind in treating Candelaria\u2019s kidney disease. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 107, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Hernandez v. Keane, </em>341 F.3d 137, 146-47 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Chance v. Armstrong, </em>143 F.3d 698, 702 (2d Cir.1998). On appeal, Candelaria does not identify sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendant\u2019s agents acted with deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We have considered all of Candelaria\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
