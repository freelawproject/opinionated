He argues that the court below erred in applying a 16-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because it wrongly characterized his 2004 attempted robbery conviction in the District of Columbia (D.C.) as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, <em>United States v. Jennen, </em>596 F.3d 594, 600 (9th Cir.2010), we agree.-</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">First, as interpreted by D.C. courts, 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2801 criminalizes non-violent conduct beyond generic robbery\u2014namely, stealthy seizure or snatching. <em>See, e.g., Leak v. United States, </em>757 A.2d 739, 742 (D.C.App.2000). Thus, Petitioner\u2019s prior conviction under that statute does not categorically qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the sentencing enhancement. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Laurico-Yeno, </em>590 F.3d 818, 821 (9th Cir.2010) (requiring the sentencing court to focus on \u201cthe least egregious end of [the statute\u2019s] range of conduct\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Becerril-Lopez, </em>541 F.3d 881, 891 (9th Cir.2008) (defining \u201cgeneric\u201d robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">Second, those portions of Petitioner\u2019s criminal record which are judicially noticeable under a \u201cmodified-categorical\u201d analysis do not indicate that Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea in 2004 \u201cnecessarily admitted\u201d the elements of generic robbery. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). In this case, our inquiry is limited to the criminal information to which Petitioner pled guilty and the judgment of the D.C. Superior Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (\u201c[A] later court determining the character of an admitted [crime] is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Tucker, </em>641 F.3d 1110, 1124 (9th Cir.2011). An examination of these documents does not exclude the possibility that Petitioner was convicted of mere stealthy seizure or snatching. <em>Cf. Jackson v. United States, </em>359 F.2d 260, 262 (D.C.Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">As nothing in the record establishes Petitioner\u2019s prior conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the district court erred in applying a 16-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s sentence is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
