He received an aggregate sentence of 300 months\u2014considerably above his advisory Guidelines range of 78-97 months. We previously affirmed Tyer\u2019s convictions but vacated his sentence because the district court failed to make the individualized assessment required by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>396 Fed.Appx. 33 (4th Cir.2010). Tyer now appeals the 300-month term of imprisonment imposed at resentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">At Tyer\u2019s resentencing, defense counsel requested a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range based on Tyer\u2019s difficult childhood and the fact that Tyer did not physically assault any of the robbery victims. The court rejected this request, finding that the nature and circumstances of the case warranted a \u201csubstantial increase\u201d above the Guidelines range. In this regard, the court mentioned the number of robberies and \u201cthe fact that this defendant carried a shotgun with him and had the ammunition right at the side ready, which enabled the robberies and the assaults to go forward.\u201d The court specifically found that these circumstances, coupled with the need to protect the public and to deter Tyer and others from similar conduct, outweighed his relatively young age and difficult background.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We vacated the sentence originally imposed because the district court committed procedural error when it failed \u201cto adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">In evaluating a district court\u2019s explanation for the sentence imposed, we have held that, although a district court must consider the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) sentencing factors and explain the sentence, it need not explicitly refer to \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss every factor on the record. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,\u201d and apply the \u201crelevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the specific circumstances of the case before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). The district court must also \u201cstate in open court the particular reasons supporting its chosen sentence\u201d and \u201cset forth enough to satisfy\u201d us that it has \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, the reasons articulated by the district court need not be \u201ccouched in the precise language of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d as long as the reasons \u201ccan be matched to a factor appropriate for consideration under that statute and [are] clearly tied to [the defendant\u2019s] particular situation.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 658 (4th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Tyer contends that the district court did not acknowledge his contention that a less severe sentence was warranted because, unlike codefendant Monroe, he did not assault any of the robbery victims. To the contrary, the court implicitly rejected this argument when it found that, by carrying a shotgun with ammunition at the side, Tyer enabled the robberies and assaults. Tyer also argues that the district court did not consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) when imposing sentence, claiming that the explanation given by the court for the selected sentence \u201ccould apply to any series of armed robberies.\u201d Especially in light of the court\u2019s statement about the number of robberies, the shotgun and the ammunition, it is clear that the court\u2019s explanation of the sentence addressed Tyer\u2019s conduct, not armed robberies in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We conclude that the court adequately explained its reasons for the variant sentence and performed an appropriate individualized assessment. Further, the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
