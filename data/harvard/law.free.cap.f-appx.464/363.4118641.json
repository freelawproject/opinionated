He contends that the district court erred when it denied him a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Whether Aranda was a minor participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir. 2005). There is no clear error if the district court\u2019s factual finding is \u201cplausible in light of the record read as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Section 3B 1.2(b) provides for a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if he was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. The minor-role adjustment applies to defendants who are only peripherally involved in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 204. For purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2, a defendant\u2019s participation in the offense is not to be evaluated with reference to the entire criminal enterprise of which the defendant was a part. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001). Rather, \u00a7 3B1.2 asks whether a defendant\u2019s involvement was minor in relation to the conduct for which he was held accountable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The evidence highlighted by Aranda and contained in the record reflects that Aranda illegally guided aliens across the Mexican border into the United States and that, once in the United States, Aranda drove a truck transporting the illegal aliens. While he may not have been the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the conspiracy, Aranda\u2019s roles of guiding illegal aliens into the United States and driving them to .their destination, can hardly be described as peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity to which Aranda pleaded guilty\u2014conspiracy to transport illegal aliens within the United States. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203-04. As a guide and driver, Aranda\u2019s roles were central to the agreement to transport illegal aliens and clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in failing to grant Aranda a minor role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The district court\u2019s judgment therefore is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
