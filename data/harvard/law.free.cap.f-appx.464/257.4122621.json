Hernandez was ordered removed because the Immigration Judge found that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Hernandez argues that his ineligibility for relief from removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) based on the fact that he was admitted as a lawful permanent resident (LPR) and subsequently convicted of an aggravated felony violates his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Although we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h), we have jurisdiction \u201cto review the question of law presented by [a] challenge to the BIA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 212(h).\u201d <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 541 (5th Cir.2008). An alien\u2019s equal protection challenge arises under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. <em>Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 502-03 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). An equal protection challenge in this context is subject to rational basis review. <em>Flores-Ledezma v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">In <em>Malagon de Fuentes, </em>462 F.3d at 506, the petitioner argued that it was a violation of equal protection for the law to distinguish between lawful permanent residents and aliens who entered the country illegally for purposes of eligibility for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver. We noted that \u201c[e]very one of our sister courts to have addressed this question have upheld \u00a7 1182(h)\u2019s apparent favoring of non-LPRs against equal protection attack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agreed with those courts that the distinction made by Congress between lawful permanent residents and inadmissible aliens in \u00a7 1182(h) for waiver eligibility has a rational basis. <em>Id. </em>Hernandez\u2019s equal protection argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Hernandez also contends that Congress did not intend for LPRs to be treated differently from aliens who adjusted their status after arrival. However, in <em>Martinez, </em>we found that the language in \u00a7 1182(h) was unambiguous and that Congress\u2019 intent was clear. <em>Martinez, </em>519 F.3d at 544-45. The language plainly states that an alien admitted as a LPR is prohibited from seeking a waiver whereas an alien not admitted as a LPR is not barred from such relief. <em>Id. </em>at 544-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
