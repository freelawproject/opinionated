The district court ruled that Balmir did not act with deliberate indifference to Hodge\u2019s medical needs and that Hodge failed to establish that he qualified for relief under the Disabilities Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The district court did not err when it entered summary judgment in favor of Balmir. Hodge failed to establish that he had an objectively serious medical need that Balmir knowingly or recklessly disregarded. <em>See Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000). Hodge complained of pain from injuries suffered in a car accident and from injuries to and a later surgery on his knee and tibia, and Balmir prescribed several medications to address Hodge\u2019s complaints of pain. Balmir also instructed Hodge that, if he was in \u201cacute pain ... [not] to wait for sick call[,]\u201d which could \u201ctake 24, 72 hours,\u201d and instead to go \u201cto the infirmary\u201d for medication. Hodge argued that Balmir acted with deliberate indifference by prescribing primarily Tylenol III when it was less effective than hydrocodone, but \u201ca simple difference in medical opinion between the prison\u2019s medical staff and the inmate as to the latter\u2019s diagnosis or course of treatment [does not] support a claim of cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (11th Cir.1991). Hodge\u2019s expert witness, Dr. John Clark, criticized Balmir for failing to \u201cgrade or evaluate\u201d Hodge after he reported that Tylenol III was ineffective, but Balmir testified that Hodge refused to undergo an examination to assess his level of pain. Balmir testified that he prescribed that Hodge \u201cshould be treated with stronger medication than Tylenol ... [during the] acute pain early postoperative period,\u201d but be \u201cwean[ed] ... off controlled medications such as opiates.\u201d Balmir determined that Tylenol III was an appropriate medication after conferring with Hodge\u2019s hand surgeon, who had recommended that Hodge receive treatment for drug dependence because he had been exaggerating his level of pain. Hodge failed to create a genuine dispute about whether Balmir\u2019s decision was anything \u201cmore than a medical judgment call.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Evans, </em>792 F.2d 1052, 1060 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">The district court also did not err when it entered summary judgment in fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>vor of the prison officials. To be eligible for relief under the Disabilities Act, Hodge has to establish that he is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, because he has a physical impairment that \u201csubstantially limits one or more major life activities,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12102(1)(A), and that he has been \u201cexcluded from participation in or ... denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12132. Hodge failed to establish that there existed a genuine issue of material fact about whether his physical impairment was substantial or limiting. <em>See Harris v. H &amp;W Contracting Co., </em>102 F.3d 516, 522-23 (11th Cir.1996). Hodge testified that his physicians had told him his impairments limited him substantially in the major life activity of walking, but the district court correctly concluded that it could not consider inadmissible hearsay in ruling on the motion for summary judgment. <em>Macuba v. Deboer, </em>193 F.3d 1316, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1999). Hodge also failed to establish a genuine dispute about whether he was excluded from or denied treatment for his injuries. The prison officials submitted substantial evidence about their treatment for Hodge\u2019s injuries, which included use of wheelchairs and braces, medication, surgery, and consultation and rehabilitation with medical personnel outside the prison. Hodge fails to argue that he was denied any service, program, or activity needed to treat his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Balmir and officials of the Florida Department of Corrections.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
