The district court sentenced Hunter to sixty-nine months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Hunter challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and argues that the district court erred in denying her motions for a mistrial and for a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s comment on her failure to testify. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Hickman, </em>626 F.3d 756, 762 (4th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 469, 181 L.Ed.2d 306 (2011). We must \u201csustain a guilty verdict that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 385 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[SJubstantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). The defendant\u2019s burden is a heavy one, and reversal is proper only in \u201cthe rare case \u2018where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">Much of Hunter\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence attacks the credibility of the witnesses. However, in evaluating the sufficiency of evidence, we will not review the credibility of witnesses, and we must assume the jury resolved all contradicting testimony in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>507 F.3d 233, 245 (4th Cir.2007). Hunter also asserts that there was no explicit reference to her involvement with drugs in the telephone calls and text messages presented at trial. Our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the record leads us to conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter was guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, <em>see United States v. Green, </em>599 F.3d 360, 367 (4th Cir.) (stating elements of offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 271, 178 L.Ed.2d 179 (2010); aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin, <em>see United States v. Yearwood, </em>518 F.3d 220, 227 (4th Cir.2008); <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 873; possessing with intent to distribute heroin, <em>see United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 519 (4th Cir.2005); maintaining a druginvolved premise, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2); and using a communication facility to facilitate a felony drug offense, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b); <em>United States v. Lozano, </em>839 F.2d 1020, 1023 (4th Cir.1988). Thus, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Hunter\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Turning to Hunter\u2019s second argument, a claim of prosecutorial misconduct warrants reversal only if the reviewing court determines the comment (1) was improper and (2) \u201cso prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights as to deprive [her] of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>471 F.3d 535, 542 (4th Cir.2006). A prosecutor\u2019s statement does not amount to an improper comment on a defendant\u2019s refusal to testify unless, in context, the offending language was \u201cmanifestly intended to be, or [was] ... of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relevant to this inquiry is whether \u201cthe comment[ ] ... invited the jury to draw an \u2018inference of guilt\u2019 against the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Francis, </em>82 F.3d 77, 79 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">After reviewing the transcript and reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s comment in context, we conclude without difficulty that the comment does not warrant reversal because it was a factual clarification of the prosecutor\u2019s prior misstatement. <em>See Jones, </em>471 F.3d at 542. Moreover, even if improper, we conclude that the comment did not affect Hunter\u2019s substantial rights and constituted harmless error. <em>See United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 507-10, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (providing standard); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 299 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
