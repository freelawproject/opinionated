Finding no clear error on the part of the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Martin and several codefendants were charged in a multiple count, superseding indictment for robberies and related offenses. Martin pled guilty to Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). At sentencing, the parties stipulated that Martin \u201cdirected\u201d his coconspirators to commit the armed robbery to which he pled guilty. Martin promised them that they would earn \u201cgood money\u201d if they committed the robbery and would not be punished severely due to their young age. He supplied them with guns from his \u201cdrug hole,\u201d drove them to the scene, and served as the getaway driver. After completion of the robbery, Martin\u2019s coconspirators gave him the money and property that they had stolen in return for a \u201csmall amount of money.\u201d Based on these facts, the district court applied, over Martin\u2019s objection, a two-level enhancement for his aggravating role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to apply an aggravating-role enhancement for clear error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>584 F.3d 1022, 1025 (11th Cir.2009). Under this standard, we will not reverse unless left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Poirier, </em>321 F.3d 1024, 1035 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Facts contained in a PSI are deemed admitted and may be used to support a guideline enhancement unless a defendant objects to the facts before the sentencing court. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir.2009). Similarly, although stipulated facts are not binding on a district court, they may be used along with the PSI to assist the court in making factual findings at sentencing. <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>888 F.2d 752, 754 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Application of the aggravating-role enhancement requires that (1) the defendant undertake the role of \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in the crime and (2) the nature of the offense does not qualify for a higher-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>See United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cm. 2003). To apply, evidence must support a finding that \u201cthe defendant exerted some control, influence[,] or decision-making authority over another participant in the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>584 F.3d at 1026. Thus, a \u201cdefendant who merely suggests committing the offense\u201d is not a leader or organizer under the guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. 4. However, evidence showing that the defendant exerted influence or control over even one other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>individual will be sufficient to support an enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>Id. </em>cmt. 2; <em>see United States v. Lozano, </em>490 F.3d 1317, 1323 (11th Cir.2007) (affirming a \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) enhancement where the defendant instructed at one least coconspirator to engage in criminal conduct and was \u201cintricately involved in the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Martin argues that the district court erred because he merely performed an assigned role of furnishing guns and driving the getaway car. He further asserts that he did not recruit his coconspirators, as they were already involved in illegal activities. And similarly, Martin contends that he was not such a crucial participant in the crime, which is evident by the fact that his coconspirators planned multiple other robberies without his participation or supervision. Martin\u2019s arguments do not establish clear error on the part of the district court because his contentions do not undermine the facts establishing his role <em>in this particular robbery, </em>which is the crime for which he received the sentencing enhancement. Although his coconspirators may have been led by other individuals when they committed other crimes, that does not change the facts surrounding this particular robbery offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The district court considered the stipulated facts and those uncontested in the PSI when it applied the two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Based on these facts, the sentencing court could properly find that Martin planned the crime, enticed his coconspirators to join him in committing the crime, supplied the group with weapons, and collected and distributed the bounty from the robberies. The commentary to the guidelines recognizes that these factors indicate that a defendant qualifies for an aggravating-role enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. 4. We are therefore not left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d <em>Poirier, </em>321 F.3d at 1035, and we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
