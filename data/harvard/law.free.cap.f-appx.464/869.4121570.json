The Secretary moves to dismiss Jones\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-18\">On April 8, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the Board of Veterans Appeals\u2019 decision denying entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation benefits. On June 1, 2011, the Veterans Court entered judgment in Jones\u2019s case. The court received Jones\u2019s notice of appeal on August 29, 2011, 89 days after the date of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-19\">To be timely, a notice of appeal must be filed with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims within 60 days of the entry of judgment. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1); <em>see also Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1204-05, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011) (the language of Section 7292(a) \u201cclearly signals an intent\u201d to impose the same jurisdictional restrictions on an appeal from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit as imposed on appeals from a district court to a court of appeals). The statutory deadline for taking an appeal to this court is jurisdictional and thus mandatory. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). As such, this court \u201chas no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements,\u201d even if such \u201crigorous rules ... are thought to be inequitable[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"AtD\">Jones contends that she submitted a notice of appeal on April 8, 2011\u2014the same date as the Veterans Court\u2019s decision. As the Secretary points out, there is no record of a notice of appeal filed with the Veterans Court prior to the August 29, 2011 notice of appeal. Jones also contends that \u201cthe cause of delay is contributed by distance and mail.\u201d As noted above, this court may not waive the jurisdictional time limit on such grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b895-25\">It Is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-26\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion is granted. Jones\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-27\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
