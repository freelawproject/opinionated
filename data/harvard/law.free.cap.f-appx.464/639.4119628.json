Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Hamazaspyan v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 744, 747 (9th Cir.2009). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision to deny Lugo-Miramontes\u2019 applications for waivers of inadmissibility, which were denied for failure to show extreme hardship to a qualifying relative, as well as his application for adjustment of status, which was denied in the exercise of discretion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-24\">Lugo-Miramontes\u2019 contention that the agency erroneously relied on his attempted fraudulent entry in 1998 to deny his applications for relief is not supported by the record, and therefore does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
