For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss Brodzki\u2019s appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2), as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">In November 2011, Brodzki filed a complaint in the District Court against Fox Broadcasting Company, alleging that employees of the Fox Network\u2019s Dallas, Texas morning television show violated his civil rights and defamed him. Specifically, Brodzki alleged that the station\u2019s on-air personalities \u201care invading my privacy and my seclusion,\u201d that they accused him on air of being \u201can unconvinced [sic] felon,\u201d and that they \u201chave even said that they have the ability to hear my thinking.\u201d Brodzki also claimed that one Fox employee played a tape on air one morning and said the recorded person was Brodzki. Brodzki sought $50 million in damages, injunctive relief, and information about \u201chow they are coming about this private information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-21\">Brodzki applied for, and was awarded, in forma pauperis status, after which the District Court screened his complaint for legal sufficiency pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The District Court noted that Brodzki has a history of filing legally frivolous lawsuits, which has resulted in his being banned from filing civil suits in the Northern District of Illinois without prior court authorization and in the imposition of sanctions in at least one case in the Northern District of Texas. The District Court reasoned that the instant complaint\u2014one of at least seven similar complaints he has filed in the District of Delaware since 2010\u2014did not adequately state a cause of action and that his allegations were \u201cfantastical, delusional, irrational, and frivolous.\u201d D. Ct. Doc. No. 5, 4. Accordingly, the District Court dismissed the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Brodzki filed an objection, which the District Court construed as a motion for reconsideration and then denied. Brodzki timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-22\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint under \u00a7 1915. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). Because Brodzki was proceeding in forma pauperis, the District Court was required to dismiss his complaint if failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2) is the same as that for dismissing a complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). To withstand scrutiny under \u00a7 1915(e)(2), \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 677, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Further, \u00a7 1915(e)(2) \u201caccords judges ... the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). \u201cExamples ... are claims describing fantastic or delusional scenarios ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We agree with the District Court that Brodzki\u2019s bare allegations, without more, were insufficient to state a claim under <em>Iqbal. </em>Further, in light of the nature of Brodzki\u2019s factual allegations, we perceive no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that granting Brodzki leave to amend his complaint would have been futile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, it was appropriate for the District Court to dismiss his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Nor was there any error in denying Brodzki\u2019s \u201cobjections\u201d inasmuch as the objections amounted to a motion to reconsider. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Caver v. City of Trenton, </em>420 F.3d 243, 258 (3d Cir.2005). To prevail on a motion for reconsideration, a litigant must demonstrate: \u201c(1) an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) the availability of new evidence ...; or (3) the need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir.1999). Brodzki\u2019s submission to the District Court did not satisfy any of these requirements, and the District Court appropriately denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Because Brodzki is proceeding, in forma pauperis on appeal, we must dismiss the appeal if it is legally frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\">. Before dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2), a plaintiff must be afforded the opportunity to amend the complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. See <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
