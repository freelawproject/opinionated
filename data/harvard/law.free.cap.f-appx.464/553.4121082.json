We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-21\">Brown defrauded her employer, a small, family-owned sheet-metal business, by forging checks drawn on her employer\u2019s bank accounts and depositing those checks into her personal bank accounts. Over a ten-year period, Brown forged more than 470 checks and embezzled approximately $800,000. The District Court sentenced Brown to seventy-two months\u2019 imprisonment\u2014an upward variance from the sentencing range of thirty-three to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Brown argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to further the statutory goals of sentencing and does not reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>appropriate consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We review the imposition of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines\u201d sentencing range; \u201cfailing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d; or \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although a court commits procedural error if it fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to recite each of the factors on the record, nor is it required to address each argument raised by the defendant. <em>United States v. Barron, </em>557 F.3d 866, 868 (8th Cir.2009). If the district court committed no procedural error, we then determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. It is \u201cthe unusual case when we reverse a district court sentence\u2014whether within, above, or below the applicable Guidelines range\u2014as substantively unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 464 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (quotation marks and citation to quoted case omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The District Court committed no procedural error in sentencing Brown. After considering the undisputed Guidelines range and the parties\u2019 sentencing arguments, the court found that the Guidelines range did not adequately account for the fact that Brown \u201cwork[ed] face-to-face in the same office with the same people for ... ten years and seven months\u201d as a seemingly \u201cgood, trusted employee and friend\u201d who was \u201cin a position of confidence and trust\u201d and yet embezzled almost $800,000. Sent. Tr. at 14, 15. The court noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and had focused specifically on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of th[e] offense,\u201d \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and \u201cthe seriousness of th[e] offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19, 20. Although the court considered imposing a ten-year prison term\u2014\u201ca year in prison for every year you stole from these people\u201d\u2014it ultimately determined that a seventy two-month sentence was appropriate \u201cfor the purpose of punishment, deterrence, and to serve the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 21. The court adequately explained its rationale for the sentence imposed, focusing on all the facts of Brown\u2019s case as well as the harm caused by her conduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court committed no procedural sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Brown also argues that the District Court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence that is substantively unreasonable. \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it fails to consider a relevant factor, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or considers only appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear error of judgment....\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>509 F.3d 911, 913 (8th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>553 U.S. 1088, 128 S.Ct. 2891, 171 L.Ed.2d 826 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Brown contends that the District Court did not give enough weight to certain mitigating factors. We disagree. The record demonstrates that the court was well aware of the circumstances surrounding Brown\u2019s embezzlement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>court reviewed Brown\u2019s Presentence Report, heard defense counsel\u2019s descriptions of Brown\u2019s positive characteristics and family circumstances, and heard testimony from Brown\u2019s employer about the impact her crimes had on his business. That the District Court\u2019s evaluation of these facts resulted in a lengthier sentence than Brown had hoped for does not constitute an abuse of discretion. The District Court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-12\">. The Honorable Dean Whipple, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. Brown argues that the court focused exclusively on the fact that she violated her employer's trust and confidence while ignoring other factors. As noted above, the record refutes Brown\u2019s assertions, and the court exercised its considerable discretion \"to weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... and assign some factors greater weight than others in determining an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>569 F.3d 374, 379 (8th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
