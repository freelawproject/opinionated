Barney appeals from the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the \u201cVeterans Court\u201d) that affirmed the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision denying Barney entitlement to veteran\u2019s benefits. <em>Barney v. Shinseki, </em>No. 08-2964, 2011 WL 759671 (Vet.App. Feb. 25, 2011). Because the Veterans Court did not err and we lack jurisdiction over factual issues, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">James Barney served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1959 to October 1961. While on active duty in August 1961, Barney underwent hernia surgery for a right inguinal hernia. From that surgery, the Department of Veterans Affairs (the \u201cVA\u201d) has granted Barney service connection for the postoperative residuals of a right inguinal hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-23\">In this proceeding, Barney claims that a back disorder is connected to his service in the Air Force, specifically arguing that his back disorder is connected to his inguinal hernia and resulting surgery. Barney also filed a claim for a total disability rating based on unemployability (\u201cTDIU\u201d). In 2008, the Board denied Barney\u2019s claim, finding that Barney\u2019s back disorder was not causally related to his active service. J.A. 17. In reaching that determination, the Board found that Barney did not provide the VA with an accurate medical history. JA. 28. The Board also denied Barney\u2019s TDIU claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-24\">Barney appealed to the Veterans Court, arguing that the Board did not provide an adequate basis for finding a lack of service connection, including the Board\u2019s finding that Barney did not provide accurate information to the VA. The court rejected Barney\u2019s arguments and upheld the Board\u2019s decision. JA. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-25\">After the opinion issued, Barney terminated his attorney and, representing himself, filed a motion for reconsideration. In his motion, Barney argued that the court should reconsider its decision because his former attorney failed to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>two forms in the Record of Proceeding, specifically Air Force Forms 509 and 75, although those documents appeared in the Record Before the Agency. According to Barney, the documents show that, only 20 days after the hernia surgery, the Air Force doctor discharged Barney to perform duties that included heavy lifting. In an email attached to Barney\u2019s motion, Barney\u2019s attorney explains that he did not include those forms in the Record of Proceeding because, while the forms were relevant to showing Barney\u2019s course of treatment and subsequent duties, \u201cwhen drafting the arguments, there was sufficient other evidence in my opinion that supported these propositions.\u201d JA. 11. The Veterans Court denied Barney\u2019s motion for reconsideration, JA. 14, and Barney thereafter appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans Court is limited by statute. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), a party may obtain review \u201cwith respect to the validity of a decision of the Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Under \u00a7 7292(d)(2), however, absent a constitutional issue we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Barney argues on appeal that the Veterans Court committed legal error, including violating his due process rights, because it failed to consider Air Force Forms 509 and 75. We disagree. First, the Veterans Court did not construe a statute or regulation in its opinion, and hence it committed no legal error. Second, Barney\u2019s allegations arise from his attorney\u2019s decision not to include Forms 509 and 75 in the Record of Proceeding, a decision that Barney is bound by. \u201cIt is well settled that a person is bound by the consequences of his representative\u2019s conduct, which includes both his acts and omissions.\u201d <em>Rowe v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>802 F.2d 434 (Fed.Cir.1986) (collecting cases). Thus, the actions of Barney\u2019s attorney in this proceeding were legally the actions of Barney himself and those actions have not been shown to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Barney also argues that the ultimate finding on service connection was clearly erroneous because it conflicts with a 1991 medical record that allegedly shows a service connection. We lack jurisdiction, however, to review the factual determination of service connection. <em>Johnson v. Derwinski, </em>949 F.2d 394, 395 (Fed.Cir. 1991) (holding that a denial of entitlement to service connection is a factual determination that we may not review). And, in any event, the 1991 medical record does not, on its face, appear to relate to Barney\u2019s back disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">We have considered Barney\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
