R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">California state prisoner Kou Cha appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Cha contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he failed to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination violated <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The only support Cha provided for his <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978) motion was that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to dismiss two Hispanic male potential jurors. In denying the motion, the trial court indicated that two Hispanic potential jurors remained in the jury box and a number of others were left on the panel. On that record, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Cha failed to make a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of <em>Batson v. Kentucky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Cha also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the gang sentencing enhancements he received under Cal. Pen.Code \u00a7 186.22(b)(1). The statute does not require that he knew that the gang members have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity. <em>See People v. Gamez, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 957, 286 Cal.Rptr. 894, <em>disapproved on other grounds in People v. Gardeley, </em>14 Cal.4th 605, 624 n. 10, 59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713 (1996). The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that there was sufficient evidence to support the gang sentencing enhancements was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Lewis v. Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 781, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Finally, Cha contends that his upper-term sentence violates his Sixth Amendment rights because it was based on aggravating facts found by a judge rather than by a jury. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that Cha\u2019s upper-term sentence is constitutional, based on the fact that he was on probation at the time of the underlying crime, was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Kessee v. Mendoza-Powers, </em>574 F.3d 675, 677 (9th Cir.2009). Any error related to other judicial fact-finding was harmless, because, under California law, one aggravating factor is sufficient to impose an upper-term sentence. <em>See People v. Black, </em>41 Cal.4th 799, 815, 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130 (2007); <em>see also Butler v. Curry, </em>528 F.3d 624, 642-43 (9th Cir.2008) (explaining that one aggravating factor is sufficient notwithstanding the language of Cal. R. Ct. 4.420(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">We construe Cha\u2019s additional arguments as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. So construed, the motion is denied. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e); <em>Hiivala </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir. 1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We construe Cha\u2019s September 20, 2011 letter as including a request to file a supplemental motion. So construed, the request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
