She posits three issues for review. The first is whether the BIA erred in determining that the material she presented with her motion to reopen would not establish that the dangerous circumstances and conditions prevailing in Guatemala when she moved to reopen in 2010 differed from those prevailing when an immigration judge (IJ) ordered her removed in 1998. The second is whether the BIA erred by not treating Perez\u2019s evidence of natural catastrophes in Guatemala as exacerbating the danger Perez faced based on her sex. The third is whether the BIA abused its discretion when it failed to reopen sua sponte to consider whether women in Guatemala may constitute a particular social group eligible for immigration relief pursuant to the remand in <em>Perdomo v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 662, 669 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">When judicial review of the denial of a motion to reopen is permitted, we employ a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even if we think the BIA\u2019s denial wrong, the ruling will stand if \u201cit is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Ordinarily, a motion to reopen must be filed in the BIA \u201cno later than within 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). This bar does not apply, however, if the motion is based on \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence [of change] is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing\u201d before the IJ. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); see <em>Enriquez-Gutierrez v. Holder, </em>612 F.3d 400, 409-10 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">A motion to reopen must state new facts to be proved at a hearing and must \u201cbe supported by ... evidentiary material.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA, in its gatekeeping function, concluded that, even assuming women in Guatemala could constitute a particular social group, Perez failed to present material that would show that contemporary circumstances in Guatemala differed from those existing there at the time of her hearing in 1998. In explaining its denial of Perez\u2019s motion, the BIA mentioned only the materials attached to that motion, although the administrative record contained also the United States State Department country reports for Guatemala that Perez filed when she sought immigration relief in 1997. When she moved to reopen in the BIA, however, Perez did not direct the BIA to any of the earlier materials and instead limited her argument to the new material presented with her motion to reopen\u2014material that did not present a basis for any determination about the circumstances existing in 1998 and whether they had changed. Given the limited argument and conclusory assertion of changed circumstances that Perez presented to the BIA, we cannot conclude that its denial of her motion to reopen was arbitrary, capricious, or irrational. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We reject Perez\u2019s second claim also. Perez cites no legal authority for the proposition that asylum or withholding of removal can be granted based on any exacerbating effects of a tropical storm, flooding, landslides, a volcanic eruption, or a sinkhole in an urban setting. An issue must be briefed to be preserved. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). We are not required to find the legal basis for Perez\u2019s claim. <em>See United States, v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 408 (5th Cir.2006). Because Perez has not presented any legal authority concerning, and thus has not preserved, the issue whether natural disasters may be considered in determining whether circumstances have worsened in Guatemala, we need not consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Additionally, we find unavailing Perez\u2019s contention that the BIA abused its discretion when it chose not to reopen sua sponte. Given that the provision for sua sponte reopening, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1003.2(a), vests the BIA with complete discretion to deny untimely motions to reopen, we have \u201cno legal standard by which to judge the ... ruling, and therefore ... lack[ ] jurisdiction\u201d to do so. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
