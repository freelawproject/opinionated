On appeal, Smith contends that the district court erred by not committing him to a suitable facility for mental health treatment in lieu of sentencing him to imprisonment, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244(d) (2006). Smith also asserts several challenges to his sentence and two of his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244(d), a defendant with a mental disease or defect may receive a provisional sentence and be committed for treatment prior to his final sentencing and incarceration. Commitment under \u00a7 4244(d) occurs if, after a hearing on the defendant\u2019s current mental condition, \u201cthe court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect and that he should, in lieu of being sentenced to imprisonment, be committed to a suitable facility for care or treatment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244(d). In making this determination, the district court is required to find both a mental disorder \u201cand that the defendant should be hospitalized in lieu of imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Buker, </em>902 F.2d 769, 770 (9th Cir.1990). A district court\u2019s determination as to a defendant\u2019s mental condition is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>920 F.2d 139, 146 (2d Cir.1990). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant should not be committed to a mental health facility in lieu of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 397 (4th Cir.2002) (reviewing for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination concerning a defendant\u2019s competency to be sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that, assuming Smith suffered from a mental disease or defect, important governmental interests would not be served by his commitment under the statute. <em>See United States v. Jensen, </em>639 F.3d 802, 805-06 (8th Cir.2011). Therefore, this claim entitles Smith to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">Next, Smith asserts several challenges to his sentence. We review a sentence for reasonableness, using an abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The first step in this review requires us to ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.2008). Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>dural errors include improperly calculating the Guidelines range or failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009). In determining whether a district court has properly applied a particular Guidelines provision, we review its factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Osborne, </em>514 F.3d 377, 387 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Smith first challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level increase in his offense level under U.S. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(3) (2010), based on its finding that he was engaged in sophisticated money laundering. Under USSG \u00a7 2S1.1(b)(3), a two-level enhancement in the defendant\u2019s offense level is warranted if the defendant is convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 and the offense involved sophisticated money laundering. The commentary to USSG \u00a7 2S1.1 defines sophisticated laundering as \u201ccomplex or intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 offense,\u201d that \u201ctypically involves the use of\u2019 fictitious entities, shell corporations, or layering of transactions. USSG \u00a7 2S1.1, cmt. n. 5(A). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Smith was engaged in sophisticated money laundering, warranting the two-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Smith next contends that the district court erred in imposing the two-level vulnerable victim enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), because there was no evidence to show that he actually knew that his victims, incarcerated inmates, were unusually vulnerable. The increase is warranted \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that the victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). In making this determination, the district court must find that a victim was unusually vulnerable, and assess whether the defendant knew or should have known of such vulnerability. <em>United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d 381, 388 (4th Cir.2010). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in imposing this enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Next, Smith challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of six consecutive twenty-four-month sentences for his multiple \u00a7 1028A convictions. Smith argues that his underlying fraud offenses were grouped under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2, and the district court procedurally erred by failing to explain its reasons for imposing six consecutive sentences for his multiple \u00a7 1028A convictions when the Guidelines recommended that these sentence run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, if a defendant wrongfully uses the identity of another person during and in relation to a bank or social security fraud, a sentencing court is required to impose a twenty-four-month sentence consecutive to the sentence imposed for the underlying fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A (a)(1), (b)(2). In cases where a defendant has been convicted of multiple counts under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), a court, in its discretion, can run each of the twenty-four-month sentences concurrently with one another, in whole or in part. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(b)(4). In exercising its discretion to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences for multiple convictions under \u00a7 1028A, the court must consider a non-exhaustive list of factors that includes the nature and gravity of the underlying offenses, whether those offenses are groupable under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2, and whether the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are better achieved with consecutive or concurrent sentences. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5G1.2 cmt. n. 2(B). The sentencing court must adequately explain its decision to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>consecutive sentences pursuant to \u00a7 1028A. <em>See United States v. Dvorak, </em>617 F.3d 1017, 1029 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">After reviewing the record, we find that the district court properly noted that Smith\u2019s underlying fraud offenses were grouped under USSG \u00a7 3D1.2, but in a proper exercise of its discretion, found that the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) were better achieved by imposing consecutive sentences. We conclude that the district court thoroughly considered those factors in making its determination, and the resulting sentence is not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Smith claims that the district court plainly erred in failing to dismiss, on its own motion, one of the counts of access device fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft to which he pled guilty because the evidence offered at sentencing showed that the Government could not prove the elements of the crimes. We note that, in making this argument, Smith does not challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cWhen a defendant pleads guilty, he waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings conducted prior to entry of the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Moussaoui, </em>591 F.3d 263, 279 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We find that because Smith\u2019s guilty plea to the crimes was both counseled and voluntary, he cannot now challenge his conviction based on his contention that the evidence at sentencing failed to prove the elements of those crimes. Thus, we conclude that Smith is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
