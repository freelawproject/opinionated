Thomas, seeking money damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for false arrest and malicious prosecution in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. On August 19, 2010, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action in its entirety. Kent now appeals. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-16\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Serricchio <em>v. Wachovia Secs. LLC, </em>658 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2011). The movant must \u201cshow[ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that] the movant is entitled to judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We must \u201cresolve all ambiguities, and credit all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn, in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Brown v. Henderson, </em>257 F.3d 246, 251 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate only if no rational fact-finder \u201ccould find in favor of the nonmoving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight.\u201d <em>Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P'ship, </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The absence of probable cause is a necessary element of both false arrest and malicious prosecution claims. <em>See Williams v. Town of Greenburgh, </em>535 F.3d 71, 78-79 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Cornejo v. Bell, </em>592 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2010) (stating that \u201cthe initiation of an action ... without probable cause to believe [the action] can succeed\u201d are two of four essential elements of a malicious prosecution claim in New York); <em>Escalera v. Lunn, </em>361 F.3d 737, 743 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]here can be no claim for false arrest where the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u201cProbable cause exists when [one] ha[s] knowledge of, or reasonably trustworthy information as to, facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>535 F.3d at 79 (internal quotation marks omitted). For false arrest claims, the probable cause inquiry focuses on the facts reasonably believed by the officers at the time of the arrest; even if it later turns out that the officers were mistaken, a mistake of fact would not undermine probable cause so long as their belief was objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>With respect to claims for malicious prosecution, we have held that \u201c[u]nder New York law, even when probable cause is present at the time of arrest, evidence could later surface which would eliminate that probable cause.\u201d <em>Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, </em>82 F.3d 563, 571 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">When considering whether the facts known to an officer give rise to probable cause, we must not \u201cconsider individual facts in isolation but [must] examine the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Delossantos, </em>536 F.3d 155, 161 (2d Cir.2008). In general, \u201c[a]n arresting officer advised of a crime by a person who claims to be the victim, and who has signed a complaint or information charging someone with the crime, has probable cause to effect an arrest absent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim\u2019s veracity.\u201d <em>Fulton v. Robinson, </em>289 F.3d 188, 195 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The only issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether defendants had probable cause. Defendants arrested Kent based on charges of \u201cgrand larceny in the third degree\u201d in violation of Section 155.35 of the New York Penal Law, and \u201cunlawful cutting of trees,\u201d in violation of Section 9-1501 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">We agree with the district court that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Kent, a reasonable jury could not find that defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Kent for larceny. \u201cA person steals property and commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself ..., he wrongfully takes, obtains, or withholds such property from an owner thereof.\u201d N.Y. Penal \u00a7 155.05(1). Defendants reasonably believed that Gladys Drought had authorized Kent to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>only 79 of the high-quality \u201csawtimber\u201d trees but, based on the DEC foresters\u2019 report, that Kent had removed at least 198 such trees, and had thus stolen more than 100 trees. Additional facts reasonably believed by defendants at the time of Kent\u2019s arrest supported their belief that Kent had stolen the trees. These additional facts include: (1) Drought\u2019s sworn statement to the police described Kent as having taken trees after dark the same day he had explicitly agreed not to; (2) Kent had not defined \u201ccull trees\u201d in Drought\u2019s contract but had done so in a contract with another individual; and (8) the contract indicated that Kent\u2019s mother had signed as a witness, but according to Drought, there had been no witness to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Kent argues that the district court erred in relying on the DEC foresters\u2019 report and in ignoring a second appraisal by forestry expert Bruce Robinson. It is undisputed that the second appraisal did not come into existence until after Kent\u2019s arrest. Thus, the report can have no bearing on Kent\u2019s false arrest claim, for probable cause is assessed at the time of arrest for this claim. <em>See Williams, </em>585 F.3d at 79. With respect to the assessment of probable cause for Kent\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, Kent points to no evidence to suggest that defendants took any action subsequent to Kent\u2019s arrest, so this claim, too, hinges on the question of whether the arrest was supported by probable cause. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. City of New York, </em>388 F.Supp.2d 179, 186 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (noting that because officer was not involved with criminal proceeding after the filing of the criminal complaint, probable cause should be assessed at the time of arrest). In any event, Kent has not demonstrated that defendants, assuming they reviewed the Robinson report, were unreasonable in crediting the findings of the DEC report over those of the Robinson report.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Kent also argues that defendants lacked probable cause because his dispute with Drought was a civil matter and not a criminal offense, and because there is evidence in the record that a forestry attorney believed the contract was valid. The district court correctly rejected these arguments. The contract\u2019s validity was irrelevant, and the fact that this case could also be characterized as a contract dispute did not preclude defendants from believing that Kent\u2019s actions satisfied the elements of larceny. The more than 100-tree discrepancy between the number of \u201csawtimber\u201d trees harvested according to the DEC report and the number of \u201csawtimber\u201d trees contracted for allowed a person of reasonable caution to conclude that Kent had intended to steal these additional trees. Regarding the contract, defendants could reasonably have concluded that Kent had used the pretext of the contract\u2014valid or not\u2014to take considerably more \u201csawtimber\u201d lumber than the contract authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Moreover, the DEC report gave defendants reason to believe that Kent had lied when he claimed that the additional \u201csaw-timber\u201d trees were \u201ccull\u201d trees, and they had reason to believe that Kent had intended to pass off the additional high-quality \u201csawtimber\u201d trees as lower-quality \u201ccull\u201d trees. Although Kent argues that there were valid explanations for his actions, defendants \u201cw[ere] not required to explore and eliminate every plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest,\u201d <em>Jaegly v. Couch, </em>439 F.3d 149, 153 (2d Cir.2006); indeed, \u201c[t]he fact that an innocent explanation may be consistent with the facts alleged ... does not negate probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Fama, </em>758 F.2d 834, 838 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">We have reviewed the remainder of Kent\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>of the district court hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
