Baez contends that the declaration of civil forfeiture must be set aside because he did not receive actual notice of the forfeiture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plain language of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (\u201cCAFRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e)(1)(A), forecloses Baez\u2019s argument. The statute requires only that the government take <em>reasonable steps </em>to provide notice to potentially interested parties; it does not require actual notice. Moreover, Baez cannot show that he did not know, or have reason to know, of the seizure within sufficient time to file a timely claim, as CAFRA requires, since the monies were seized from his person. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-23\">Baez\u2019s additional contention that due process requires that he receive actual notice prior to the forfeiture of his assets is likewise without merit. \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the United States ... from depriving any person of property without \u2018due process of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Dusenbery v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 161, 167, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002). \u201c[I]ndividuals whose property interests are at stake are entitled to \u2018notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Due process requires only that the notice afforded to interested persons be \u201c \u2018reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise [them] of the pendency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 122 S.Ct. 694 (quoting <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">CAFRA\u2019s requirement that the government take reasonable steps to provide potential claimants with notice mirrors the requirements of the Due Process Clause. Due process plainly does not require actual notice. <em>See id. </em>at 170-71, 122 S.Ct. 694 (rejecting inmate\u2019s claim that the government was required to assure delivery of notice of forfeiture to his cell and noting that \u201cour cases have never required actual notice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-20\">. The government contends that Baez waived this argument by raising it for the first time on appeal. <em>Pro se </em>litigants, however, are held to a lesser standard where their compliance with statutory procedural requirements is at issue. <em>See Draper v. Coombs, </em>792 F.2d 915, 924 (9th Cir. 1986). We therefore construe Baez\u2019s arguments before the district court that his attorneys advised him against pursuing the return, of his property as having raised the notice issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
