Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Cabrera\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
