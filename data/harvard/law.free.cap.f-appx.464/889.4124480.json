Because we conclude that the Veterans Court correctly denied El Malik\u2019s petition as failing to present a claim to an indisputable right to such extraordinary relief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The Secretary of Veterans Affairs \u201cmay recognize any individual as an agent or attorney for the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims under laws administered by the Secretary.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(a). The VA may require that such individuals establish good moral character and reputation, as well as demonstrate qualifications and competency to represent claimants, as prerequisites to accreditation. <em>Id. </em>The VA regulations further specify the standards for accreditation of attorneys. <em>See, e.g., </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.629(b). Among other things, the regulations require applicants for accreditation to disclose information regarding any criminal background. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14.629(b)(2)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">After notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the VA may \u201csuspend or exclude from further practice before the Department\u201d any previously accredited attorney who has \u201cviolated or refused to comply with any of the laws administered by the Secretary, or with any of the regulations or instructions governing practice before the Department....\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(b)(4). The regulations provide that accreditation may be cancelled if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney has violated any applicable VA law, including proof that the attorney has \u201c[d]emand[ed] or accepted] unlawful compensation for preparing, presenting, prosecuting, or advising or consulting, concerning a claim....\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.633(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">El Malik\u2019s accreditation to represent claimants before the VA was cancelled on April 28, 2005 based on charges that he knowingly presented false information to the VA and accepted unlawful compensation in exchange for his representation. In particular, it was found that El Malik stated on his application for accreditation that he had never been a defendant in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>criminal proceeding, when in fact he was a defendant in several criminal cases. El Malik was also found to have charged fees for his services prior to the Board of Veterans Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBVA\u201d) final decision in certain matters he was handling, in violation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1) (2005) which prohibited such a practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Both the BVA and the Veterans Court upheld the cancellation of El Malik\u2019s accreditation, rejecting El Malik\u2019s arguments on the merits of the charges against him, as well as his contention that the cancellation violated his constitutional right to due process. El Malik then appealed to this court. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we did not have jurisdiction to examine the merits of El Malik\u2019s termination, but we rejected his due process arguments. <em>El Malik v. Shinseki, </em>374 Fed.Appx. 980 (Fed.Cir.2010). Upon a careful review of the record, the alleged due process violations\u2014that the VA postponed his hearing, failed to communicate with his counsel, and appointed a non-VA hearing officer\u2014 were found to be \u201cunconvincing,\u201d and in any event El Malik failed to show any prejudice or harm as a result of the alleged violations. <em>Id. </em>at 981. El Malik\u2019s cancellation of his accreditation thus became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">El Malik then filed a new application for accreditation on September 27, 2010. On April 8, 2011, the VA returned El Malik\u2019s application to him along with a letter explaining that the VA would not reinstate his accreditation. The letter noted that the VA has the authority to permit reinstatement of attorneys whose accreditations are cancelled for receipt of unlawful fees under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-9\">If the Secretary ... suspends or excludes from further practice before the Department any agent or attorney who collects or receives a fee in excess of the amount authorized under this section, the suspension shall continue until the agent or attorney makes full restitution to each claimant from whom the agent or attorney collected or received an excessive fee. If the agent or attorney makes such restitution, the Secretary may reinstate such agent or attorney under such rules as the Secretary may prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The letter further noted that the VA has discretion as to whether and under what circumstances such reinstatement should occur, even if the required restitution has been made. All-12 (quoting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a) (\u201cThe Secretary has authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the Department. ...\u201d)). While the VA opted to permit reinstatement for suspended accreditations under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.633(g), the VA \u201cdecided that an individual whose accreditation has been cancelled should no longer be permitted to represent claimants before the Department,\u201d and so there were no rules prescribed for reinstatement of such individuals. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">El Malik filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Veterans Court, alleging that he was improperly denied reinstatement of his accreditation based on his new application. El Malik\u2019s petition relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>on \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C), which he contended required his application to be considered. He also pointed to regulations existing in 2005 providing that the records of cases where accreditations are terminated will be maintained in the General Counsel\u2019s office for three years from the date of the final termination decision. 53 Fed.Reg. 52416 (Dec. 28, 1988) (revising 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.633(g)); 76 Fed.Reg. 58009, 58012-13 (October 12, 2007) (again revising \u00a7 14.633 to remove the three-year maintenance of termination records provision). El Malik took the regulations to mean that after three years he would be entitled to reinstatement. He further contended that the VA findings relied upon to disaccredit him in 2005 could not be used to reject his new application for accreditation, under principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. Finally, El Malik alleged that the VA\u2019s failure to reinstate him violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The Veterans Court found that El Malik failed to meet the requirements for issuance of a writ of mandamus: (1) that the party seeking issuance of the writ has no other adequate means to attain the desired relief, which ensures that the writ is not utilized to circumvent the normal appeals process; (2) that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable;\u201d and (3) that the court is satisfied in its discretion that granting the writ is appropriate under the circumstances. Al-2 (citing <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>542 U.S. 367, 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004)). The Veterans Court viewed El Malik\u2019s petition as relitigating the same issues raised in his earlier appeal, and cautioned him not to raise issues before this court that have already been decided. Because El Malik\u2019s claims were believed to have already been adjudicated and rejected, El Malik\u2019s petition was dismissed as unable to satisfy the stringent criteria for a writ or mandamus. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We have jurisdiction over the issue of whether the Veterans Court properly denies a petition for writ of mandamus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a); <em>Cox v. West, </em>149 F.3d 1360, 1363-64 (Fed.Cir.1998); <em>see also Lamb v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2002). \u201cThe remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Accordingly, because \u201c[ijssuance of the writ is in large part a matter of discretion with the court to which the petition is addressed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119, we review the Veterans Coui't\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lamb, </em>284 F.3d at 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">As a threshold matter, the Veterans Court mischaracterized the arguments made in El Malik\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. The petition does not seek to relitigate the 2005 cancellation of El Malik\u2019s accreditation. Rather, it seeks to compel the VA to reinstate his accreditation based on his new application filed in 2010. A4 (seeking, as specified under \u201cRELIEF SOUGHT\u201d heading, \u201c[rjeinstatement of accreditation pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C)\u201d). The issues and arguments made by El Malik are plainly distinct from those previously raised, as he is now relying primarily on the text of \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C) and the three-year record maintenance regulations in effect in 2005 to assert that his new application must be considered by the VA even though his accreditation was previously cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Nonetheless, the Veterans Court\u2019s mischaracterization of El Malik\u2019s argument was harmless because he is not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>mandamus relief under his theory. El Malik\u2019s theory on appeal may be essentially expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">(1) The VA has no rules or procedures in place for accreditation of attorneys whose prior accreditations were can-celled\u2014rules and procedures exist only to reinstate \u201csuspended\u201d attorneys;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(2) The regulations in effect in 2005 provided that the record of El Malik\u2019s 2005 accreditation cancellation would be maintained for only three years, making El Malik\u2019s cancellation in fact only a three year suspension;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">(S) El Malik\u2019s new application for accreditation was filed in 2010, more than three years after the 2005 decision to \u201ccancel\u201d his accreditation, but due to the absence of rules and procedures no formal examination or appealable denial of his application was made\u2014it was simply returned to him; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-8\">(4) Section 5904(c)(3)(C) imposes an obligation on the VA to consider an application for accreditation by formerly suspended practitioners;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-9\">(5) Therefore, El Malik\u2019s new application for accreditation should be granted, but he has no avenue for relief before the VA, and so a writ of mandamus is necessary to direct the VA to process his application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">We find El Malik\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">First, the regulations in effect in 2005 provided only that the records of El Malik\u2019s cancellation proceedings \u201cwill be maintained in the General Counsel\u2019s office for 3 years.\u201d 53 Fed.Reg. 52416 (Dec. 28, 1988) (revising 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.633(g)). This regulation does not deem all cancellations mere three-year suspensions, but simply prescribes rules for recordkeeping. The VA regulations carefully differentiate between provisions that apply to suspension and those that apply to cancellation. <em>Compare </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 14.633(b), (c), (d) (2012) (providing for various instances when accreditation \u201cshall be canceled\u201d) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 14.633(g) (\u201cThe General Counsel may suspend the accreditation of a [practitioner] under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, for a definite period or until the conditions for reinstatement ... are satisfied.\u201d). We would be remiss to muddle such distinctions by reading a record-keeping provision that is silent as to the effect of the expiration of the three-year period, as one that somehow converts a cancelled accreditation into a mere suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Second, \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C) does not require the VA to re-accredit any suspended practitioners, but only permits such action at the VA\u2019s discretion, providing that \u201cthe Secretary <em>may </em>reinstate such agent or attorney under such rules as the Secretary may prescribe.\u201d Even if the VA elects to permit such re-accreditation, \u00a7 5904(c)(3)(C) expressly applies only to suspensions due to unlawful fee collection, and requires that the suspension <em>\u201cshall </em>continue until the agent or attorney makes full restitution to each claimant from whom the agent or attorney collected or received an excessive fee.\u201d We see no evidence that El Malik has undertaken the prerequisite restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">Because the above discussion dispels the possibility of any \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to the relief requested by the petition, <em>Cheney, </em>542 U.S. at 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, we agree with the Veterans Court\u2014 albeit on different grounds\u2014that a writ of mandamus is inappropriate in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b919-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Veterans Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1) was subsequently amended in 2006 to prohibit the charging of fees for services rendered \"before the date on which a notice of disagreement is filed with respect to a case,\u201d replacing the existing language of \"before the date on which the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals made a final decision in a case.\u201d Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, P.L. 109-461, 120 Stat. 3403, 3407 (December 22, 2006).
