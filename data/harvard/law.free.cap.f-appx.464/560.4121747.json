Shah contends that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not based on substantial evidence, and that the BIA erred in dismissing his asylum claim as untimely because he had demonstrated extraordinary circumstances excusing his delay. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The BIA correctly held that Shah\u2019s asylum claim was time-barred. Shah applied for asylum more than one year after his last entry into the United States and has not demonstrated any extraordinary circumstances justifying his delay. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B),(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">We review a finding of adverse credibility for substantial evidence. <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1253 (9th Cir.2003). An adverse credibility determination will be upheld on review unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Antonyan v. Holder, </em>642 F.3d 1250, 1254 (9th Cir.2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">The BIA based its adverse credibility finding on misrepresentations Shah made on a worksheet in preparation for his bond hearing and discrepancies between Shah\u2019s testimony and declaration and the affidavits of his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-17\">Shah\u2019s misrepresentations on his bond worksheet support an adverse credibility finding. The fact that a petitioner \u201cchose to lie to immigration authorities ... always counts as substantial evidence supporting an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Singh v. Holder, </em>643 F.3d 1178, 1181 (9th Cir.2011). The BIA relied on Shah\u2019s oral testimony during his removal hearing in which he admitted that he lied on his bond worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">Shah also testified that he and his two friends were detained and beaten by the police on two separate occasions. However, his friends\u2019 affidavits do not mention these events. These are material omissions since they concern the basis of Shah\u2019s withholding of removal claim and are thus sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2011). Absent credible testimony, Shah\u2019s CAT claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b587-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
