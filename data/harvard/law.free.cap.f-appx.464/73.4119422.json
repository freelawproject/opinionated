For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The procedural history of this case and the details of Tormasi\u2019s claims are well known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, Tormasi filed a civil rights complaint alleging that Appellees denied him access to the courts when they confiscated some of his legal materials and disciplined him for possession of contraband. The District Court granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and Tormasi filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and review the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Burns v. PA Def't of Corr., </em>642 F.3d 163, 170 (3d Cir.2011). A grant of summary judgment will be affirmed if our review reveals that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Although his state post-conviction proceedings were over, Tormasi claims that he was afraid that if he filed future state post-conviction petitions or a federal habeas petition, he would be disciplined for possessing his appendices which contained the <em>Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook. </em>We agree with the District Court that Appellees did not impede Tormasi\u2019s litigation of any claims challenging his criminal conviction. As noted by the District Court, Tormasi could have simply referred to his prior briefs for citations to the material or arranged for a copy of the contraband materials to be sent to the state or federal court. Thus, the fact that Tormasi is not permitted to possess the <em>Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook </em>in prison does not violate his right to access to the courts or his freedom of speech. Because we agree with the District Court that Appellees did not did not impede or frustrate Tormasi\u2019s claims regarding his criminal conviction, we need not address whether his potential claims had any merit. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Tormasi also argues that the seizure of his documents and the disciplinary action against him was an exaggerated response by Appellees. Tormasi argued that the contents of the <em>Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook </em>are available to prisoners. To support this argument, he submitted over three hundred pages of encyclopedia entries on ammunition, explosives, grenades, gunpowder, rockets, etc. He does not explain how any specific entry corresponds to a section of the <em>Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook </em>or how the passages from the encyclopedia would threaten prison security in a manner similar to the <em>Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook. </em>We agree with the District Court that the Appellees\u2019 confiscation of the Anarchist\u2019s Cookbook from a prisoner was a reasonable response to the security concerns that book poses to a correctional environment. <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
