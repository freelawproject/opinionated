We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-28\">A district court cannot reject a magistrate judge\u2019s credibility determinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>made in a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on a motion to suppress without conducting a <em>de novo, </em>live evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Bergera, </em>512 F.2d 391, 392 (9th Cir.1975). There is \u201cno procedural burden on the defendant to request that the district court take live testimony\u201d in this circumstance. <em>United States v. Ridgway, </em>300 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s ruling, in rejecting the magistrate judge\u2019s report \u201cin its entirety,\u201d rejects all credibility determinations made by the magistrate judge. From a review of the record, it seems that the magistrate judge made at least two credibility determinations. He at least determined that Agent Winnecke\u2019s testimony about Saban\u2019s Car Rental policy (conflicting with other police officers\u2019 testimony) was not truthful. He also questioned Agent Winnecke\u2019s testimony about whether the length of time the defendants\u2019 vehicle was parked in a store parking lot was really suspicious. Therefore, based on <em>Bergera, </em>we remand this case to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing before rejecting the magistrate judge\u2019s credibility determinations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">At oral argument, Schultz requested that this court allow him to join in his co-defendant\u2019s argument regarding this issue, because he did not include the argument in his briefs. This court \u201cwill not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Ullah, </em>976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, one exception to this rule is if a \u201cfailure to raise the issue did not prejudice the defense of the opposing party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Here, the Government clearly will not be prejudiced in its defense of this due process issue, because it fully briefed the issue in its Answering Brief to Wallace. <em>See also United States v. Hanley, </em>190 F.3d 1017, 1029 n. 4 (9th Cir.1999) (allowing a defendant to join in an argument not raised in his opening brief because \u201cthe issue is not defendant-specific and the [Gjovernment will suffer no resulting prejudice from our decision, as it has briefed the issue thoroughly\u201d). Thus, our disposition applies to both Schultz and Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"ATW\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\">. We express no opinion as to the merits of defendants\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence. Rather, our decision is limited to the procedure the district court must follow if it disagrees with the magistrate's recommendation and rejects a credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
