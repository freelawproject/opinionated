Southeast prevailed, and filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to Fla.Stat. \u00a7 768.79. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>denied the motion, and Southeast appealed to this court. We certified questions to the Supreme Court of Florida,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> including the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">DOES FLORIDA STATUTE \u00a7 768.79 APPLY TO CASES THAT ARE GOVERNED BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION; AND, IF SO, IS THIS STATUTE APPLICABLE EVEN TO CONTROVERSIES IN WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED TO BE BOUND BY THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In the indemnity contract, the parties agreed that the substantive law of Michigan would apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of Florida answered the certified question in the negative, holding that \u00a7 768.79 is substantive in nature for conflict of laws purposes, that no sufficient public policy concerns override the parties\u2019 right to choose the law of a particular forum that governs the substantive portions of their contract, and thus that \u00a7 768.79 simply does not apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Florida Supreme Court also disapproved of <em>BDO Seidman, LLP v. British Car Auctions, Inc., </em>802 So.2d 366, 368 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Although the judgment of the district court denying attorney\u2019s fees and costs was based upon a different ground, we affirm on the ground articulated by the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b881-10\">. <em>Auto-Owners Ins.
