Hanns, appeals his status as a career offender, based upon two prior state convictions for second-degree assault that were classified as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u00a7 4B1.2(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Mr. Hanns was charged in May 2007 with carjacking and firearms offenses, 1 R. 14-23, and pled guilty to one count of carjacking (count five), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119, and one count of use of a firearm during a crime of violence (count seven), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), 1 R. 24-37. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) revealed, inter alia, two prior state convictions for second-degree assault and classified these offenses as crimes of violence. 3 R. 11, 15. Due in part to this classification, Mr. Hanns was found to be a career offender as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)\u2014thus increasing his Guidelines range. 3 R. 11. Mr. Hanns objected to the PSR, 1 R. 51-66, and the government responded, 1 R. 67-74. The district court overruled Mr. Hanns\u2019s objections. <em>See </em>Order Overruling Objections to PreSentence Report, <em>United States v. Hanns, </em>No. 07-cr-00182-REB-02, ECF No. 321 (D.Colo. July 29, 2011) (hereinafter \u201cOrder\u201d). He was sentenced to 157 months\u2019 imprisonment, with three years\u2019 supervised release for count five and five years\u2019 supervised release for count seven to run concurrently. 1 R. 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>643 F.3d 802, 804 (10th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the Guidelines, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">In Colorado, an individual commits second degree assault when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-13\">For a purpose other than lawful medical or therapeutic treatment, he intentionally causes stupor, unconsciousness, or other physical or mental impairment or injury to another person by administering to him, without his consent, a drug, substance, or preparation capable of producing the intended harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzHP\">Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-203(l)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">In determining whether a crime is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we first take a categorical approach and \u201clook[] only to the statutory definition! ] of the prior offense!], and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d <em>See United States v. Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d 1282, 1284 (10th Cir.2005). If the statute is broad enough to encompass both violent and nonviolent crimes, however, \u201ca court can look beyond the statute to certain records of the prior proceeding, such as the charging documents, the judgment, any plea thereto, and findings by the sentencing court.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). This court has already decided that Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-203(l)(e) does not proscribe a crime of violence, as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)\u2014 meaning that it does not necessarily involve the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>States v. Rodriguez-Enriquez, </em>518 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir.2008). Therefore, as argued by Mr. Hanns, second degree assault in Colorado does not meet the definition of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l), which shares the \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d language with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Furthermore, again as argued by Mr. Hanns, it is not one of the enumerated felonies listed in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Thus, in order to be classified as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the second-degree assault statute must qualify under the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Mr. Hanns argues that the second-degree assault statute does not qualify under the residual clause because it does not involve risk of physical injury, but even if it does, it still would not qualify because it does not involve violent and aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Whether Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-203(l)(e) constitutes a crime of violence under the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is an issue of first impression for this court. The Supreme Court, however, recently considered whether an Indiana law criminalizing vehicle flight from police constituted a crime of violence under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which is identical to the residual clause at issue here. In <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Court held that vehicle flight is a crime of violence because it can \u201ccause serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2274. Addressing the argument that \u201cvehicle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the [ACCA\u2019s] residual clause demands,\u201d the Court distinguished <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), upon which Mr. Hanns relies heavily. <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275-76. <em>Begay </em>held that driving under the influence is not a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA because the crimes listed in the residual clause all involve \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct\u201d\u2014suggesting a \u201chigher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\u201d usually present in a DUI. 553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (internal quotations omitted). <em>Sykes </em>distinguished <em>Begay </em>by explaining that vehicle flight \u201chas a stringent <em>mens rea </em>requirement and violators must act <em>knowingly or intentionally.\u201d Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2275 (second emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted). The \u201cpurposeful or intentional\u201d <em>mens rea </em>requirement in the state statute concerning vehicle flight was therefore similar to the enumerated crimes listed in the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and precluded application of the <em>Begay </em>exception. <em>Id. </em>at 2276. The Court also found that \u201c[s]erious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight,\u201d making vehicle flight a crime of violence for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">This court applied <em>Sykes </em>in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>652 F.3d 1244 (10th Cir. 2011), and held that a person in the custody of a juvenile officer commits a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the ACCA by violating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 650.2. Holding that the conduct at issue was \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed to the enumerated examples preceding the [residual clause],\u201d <em>Smith, </em>652 F.3d at 1247 (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>559 F.3d 1143, 1147 (10th Cir.2009)), we held that assaulting a state official requires a \u201cstringent <em>means rea </em>requirement ... beyond strict liability\u201d and results in a sort of \u201cpowder keg\u201d situation, which could result in physical injury at any moment, <em>id. </em>at 1248^9.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Additionally, this court has applied <em>Sykes </em>in determining whether a crime constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). In <em>Thomas, </em>we relied on <em>Sykes </em>to hold that a defendant\u2019s willful refusals to stop for police under Kansas law were crimes of violence under the residual clause for substantially the same reasons that the Supreme Court articulated in <em>Sykes. </em>643 F.3d at 806. In <em>Thomas, </em>like in <em>Sykes, </em>we noted that the <em>Begay </em>exception for strict liability and negligence crimes did not apply. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Armijo, </em>651 F.3d 1226, 1237 (10th Cir.2011), we held that \u201conly those versions of manslaughter that involve intentional or purposeful behavior qualify as crimes of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a),\u201d excluding Colorado\u2019s manslaughter statute that addressed only reckless conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We hold that the statute at issue in this case includes an \u201cintentional\u201d <em>mens rea </em>requirement, thus fulfilling the <em>Sykes </em>standard and precluding <em>Begay\u2019s </em>exception. The crime is also similar in risk, as well as in degree, to the enumerated crimes listed in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). As the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">a person who is in a stupor or who is suffering from physical or mental impairment is at significant risk of physical injury from falling and from assaults or other harmful actions taken by others who may choose to take advantage of the victim\u2019s impairment or impairments. In addition, a person suffering from mental impairment is at risk of physical injury also <em>from </em>the exercise of impaired judgment about what actions to take, including in the operation of a motor vehicle. Like the excessive consumption of alcohol, these conditions present a serious potential risk of physical injury to both the victim of the assault in the second degree and to those persons in the presence of the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Order at 6. Moreover, the administration of drugs by someone who is not a licensed doctor to a victim whose medical history and other physical characteristics are unknown to the perpetrator poses a substantial risk of physical injury to the victim. Therefore, the district court correctly held that a violation of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-203(l)(e) is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-26\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
