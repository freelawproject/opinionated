Keller and plaintiff Frank Russo<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant Macon County Greyhound Park (\u201cMCGP\u201d) on the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that MCGP willfully violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (\u201cFAC-TA\u201d). FACTA prohibits merchants from printing more than the last five digits of a customer\u2019s credit or debit card number on a customer\u2019s receipt. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c(g). Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a), \u201c[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with [this] requirement ... with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer.\u201d In <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, </em>551 U.S. 47, 56-57, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 2208-09, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007), the Supreme Court construed \u201cwillfully\u201d in \u00a7 1681n(a) as including both \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d violations of FACTA. Recklessness entails \u201can unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that it should be known.\u201d <em>Safeco, </em>551 U.S. at 68, 127 S.Ct. at 2215 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-19\">In December 2007, the plaintiffs filed a single count complaint alleging that MCGP willfully violated FACTA between October and December 2007 by issuing receipts to the plaintiffs and other MCGP customers showing customers\u2019 full credit and debit card numbers. The district court granted summary judgment to MCGP because the evidence created no issue of material fact as to whether MCGP \u201cwillfully\u201d violated FACTA; the evidence, if anything, showed that MCGP\u2019s FACTA violations were neither \u201cknowing\u201d nor \u201creckless.\u201d See <em>Burr, </em>551 U.S. at 56-57, 127 S.Ct. at 2208-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-20\">After oral argument and review of the record, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>MCGP.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-21\">. The district court excluded Plaintiff Russo from the Keller class because Russo's claim was not typical of the class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-22\">. Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Greenberg v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
