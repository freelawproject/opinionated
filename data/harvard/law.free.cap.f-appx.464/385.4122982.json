The Cantus then initiated an adversary proceeding against the International Bank of Commerce (\u201cIBC\u201d). Before they filed for bankruptcy, the Cantus had been engaged in arbitration and state court litigation with IBC. In the bankruptcy case, the Cantus and IBC entered into a settlement agreement that resolved all controversies between them. The bankruptcy court approved the parties\u2019 settlement agreement and entered a written order providing that IBC had an \u201cAllowed Claim\u201d in excess of $2.2 million, that IBC continued to have a perfected first lien security interest in all accounts receivable of Marco Cantu and his law firm, and that IBC was entitled to 75% of Cantu\u2019s future case revenues in satisfaction the Allowed Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">Several months later, the Cantus\u2019 bankruptcy case converted to chapter 7 and a trustee was appointed. It then emerged that Marco Cantu had an interest in the settlement from a personal injury case filed by his law firm after the conversion of the Cantus\u2019 bankruptcy to chapter 7 and that Cantu had actually received a portion of the settlement funds but had not disclosed those funds. The Cantus filed a \u201cMotion to Clarify\u201d the bankruptcy court\u2019s prior order, seeking a declaration that the personal injury lawsuit proceeds were not subject to IBC\u2019s lien. The bankruptcy court denied that motion, holding that IBC had a valid post-petition lien on the lawsuit proceeds and reaffirming that, under the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, IBC was entitled to 75% of future revenues received by Cantu. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">On appeal, the Cantus argue they are not bound by the settlement agreement on three grounds: (1) the party bound by the settlement agreement is the chapter 7 trustee, not the Cantus; (2) it would not be equitable to hold the Cantus to the settlement agreement post-conversion; and (3) \u00a7\u00a7 348 and 552 of the Bankruptcy Code operate to relieve the Cantus\u2019 post-conversion property from IBC\u2019s lien. The Cantus waived their first two arguments by failing to raise them in the district court, and they have not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances justifying consideration of those arguments on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">The Cantus\u2019 non-waived third argument fails because, as the district court correctly found, \u00a7\u00a7 348 and 552 of the Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Code do not exempt Marco Cantu\u2019s lawsuit proceeds from IBC\u2019s post-petition lien. Section 348(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">A claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, other than a claim specified in section 503(b) of this title, shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had arisen immediately before the date of the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 552(a) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, property acquired by the estate or by the debtor after commencement of the case is not subject to any lien resulting from any security agreement entered into by the debtor before the commencement of the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The Cantus maintain that because IBC\u2019s original lien arose prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case, the property they acquired post-petition cannot be subject to the lien if the lien has not been revived. They admit that, absent conversion, the settlement agreement approved by the bankruptcy court would have revived the lien. However, because their case was converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy, they maintain that under \u00a7 348(b), the settlement agreement must be treated as if the parties entered into it before the commencement of the case and hence that, under \u00a7 552(a), Cantu\u2019s post-petition receivables are not subject to any lien resulting from the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The Cantus\u2019 argument is flawed in at least two ways. First, they mistakenly assume that the parties\u2019 settlement agreement constituted a \u201cclaim,\u201d and, second, they conflate the terms \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201csecurity agreement.\u201d Under the Bankruptcy Code, the term \u201cclaim\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">(A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">(B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to any equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">As the district court explained, \u201c[IBC\u2019s] claim, ie., right to payment, did not \u2018arise\u2019 at the time the claim was <em>resolved </em>through the parties\u2019 agreement and through subsequent court approval.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cIBC\u2019s security interest in Cantu\u2019s post-petition receivables as created by the Settlement Agreement and Order cannot be deemed under \u00a7 348(d) to have arisen pre-petition,\u201d and \u201c \u00a7 348(d) does not transform IBC\u2019s lien into one resulting from a security agreement entered into \u2018before the commencement of the case\u2019 so as to trigger application of \u00a7 552(a).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">We have considered the Cantus\u2019 arguments to the contrary and find them to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
