We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">We review BIA decisions on motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Yan\u2019s second renewed motion to reopen was number barred and untimely because he filed it more than five years after his final removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Nevertheless, the 90-day timeliness requirement does not apply to motions to reopen based on changed country conditions, so long as the new evidence is material, was previously unavailable, and could not have been discovered and presented at the prior hearing. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h). Changed country conditions are distinct from changed personal circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">As a preliminary matter, we find Yan exhausted his claim of deteriorating country conditions because he argued before the BIA that China\u2019s conditions had deteriorated before <em>and after </em>the Olympics. Nevertheless, we conclude the BIA did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Yan\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">First, while Yan\u2019s Falun Gong practice may have changed his <em>personal </em>circumstances, it did not change the conditions in China. Second, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Falun Gong repression has been ongoing since Yan\u2019s 2003 hearing, so he could have, and should have, made the argument then. While Yan suggests China increased repression of Falun Gong practitioners in the lead up to the Olympics, there is evidence that repression of Falun Gong practitioners has been constant and ongoing since Yan\u2019s 2003 hearing. Third, the BIA\u2019s references to Yan\u2019s submitted evidence, \u201cdemonstrate that it has considered such evidence\u201d and rejected it. <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">To conclude, it was not an abuse of discretion to find no changed country conditions and to deny Yan\u2019s motion as untimely. We have considered and reject Yan\u2019s other arguments. Yan\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
