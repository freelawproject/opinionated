He contends he is eligible for a sentence reduction based upon Amendment 599 (clarifying the circumstances sentencing enhancements should apply to use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence) to the commentary to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.4 (establishing Guideline sentence for, <em>inter alia, </em>defendants convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Conner, </em>537 F.3d 480, 489 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Government maintains McDaniel\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely and this appeal is, therefore, subject to dismissal. The untimely filing of a notice of appeal, however, is not jurisdictional and can be waived in a criminal case. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 207-14, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007)); Fed R.Apf. P. 4(b)(1)(A). Because the Government evidences its intent to waive the issue, we need not decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In 1996, McDaniel pleaded guilty to armed bank robbery (count one), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and to use and carrying of a firearm during, and in relation to, a crime of violence (count two), in violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1). After applying various offense-level enhancements and adjustments, including a three-level adjustment, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3A1.2(a), for assaulting an official victim, and a two-level obstruction of justice adjustment, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3C1.2, for reckless endangerment, the district court sentenced McDaniel to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment for count one, to be served consecutively with 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for count two, for a total of 355 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court also determined that McDaniel was a career offender pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Amendment 599 amends the commentary to Guideline \u00a7 2K2.4, and clarifies \u201cunder what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses\u201d. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599 (Nov. 2000). The Amendment expanded the commentary to clarify its application, \u201cconsistent with the definition of \u2018offense\u2019 found in \u00a7 1B1.10 ... and with general guideline principles\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the <em>discretionary </em>modification of defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive Guidelines amendments, as set forth in the Guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). If an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d, a sentence reduction is not consistent with Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10 and is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Government concedes Amendment 599 applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>retroactively. <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">McDaniel contends that, in the light of Amendment 599 and his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1) for using and carrying a firearm during, and in relation to, a crime of violence, the district court should <em>not </em>have applied the two Chapter Three adjustments. Because the facts supporting each adjustment involved the use of a firearm, he claims those adjustments are more appropriately considered specific offense characteristics; consequently, he contends application of these adjustments along with his conviction for the firearm offense constituted impermissible \u201cdouble-counting\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">At the time of McDaniel\u2019s sentencing, the Guidelines provided: if sentences were to be imposed for both a violation of \u00a7 924(c) and for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristics for the possession, use, or discharge of a firearm should <em>not </em>be applied to the underlying offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 cmt. n. 2 (1991). Although Amendment 599 altered and clarified the text of the relevant Application Note, it did <em>not </em>change the general rule against applying the firearms enhancements to the underlying offense where the defendant also was convicted under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 599 (Nov. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Moreover, in determining whether a defendant is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court must \u201cconsider the sentence it would have originally imposed had the Guidelines, as amended, been in effect at that time\u201d. <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10(b)). It must \u201csubstitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (b)(1). Even if any Guidelines amendments were applicable in McDaniel\u2019s case, operation of the career-offender Guideline prevents any reduction in his sentencing Guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Because Amendment 599 does <em>not </em>have the effect of lowering McDaniel\u2019s applicable Guideline range, a sentence reduction is <em>not </em>consistent with Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10 and is not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">To the extent McDaniel contends the district court inappropriately applied the Chapter Three adjustments and was prohibited from concurrently applying both adjustments because they involved the same conduct, he is merely attempting to relitigate issues already raised and ruled upon at sentencing. Issues relating to the original sentencing are beyond the scope of the Guidelines amendment and are therefore <em>not </em>cognizable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009) (modification in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">No authority need be cited for the well-established rule that, because McDaniel\u2019s claim regarding Amendment 600 (clarifying application of career-offender Guideline to defendants convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)) is raised for the first time on appeal, and especially because it is raised in his reply brief, it will not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
