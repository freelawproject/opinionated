Espinal asserted that Bemis violated several of his constitutional rights after Bemis denied Espinal\u2019s request to be placed on a kosher diet. The district court granted Bemis\u2019s motion for summary judgment, determining that Espinal had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">A Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> action is analogous to a \u00a7 1983 action; the only difference is that \u00a7 1983 claims apply to constitutional violations by state actors and <em>Bivens </em>claims apply to actions by federal officials. <em>Izen v. Catalina, </em>398 F.3d 363, 367 n. 3 (5th Cir.2005). This court does not distinguish between <em>Bivens </em>claims and \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>Id. </em>This court reviews a district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) requires a prisoner to exhaust his administrative remedies before he may file a \u00a7 1983 suit against prison officials. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion of administrative remedies \u201cmeans using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so <em>properly </em>(so that the agency addresses the issues on the merits).\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">Summary judgment in favor of Bemis on exhaustion grounds was proper because it is undisputed that Espinal failed to file an appeal to either Cornell Corporation or to the Bureau of Prisons National Inmate Appeals Administrator, as required by the prison\u2019s grievance procedures. <em>See id. </em>Espinal\u2019s argument that he was excused from filing the necessary appeals because prison officials failed to respond to his grievances is without merit. Because his grievances were deemed denied if prison officials failed to respond within 20 days, he was not excused from filing subsequent appeals even if the prison failed to respond. Additionally, his argument that prison staff confiscated legal papers that were relevant to the exhaustion issue is likewise without merit; he did not allege what documents were taken or that they were any of the forms required for him to complete the exhaustion process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Because Espinal has not shown \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d his motion for the appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 515 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 213 (5th Cir.1982). Finally, the district court\u2019s partial dismissal of the complaint as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 460-64 (5th Cir.1998). Espinal is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
