We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Hatcher contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider all of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and by failing to explain adequately its reasons for the sentence imposed. The record belies Hatcher\u2019s contentions. The district court is not required to refer to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 912-13 (9th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s explanation of Hatcher\u2019s sentence was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992, 995 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Hatcher also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Hatcher\u2019s contentions that the district court erred in declining to apply a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and in rejecting his argument that his criminal history category overrepresented his criminal history, are not supported by the record. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
