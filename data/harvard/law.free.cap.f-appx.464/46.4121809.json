For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-23\">Randolph filed a notice of removal with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking removal of a criminal action from Pennsylvania state court. After reviewing Randolph\u2019s removal petition, the District Court determined that it appeared Randolph was attempting to remove his case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court then held that the allegations of Randolph\u2019s notice were insufficient to support removal under \u00a7 1443, denied the petition, and remanded the case to the state court. Randolph timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-24\">\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal\u201d unless the case was removed pursuant to \u00a7 1443. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Thus, to the extent that Randolph challenges the District Court\u2019s remand order with respect to any bases for removal other than \u00a7 1443, we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Davis v. Glanton, </em>107 F.3d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction to review the remand order to the extent that Ran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>dolph asserts that removal was proper under \u00a7 1443. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Section 1443(1) authorizes the removal of a state law action \u201c[ajgainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. For this provision to apply, \u201ca state court defendant must demonstrate both: (1) that he is being deprived of rights guaranteed by a federal law \u2018providing for ... equal civil rights\u2019; and (2) that he is denied or cannot enforce that right in the courts\u2019 of the state.\u201d <em>Davis v. Glanton, </em>107 F.3d at 1047 (quoting <em>State of Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 788, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966)). Under the first requirement, the defendant must allege a deprivation of rights guaranteed by a federal law \u201cproviding for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted). Under the second requirement, removal is available where the defendant\u2019s federal civil rights would \u201cinevitably be denied by the very act of being brought to trial in state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1049. (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The District Court correctly determined that Randolph did not allege in his petition that the state court litigation involves issues of racial inequality, and he offers no argument on appeal to dispute that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Randolph likewise failed to allege anything that might permit removal under \u00a7 1443(2). Indeed, \u201c[t]he second subsection of \u00a7 1443 confers a privilege of removal only upon federal officers or agents and those authorized to act with or for them in affirmatively executing duties under any federal law providing for equal civil rights.\u201d <em>City of Greenwood, Miss. v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 824, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966). Randolph does not purport to fall into any of those categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">Accordingly, the District Court correctly determined that \u00a7 1443 did not apply to Randolph\u2019s removal petition and appropriately remanded the case to the state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">For the these reasons, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Appellant\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss based upon excessive and prejudicial delay between the criminal incident and arrest,\u201d and motion for appointment of counsel, are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-16\">. Randolph does not dispute the District Court's characterization of his petition. In any event, we are not aware of any other provision permitting removal of the State's criminal prosecution against Randolph.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\">. Moreover, we agree with the District Court that the removal petition was not timely filed. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 1455(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
