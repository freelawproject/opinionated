He contends that the district court improperly calculated his criminal-history score under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c), which authorizes the addition of up to four criminal-history points for prior short-term sentences. The court here, however, added five. The government concedes that this error warrants remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">In 2007 Garcia, a Mexican citizen, was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and imprisoned. In 2009 he was removed to Mexico, but returned and ultimately pleaded guilty to illegal reentry by a previously removed alien. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. At sentencing the probation office initially calculated a total offense level of 17 and a criminal-history score of 9 points (3 points due to a conviction for unlawful use of a firearm, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a); 2 points for illegally reentering the United States while on parole, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d); and 1 point each for 4 prior convictions that had resulted in only probation or supervision, <em>see </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(c)). The probation office later supplemented the presentence report to add a fifth point under \u00a7 4Al.l(c) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Garcia\u2019s criminal-history score for driving on a suspended or revoked license. The fifth point had the effect of raising Garcia\u2019s criminal-history score from 9 to 10, his criminal-history category from IV to V, and increasing his Guidelines range from 37-46 months to 46-57 months. At sentencing neither Garcia nor the United States objected to the new calculations, which the district court adopted when imposing a 57-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Garcia argues, and the United States concedes, that the district court\u2019s inclusion of the fifth point to his criminal-history score exceeded the 4-point maximum under \u00a7 4Al.l(c). Because Garcia did not raise this objection during the sentencing hearing, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Longstreet, </em>567 F.3d 911, 928 (7th Cir.2009). We accept the government\u2019s concession that the district court committed plain error, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When a sentencing court misapplies the Guidelines and thereby erroneously increases a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, the error can affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and infect the integrity of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Jaimes-Jaimes, </em>406 F.3d 845, 850-51 (7th Cir. 2005); <em>see United States v. Jumah, </em>599 F.3d 799, 813 (7th Cir.2010). Guidelines errors can also be harmless when the district court makes clear that a final decision is independent of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>645 F.3d 900, 912 (7th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>560 F.3d 660, 666-67 (7th Cir.2009). In this case, the district judge made clear that he had followed the Guidelines, which he believed had been properly calculated. Because they were not, the determination was plain error and must be remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Garcia also contends that the sentencing order improperly compels him to participate in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. On remand the district court should clarify that Garcia\u2019s participation is voluntary. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>608 F.3d 331, 334-35 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We VACATE Garcia\u2019s sentence and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
