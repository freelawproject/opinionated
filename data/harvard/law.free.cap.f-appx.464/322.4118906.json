Garcia-Sandoval appeals his sentence following his guilty plea conviction for illegal reentry of a deported alien. The district court sentenced him within his advisory guidelines range to 24 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Garcia-Sandoval challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, we will then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Garcia-Sandoval contends that the district court erred procedurally by failing to adequately explain its sentence. As conceded by him, this issue is subject to plain error review because he did not object in the district court on this ground. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cThe district court must adequately explain the sentence \u2018to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (quoting <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586). Before pronouncing the sentence, the district court acknowledged Garcia-Sandoval\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence but noted that he had an extensive criminal history and had been fortunate not to have been removed from the United States on numerous additional occasions given his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d Ri<em>ta v. United States, 551 </em>U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judge need only \u201cset forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>enough to satisfy the appellate court that [she] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [her] own legal decision making authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court provided a reasoned basis for the sentence, and its statements reflect adequate consideration of Garcia-Sandoval\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence. The court\u2019s explanation of the sentence was adequate, and Garcia-Sandoval has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise, with respect to this issue. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356-58, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Regarding substantive reasonableness, Garcia-Sandoval argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that his past convictions were very old, very minor, or both, and that most, if not all, of them involved alcohol abuse warranting treatment rather than incarceration. He asserts that he had lived in the United States for more than 25 years, he had been consistently and gainfully employed as a pipefitter, his family all lived in the United States, and he had no ties to Mexico. According to Garcia-Sandoval, his incarceration extends his unlawful presence in the United States at taxpayer expense while dividing his family.</p>\n<p id=\"Am9\">Because he did not object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The district court considered and was not persuaded by Garcia-Sandoval\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence. The court\u2019s consideration of his criminal history in imposing the sentence was permissible. <em>See United States v. Herrerar-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Garcia-Sandoval has not shown sufficient reason to disturb the presumption of reasonableness applicable to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). He has not shown error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
