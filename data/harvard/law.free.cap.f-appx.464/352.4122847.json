Leger argues that the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition because his petition did not attack a removal order. He also contends that the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over his motion for injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>because he did not ask the district court to stay a removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions on jurisdiction. <em>Rios-Valenzuela v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>506 F.3d 393, 396 (5th Cir.2007). As the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, Leger bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is proper. <em>Rivera-Sanchez v. Reno, </em>198 F.3d 545, 546 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Although the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Leger\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because the petition attacked a removal order, the record in the instant case does not contain a removal order and it is unclear from the record when or if a removal order had issued. The district court\u2019s judgment may nevertheless be affirmed on the alternative ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the \u00a7 2241 petition because the relief sought by Leger in the district court was connected directly and immediately with the Attorney General\u2019s decision to commence removal proceedings against him. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g); <em>Humphries v. Various Fed. USINS Emps., </em>164 F.3d 936, 943 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that no court has jurisdiction over claims directly and immediately connected with the Attorney General\u2019s decision to commence removal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">As to Leger\u2019s motion for injunctive relief, the district court correctly denied the motion because it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Fabuluje v. Immigration and Naturalization Agency, </em>No. 00-10796, 2000 WL 1901410, at *1 (5th Cir. Dec.5, 2000) (finding that the district court correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Fabuluje\u2019s request for an emergency injunction in order to stay removal proceedings because the relief sought was connected with the Attorney General\u2019s decision to commence removal proceedings against him). Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
