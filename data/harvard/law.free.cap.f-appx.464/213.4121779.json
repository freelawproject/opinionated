At sentencing, the district court increased McCowan\u2019s offense level by six by applying the sentencing enhancement prescribed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(3), for \u201coffense[s] involving] an elected official or any public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive position,\u201d because the court concluded that a correctional officer was a public official in a sensitive position. McCowan appeals, arguing that a correctional officer is not a public official in a sensitive position and that the district court lacked \u201ca factual basis\u201d for reaching that conclusion. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">In his June 2009 written plea agreement, McCowan acknowledged that as an inmate at the Ector County Correctional Center (\u201cECCC\u201d), in Odessa, Texas, he arranged with \u201ca prison guard, A. Zehr,\u201d at ECCC to meet with McCowan\u2019s brother, Marcus, outside of the facility, and that Marcus would provide Zehr with contraband to smuggle into ECCC for McCowan. The plea agreement further acknowledged that Marcus and Zehr eventually met, and Marcus paid Zehr $100 and gave him the contraband that Zehr delivered to McCowan at ECCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) identified Zehr, as \u201ca correctional officer, employed at ... ECCC,\u201d and because of Zehr\u2019s position, the PSR recommended an offense-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Cl.l(b)(3), for an \u201coffense involv[ing] ... any public official in a ... sensitive position,\u201d increasing McCowan\u2019s offense level from twelve to eighteen. At sentencing, McCowan did not object to the finding adopted by the district court that Zehr was a correctional officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, he did object to the upward adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>because he contended that Zehr was not in a sensitive position. The district court overruled McCowan\u2019s objection and applied the enhancement because it found that \u201cas a prison guard, Mr. Zehr is in a sensitive position. A prison guard does have great control over the inmates under his or her control. They can write people up. They can make recommendations. They deal with their daily lives in that position.... They are law enforcement officials responsible for the day-to-day management and safety of the facility.\u201d McCowan offered no rebuttal evidence, but continued his objection that \u201cthere is not a factual basis\u201d in the record to find Zehr was in a sensitive position.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u201cThe question whether [an official] is an official holding a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, because it depends primarily upon interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Snell, </em>152 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Stephenson, </em>895 F.2d 867, 877 (2d Cir.1990)). We examine the underlying \u201c[fjactual questions, such as the discretion, supervisory authority, and other indicia of responsibility of [the] official ... only for clear error and afford great deference to the court\u2019s application of the guidelines to those facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1391 (5th Cir.1995)). \u201cThe burden is on the party seeking to adjust the sentence level to prove \u2018by a preponderance of the relevant and sufficiently reliable evidence the facts necessary to support the adjustment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Herrera-Solorzano, </em>114 F.3d 48, 50 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>919 F.2d 962, 965 (5th Cir.1990)). \u201cThere is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The sentencing court may rely on the facts in the PSR \u201cwithout more specific inquiry or explanation, provided those facts had an adequate evidentiary basis\u201d and the defendant has not presented rebuttal evidence. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>897 F.2d 1324, 1328 (5th Cir.1990). And \u201cthe court is permitted to make inferences from the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Section 201.1(b)(3) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides: \u201cIf the offense involved an elected official or any public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive position, increase by 4 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 18, increase to level 18.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(3) (Nov.2009). According to the commentary to \u00a7 201.1(b)(3), \u201c \u2018High-level decision-making or sensitive position\u2019 means a position characterized by a direct authority to make decisions for, or on behalf of, a government department, agency, or other government entity, or by a substantial influence over the decision-making process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4(A). \u201cExamples of a public official who holds a sensitive position include a juror, <em>a law enforcement officer, </em>an election official, and any other similarly situated individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 4(B) (emphasis added). Before 2004, the commentary listed \u201csupervisory law enforcement officers\u201d as an example of a public official in a sensitive position. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Manual supp. app. C, amend. 666. The 2004 amendments to \u00a7 2C1.1 and its commentary changed this example to simply \u201claw enforcement officer,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201csuggesting that] officers need not be in a supervisory position to be considered \u2018sensitive.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>383 Fed.Appx. 493, 494 n. 4 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Based upon the undisputed facts in the record and inferences supported by those facts, we hold that the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3) to enhance McCowan\u2019s offense level because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>those facts and inferences meet the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition of a public official in a sensitive position. McCowan contends that the record evidence does not support the district court\u2019s findings; however, the plea agreement identified Zehr as a \u201cprison guard\u201d and the PSR identified him as a \u201ccorrectional officer\u201d and McCowan did not dispute these facts or offer rebuttal evidence. The record also indicates that Zehr had access to inmates. Therefore, district court\u2019s factual findings about Zehr\u2019s duties and responsibilities are plausible in light of the record as a whole and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The district court\u2019s findings support the conclusion that Zehr occupied a sensitive position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court found that correctional officers have a substantial influence over the decision-making process by having significant control over prisoner disciplinary matters and tremendous responsibility for the \u201cday-to-day management and safety of the facility.\u201d This finding meets the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition of \u201csensitive position,\u201d which is \u201ca position characterized ... by a substantial influence over the decision-making process.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2C1.1 cmt. n. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">McCowan mistakenly argues that our decision in <em>Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d at 1391, which was decided <em>before </em>the 2004 amendments to \u00a7 2C1.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> dictates that only where an official possesses \u201csome final decision-making authority\u201d or occupies a position that \u201cinvolves substantial responsibility for funds can the position qualify under the\u201d Sentencing Guidelines as a sensitive position. In <em>Tomblin, </em>we held that \u201c[a] senator\u2019s top administrative aide holds a position of substantial influence, because he often serves as the senator\u2019s functional equivalent\u201d and therefore is in a sensitive position. <em>Id. </em>It is true that in reaching that decision, we said: \u201c[t]hat a position requires the exercise of some discretion alone does not mandate finding that the possessor of that discretion occupies a sensitive government position. When the discretion includes some final decision-making authority or involves substantial responsibility for funds, however, the position can qualify under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). However, in <em>Snell, </em>decided three years after <em>Tomblin, </em>we expressly rejected McCowan\u2019s contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">[Discretion involving final decision-making authority over matters of public policy or over the expenditure of substantial sums of money ... is not always required, and courts have readily found an ... enhancement [under the predecessor to \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3)] appropriate ... based on the official\u2019s ability to use his position to influence another in the exercise of such discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">152 F.3d at 347. We have previously characterized <em>Snell </em>as holding that \u201ca sensitive position is one that has power to affect the integrity and workings of the judicial and law enforcement system.\u201d <em>Guzman, </em>383 Fed.Appx. at 494 (citing <em>Snell, </em>152 F.3d at 348). We agree that \u201c[a] prison guard [who] has the authority and the ability to directly and significantly influence inmates\u2019 lives and the entire facility\u2019s safety with the decisions he or she makes,\u201d has \u201c[s]uch power within the judicial system [that] makes the position of prison guard a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>sensitive position under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Therefore, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-16\">. \"At sentencing, the court ... may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\u2019\u2019 Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. McCowan does not contend that Zehr was not a \u201cpublic official\u201d but only that he was not in a sensitive position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. McCowan relies on other cases that predate the 2004 amendments to \u00a7 2C1.1(b)(3), which changed the commentary to remove the modifier, \u201csupervisory,\u201d from \"law enforcement officers.\u201d Because those cases were decided before the relevant changes to the commentary, they are unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
