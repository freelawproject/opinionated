Although acknowledging that a within-Guidelines sentence is presumed reasonable, Lucio contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it exceeds what is necessary to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Lucio\u2019s having preserved this issue, review is for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 233 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Lucio can rebut the presumptive reasonableness of his sentence only by showing that it: does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight; gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor; or represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Neither the age of the prior conviction used to enhance Lucio\u2019s sentence nor his cultural assimilation rebuts the presumption. <em>Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d at 234-35. Further, the record reflects the district court considered Lucio\u2019s family\u2019s mistaken belief that Lucio could stay in this country, despite his illegal-reentry conviction, as a factor that weighed against cultural assimilation, not as an aggravating factor, as Lucio suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
