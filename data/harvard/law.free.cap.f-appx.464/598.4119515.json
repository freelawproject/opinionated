Astrue, </em>622 F.3d 1228, 1231 (9th Cir.2010). The ALJ\u2019s disability determination will be affirmed unless it is based on legal error or it was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.; </em>42U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-26\">Kakos first argues that the ALJ erred by not fully developing the administrative record. A claimant for social security benefits carries the burden of proving she is disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A); <em>Valentine v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>F.3d 685, 689 (9th Cir.2009). When the evidence in the record is vague or ambiguous, the ALJ has a duty to develop the record to resolve the ambiguity. <em>McLeod v. Astrue, </em>640 F.3d 881, 885 (9th Cir.2011) (citing <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001)). When the record allows the ALJ to evaluate the evidence and make a disability determination based on substantial evidence, the ALJ is under no obligation to further develop the record. <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir.2001). In the present case, three physicians conducted independent personal evaluations of Kakos and four non-examining physicians reviewed Kakos\u2019s medical records. All seven physicians concluded that Kakos was not disabled. The record before the ALJ was substantial and unambiguous. <em>See Tonapetyan, </em>242 F.3d at 1149 (physician\u2019s independent examination may constitute substantial evidence); <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir.1995) (non-examining physician\u2019s opinion may constitute substantial evidence when opinion is consistent with independent evidence in record). The ALJ was under no obligation to develop the administrative record further. <em>See Mayes, </em>276 F.3d at 459-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Kakos also argues that the ALJ posed an improper hypothetical question to the vocation expert at the administrative hearing. When an ALJ uses a vocation expert to determine which jobs the claimant is able to perform, hypothetical questions \u201cmust \u2018set out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bray v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1228 (9th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Russell v. Sullivan, </em>930 F.2d 1443, 1445 (9th Cir.1991)). Here, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the vocation expert properly incorporated Kakos\u2019s physical and mental limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The ALJ\u2019s disability determination was based on substantial evidence and did not contain legal error. The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b624-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
