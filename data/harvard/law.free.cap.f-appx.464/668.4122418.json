R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Nshan Zadelyan, his wife Azniv, and their two sons Karapet and Ruben, natives of Armenia, petition for review of an order by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying their motion to reopen. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The facts of this case are known to the parties. We need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s June 29, 2006 order denying the Zadelyans\u2019 asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture claims. Petitioners failed to seek timely review; the \u201ctime limit is mandatory and jurisdictional, and cannot be tolled.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 untimely motion to reopen. Petitioners failed to prove that either changed country conditions, <em>see Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), or ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>see Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 898 (9th Cir.2003), should excuse their tardiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">Appellants\u2019 argument that we did not previously rule on the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) adverse credibility decision is incorrect. We did consider and affirm the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility decision, and that is the law of the case. The BIA did not err by relying on the adverse credibility decision when considering changed country conditions because the adverse credibility decision was the law of the case and the alleged new facts were insufficient to warrant reopening the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">The BIA also did not err in rejecting Karapet and Ruben\u2019s asylum claim. The Board correctly concluded that the twins\u2019 nineteen-month delay in filing their claim after turning twenty-one was not a \u201creasonable period.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(C) &amp; (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">Finally, the BIA did not err in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen on account of their confidentiality claim concerning 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.6(a). The Zadelyans concede that they have no evidence that the Armenian government actually uses PACER to persecute asylum seekers.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
