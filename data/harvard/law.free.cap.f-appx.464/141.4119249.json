We have reviewed Petitioners\u2019 claims in this regard and find that we do not have jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2006); <em>Lizama v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 440, 445 (4th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-23\">Petitioners next challenge the Board\u2019s alternative finding that they failed to establish eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and Petitioners\u2019 claims and conclude that Petitioners fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Petitioners cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we have considered Petitioners\u2019 contention that the Immigration Judge improperly questioned them at the hearing and find it to be lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-24\">Accordingly, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
