The BIA relied on the post-departure bar in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(a) and 1003.23(b)(1), which provide that a motion to reopen \u201cshall not be made\u201d by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of removal proceedings \u201csubsequent to his or her departure from the United States.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(d) (pertaining to motions before the BIA); \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (pertaining to motions before an IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Merino-Fernandez contends that the post-departure bar conflicts with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7), but we rejected a similar challenge to the validity of the post-departure bar in <em>Ovalles v. Holder, </em>577 F.3d 288, 292-96 (5th Cir.2009). Because Merino-Fernandez had previously filed two motions to reopen, the instant motion to reopen was number barred\u2014 just as Ovalles\u2019s motion was time barred\u2014 by the very statute that he invokes against the regulation prohibiting post-departure motions. <em>See id. </em>at 296. Merino-Fernandez relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers &amp; Trainmen General Committee of Adjustment, Central Region, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 584, 596-99, 175 L.Ed.2d 428 (2010), and contends that the BIA\u2019s application of the post-departure bar as a jurisdictional rule improperly narrowed the statutory authority of the BIA and the IJ to grant motions to reopen. However, there was no such error in the application of the bar in Merino-Fernandez\u2019s case because he had no right under the statute to file a number-barred motion to reopen in the first place. <em>See Ovalles, </em>577 F.3d at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">To the extent that he challenges the refusal of the BIA to exercise sua sponte authority to reopen his case, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.2004). Merino-Fernandez contends that the BIA erred by refusing in light of \u00a7 1003.2(d) to consider whether to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his case, but we rejected the same argument in <em>Ovalles. Ovalles, </em>577 F.3d at 296-97. In addition, he challenges the BIA\u2019s application of the post-departure bar by challenging the validity of his underlying removal order, but we lack jurisdiction to review this claim because he did not separately petition for review of the underlying order. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Merino-Fernandez also argues that the BIA violated his due process rights by enforcing the post-departure bar in his case, but we rejected that argument in <em>Ovalles. Ovalles, </em>577 F.3d at 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
