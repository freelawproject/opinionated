We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>mindful that \u201c[sjummary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In doing so here, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, record of prior proceedings, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Upon review, we conclude that Hurt\u2019s appeal is without merit substantially for the reasons stated in the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of the district court. <em>See </em>Memorandum &amp; Order, <em>Hurt v. Donahoe, </em>No. 07-cv-4201 (ENV) (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2011), ECF No. 31. We add only that to the extent Hurt alleged improper denials of worker\u2019s compensation, \u201cit is settled law ... that [the Federal Employee\u2019s Compensation Act] is the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries sustained by federal employees.\u201d <em>Votteler v. United States, </em>904 F.2d 128, 129-30 (2d Cir.1990). The district court properly concluded that the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination under that statute is not subject to judicial review. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">We have considered all of Hurt\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
