Thompson contends he is eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 706 lowers Thompson\u2019s offense level, but it does not lower his recommended sentencing range. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A jury convicted Thompson of four offenses: (1) possession of a firearm as a felon, (2) possession of a firearm within a school zone, (3) possession with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d), and (4) possession with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of crack within a school zone. At sentencing, the district court determined that Thompson was a career offender. The career-offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), provided that Thompson\u2019s offense level was 37 unless the otherwise-applicable base offense level was higher. It was\u2014under the crack-cocaine provisions of the Guidelines in effect at the time, \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 &amp; 2D1.2, Thompson\u2019s adjusted offense level was 38. The district court applied the higher offense level of 38 which, combined with Thompson\u2019s criminal-history score, produced a recommended a sentencing range of 360 months to life. The district court varied downwardly and sentenced Thompson to 324 months in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Thompson filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Thompson seeks a reduction in his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 706, which the Sentencing Commission made retroactive, reduced the base offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. <em>United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). In general, Amendment 706 adjusts downward by two levels the base offense level for-crack cocaine offenses under \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Guidelines. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The district court denied Thompson\u2019s motion because it concluded that he was sentenced as a career offender and was therefore ineligible for a reduction in his sentence. We review de novo a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 93, 178 L.Ed.2d 58 (2010), and we review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790 n. 6 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">By its terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) allows a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence only if the defendant\u2019s \u201csentencing range\u201d has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines. Without more, the fact that a defendant\u2019s base or adjusted offense level has been reduced is not enough to entitle that defendant to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If the defendant\u2019s recommended sentencing range remains the same even though his offense level has been lowered, he is not eligible for resentencing. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 IB.1.10 cmt. n. 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Thompson thus finds himself ineligible for resentencing. Thompson\u2019s adjusted offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2D1.1 was subject to a two-level reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 276-77. But Thompson was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. Thompson\u2019s adjusted offense level was determined under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1 instead of \u00a7 4B1.1 only because the adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 was higher. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (2010). Amendment 706 did not change the fact that \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A) sets Thompson\u2019s offense level at 37. Consequently, the newly lowered offense level of 36 under \u00a7 2D1.1 does not apply to Thompson because it is not greater than the offense level of 37 that is otherwise applicable under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The effect of Amendment 706 was to reduce Thompson\u2019s offense level not from 38 to 36, but from 38 to 37. For a defendant such as Thompson whose criminal-history category is VI, the recommended sentencing range for an offense level of 37 is the same as it is for an offense level of 38. <em>See id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A. (Sentencing Table). Either way, the Guidelines recommends a term of imprisonment of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Because Thompson\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range has not been lowered, the district court did not err in determining that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to lower Thompson\u2019s sentence, and its denial of Thompson\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion. We affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Thompson\u2019s motion for a sentencing reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">As Thompson has not shown that the interest of justice requires appointment of counsel in this case, his motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1052 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\">. Thompson also received a sixty-month sentence for one of his firearms offenses and a 120-month sentence for the other one. The district court ordered that Thompson serve those sentences concurrently with the sentence for his crack-cocaine offenses, and Thompson does not challenge either of his firearms sentences on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
