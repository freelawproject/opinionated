For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">To manage the \u201cthe financing and delivery of health care services,\u201d Pennsylvania\u2019s Quality Health Care Accountability Act, 40 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 991.2101-991.2194, known as Act 68, regulates the financial exchanges between managed care plans (\u201cPlans\u201d) and healthcare providers. Two types of providers are relevant here: (1) \u201cparticipating\u201d providers, who hold payment-governing contracts with the Plans; and (2) \u201cnon-participating\u201d providers, who do not. The Association represents a class of non-participating ambulance service corporations. Highmark, like other Appellees, operates a managed care plan that contracts with ambulance service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Reduced to its essence, the proceedings before us are governed by the law of contracts. If a provider contracts with High-mark, the provider may\u2014and often does\u2014 bargain for a payment scheme that entitles the provider to collect payments directly from Highmark. If, like Appellants, a provider does not contract with Highmark, it is not entitled to the contractual privileges enjoyed by participating providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The non-participating providers here seem to recognize this, but contend that the interposition of Act 68 confers upon them the privilege of direct payment without having signed a managed care agreement. Based on its construction of Act 68, the Association seeks (1) a declaration under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 that Plans must pay the non-participating providers directly; and, if successful, (2) treble damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d), because, the Association contends, Highmark\u2019s payment method to enrollees for non-participating providers exerts impermissible economic pressure on non-contracting providers in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The District Court rejected these contentions. And so do we. We conclude that (1) Act 68 does not require direct payment, and as a result, (2) the Association cannot state a claim under RICO for Hobbs Act violations. We will, therefore, affirm the District Court\u2019s, order dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Because we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and the proceedings in the District Court, we will revisit them only briefly. Pennsylvania requires ambulance companies to respond to all emergency calls and provide emergency transportation, regardless of whether or how the injured may be insured. <em>See </em>28 Pa.Code \u00a7 1005.10(e)(4). After completing this mandatory service for one of Highmark\u2019s enrollees, the Association submits bills to Highmark for the costs it incurred. Rather than paying the Association directly for this service, however, Highmark responds to these invoices by reimbursing its <em>enrollees, </em>who then in turn remit payment to the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In February 2010 the Association filed a complaint in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking a declaration that Act 68 requires direct payment to non-participating providers. Highmark moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Court assigned the matter to Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan, who, based on her conclusion that Act 68 does not require direct payment to non-participating providers, recommended that the case be dismissed with prejudice. In a Memorandum Order issued on June 7, 2011, the District Court adopted and modified Magistrate Judge Leniharis reasoning and granted Highmark\u2019s motion. The Association timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The District Court had federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The parties place a single, dispositive issue before us: whether Act 68 requires direct payment to non-participating providers. The Association brings to bear several canons of statutory construction to support its view that Act 68 does, in fact, mandate direct payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Confronted with the Association\u2019s paeans to the precepts of statutory construction, however, we are reminded that even \u201c[t]he devil can cite scripture for his purpose.\u201d William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice, act 1, sc. 3. After sifting through its many arguments, we find that the Association cannot justify why we should ignore the plain language of a statute\u2014which does not mention direct payment\u2014in favor of a reading that eviscerates the legislature\u2019s intent to encourage contracts. For the four reasons that follow, we hold that Act 68 does not require direct payment and, as a result, no violation of the Hobbs Act occurred. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the Association\u2019s suit for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">First, notwithstanding the Association\u2019s heavy reliance on the canons of statutory construction, it cannot evade Act 68\u2019s absolute silence about direct payment. The Association asks us to piece together a flimsy web of statutory language to conjure a direct-payment mandate out of silence. To that end, the Association clouds the otherwise clear language of the prompt-payment provision in an effort to insert the notion that payments must be not only prompt, but also direct. Yet \u201cit is not for the courts to add, by interpretation, to a statute, a requirement which the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Rieck Inv. Corp., </em>419 Pa. 52, 213 A.2d 277, 282 (1965); <em>accord Spectrum Arena Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Commonwealth, </em>603 Pa. 180, 983 A.2d 641, 651-652 (2009). The legislature could have written Act 68 to require Plans to \u201cpay <em>to the provider </em>all reasonable costs of emergency services.\u201d But it did not. Instead, the legislature included a separate, comprehensive section specifically dealing with payments for emergency services\u2014a section that is, again, silent about direct versus indirect payments. 40 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 991.2111(4); <em>see infra </em>Part III. B. Indeed, language mandating or even intimating direct payment does not appear in \u00a7 2166 nor anywhere else in Act 68. In the face of these legislative omissions, the Association\u2019s arguments for adding words ring hollow. Rather than add into the Act a direct-payment mandate, we interpret the absence of such a clause as proof of the legislature\u2019s disinclination to regulate payment recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Second, the Act\u2019s emergency-services provision explicitly endorses Highmark\u2019s payment scheme. The Association\u2019s arguments aimed at obscuring this truth, moreover, lack merit. The Association contends that the conjunction \u201cor\u201d in the clause stating that Plans must \u201cprovide reasonable payment <em>or </em>reimbursement for emergency services,\u201d 40 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 991.2111(4) (emphasis added), is meant to \u201cindicate ... [a] synonymous or equivalent expression,\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 585 (3d ed.1994). In essence, then, to sidestep this conjunction\u2019s only proper implication\u2014that Plans may choose whether to pay providers <em>or </em>reimburse enrollees\u2014the Association contends that <em>payment </em>and <em>reimbursement </em>mean the same thing. But such a reading runs headlong into a core precept of statutory construction that we must avoid surplusage. If \u201cpayment\u201d meant the same thing as \u201creimbursement,\u201d one of the two would be redundant, rendered \u201c \u2018mere surplusage\u2019 \u201d by the inclusion of both. <em>Prestol Espinal v. Att\u2019y Gen. of U.S., </em>653 F.3d 213, 224 (3d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>William v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 329, 333 (4th Cir.2007)). \u201cAnd it \u2018is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>TRW Inc. v. Andrews, </em>534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001)). <em>Payment </em>and <em>reimbursement, </em>therefore, must have different meanings. The inclusion of both, moreover, demonstrates that one word alone, in language as well as in the factual scenario presented here, would not convey the clause\u2019s full meaning. Indeed, the language here is not in the nude, clothed as it is in the logical and grammatical difference between <em>paying </em>a provider pursuant to a contract, and <em>reimbursing </em>its enrollees for services obtained from non-contracting providers. We thus easily conclude that the legislature intended to give Plans the option of whether to pay providers directly or reimburse them indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Third, the Association\u2019s ado about the absurd results that will result from upholding Highmark\u2019s payment system is exaggerated. We hasten to note that there is no allegation that non-participating providers are unpaid or under paid in the current arrangement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Leaving the Act\u2019s interpretation as is\u2014and as it long has been\u2014 would do nothing more than preserve the status quo. Moreover, when viewed in light of the Act\u2019s stated purpose to reduce health care costs, <em>see </em>40 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3809(a)(3), it is Appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation that begins to border on the absurd. Appellants\u2019 suggested reading would permit non-participating providers to charge Plans what they wished (up to a \u201creasonable\u201d limit) while avoiding any contractual obligations\u2014figuratively letting them have their cake and eat it, too. Such a result would undermine the cost-cutting, contract-incentivizing purpose of the Act. Invoking the specter of results that are devoid of logic, therefore, hurts rather than helps the Association\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">As stated heretofore, the law of contracts further cuts against the Association\u2019s position. The Act clearly anticipates a system of contracts between Plans, providers, and enrollees. Section 2102, for example defines a \u201cmanaged care plan\u201d as an entity that \u201cintegrates the financing and delivery of health care services to enrollees by <em>arrangements with health care providers selected to participate </em>on the basis of specific standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 991.2102 (emphasis added). \u201cHealth care services,\u201d moreover, are \u201cprovided ... to an enrollee under a managed care plan <em>contract.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). These contracts, under which Plans and providers may negotiate for such things as, inter alia, direct payment, have become commonplace. Non-participating providers, however, have obviously chosen <em>not </em>to enter this system of contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Hence, the argument that a provider who purposefully turned down the burdens <em>and </em>benefits of a contract may demand direct payment from a Plan simply because it administered aid to a patient with a Plan contract is a theory devoid of deductive or inductive reasoning. Rather, it smacks of the logical fallacy of <em>non sequitur. </em>The contract is between Plan and enrollee; that the Plan would reimburse the enrollee\u2014and no one else, absent a prior assignment\u2014comports with core principles of contract law. Appellants\u2019 proposal, on the other hand, would effectively transform a provider into a party to the Plan-enrollee contract, effectively subrogating the enrollee\u2019s position and assigning to itself a one-time right to payment. After the transaction, the provider could then extricate itself from obligations while awaiting its next, profitable encounter with an enrollee. This parasitic free-riding flies in the face of settled precepts that a contract must bear the mutual assent of the parties, <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 3, and any subsequent assignment must follow the intent of the assign- or, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The precepts of contract law do not permit non-participating providers to temporarily insert themselves into other parties\u2019 contracts, take what benefits they can, and then leave the contract. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bernard, </em>373 F.3d 339, 345 (3d Cir.2004) (holding that one party may not \u201cget the benefits of [its] ... bargain, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>evading the costs .... [because] contract law would not support such a result\u201d). Bargains, by nature, carry benefits and burdens. The Act already guarantees the benefit of \u201creasonable\u201d remuneration. If the Association seeks the extra benefit of direct payment, it must bargain for a contract with a Plan. Until then, indirect payment is a legislatively sanctioned price of the Association\u2019s freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">After scrutinizing the Act\u2019s language and the parties\u2019 contentions, we cannot fathom that a legislature, concerned about cutting costs and incentivizing contracts, sought to benefit non-contracting providers at the expense of participating providers. Nor can we reconcile the Association\u2019s desired outcome with elementary principles of contract law. We thus agree with the District Court and the Magistrate Judge that Act 68 does not require the direct payment of non-participating providers, and that the Association therefore cannot state a claim for relief. Dismissal was and is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In its Amended Complaint, the Association further alleges that Highmark and other Plans have \u201cengaged in a pattern of attempted and actual extortion, by purposefully ignoring and/or misconstruing\u201d Act 68, and by using the \u201cthreat of sending the providers\u2019 money to enrollees as a means to exert economic pressure and coerce\u201d non-participating providers to enter into contracts with Plans at unfair rates. App. 00018. This activity, the Association contends, violates the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c) and (d), which makes it \u201cunlawful ... to conduct [business] affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d Accordingly, the Association brought suit under the federal civil RICO statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), for damages sustained due to the alleged Hobbs Act violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The Hobbs Act is violated, however, only if Highmark has coerced providers to forfeit a statutory <em>right </em>to direct payment. Without such a right, there is no violation of Act 68, and thus, no violations of the Hobbs Act that might support a viable RICO claim. Indeed, Appellants conceded that our conclusion that Highmark\u2019s payment scheme violates Act 68 \u201cis a neces-' sary element of the RICO claims ... [which] rest on violations of the Hobbs Act as the necessary predicate acts.\u201d App. 00025. In light of this concession, our unqualified rejection of the Association\u2019s Act 68 contentions necessarily means that no violation of those federal statutes took place here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">$ \u00ed{\u00ed }|t ^ \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">We conclude that Act 68 does not require Plans to make direct payments to non-participating providers. Because our holding means that Highmark\u2019s payment scheme does not violate Act 68, the Association\u2019s federal RICO and Hobbs Act claims fail. Without any claims remaining, save a few state-law contentions, we furthermore hold that the District Court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kach, </em>589 F.3d at 634. We will therefore AFFIRM the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Court\u2019s dismissal of the Association\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">. Appellants raise state-law claims for conversion and unjust enrichment. Our resolution of Appellants\u2019 other claims, however, obviates our ability to address the state-law issues. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a)(3) (permitting a court to refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after all claims over which the court had original jurisdiction are dismissed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>[the] [District [C]ourt's decision to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,\u201d <em>Eurofins Pharma U.S. Holdings v.

Town of Elsmere, </em>542 F.3d 412, 416 (3d Cir.2008). We review the District Court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kach </em>v. <em>Hose, </em>589 F.3d 626, 634 (3d Cir.2009). \"In considering a Motion to Dismiss ...

Appellants' main textual support comes from two sections of the Act. First, the Act mandates that a Plan \"shall pay a clean claim submitted by a health care provider within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the clean claim.\u201d 40 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 991.2166(a). A \u201cclean claim\u201d is a \u201cclaim for payment for a health care service which has no defect or impropriety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 991.2102.
