Guy, Jr., Senior United States Circuit Judge, Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Appellants Illinois National Insurance Company and Lexington Insurance Company (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal an adverse grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee Willmar Development, LLC (\u201cWillmar\u201d). The district court granted summary judgment on Willmar\u2019s claim that appellants breached their duty to defend a lawsuit alleging negligence against Willmar in the site-selection and construction of a new home. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">To trigger an insurer\u2019s duty to defend under Oregon law, the insured must demonstrate that the conduct alleged in the underlying complaint falls within the insured\u2019s policy coverage. <em>See Nielsen v. St. Paul. Cos., </em>283 Or. 277, 583 P.2d 545, 547 (1978). In this case, the underlying complaint must have alleged \u201cproperty damage\u201d from an \u201coccurrence\u201d to trigger the duty to defend. There was an \u201coccurrence\u201d in this case because the damages were unintended, accidental results of Willmar\u2019s alleged negligence. <em>See Finley v. Prudential Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>236 Or. 235, 388 P.2d 21, 26 (1963); <em>see also Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v. Gutman, </em>172 Or.App. 528, 21 P.3d 101, 105 (2001) (\u201cThe question is whether the insured specifically intended the harm suffered.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">The complaint also alleged \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined by the policy. Appellants contend that \u201cproperty damage\u201d excludes damage to the insured\u2019s own product, but they can point to no authority under Oregon law to support that claim. <em>Cf. Anthem Elec., Inc. v. Pac. Emp\u2019rs Ins. Co., </em>302 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th Cir.2002) (applying California law). The plain language of the policy covers property damage \u201carising out of\u2019 Willmar\u2019s work, including \u201coperations performed by\u201d Willmar. Because the complaint alleges that Willmar negligently performed the site-preparation and home-construction, resulting in damage from settling of the foundation, the damage arises out of Will-mar\u2019s negligent performance. This constitutes \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Because Willmar has demonstrated that the conduct alleged in the underlying complaint is covered by the policy, appellants bear the burden of proving that a specific policy exclusion bars coverage for the alleged conduct. <em>Emp\u2019rs Ins. of Wausau v. Tektronix, Inc., </em>211 Or.App. 485, 156 P.3d 105, 119 (2007). Appellants point to a number of specific policy exclusions, none of which bar coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">First, appellants point to the policy\u2019s \u201cLand Subsidence Exclusion.\u201d Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>though no Oregon court has interpreted such a provision, the majority of courts that have interpreted such provisions have found them ambiguous as to their application to land subsidence resulting from man-made causes, and have ultimately resolved such ambiguity in favor of the insured. <em>See </em>3 Allan D. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11:23A (5th ed.2011) (citing, <em>inter alia, Murray v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>203 W.Va. 477, 509 S.E.2d 1 (1998) (collecting cases); <em>Cox v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>217 Ga.App. 796, 459 S.E.2d 446, 447 (1995)); <em>see also Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Vuk Builders, Inc., </em>406 F.Supp.2d 899, 904-05 (N.D.Ill. 2005). The rationale in these cases is persuasive. The district court correctly followed that rationale in this case, and held that the land-subsidence exclusion does not bar coverage for land subsidence from man-made causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Second, appellants point to \u201cExclusion J\u201d and \u201cExclusion K\u201d in the policy. These exclusions do not apply in this case because specific exceptions to the exclusions allow coverage for the alleged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, appellants argue that \u201cExclusion L\u201d\u2014the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion\u2014 bars coverage in this case. This exclusion does not apply if the damaged work was performed by a subcontractor. The underlying complaint alleges negligence on the part of \u201cDefendant Willmar, and/or Defendant\u2019s agents.\u201d This allegation raises the possibility that the work was performed by a subcontractor, thus triggering the insurers\u2019 duty to defend. <em>See Schnitzer Inv. Corp. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, </em>197 Or.App. 147, 104 P.3d 1162, 1169 (2005) (holding that underlying letter raised possibility of allegations of contaminated groundwater, even though letter did not expressly mention groundwater). The district court correctly held that the subcontractor exception applies, negating the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
