LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">Sergio Apodaca-Garcia challenges the substantive reasonableness of his within-Guidelines sentence. Exercising jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-25\">Apodaca-Garcia pled guilty to illegally reentering the United States following a conviction for an aggravated felony in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>lation of 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). His presentence report calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 57-71 months. At his sentencing hearing, Apodaca-Garcia requested a 57-month sentence. After considering the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. It expressed concern about Apodaca-Garcia\u2019s \u201chistory of violent crime\u201d and the possibility that he might again \u201cbe tempted\u201d to reenter the country illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">On appeal, Apodaca-Garcia contends that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a five-year sentence was substantively unreasonable. Such claims are subject to a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Alfonso, </em>653 F.3d 1137, 1144 (10th Cir.2011). And because Apodaca-Garcia was sentenced within his advisory Guidelines range, we presume his sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006). ApodacaGarcia may rebut this presumption by showing that his sentence is unreasonable when viewed against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Kristl, </em>437 F.3d at 1054. However, \u201cthe fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Apodaca-Garcia points to several factors which, he contends, warrant a lower sentence: illegal reentry is a nonviolent offense that is harmful primarily in the aggregate; the United States has been his home since he was a toddler; he experienced a difficult childhood; he has a history of substance abuse and suicide attempts; and at the time of sentencing, he had not committed any non-misdemeanor crimes in over a decade. Although Apodaca-Garcia is an arguably sympathetic defendant, we simply cannot say that the district court acted unreasonably when it imposed a sentence near the low end of his advisory Guidelines range\u2014one a mere three months longer than the sentence Apodaca-Garcia requested. Moreover, some of the sympathetic factors ApodacaGarcia highlights reinforce the court\u2019s conclusions about his likelihood of recidivism. In any event, a 60 month sentence was unquestionably within the realm of choices \u201crationally available\u201d to the district court. <em>United States v. McComb, </em>519 F.3d 1049, 1053 (10th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we defer to the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Apodaca-Garcia\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-15\"><em> </em>The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
