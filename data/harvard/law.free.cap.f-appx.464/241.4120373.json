(collectively, \u201cMars\u201d or \u201cPlaintiffs-Appellants\u201d) and Mars\u2019s former Nicaraguan distributor, Caf\u00e9 Soluble, S.A. (\u201cCaf\u00e9 Soluble\u201d or \u201cDefendant-Appellee\u201d). Mars seeks a declaratory judgment stating, primarily, that it is not liable to Caf\u00e9 Soluble for terminating the importation and distribution agreement between the parties, notwithstanding Nicaraguan law that may impose penalties for such termination. Caf\u00e9 Soluble moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Mars responded that Caf\u00e9 Soluble has sufficient contacts with Mississippi for purposes of specific jurisdiction because it received twelve shipments of Mars\u2019s products F.O.B. Gulfport, Mississippi between 2008 and 2010. The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that (1) Caf\u00e9 Soluble was subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction under Mississippi\u2019s long-arm statute, (2) Caf\u00e9 Soluble had purposeful contacts with Mississippi, and (3) Mars\u2019s claims are sufficiently related to those Mississippi contacts, but that (4) asserting jurisdiction over Caf\u00e9 Soluble would not be fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">After the appeal of this case was briefed, another panel of this court issued an opinion in <em>ITL International, Inc. v. Constenla, S.A.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, Mars brought suit in the same Mississippi district court that we are reviewing here, seeking a declaration that it was not liable to Constenla, its Costa Rican distributor, despite Costa Rican law to the contrary. The panel in that case held that (1) Constenla fell under Mississippi\u2019s long-arm statute, and (2) Constenla had purposeful contacts with Mississippi, but that (3) Mars\u2019s claims do not \u201carise out of or relate to\u201d those Mississippi contacts, stating:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">Although the contract was partially performed in Mississippi, the dispute here does not arise out of or result from that partial performance. This dispute concerns only trademark claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and general contract issues\u2014transfer, assignment, application, liability, termination, interpretation\u2014that have, at most, a superficial and highly attenuated connection to the minimal activity that took place in Mississippi. In fact, this lawsuit is oriented almost exclusively toward activity that has taken place or may eventually take place in Costa Rica, and nothing in the facts, claims, causes of action, or prayer sections of the complaint makes reference to Mississippi or to activity that took place there. This case is not about damaged goods delivered in Gulfport but rather about distribution in Costa Rica and associated contract and trademark issues. The contract claims present rather abstract questions of law that have no relation to passing the goods from plaintiffs to defendants in Gulfport. Indeed, plaintiffs allege no injury flowing from the transport of the goods, and neither party to the contract was a Mississippi resident when the contract was made or performed.... Whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>defendants took possession of the goods in Mississippi, Florida, or some other state makes no difference to the claims in this lawsuit. Partial performance in a state, without more, does not provide an adequate nexus with claims that do not arise out of or result from that performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">As the instant case is not distinguishable from <em>Constenla </em>in any material respect, we hold that Mars\u2019s claims do not arise out of or relate to Caf\u00e9 Soluble\u2019s Mississippi contacts for purposes of specific jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Mars also claims that the district court has general jurisdiction over Caf\u00e9 Soluble because Caf\u00e9 Soluble accepted delivery of the twelve shipments at Gulfport. Assuming that this contention was preserved below, we reject it because \u201cmere purchases, even if occurring at regular intervals\u201d are insufficient to support general jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Caf\u00e9 Soluble.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court, however, dismissed Mars\u2019s contract claims with prejudice. Mars correctly insists that a dismissal \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d does not \u201coperate[] as an adjudication on the merits\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and thus should have been without prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal to the extent that it is with prejudice, and we remand with instructions to amend the order to specify that the dismissal is without prejudice. Finally, we deny Mars\u2019s motion for an international anti-suit injunction against Caf\u00e9 Soluble as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
