Hapner, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and Native Ecosystems Council (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) challenge the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s Smith Creek Vegetation Treatment Project (\u201cthe Project\u201d) under the National Forest Management Act (\u201cNFMA\u201d) and National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d). In a prior opinion, we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the Service\u2019s favor \u201cin almost all respects.\u201d <em>Hapner v. Tidwell, </em>621 F.3d 1239, 1251 (9th Cir.2010). Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csingle meritorious argument\u201d was that the Service violated NFMA by failing to ensure that the Project complied with an elk-cover requirement contained in the Gallatin National Forest Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 1250-51. We remanded for the Service to remedy this error. <em>Id. </em>at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">On remand, the Service field tested and revised its methodology for calculating elk cover and determined that the Project complied with the Plan\u2019s requirements. The district court held that the Service\u2019s new elk cover analysis complied with the Plan and granted the Service\u2019s motion to dissolve the injunction against the Project. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">We review the validity of a district court\u2019s order dissolving an injunction for an abuse of discretion. <em>N. Alaska Envtl. Ctr. v. Lujan, </em>961 F.2d 886, 889 (9th Cir. 1992). We review the Service\u2019s compliance with NFMA and NEPA under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). <em>Hapner, </em>621 F.3d at 1244 (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">In our prior opinion, we did not determine, as a factual matter, that the logging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>project would reduce elk hiding cover to an amount below what the Plan allowed. We simply concluded that the Service had not calculated elk cover according to the definition in the Plan. As a result, the district court correctly held that the Service, on remand, was free to recalculate elk cover without changing the Project so long as its methodology complied with the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We agree with the district court that the Service\u2019s revised elk cover analysis complied with the Plan. On remand, the Service conducted extensive field sampling and concluded that tree stands with 40% or greater canopy cover generated a result consistent with the Plan\u2019s definition of hiding cover. The Service also considered other methods of calculating hiding cover and gave a reasoned explanation why it preferred the canopy cover method. The Service\u2019s explanation did not \u201crun[ ] counter to the evidence,\u201d nor was it \u201cso implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d <em>Lands Council v. McNair, </em>537 F.3d 981, 987 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Similarly, the Service\u2019s revised baseline for calculating how much elk cover the Project would maintain is a reasonable interpretation of the relevant Plan provision. The Plan requires that the Service maintain \u201cat least two thirds of the hiding cover <em>associated with key habitat components </em>over time.\u201d (Emphasis added). This phrase supports the Service\u2019s view that the proper baseline does not include areas that are naturally open and entirely lack the capability to provide hiding cover now or in the future. Moreover, the revised baseline avoids the major problem we identified with the Service\u2019s previous interpretation because it no longer \u201callowls] iterative Service actions to whittle elk cover down to nearly nothing.\u201d <em>Hapner, </em>621 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Finally, we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs could not raise new NEPA claims on remand because we remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the Service to remedy its elk cover analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">We lift the stay pending resolution of the appeal that we granted on November 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b706-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
