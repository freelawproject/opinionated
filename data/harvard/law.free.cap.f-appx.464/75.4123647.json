The District Court imposed a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the three violations to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 36 months. Pena appeals, contending that the Court erred in its sentencing calculations under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-26\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b101-27\">This case has its origin in two guilty pleas to a total of three charges. In March 2006, Pena pled guilty in the Western District of Virginia to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and one count of illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). In June of that year, the District Court in Virginia sentenced Pena to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. In addition, the Court imposed three years of supervised release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>on each count, to run concurrently. A mandatory condition of both terms of supervised release was that Pena \u201cnot commit another federal, state[,] or local crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Also in June 2006, Pena pled guilty in the Middle District of Pennsylvania to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In November of that year, the District Court in Pennsylvania sentenced Pena to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run concurrently with his Virginia sentences. In addition, the Court imposed three years of supervised release, also to run concurrently with his Virginia supervised release. A mandatory term again provided that Pena not commit any crimes while on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In 2009, after serving his concurrent terms of imprisonment, Pena was deported to Mexico. Less than two years later, in June 2011, police officers in Tennessee arrested Pena for a traffic offense. The parties agree that, by returning to the United States, Pena violated federal law and thus violated the terms of his supervised release. Due to this violation, probation officers in the Western District of Virginia and the Middle District of Pennsylvania filed petitions for those District Courts to revoke Pena\u2019s supervised release. The Virginia petition was transferred to the Middle District of Pennsylvania and consolidated with the Pennsylvania petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d), Pena waived his right to a formal revocation hearing and admitted that he had violated the terms of his supervised release. The Court thus turned to sentencing. It determined that, under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, Pena had committed a Grade B violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Because Pena had a criminal history category of VI, the Guidelines sentencing range for a Grade B violation was 21-24 months. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court noted the policy statements of Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, then stated that it would provide a downward variance to 12 months. However, at the time of his violation, Pena was serving three concurrent terms of supervised release. The Court thus imposed three 12-month sentences, to run consecutively, for a total of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">II. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3231 and 3583(e)(3). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">\u201cOur standard of review differs based on whether the alleged sentencing error was raised below. If so, we review for abuse of discretion; if not, we review for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>564 F.3d 200, 203 (3d Cir.2009). In this case, Pena\u2019s counsel raised his argument to the District Court with a question that he said was \u201creally just for record clarification.\u201d After the Court explained its reasoning, counsel responded that its explanation had sufficiently clarified the matter. The parties dispute whether the argument was \u201cbrought to the court\u2019s attention,\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b), on the basis of this \u201cclarification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">In light of our disposition, we decline to resolve this dispute and review for abuse of discretion. Where, as here, the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>lant alleges a procedural error in a sentence, \u201ca district court will be held to have abused its discretion if its decision was based on a clearly erroneous factual conclusion or an erroneous legal conclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir.2008). \u201cWhere procedural reasonableness turns on a question of statutory interpretation, we conduct plenary review of the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>617 F.3d 766, 769-70 (3d Cir.2010). In this case, applying the more stringent plain error standard would not affect our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In imposing a sentence, district courts must follow a three-step procedure. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). First, they must calculate properly the defendant\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines. Second, they must rule on the motions of both parties and state their justifications for any departures that they have granted. Third, they must exercise their discretion by considering relevant factors from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Pena grounds his argument on the first of these steps, contending that the District Court\u2019s Guidelines calculation was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Pena argues that the Court erred when, based on a \u201csingle violation\u201d (that is, Pena\u2019s reentry after deportation), it \u201cgenerated] three advisory Guideline ranges.\u201d Pena Br. at 14. He acknowledges that district courts have the authority to impose consecutive sentences for violations of concurrent terms of supervised release. <em>See id. </em>at 14 n. 2 (citing <em>United States v. Dees, </em>467 F.3d 847, 851-52 (3d Cir.2006)). The error, he maintains, is that the District Court assigned \u201ca particular Guideline range for each supervised release term.\u201d Pena Reply Br. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">To the contrary, our law obligates the District Court to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range for each sentence it imposes. When it imposes consecutive sentences for the violation of multiple terms of supervised release, as Pena concedes that it may, it must determine the appropriate Guidelines range for each sentence. The Court has authority to revoke \u201ca term of supervised release,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), and here there were three such terms. Thus, it invoked its authority three times and applied the Guidelines three times. Because the relevant facts were the same for each revocation, the Court\u2019s Guidelines calculation was the same for each revocation. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>557 F.3d 910, 916-17 (8th Cir.2009) (affirming a court\u2019s Guidelines calculations for concurrent terms of supervised release before departing upward).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">That the Sentencing Guidelines require grouping of offenses based on similar conduct, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1-.5, does not change our result. Those provisions apply only to initial sentences, as shown by their enumeration of the offenses to which they apply. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.2. Whereas all of those offenses appear in Chapter 2, the offense of violating supervised release is confined to Chapter 7, whose underlying policy is different. <em>See United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir. 1998) (rejecting a similar argument based on \u00a7 3D1.1 in the supervised release revocation context). Notably, while the Guidelines generally call for concurrent sentences, <em>see </em>U.S. S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c), they call for consecutive sentences for violations of supervised release, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.3(f). That difference reflects the \u201cbreach of trust\u201d approach that the Sentencing Commission adopted with respect to the revocation of supervised release. <em>See id. </em>ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The District Court made no procedural error in sentencing Pena. Hence, we affirm its judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. The Guidelines range was 21-27 months. However, there is a statutory maximum term of 24 months, as the parties agree that the underlying crimes were Class C or Class <em>D </em>felonies. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
