Pendleton argues that the district court committed procedural error by imposing a sentence at the high end of the Guidelines range because of Pendleton\u2019s purported failure to admit guilt and by failing to consider that Pendleton had suffered abuse as a child and had psychological issues. Pendleton also argues that the sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the fraud guideline and his low risk of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">1. The district court did not commit procedural error by considering Pendleton\u2019s failure to admit responsibility to explain why Pendleton was not entitled to a downward adjustment. <em>See United States v. </em>Rosas, 615 F.3d 1058, 1067 (9th Cir.2010), as <em>amended.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">2. The district court considered the evidence Pendleton submitted regarding his childhood abuse and psychiatric condition and sufficiently explained why it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>rejected Pendleton\u2019s argument that this evidence mandated a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Apodaca, </em>641 F.3d 1077, 1081 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201c[N]o lengthy explanation is necessary if the record makes it clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">3. Pendleton did not challenge the fraud guideline before the district court, and the district court therefore did not commit plain error in sentencing Pendleton under that guideline. <em>See United States v. Ayala-Nicanor, </em>659 F.3d 744, 746-47 (9th Cir.2011). Nor did the district court abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Carper, </em>659 F.3d 923, 925 (9th Cir.2011) (explaining that the district court is not obliged to \u201cconsider <em>sua sponte </em>whether it had discretion to make a downward variance ... \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">4. Nor did the district court impose a substantively unreasonable sentence because \u201cthe district court heard and considered [Pendletonj\u2019s arguments, contemplated the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and reached an informed conclusion regarding sentencing....\u201d <em>United States v. Overton, </em>573 F.3d 679, 700 (9th Cir.2009), <em>as amended.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
