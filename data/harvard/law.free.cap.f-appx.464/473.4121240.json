Hessa, who is represented by counsel, appeals his twenty-one month sentence for using counterfeit access devices with the intent to defraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Hessa was indicted on April 6, 2009, for buying replica sports jerseys from thrift stores, creating counterfeit UPC bar codes and receipts, and using them to return the jerseys at J.C. Penney stores around the United States. He pleaded guilty to five specific fraudulent returns, but admitted for the purposes of his plea that he had returned hundreds of items using this method in numerous states. His presentence report calculated a criminal history category of II, and a total offense level of thirteen. The report found a base offense level of six under USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2); an eight-level enhancement for a loss of $110,851.86 under USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E); a two-level enhancement for producing authentication features under USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(B)(ii); and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The district court adopted the report, but also found, over Hessa\u2019s objection, that a two-level enhancement for relocation of a fraudulent scheme to evade law enforcement was applicable under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(9)(A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, With this two-level enhancement, Hessa\u2019s total offense level became fifteen, resulting in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of twenty-one to twenty-seven months of imprisonment. The district court sentenced Hessa to concurrent terms of twenty-one months of imprisonment on each of the five counts. Hessa was also sentenced to two years of supervised release. The district court imposed a $500 special assessment and ordered restitution of $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">Hessa argues on appeal that: 1) the district court erred by increasing his offense score by two levels for either the relocation enhancement or the sophisticated means enhancement; and 2) the application of the enhancements for both the sophisticated means and the production of an authentic feature enhancement constituted impermissible double-counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-13\">We review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If no procedural error occurred, we \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence may be substantively unreasonable \u201cif the district court chooses the sentence arbitrarily, grounds the sentence on impermissible factors, or unreasonably weighs a pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>628 F.3d 791, 796 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 3077, 180 L.Ed.2d 899 (2011). When a sentence falls within the applicable guideline range, we afford it a rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Our review of the record establishes that the district court did not apply the sophisticated means enhancement, but rather the relocation enhancement. Although the district court mentioned the sophisticated means enhancement during the sentencing hearing, the court actually applied the relocation enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The application of the relocation enhancement was not procedurally unreasonable. This enhancement applies when \u201cthe defendant relocated, or participated in relocating, a fraudulent scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(A). Hessa argues that the record does not demonstrate that he had any purpose of evading law enforcement, and that he was instead simply going to different stores as a \u201cmethod of operation.\u201d The district court nevertheless found that Hessa was moving from state to state to avoid law enforcement. Given that Hessa did not otherwise explain why he was traveling from location to location, the district court\u2019s finding that the travel was \u201cin large part for the purpose of evading\u201d and \u201cmore likely a relocation for the purpose, in this case, of evading\u201d was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Further, Hessa\u2019s actions fall within the plain language of the enhancement. He admitted that he traveled to numerous states making fraudulent returns at J.C. Penney stores. The logical explanation for Hessa\u2019s interstate travel is that he traveled between multiple stores to avoid detection by J.C. Penny. Thus, Hessa was trying to \u201crelocate[ ] ... a fraudulent scheme ... to evade law enforcement or regulatory officials.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(A). Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the relocation enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Finally, Hessa argues that the district court impermissibly double counted his guidelines score by using both the sophisticated means and counterfeit access device enhancements. However, because the district court did not apply the sophisticated means enhancement, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-16\">.
