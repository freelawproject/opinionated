Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) and (II), the Immigration Judge found Frutos ineligible and denied his application for adjustment of status, also denying his application for voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Frutos\u2019 appeal. We deny Frutos\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-23\">(1) Adjustment of Status. Frutos argues that \u00a7 1255\u00ae should permit adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ment of status for those individuals, like himself, who are inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i). However, the BIA has interpreted the statutes to mean that an alien inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) and (II) is ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>See In re Briones, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355 (BIA 2007); <em>In re Torres-Garcia, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 866 (BIA 2006). Under <em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we defer to the agency\u2019s permissible interpretation of the statute, and we have previously adopted the BIA\u2019s interpretation. <em>See Gonzales v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>508 F.3d 1227, 1242 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Frutos\u2019 argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">(2) Waiver of Inadmissibility. Frutos contends that a waiver for unlawful presence under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) also waives inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C). The BIA rejected Frutos\u2019 argument because \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(v) specifically provides that the Attorney General has \u201cdiscretion to waive clause <em>(i) </em>\u201d (emphasis added). We have interpreted this section to refer only to \u201cclause (i) of subparagraph (B).\u201d <em>Acosta v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 550, 557-58 (9th Cir.2006) (recognizing that in construing statutes, words are given their ordinary meaning), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Garfias-Rodriguez v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 942 (9th Cir.2011). Because the waiver is limited to aliens under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(B)(i), it does not apply to Frutos.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">(3) Equal Protection. Frutos argues that \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C) violates the equal protection clause because it irrationally discriminates between two classes of aliens. An alien who acames an aggregate period of more than one year of unlawful presence, departs the United States and then reenters unlawfully or attempts to reenter unlawfully is rendered inadmissible for 10 years. In contrast, an alien who makes any number of unlawful entries, but never accrues a total of more than one year of unlawful presence, departs the United States and then reenters unlawfully or attempts to do so does not become inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">To establish an equal protection violation, Frutos must show that the distinction is \u201cwholly irrational.\u201d <em>Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting <em>Taniguchi v. Schultz, </em>303 F.3d 950, 957 (9th Cir.2002)). He must disprove \u201cevery conceivable basis which might support a legislative classification, whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hemandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1164 (9th Cir.2002)). If the government provides a rational reason for the rule, the equal protection claim fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">Here, the government argues that it is rational for Congress to have decided to punish aliens who have accrued more than one year of unlawful presence more harshly than aliens who have accrued a lesser amount of time. Frutos has failed to show that this distinction is \u201cwholly irrational,\u201d so we must reject his equal protection argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
