Doyle, a Montana prisoner, appeals from the denial of habeas relief with respect to his claim that the passage of 609 days, or roughly 20 months, between his arrest and the commencement of trial violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial as articulated in <em>Barker v. Wingo, 407 </em>U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). Although respondents argue that the state court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the district court did not err in finding that, even without such deference, Doyle failed to establish a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Doyle was charged, along with Dean Maestas and Cheren Day, with deliberate homicide, or in the alternative, deliberate homicide by accountability, in the beating death of Richard Solwick in Butte, Montana, on March 3, 2003. <em>See Mont.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(1), 45-2-302 (2003). Maestas and Day pleaded guilty and testified at Doyle\u2019s trial. Doyle was convicted of deliberate homicide by accountability, and was sentenced to 65 years of imprisonment. Unable to make bail, Doyle was detained between his arrest on May 5, 2003, and the commencement of trial on January 3, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">Petitioner\u2019s claims, including the speedy trial claim, were rejected on direct appeal. <em>State v. Doyle, </em>337 Mont. 308, 160 P.3d 516, 522-26, \u00b6\u00b6 15-39 (2007). Post-conviction relief was denied, and that decision was affirmed. <em>Doyle v. State, </em>350 Mont. 562, 213 P.3d 789 (2009) (unpublished). A timely habeas petition followed. Adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>mendations, the district court dismissed all five claims and granted a certificate of appealability on the only claim before us. Reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition is reviewed de novo. <em>McClure v. Thompson, </em>323 F.3d 1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2003). Doyle\u2019s speedy trial claim was rejected under a state-law framework that purported to apply the factors outlined in <em>Barker, </em>but which was later abrogated by the Montana Supreme Court for having \u201cstrayed considerably from the actual balancing approach envisioned in <em>Barker.\u201d State v. Ariegwe, </em>338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815, 828 \u00b6 27 (2007) (abrogating in part <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866 (1998)). Declining to decide whether the state court\u2019s application of the now-abrogated <em>Bruce </em>framework was contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Barker, </em>we turn first to the constitutional question of whether Doyle has demonstrated a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>Barker </em>adopted a \u201cdifficult and sensitive balancing process\u201d through which \u201cthe conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 533, 92 S.Ct. 2182. Examining the four factors identified in <em>Barker, </em>courts must determine \u201cwhether [the] delay before trial was uncommonly long, whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial, and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay\u2019s result.\u201d <em>Doggett v. U.S., </em>505 U.S. 647, 651, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Lam, </em>251 F.3d 852, 855 (9th Cir.2001). The facts relevant to this claim are not in dispute, and, since Doyle had the opportunity to develop the record in state court, we presume that the state court\u2019s factual findings are correct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">First, there is no dispute that the length of delay of roughly 20 months is sufficient to cross the threshold and trigger further inquiry. <em>See Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 651-52, 112 S.Ct. 2686 (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530-31, 92 S.Ct. 2182). Considering the seriousness of the charges, the volume of discovery, and the extensive forensic evidence involved, the district court did not err in finding that the delay did not greatly exceed the threshold and does not weigh heavily in Doyle\u2019s favor. <em>Lam, </em>251 F.3d at 857 (finding 15-month delay triggered further inquiry, it only \u201cmilitate[d] slightly in Lam\u2019s favor\u201d); <em>see also United States v. King, </em>483 F.3d 969, 976 (9th Cir.2007) (finding nearly two years was not excessive).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Second, when considering the reasons for the delay, <em>Barker </em>asks whether the government or the defendant is more to blame. <em>Vermont v. Britton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, -, 129 S.Ct. 1283, 1290, 173 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Also, \u201cdifferent weights should be assigned to different reasons,\u201d with any deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense weighted heavily against the government, a more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowding weighted less heavily, and a valid reason\u2014such as a missing witness\u2014justifying appropriate delay. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182. The district court concluded that the parties shared responsibility for much of the delay, except that 175 days of delay were attributed to the state and 84 days were attributed to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Doyle argues that it was error for the district court to attribute the initial 225-day period between his arrest on May 5, 2003, and the first trial setting on December 15, 2003, to both parties when it is undisputed that the crime lab had not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>pleted its analysis of the evidence. As the recognition of a threshold dividing ordinary delay from presumptively prejudicial delay suggests, \u201cordinary procedures for criminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 521 n.15, 92 S.Ct. 2182 (citation omitted). Some delay to allow preparation for trial would be consistent with the right to speedy trial. <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 656, 112 S.Ct. 2686 (\u201cspeedy trial standards recognize that pretrial delay is often both inevitable and wholly justifiable\u201d). Here, the charges were serious and the record, even without the completed crime lab report, was voluminous. We find no error in this regard, or in the district court\u2019s attribution of the other periods of delay. Further, the 175-day period that was attributed to the state alone as a result of the delay in the crime lab\u2019s processing of the evidence was not the result of deliberate or bad faith delay, nor official negligence that interfered with timely processing. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Respondents concede that the third factor was properly weighed in favor of Doyle as he asserted his right to a speedy trial by writing to the court two months after his arrest, seeking release on bail, and moving to dismiss the charges on speedy trial grounds before trial. Although the defense found it necessary to request a number of continuances, none were made in bad faith or suggested an effort to derail the proceedings. <em>Lam, </em>251 F.3d at 858; <em>McNeely v. Blanas, </em>336 F.3d 822, 831 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Fourth, while presumptive prejudice alone cannot demonstrate a Sixth Amendment violation, \u201cits importance increases with the length of delay.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655-56, 112 S.Ct. 2686. To warrant relief, \u201cnegligence unaccompanied by particularized trial prejudice must have lasted longer than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 112 S.Ct. 2686. Prejudice should be assessed in light of three interests: \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Some prejudice is presumed to result from extended pretrial detention. However, Doyle\u2019s complaints about the conditions of confinement in an overcrowded temporary facility without access to recreation and the \u201cextreme discomfort\u201d he experienced related to the back surgery he underwent several months prior to his arrest did not constitute oppressive pretrial incarceration or demonstrate that the delay significantly aggravated the anxiety and concern beyond what is inherent in pretrial detention. Further, the prejudice Doyle claims concerning damage to his relationship with Katrina Bowen and their daughter was not the product of the pretrial delay. <em>See United States v. Gregory, </em>322 F.3d 1157, 1163 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Turning to the most serious form of prejudice, impairment of his defense, Doyle claimed that the delay was used to pressure Bowen into testifying against him at trial and resulted in the unavailability of several potential witnesses at trial. Assuming Bowen\u2019s equivocal testimony was credible, it did not support an inference that the state had used the delay to badger or coerce Bowen into incriminating Doyle. <em>See Gregory, </em>322 F.3d at 1164. Although Kay Paige died before the defense had an opportunity to interview her, nothing in the record suggests that even if she could have been effectively impeached the testimony could have been favorable to Doyle. Finally, while Doyle\u2019s sister, his nephew, and his nephew\u2019s girlfriend were never interviewed and could not be located by the investigator prior to trial, Doyle has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>made no claim about how the unavailability of these witnesses impaired his defense. The possibility of prejudice from the unavailability of these witnesses is not sufficient to demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>See Lam, </em>251 F.3d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Considering the <em>Barker </em>factors together, the delay was not excessive, the right to speedy trial was sufficiently asserted, the state bore more responsibility for the delay than the defense but this factor is not weighted heavily against the state, and the presumed prejudice in this case did not warrant relief for violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b628-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
