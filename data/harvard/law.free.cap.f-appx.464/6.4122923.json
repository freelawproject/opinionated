R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. R. 34(j). The court has afforded full consideration to the issues presented and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons that follow, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">In light of the explanation given by the district court in its memorandum opinion accompanying the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, <em>see United Am. Fin., Inc. v. Potter, </em>770 F.Supp.2d 252 (D.D.C.2011), and in light of the decision of this court in <em>Cotton v. Heyman, </em>63 F.3d 1115 (D.C.Cir.1995), we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-19\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this Court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
