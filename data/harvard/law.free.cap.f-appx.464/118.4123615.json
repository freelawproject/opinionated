Gray seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders granting the Defendants\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss his complaint and denying his Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion and motion for recusal. On appeal, we confine our review to the issues raised in Gray\u2019s informal brief. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Because Gray\u2019s informal brief does not challenge the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to recuse, Gray has forfeited appellate review of that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Turning to the orders denying relief under Rules 12(b)(6) and 59(e), we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny Gray\u2019s motions for summary disposition<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and affirm the district court\u2019s orders for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Gray v. Bagley, </em>No. 8:11-cv-01117-JFM (D. Md. July 28, 2011 &amp; Aug. 9, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-14\">. In any event, we note that Gray\u2019s motion to recuse does not assert any facts that raise any question regarding the impartiality of the experienced district court judge. Rather, fairly read, Gray\u2019s assertion of bias is entirely predicated on Gray\u2019s dissatisfaction with the district court\u2019s rulings and management of the litigation. Thus, even had Gray properly preserved appellate review of the denial of his recusal motion, we would have no difficulty rejecting the claim on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-26\">. To the extent Gray moves for summary disposition against some Appellees for failure to file a response brief, we decline to grant such a motion. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (noting that Appellees are permitted, but not required, to file response brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
