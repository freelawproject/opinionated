Jones and his counsel violated Local Rule 47.5(C) of the Eastern District of Louisiana, Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and Rule 3.5(c) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to sanction Jones and his counsel, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">After the district court entered judgment against Swift in a case arising from a vehicle accident, Brenda G. Beilman, the jury foreperson, contacted the district court with concerns about the verdict. The district court, without informing Swift, directed Beilman to discuss her concerns with Jones\u2019s counsel. Beilman told Jones\u2019s attorney that a juror overheard Jones say he may receive $2,000,000 from his case. She also stated that Jones\u2019s \u201cstatement was discussed at length amongst the jurors,\u201d and \u201cthe jury\u2019s consideration of [Jones\u2019s] statement was prejudicial\u201d to his damages award. Jones\u2019s attorney moved for a new trial using Beilman\u2019s testimony to argue that outside influence prejudiced the jury. In response, Swift filed motions to strike the affidavit and to sanction Jones\u2019s counsel for violating Local Rule 47.5(C) of the Eastern District of Louisiana, Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and Rule 3.5(c) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct. The district court denied both motions, and Swift timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">We review a district court\u2019s determination not to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990). The district court may sanction conduct where it is in direct defiance of the sanctioning court or constitutes disobedience to the court\u2019s orders. <em>Positive Software Solutions, Inc. v. New Century Mortg. Corp., </em>619 F.3d 458, 460 (5th Cir.2010). Because imposing sanctions is often a fact-intensive inquiry, the district court is given wide discretion. <em>Mercury Air Group, Inc. v. Mansour, </em>237 F.3d 542, 548 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Swift argues that Jones and his counsel violated Local Rule 47.5(C) of the Eastern District of Louisiana and Rule 3.5(c) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct and should be sanctioned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Swift further contends that Jones and his counsel violated Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence by including inadmissible testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>mony in the motion and should be sanctioned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The district court itself permitted Jones\u2019s counsel to speak with Beilman when it encouraged her to contact counsel to discuss her concerns regarding the overheard statement and its effect at deliberations. It was certainly not unreasonable under those circumstances for Jones\u2019s counsel to speak with Beilman and to include her statements in an affidavit supporting Jones\u2019s motion for a new trial. Even assuming it was error for Jones to include this information in an affidavit submitted to the district court, that error was harmless because the district court denied Jones\u2019s motion for a new trial. Therefore, under these unique facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Jones did not act in defiance of the district court by talking to the juror or in failing to award sanctions. Of course, the better practice is for the parties and the court to avoid ex parte communications with jurors because such communications can have serious effects on litigation. <em>See United States v. Peters, </em>349 F.3d 842, 846 (5th Cir.2003) (explaining that ex parte communication with jurors is rarely tolerated because it is \u201cpregnant with possibilities for error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The district court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-12\">. Local Rule 47.5(C) of the Eastern District of Louisiana prohibits attorneys from contacting jurors without having filed a motion showing good cause. Rule 3.5(c) of the Louisiana Rules of Professional Conduct precludes attorneys from speaking with a juror where the communication is prohibited by law or court order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence permits jurors to testify about extraneous prejudicial information but not about jurors\u2019 mental processes. <em>U.S. v. Barraza, </em>655 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir.2011). Beilman\u2019s affidavit testimony that the jurors overheard Jones make a statement was likely admissible under Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence as extraneous prejudicial information. However, Beilman's testimony that this statement may have impeded jurors\u2019 abilities to deliver a fair verdict is more problematic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
