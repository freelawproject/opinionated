On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by refusing to apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d). His argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 214-15 (5th Cir. 2011), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2011) (No. 11-8023), and <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 27, 2011) (No. 11-8268), which held that the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants whose sentencing occurred after the FSA\u2019s effective date but whose offenses occurred before that date. Although the Supreme Court has recently granted <em>certiorari </em>in two Seventh Circuit cases that held that the FSA does not apply retroactively, our precedent remains binding unless the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">Hicks contends that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a safety-valve sentence reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The only dispute is whether \u201cnot later than the time of sentencing\u201d Hicks \u201ctruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence ... concerning the offense.\u201d \u00a7 3553(f)(5). He argues that, regardless of how much he balked, prevaricated, or misled federal agents, he is entitled to the reduction if he ultimately provided all relevant information before sentencing. This proposition is doubtful in light of a defendant\u2019s obligation to provide all relevant information even if the government does not request it. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996). But we need not examine the degree of good faith required, because the district court did not clearly err by finding that Hicks never made full disclosure. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 432-33 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-25\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
