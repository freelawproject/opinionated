Because the district court erroneously classified McFadden as a \u201cthree-striker\u201d for purposes of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), we vacate the order and remand.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">Under the PLRA, a prisoner who brings a civil action or an appeal who has had three or more actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted may not proceed without prepayment of fees unless he is under \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2006). The dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim that is without prejudice, however, does not count as a strike under the PLRA. <em>McLean v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 391, 395-98 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">Although the three cases the district court relied on to deny McFadden\u2019s motion were dismissed for failure to state a claim, each was dismissed without prejudice. <em>See McFadden v. Allen, </em>No. 3:05-0887-RBH-JRM (D.S.C. Nov. 29, 2005), <em>aff'd, </em>193 Fed.Appx. 251 (4th Cir.2006); <em>McFadden v. Clarendon Cnty. Sheriff's Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 3:00-cv-2536-MBS-JRM, 2001 WL 34085610 (D.S.C. May 22, 2001), <em>aff'd </em>20 Fed.Appx. 207 (4th Cir.2001); <em>McFadden v. Land, </em>No. 3:99-cv-3221-MBS-JRM (D.S.C. Oct. 21, 1999). Accordingly, they are not proper bases on which to deny McFadden\u2019s motion to proceed without prepayment of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-20\">We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for reconsideration of McFadden\u2019s motion consistent with this court\u2019s decision in <em>McLean. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-21\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\"> \"The denial by a District Judge of a motion to proceed in forma pauperis is an appealable order.\u201d <em>Roberts v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>339 U.S. 844, 845, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
