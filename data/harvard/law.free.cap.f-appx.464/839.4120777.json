Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Marquard v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>429 F.3d 1278, 1313 (11th Cir.2005). Here, Carden argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to his shackling prejudiced him, first, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>cause the jury saw his shackles during trial, <em>see Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 633, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005) (noting that defendant\u2019s appearance in shackles \u201calmost inevitably affects the jury\u2019s perception\u201d of the defendant), and second, because the shackles deterred him from testifying in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">As to Carden\u2019s first claim, the district court discredited Carden\u2019s affidavits suggesting that the shackles were visible to the jury, and found that the jury was not able to see Carden\u2019s shackles because the defense table was covered with a floor-length drapery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review this finding for clear error, <em>see McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011), and conclude that nothing in the record or in Carden\u2019s appeal establishes that this finding was clearly erroneous. Therefore, we reject Carden\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced because the jury saw his shackles during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Carden also argues that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to his shackles because Carden declined to testify in his own behalf out of concern that the shackles would become prominently visible to the jury from the witness stand and that the shackles would damage his credibility before the jury. However, the record fails to support that Carden made any effort to testify without the shackles, or to advise his lawyer that he wanted to testify. Indeed, when asked by the district court whether his decision not to testify was his own, Carden acknowledged that it was, and stated that he was satisfied with the advice given by his attorney. This record provides no factual basis for Carden\u2019s claim that he decided not to testify because of the shackles.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\">. The government contends that we should not address the merits of Carden\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because, it argues, Carden\u2019s brief addresses issues other than those for which the Certificate of Appealability was granted and does not adequately raise the ineffectiveness argument. However, we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally under \"a\u2019 less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys.\u201d <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir.2011). Further, we may strike those portions of briefs presenting arguments outside the Certificate of Appealability while considering those arguments addressed to the issue that has been certified. <em>See Hodges v. Atty. Gen., </em>506 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2007). Here, we find that Carden\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief adequately raises his ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>tance of counsel claim because the heading of his argument refers to counsel\u2019s efficacy, he argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the leg shackles, and he contends that he was harmed by this ineffectiveness. To the extent that Carden raises claims outside of the certified issue, we do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-21\">. We need not address the deficiency component of Carden\u2019s ineffective assistance claim if we conclude that he is unable to show that he was prejudiced by the alleged deficiency. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
