We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201cIt would be procedural error for a district court to fail to calculate\u2014or to calculate incorrectly\u2014the Guidelines range; to treat the Guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory; to fail to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; to choose a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts; or to fail adequately to explain the sentence selected, including any deviations from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The district court did not commit procedural error in the instant case. The district court clearly understood its responsibility to calculate the Guidelines range correctly at the beginning of the sentencing process, and it did so. <em>See id. </em>at 991. Furthermore, the district court understood that the Guidelines are advisory. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finally, the district court considered the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the Guidelines range, in sentencing Valenzuela-Quintero, and explained its choice of sentence sufficiently. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991. Any misunderstanding of <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), or of Valenzuela-Quintero\u2019s written objections to the pre-sentence report, was harmless error. <em>See United States v. Munoz-Camarena, </em>631 F.3d 1028, 1030 (9th Cir. 2011) (harmless error standard applies to mistakes made in sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Because Valenzuela-Quintero made no cognizable policy argument along the lines of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) in his written objections to the pre-sentence report or at the sentencing hearing, the district court was not required to address such an argument in explaining the basis for its sentence. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>649 F.3d 955, 964 (9th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to follow <em>United States v. Amezcuar-Vasquez, </em>567 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2009) when deciding whether to vary from the Sentencing Guidelines range. The district court\u2019s discussion of <em>Amezcuar-Vasquez </em>simply distinguished that opinion from the instant case on the facts, and declined to extend its holding. The existence of proposed amendments to the relevant Sentencing Guidelines that would impose only an 8-level enhancement for a prior conviction that no longer scores for criminal history points does not affect Amezcua-Vasquez\u2019s applicability as precedent. <em>See United States v. </em>Hernandez-<em>Valdovinos, </em>352 F.3d 1243, 1249 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
