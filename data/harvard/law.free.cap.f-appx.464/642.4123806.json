We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Delgado contends that the district court committed procedural error by treating the sentencing range calculated by reference to the Career Offender Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A), as \u201cvirtually mandatory,\u201d by overemphasizing the need for deterrence, and by \u201cfailing] to recognize the numerous ways in which courts are permitted to deviate from the career offender guidelines.\u201d The record belies these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Delgado also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court ignored \u201cthe tremendous extent to which [his] priors unreasonably increased [his] advisory Guidelines\u201d and gave \u201cvirtually no weight to his personal characteristics and history.\u201d He argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to serve the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These contentions are without merit. The 235-month sentence, which was 57 months below the correctly-calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, was substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
