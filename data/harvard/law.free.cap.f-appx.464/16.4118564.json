Straus, which denied his application for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Emmanuel Thiersaint, </em>No. A044 588 716 (B.I.A. May 27, 2009), <em>aff'g </em>No. A044 588 716 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 27, 2009). Thiersaint also seeks review of a September 19, 2011 decision of the BIA denying his motion to reopen, and moves for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) and for a stay of removal in connection with this petition. <em>In re Emmanuel Thiersaint, </em>No. A044 588 716 (B.I.A. Sept. 19, 2011). The petitions for review are consolidated for purposes of this order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">I. Docket Number 09-2734\u2014Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See De La Rosa v. Holder, </em>598 F.3d 103, 107 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Poole v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 259, 262 (2d Cir.2008). Notwithstanding 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction to consider any \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in a petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Thiersaint does not dispute that he was subject to removal by virtue of his conviction of an aggravated felony. Thus, Thiersaint\u2019s conviction of an aggravated felony, which served as the basis for his order of removal, falls squarely within the jurisdiction-stripping statute. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, because Thiersaint argues in his petition that the BIA erred by failing to consider his central legal argument in denying his application for CAT relief, he presents a question of law for review over which we retain jurisdiction. <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>475 F.3d 135, 137-38 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that we retain jurisdiction to review a petition when the agency \u201cunambiguously mischaracterized a central element of the record,\u201d because that raises a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Thiersaint argues that the agency failed to address his central argument that he would be individually and intentionally singled out for torture by Haitian prison officials because of his physical disability. Thiersaint further asserts that the BIA failed to consider his claim under <em>Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 121 (2d Cir.2007), wherein this Court held that beyond evidence of inhumane prison conditions, a claimant can demonstrate a likelihood of torture by providing some evidence that the authorities act with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering because of certain characteristics or medical conditions that a claimant possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The record reflects that the agency considered all of Thiersaint\u2019s legal arguments and the evidence he submitted in support of his claim. First, the IJ expressly considered \u201cwhether based on [Thiersaint\u2019s] particular characteristics [he would] be subjected to torture,\u201d and found that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Thiersaint\u2019s situation presents \u201ca close case,\u201d he had failed to establish that he will more likely than not be tortured upon his return to Haiti, as there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to show widespread physical beatings intended by Haitian government officials of criminal deportees, or even criminal deportees similarly situated to [Thiersaint].\u201d <em>In re Emmanuel Thiersaint, </em>No. A044 588 716 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 27, 2009); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (rejecting the notion that the agency must \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, although the IJ accorded \u201csome weight\u201d to a report submitted by Thiersaint\u2019s expert witness, which suggested that disabled criminal deportees are especially vulnerable to mistreatment, the IJ reasonably determined that this evidence was \u201cinsufficient ... to show that [Thiersaint would] be targeted by Haitian officials for torture.\u201d <em>In re Emmanuel Thiersaint, </em>No. A044 588 716 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 27, 2009); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, while the expert\u2019s report provides general examples of the poor prison conditions to which criminal deportees may be subjected, and discusses in general terms the treatment of physically disabled persons in Haiti, it does not identify any specific instances in which a physically disabled criminal deportee had been targeted for torture because of his physical characteristics. <em>See Pierre, </em>502 F.3d at 121-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Moreover, although the BIA did not expressly address whether Thiersaint will more likely than not be singled out for harsh treatment because of his physical disability, as with the IJ, we presume that the BIA \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record eompellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 337 n. 17. Here, nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the BIA ignored any of Thiersaint\u2019s legal arguments or the evidence he submitted in support of his claim. To the contrary, the BIA expressly referenced the country condition evidence and the expert witness report in its decision, and acknowledged Thiersaint\u2019s physical disability and the potential hardships that he may endure in prison as a result of his condition, and found that the \u201clack of medical care and likely pain that [Thiersaint] will experience due to the leg amputation ... is an unfortunate but unintended consequence of the poor conditions in the Haitian prisons,\u201d and that this \u201cunintended consequence is not the type of proscribed purpose contemplated by the [CAT].\u201d <em>In re Emmanuel Thiersaint, </em>No. A044 588 716 (B.I.A. May 27, 2009). Because the agency considered the basis of Thiersaint\u2019s claim and the evidence submitted in support of that claim, and Thiersaint raises no other legal or constitutional challenges to the denial of CAT relief, the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief is not subject to further review. <em>See Pierre, </em>502 F.3d at 121-22; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We finally address Thiersaint\u2019s argument that he was deprived of due process when the BIA failed to send him a copy of the DHS\u2019s opposition brief and denied his untimely motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief. Respondent alleges, and petitioner does not dispute, that the Department of Homeland Security made proper service of its brief by mailing a copy to petitioner at his correct address. Because Thiersaint has not cited any legal authority or procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>rules that explicitly require the BIA to send him copies of an opposition brief, and because he has had a meaningful opportunity to address all the issues implicated in that brief, we conclude that he has failed to demonstrate a due process rights violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">II. Docket Number 11-4247-ag\u2014Mo-tion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) and (e), this Court may permit an indigent appellant to proceed IFP, but must dismiss the appeal if the Court determines that it is frivolous. An appeal is frivolous when it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). The jurisdictional bar contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies equally to a petition seeking review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Durant v. INS, </em>393 F.3d 113, 115-16 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Thiersaint\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Where, as here, the BIA considers relevant evidence of country conditions in evaluating the motion to reopen, we review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Jian Hui Shoo v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">An alien may file only one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Thiersaint\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely because it was filed more than two years after the BIA issued its final order of removal, there is no time limitation for filing a motion to reopen if it is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Assuming that we retain jurisdiction over Thiersaint\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that his evidence did not materially affect his eligibility for deferral of removal under the CAT, his claim is without merit. As the BIA noted, while the evidence indicated that criminal deportees continued to encounter \u201cunduly harsh conditions\u201d in Haitian prisons, it did not indicate that Thiersaint will more likely than not be individually and intentionally singled out for torture by or with the acquiescence of Haitian prison officials because of his physical disability. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17; <em>see also Pierre, </em>502 F.3d at 121. Moreover, nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the BIA failed to consider any of Thiersaint\u2019s evidence. <em>See Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 169; <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 337 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Contrary to Thiersaint\u2019s argument that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard in concluding that his evidence was not material to his claim for CAT relief, a review of the record confirms that the BIA properly identified and applied the standard set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), which states that a \u201cmotion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">For these reasons, Thiersaint\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied and the petition for review is dismissed because it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e); <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
