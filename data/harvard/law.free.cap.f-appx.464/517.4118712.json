STRANCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">Plaintiffs Engintee Corp., Reggie Huff, Lisa Huff, Franklin Johnson, and David Brys (collectively \u201cEngintee\u201d) appeal from a district court order dismissing their complaint against various Defendants. The district court dismissed seven of the thirteen Defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction and dismissed Engintec\u2019s entire complaint with prejudice for violating Rule 8 of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and for acting in bad faith. Engintee appeals both holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, and hearing oral argument, this Court determines that no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a panel opinion. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Engintec\u2019s complaint with prejudice for the reasons stated in Judge Lioi\u2019s July 27, 2009 Memorandum Opinion, with the following qualification:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">The district court\u2019s analysis of Rules 8(a) and 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is applicable to Engintec\u2019s entire complaint, as it relates to all claims and all Defendants, and we find this analysis dispositive. Therefore, we adopt the district court\u2019s summation of the facts and procedure in Section I of its opinion and its analysis of Rules 8 and 41 in Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>II.C and affirm dismissal of Engintec\u2019s entire complaint with prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
