Judge Edwards designated an employment discrimination suit filed by McPeters as an electronic filing (\u201ce-file\u201d) case, thereby requiring that she pay certain fees imposed by LexisNexis in order to file pleadings and other court documents electronically. In the district court, McPeters sought to have the e-filing fees declared unconstitutional as denying her access to the courts, as well as in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-68. She also brought various state and common-law claims, over which the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction once it had dismissed her constitutional and federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">After considering the record, the parties\u2019 briefs and the arguments contained therein, as well as entertaining oral argument, this Court is of the firm commitment that no reversible error has been shown. The ruling of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
