We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">Bryant contends that the pre-trial photo identification procedure was unduly suggestive and tainted the witness\u2019 in-court identification. The pre-trial photo identification procedure was not unduly suggestive. Moreover, the in-court identification was sufficiently reliable. <em>See Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Plascencia v. Alameida, </em>467 F.3d 1190, 1197-98 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-22\">Bryant also contends that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to move to exclude the witness\u2019 pre-trial or in-court identification of him as being a result of an impermissibly suggestive identification procedure. As stated above, the identification procedure was not unduly suggestive. Accordingly, Bryant did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had his counsel challenged the pre-trial identification procedure. <em>See Wilson v. Henry, 185 F.3d </em>986, 990 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See Penry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792-93, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-23\">Bryant\u2019s motion to expand the certificate of appealability is denied. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
