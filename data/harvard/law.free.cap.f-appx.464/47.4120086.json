Crisdon appeals pro se from the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion for summary judgment. For the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>sons that follow, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In June 2010, Myron Crisdon filed a complaint in the District Court, alleging that the New Jersey Department of Education (\u201cNJDOE\u201d) violated the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to issue him a high school diploma. Shortly thereafter, Crisdon filed a motion for summary judgment, and a request to expedite a ruling on that motion. Before NJDOE responded to the complaint or motion and before the District Court entered an order regarding the complaint or motion, on July 8, 2010, Crisdon filed a notice of appeal, in which he requested that \u201cthe [Cjourt expedite[ his] motion for summary judgment for the relief demanded in [his] complaint....\u201d We dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. C.A. No. 10-3147. Crisdon then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied in May 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">While Crisdon\u2019s first appeal was pending, NJDOE filed a motion to dismiss in October 2010, arguing that Crisdon\u2019s claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and in the alternative, Crisdon\u2019s claim was barred because NJDOE is not a person subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By order entered April 13, 2011, the District Court granted NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Crisdon did not appeal that order. Instead, in August 2011, Crisdon filed a \u201cmotion for summary judgment,\u201d arguing that his claim was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that NJDOE is a person under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Crisdon also sent a letter to the District Court explaining that he did not file a response to NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss because NJDOE should have filed the motion to dismiss with this Court instead of the District Court. Crisdon additionally argued that the District Court erred in granting NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss while his petition for writ of certiorari was pending with the Supreme Court. The District Court appears to have construed Crisdon\u2019s \u201cmotion for summary judgment\u201d and letter as a motion for reconsideration under Local Rule 7.1 (i), and denied it as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crisdon timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review an order denying a post-judgment motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Coltec Indus., Inc. v. Hobgood, </em>280 F.3d 262, 269 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki, </em>779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion for reconsideration ... is to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d Cir.1999). In his \u201cmotion for summary judgment,\u201d Crisdon argued that his suit was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that NJDOE is a person under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Crisdon also argued, in his supplemental letter to the District Court, that the District Court erred as a matter of law by granting NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss while his petition for writ of certiorari was pending with the Supreme Court. Thus, Crisdon\u2019s motion and letter essentially alleged legal error and therefore the District Court did not err in construing Crisdon\u2019s \u201cmotion for summary judgment\u201d and letter as a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Fiorelli, </em>337 F.3d 282, 288 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The District Court apparently denied relief under Local Rule 7.1(i). It did not discuss whether Crisdon\u2019s motion could be considered under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relief, however, was unavailable under Local Rule 7.1(i), Rule 59(e), and Rule 60(b). Rule 7.1(i) motions must be filed within 14 days of entry of final judgment, while Rule 59(e) motions must be filed within 28 days of entry of final judgment. Crisdon\u2019s motion was filed approximately four months after the District Court dismissed his complaint, and therefore was untimely under both Rule 7.1(i) and Rule 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">A Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be made within a reasonable time ... no more than a year after the entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c). Thus, Crisdon\u2019s motion was timely under Rule 60(b). However, a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmay not be used as a substitute for an appeal, and ... legal error, without more\u201d does not warrant relief under that provision. <em>Fiorelli, </em>337 F.3d at 288. Crisdon simply alleged legal error in his \u201cmotion for summary judgment\u201d and letter. Crisdon could have raised on appeal his arguments challenging the dismissal of his complaint, as well as his arguments regarding jurisdiction. Consequently, relief was also unavailable under Rule 60(b). <em>See Martinez-McBean v. Gov\u2019t of V.I., </em>562 F.2d 908, 911-12 (3d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crisdon\u2019s \u201cmotion for summary judgment.\u201d Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. Prior to granting NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court dismissed Crisdon's motion for summary judgment without prejudice, and afforded him the opportunity to respond to NJDOE\u2019s motion to dismiss. Crisdon did not file a response to NJDOE's motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-13\">. NJDOE requested that the motion for summary judgment be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
