Burton did not challenge the findings of the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) that he had three prior convictions for violent felonies, and his attorney expressly admitted at the sentencing hearing before the District Court that Burton had \u201cthree prior felony convictions that qualify as predicates under 924(e).\u201d J.A. 57.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court sentenced Burton to 180 months, the minimum sentence authorized under the ACCA. Burton thereafter filed an appeal challenging his sentence, contending for the first time, and contrary to his counsel\u2019s admissions in filings submitted to the District Court and in open court, that he did not qualify as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. We review the sentence imposed by the District Court for \u201cplain error\u201d and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-17\">Burton was arrested on January 2, 2009 following a traffic stop in which an officer detected what appeared to be a concealed weapon in Burton\u2019s pocket, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>proved from a search to be a loaded .32 caliber handgun. J.A. 83. Burton was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury on July 9, 2009 for knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of a crime punishable by more than one in year in prison, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. The indictment further stated that Burton had three prior convictions for violent felonies, making him subject to sentencing under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The ACCA requires that any person with three prior violent felony or serious drug convictions serve a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years on certain subsequent federal convictions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Burton subsequently pled guilty to the charge contained in the federal indictment, and a PSR was prepared. The PSR set forth Burton\u2019s prior criminal convictions under North Carolina law that included a 1970 conviction for \u201cassault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill inflicting serious bodily injury,\u201d a 1974 conviction for first degree rape, and a 1995 conviction for second degree rape. J.A. 83-85. The PSR described the circumstances of Burton\u2019s second degree rape conviction, which included the choking of the victim and the displaying of a straight razor to coerce the victim\u2019s submission. <em>Id. </em>at 84-85. The PSR made a finding that Burton was an armed career criminal under the ACCA because of the three above-referenced convictions for violent felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Burton did not object to any of the facts underlying the 1970,1974, and 1995 convictions or his designation as an armed career criminal under the ACCA as set forth in the PSR. Instead, Burton urged the District Court in his formally filed objections to the PSR not to make an upward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA of fifteen years. <em>Id. </em>at 91. A sentencing memorandum submitted by Burton\u2019s counsel described the 1995 second degree rape conviction as Burton\u2019s \u201cmost recent violent felony\u201d and conceded that \u201c[a]s an \u2018armed career criminal,\u2019 Mr. Burton faces a minimum 15-year sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 44. At the sentencing hearing, Burton\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Burton \u201chas three prior felony convictions that qualify as predicates under 924(e)\u201d and \u201ccertainly\u201d had \u201cprior violent felonies\u201d making him subject to the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. Nonetheless, Burton\u2019s counsel argued that the District Court should sentence his client to less than the fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA because Burton\u2019s most recent violent felony (the 1995 second degree rape conviction) was \u201cover 17 years ago and ... there is nothing to indicate that he is likely to engage in the future [in] violent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. The District Court concluded that it was bound by the mandatory minimum sentence provision of the ACCA and sentenced Burton to 180 months in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Burton timely filed this appeal. On appeal, Burton concedes that the convictions for assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill inflicting serious bodily injury and for first degree rape are both violent felony convictions which qualify as predicate convictions for purposes of the ACCA. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8 n.l. Further, Burton does not dispute the PSR\u2019s description of the facts which form the basis of his second degree rape conviction. However, Burton argues on appeal that the District Court erred in treating his conviction for second degree rape as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 11-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">On appeal, the government argues that Burton \u201cwaived\u201d the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s decision to sentence him under the ACCA. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 10-12. While the mere \u201cforfeiture\u201d of a right al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>lows an appellant to seek appellate review under the plain error standard, the \u201cwaiver\u201d of a right prevents a party from seeking an appeal under any standard of review. <em>See United States v. Olano, 507 </em>U.S. 725, 733-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (distinguishing between forfeiture and waiver and holding that \u201c[i]f a legal rule was violated during the district court proceedings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then there has been an \u2018error\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despite, the absence of a timely objection\u201d). This Court, however, need not reach the question of whether Burton waived, or merely forfeited, the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s decision to sentence him under the ACCA. As discussed below, even if Burton did not waive his right to appeal his sentence, the District Court did not commit plain error in sentencing Burton under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under plain error review, Burton has the burden of establishing (1) an error, (2) that is plain, that not only (3) affects his substantial rights, but also (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Brack, </em>651 F.3d 388, 392 (4th Cir.2011). \u201cAn error is \u2018plain\u2019 when it is \u2018obvious or clear under current law,\u201d meaning that the appellant must \u201cshow that \u2018the settled law of the Supreme Court or this circuit establishes\u2019 the district court erred in imposing a sentencing enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Here, the record establishes that the District Court did not commit plain error in classifying Burton\u2019s second degree rape conviction as a violent felony and sentencing Burton pursuant to the ACCA. The PSR, in addition to describing the violent nature of Burton\u2019s conduct which resulted in his conviction for second degree rape, clearly identified Burton\u2019s second degree rape conviction (along with his assault with a deadly weapon and first degree rape convictions) as a predicate conviction for purposes of the ACCA. J.A. 88. Because Burton did not object to this portion of the PSR, the District Court was certainly authorized to accept this portion of the PSR as a finding of fact. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3) (\u201cAt sentencing, the court: (A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Padron, </em>No. 09-4486, 2010 WL 5475654, at *1 (4th Cir. Dec.9, 2010) (holding that the District Court did not commit plain error by accepting undisputed portions of a PSR as findings of fact for purposes of sentencing enhancements). Furthermore, Burton, through his counsel, affirmatively represented to the District Court numerous times, both in writing and in open court, that Burton had been convicted of three violent felonies and was therefore subject to the ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence. <em>See </em>J.A. 42, 44, 45, 57, 91. Such admissions by defense counsel are binding on the defendant. <em>See United States v. Bartram, </em>407 F.3d 307, 310-11 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that an admission by defense counsel at a sentencing hearing regarding drug weight was binding on defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Based on the foregoing, the District Court\u2019s sentence of Defendant under the ACCA was not plain error. Therefore, the decision of the District Court is affirmed. This Court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this Court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>pensed with oral argument for this appeal because the facts and legal contentions were adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">.
