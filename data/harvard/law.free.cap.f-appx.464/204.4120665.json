She appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-22\">Aubrey argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. She maintains that the sentencing court never made any findings regarding the quantity of drugs attributable to her and that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. Aubrey also argues that the district court erred in denying her motion for appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only where the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is actually lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Aubrey was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses, did not change her sentencing range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706; \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Further, a \u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir. 1995). Finally, contrary to Aubrey\u2019s assertion, <em>Booker </em>is not applicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-39. The district court also did not err in failing to appoint counsel to represent Aubrey in connection with her \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
