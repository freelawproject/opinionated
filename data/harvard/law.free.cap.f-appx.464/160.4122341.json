The district court sentenced Ortiz-Mercado to two months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to the sentence he was serving at the time of his offense. Ortiz-Mercado appeals, arguing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Finding the sentence substantively reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If we find the sentence procedurally reasonable,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). A sentencing court must \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes [of sentencing].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006). \u201cEven if we would have reached a different sentencing result on our own, this fact alone is \u2018insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 474 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">After a review of the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. The court considered arguments from both parties regarding mitigating and aggravating sentencing factors, and it explicitly accounted for Ortiz-Mercado\u2019s serious illness in announcing its sentence. The district court did not act unreasonably in considering the need to punish Ortiz-Mercado\u2019s federal offense separately from administrative sanctions assessed by prison officials. Ultimately, we conclude the brief sentence imposed was not disproportionate with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as a whole, and the district court\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive sentence amounting to one-third of the statutory maximum did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-12\"> Ortiz-Mercado does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999) (noting that party\u2019s failure to raise issue in opening brief results in abandonment of issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
