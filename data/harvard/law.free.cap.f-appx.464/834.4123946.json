The district court issued a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether it failed to provide Williams with the notice and warning mandated by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-20\">Under <em>Castro, </em>a district court cannot recharacterize a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as an initial section 2255 motion without first (1) notifying the litigant that it intends to recharacterize the motion; (2) warning the litigant that this recharacterization means that later section 2255 motions would be subject to the restrictions on second or successive section 2255 motions; and (3) giving the litigant the opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it to include all of the litigant\u2019s claims. <em>Castro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 792. \u201cIf the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law\u2019s \u2018second or successive\u2019 restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The requirements of <em>Castro </em>apply even when the district court denies a recharacterized section 2255 motion as untimely. <em>Gooden v. United States, </em>627 F.3d 846, 849 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">That the district court failed to give Williams the notice and warning required by <em>Castro </em>is undisputed. Williams\u2019s remedy for this error is that\u2014should he file a later section 2255 motion\u2014it cannot be barred as second or successive based on the instant recharacterized motion. <em>See Castro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 792. But because no other remedy, including remand, is available to address the district court\u2019s error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b861-17\"> Our review is limited to those issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, we will not consider Williams\u2019s arguments about the substantive merits of his post-conviction motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
