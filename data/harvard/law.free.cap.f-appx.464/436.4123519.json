Gwin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-4\">GWIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Sherry Berry, a Michigan citizen, appeals a district court order denying her motion for a new trial in a diversity breach of contract action that she filed against her automobile insurance company. She argues that the district court erred when it allowed the defendant to offer opinion evidence of a board certified neurologist. That neurologist gave opinion testimony that Berry\u2019s preexisting hypertension caused cerebral hemorrhage and that Berry\u2019s automobile collision did not cause her hemorrhage. Berry also argues that the district court erred during instructions to the jury and erred in allowing live testimony from a witness who defendant originally said would be presented through a deposition. For the reasons described below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">On December 8, 2006, Berry was involved in a motor vehicle accident when her car struck a car parked on the side of the road. She was taken to the hospital, where she was treated for a cut lip, a laceration to her hand, and a cerebral hemorrhage. Berry sued her insurance carrier to recover the medical costs and resultant damages from the cerebral hemorrhage. With her case, she claimed that her head injury resulted when she struck her head on the windshield of her car during the accident. Berry made this claim even though her main problem was a thalamus-area bleed in one of the brain\u2019s deepest structures. In contrast to Berry\u2019s argument that the accident <em>caused </em>the center brain bleeding, the defendant said that the brain hemorrhage resulted from a preexisting hypertensive condition and the accident followed\u2014and did not create\u2014 this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Berry moved the court to stop defendant from presenting any expert testimony on the issue of whether she suffered from high blood pressure prior to the accident. The district court denied the motion. Berry also moved to preclude the use of depositions of the medical experts in lieu of live testimony. The district court denied the motion, but ruled that the depositions could only be used if the witnesses were shown to be unavailable. At trial, the defense presented a neurologist who gave the opinion that Berry suffered a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, and this hemorrhage caused her to wreck her car. It argued that Berry\u2019s damages did not arise out of the use of her automobile, and that she could not recover damages under Michigan No-Fault Act. The jury found for the defendant. Berry\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Berry now argues that the district court erred in allowing the defense to present opinion testimony that she suffered from hypertension before the accident; rejecting her proposed jury instructions; allowing the defense to depose two witnesses who later testified at trial; and denying her motion for a new trial where the jury\u2019s verdict was arguably inconsistent and against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). Berry argues that the district court failed to fulfill its function of determining whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>defense experts\u2019 testimony rested on a reliable foundation and whether their reasoning was scientifically valid. <em>See Kentucky Speedway, LLC v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 908, 915 (6th Cir.2009). Contrary to Berry\u2019s argument, the expert testimony that she suffered from hypertension prior to the accident was sufficiently based on evidence. Defendant showed that the expert testimony was sufficiently relevant and sufficiently reliable. Although Berry had never been diagnosed with or treated for hypertension, she did have two blood pressure readings, taken by her treating physician, of 146/92 in 2005 and 140/90 in 2006. Also, the defendant offered post-accident evidence showing that Berry exhibited indications of white matter disease. Testimony supported that white matter disease is most likely due to chronic hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Further, Berry admitted that she had a headache prior to the accident and could not explain why she was on the street where the accident occurred. Therefore, sufficient evidence supported the experts\u2019 testimony that Berry likely suffered from hypertension before the accident. Although Berry gave evidence that a collision could cause the bleed to the deep brain thalamus area, other evidence suggested that \u201cher hemorrhage is not in the classic location for a traumatic type of hemorrhage.\u201d Berry did not show that the experts\u2019 methodology was in any way unscientific or unreliable. Therefore, no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Berry next argues that the district court erred in rejecting her proposed jury instructions. While we review the rejection of a proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion, <em>Hisrich v. Volvo Cars of N. Am., Inc., </em>226 F.3d 445, 449 (6th Cir.2000), we review the correctness of the jury instructions de novo. <em>Jones v. Federated Fin. Reserve Corp., </em>144 F.3d 961, 966 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Berry relies on <em>Scott v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>278 Mich.App. 578, 751 N.W.2d 51, 56 (2008), for the proposition that she was not required to exclude other possible causes of her damages in order to recover. In <em>Scott, </em>the plaintiff presented testimony showing how the accident contributed to her medical problems. <em>Id. </em>Here, plaintiffs expert was unable to explain how\u2014if the jury believed that the hemorrhage preceded the accident\u2014the accident could have worsened Berry\u2019s hemorrhage. Berry, whose case rested on the theory that she did <em>not </em>have a preexisting condition, failed to \u201cpresent substantial <em>evidence </em>from which [the] jury\u201d could conclude that the accident merely contributed to, rather than caused, her injury. <em>Meemic Ins. Co. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., </em>717 F.Supp.2d 752, 769 (E.D.Mich.2010) (applying Michigan state-law) (emphasis in original). Berry\u2019s expert did, at one point, comment that \u201c[the hemorrhage] could also certainly be made significantly worse,\u201d by the accident. But to \u201crely on alternative theories of causation,\u201d a plaintiff \u201cmust support each theory with admissible evidence, and may not rely on conjecture or speculation.\u201d <em>Walk v. Baker Coll. of Auburn Hills, </em>No. 299925, 2011 WL 5555828, at *5 (Mich.Ct.App. Nov.15, 2011) (citing <em>Skinner v. Square D. Co., </em>445 Mich. 153, 516 N.W.2d 475, 480 (1994)). Thus, while Berry was not required to exclude all other possible causes, she did not present sufficient evidence to support an alternative theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Furthermore, in <em>Nowyorkas v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>No. 168726, 1996 WL 33681826 (Mich.App. May 24, 1996), the Michigan appellate court held that injuries that cannot be attributed to a single identifiable event are excluded from coverage under the Michigan No Fault Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Berry\u2019s remaining challenges to the jury instructions involve the instructions as to the amount of damages. But given the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the defendant, any issue with the damage instructions does not matter. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Berry also argues that the district court should not have allowed the defendant to depose two of its expert witnesses before trial for possible use at trial. These defense expert witnesses ultimately did testify at trial. Berry offers the novel argument that the depositions unfairly allowed the witnesses to better prepare for cross-examination and precluded the jury from observing the unprepared cross-examination at the depositions. She cites <em>Allgeier v. United States, </em>909 F.2d 869 (6th Cir.1990), for the proposition that the proponent of a deposition must establish that the witness is unavailable. However, Berry earlier asked to stop the use of depositions in lieu of live testimony. But after these expert witnesses did testify at trial, Berry now complains that the earlier depositions allowed the experts to better prepare. She cites no authority for the argument that the depositions should have been prohibited to prevent the witnesses from learning her trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Finally, citing <em>Anchor v. O'Toole, </em>94 F.3d 1014, 1021 (6th Cir.1996), Berry argues that she was entitled to a new trial because the jury\u2019s decision to award no damages was not one it could have reasonably reached. We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nolan v. Memphis City Sch., </em>589 F.3d 257, 264 (6th Cir.2009). Here, Berry\u2019s argument is contradicted by her attorney\u2019s concession that the jury could have concluded that only her lip and hand injuries were caused by the accident, and that damages for those injuries were not at issue. Because the verdict reached in this case was reasonable, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Berry\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>See J.C. Wyckoff &amp; Assoc. v. Standard Fire Ins. Co., </em>936 F.2d 1474, 1487 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">For all of the above reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b466-8\">JANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYa5\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">I respectfully dissent because I believe the district court erred in rejecting two of Berry\u2019s proposed jury instructions. One of these instructions came directly from a recent Michigan Supreme Court case while the other accurately reflects Michigan law and was crucial to Berry\u2019s alternative argument that her brain injury was exacerbated by the accident. Accordingly, I would hold Berry is entitled to a new trial at which these instructions should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The Michigan No-Fault Act requires insurers to pay benefits to the insured \u201cfor accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 500.3105(1). The term \u201carising out of\u2019 is not defined in the statute. Consistent with the statute, the trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiff had the burden of proof to show that her \u201cinjuries arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Berry requested the following as part of the causation instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">In order to recover no-fault benefits from her insurance company, Plaintiff is not required to establish direct or proximate causation. Almost any causal connection will do. Plaintiff is not required to exclude other possible causes of her problems in order to recover against Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>She also requested the following instruction on apportionment of damages for preexisting injuries, which is a modified version of Mich. Model Civ. Jury Instr. 50.11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">If an injury suffered by Ms. Berry is a combined product of both a preexisting condition and the effects of the automobile accident, it is your duty to determine and award damages caused by the accident alone. You must separate the damages caused by the accident from the condition which was preexisting if it is possible to do so. However, if after careful consideration, you are unable to separate the damages caused by the accident from those which were preexisting, then the entire amount of plaintiffs damages must be assessed against the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Both instructions were denied. Berry argues that these denials were erroneous and prejudicial because they (1) allowed the insurance company to impose a higher standard of causation (that of a single, sole cause) and (2) prevented the jury from finding that, even if she had a brain hemorrhage just before the accident, the accident exacerbated this preexisting injury. Instead, the jury had to make an \u201call or nothing\u201d decision that the crash either caused the hemorrhage or it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The majority opinion first rejects Berry\u2019s citation to <em>Scott v. State Farm Mutual Automotive Insurance Co., </em>278 Mich.App. 578, 751 N.W.2d 51 (2008), <em>vacated in part, </em>482 Mich. 1074, 758 N.W.2d 249 (2008), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g, </em>483 Mich. 1032, 766 N.W.2d 273 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">In <em>Scott, </em>the plaintiff presented testimony showing how the accident contributed to her medical problems. <em>Id. </em>Here, plaintiffs expert was unable to explain how\u2014if the jury believed that the hemorrhage preceded the accident\u2014the accident could have worsened Berry\u2019s hemorrhage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">This is at odds with the record. Berry\u2019s expert testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">[The hemorrhage] could certainly occur with the type of force that was delivered. It could also certainly be made significantly worse with the significant jostling of the brain due to the force delivered, as well as the concurrent rise in blood pressure due to the accident and her emotional reaction to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">The expert further testified that a subsequent head injury can have an effect that is \u201csynergistic rather than just additive,\u201d using as an example the fact that an NFL quarterback had been held out of a game after sustaining a head injury in an earlier game. During closing arguments, Berry\u2019s attorney reminded the jury that her expert testified, \u201cthe accident caused the intracranial bleed. If it didn\u2019t, it made it worse.\u201d Although it is clear from the record that Berry\u2019s argument and her expert\u2019s testimony was primarily based on the theory that the accident completely caused her injury, it is equally clear that evidence of the alternative theory of exacerbation was also presented to the jury. <em>See Robelin v. Spectrum Health Hosp., </em>488 Mich. 1000, 791 N.W.2d 466, 469 (2010) (stating that \u201cevidence\u201d includes \u201cexpert testimony\u201d); <em>Walk v. Baker Coll. of Auburn Hills, </em>No. 299925, 2011 WL 5555828, at *5 (Mich.Ct.App. Nov.15, 2011) (citing <em>Skinner v. Square D Co., </em>445 Mich. 153, 516 N.W.2d 475 (1994)) (permitting \u201calternative theories of causation\u201d if supported by evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">The majority opinion cites only one case which actually purports to support its conclusion on this issue, <em>Nowyorkas v. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., </em>No. 168726, 1996 WL 33681826 (Mich.Ct.App. May 24, 1996). <em>Nowyorkas, </em>which is unpublished and has never been cited by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Michigan state court, itself cites only one case as support for its holding that \u201can injury which could not be attributed to a single identifiable event was excluded from coverage under the no-fault act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1 (citing <em>Williams v. Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Exch., </em>169 Mich.App. 301, 425 N.W.2d 534 (1988)). Taking another step back to the decision cited in <em>Williams </em>for this proposition, we learn that the term \u201csingle identifiable event\u201d is intended to distinguish an injury resulting from an accident from injuries arising \u201cfrom a series of events spanning many years\u201d\u2014in that case a chronic back injury sustained by nineteen years of truck driving\u2014and does so primarily because the No Fault Act frequently uses the term \u201caccident.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. Tucker Freight Lines Co., Inc., </em>125 Mich.App. 123, 336 N.W.2d 14, 16 (1983). <em>Williams </em>did not turn on this distinction because, although there was a car accident, the plaintiffs own doctor attributed the claimed injury to an earlier work injury rather than the accident. 425 N.W.2d at 536. Here, as Berry observes, there is a single identifiable event to which the injury (or at least its exacerbation) could be attributed, the car accident, to which Berry\u2019s doctor attributed all or part of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In their briefs, both parties cited several more recent and relevant cases, including decisions by the Michigan Supreme Court which address these issues. Most beneficially for Berry, the Michigan Supreme Court used language very similar to that of the first proposed jury instruction quoted above when discussing \u201cthe causal nexus required in a no-fault case involving injury\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">[Ejvidence establishing almost any causal connection will suffice when it is more than merely fortuitous, incidental, or but for. But it need not be much more; almost any causal connection <em>or </em>relationship will do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\"><em>Scott v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>483 Mich. 1032, 766 N.W.2d 273, 275 (2009) (Kelly, C.J., concurring). This decision vacated the court\u2019s earlier reversal of <em>Scott.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It upheld the determination of the Michigan Court of Appeals that there was a question of fact as to whether a plaintiff could recover no-fault insurance coverage for her cholesterol medication under the \u201csomewhat attenuated\u201d theory that a previous car accident a decade earlier caused her high-cholesterol problem by preventing her from exercising and eating properly. <em>Scott, </em>751 N.W.2d at 56. The court reached this conclusion despite the fact that \u201ca genetic predisposition to [the condition] is apparently present\u201d because \u201cthere is no authority that, for purposes of personal protection insurance, a plaintiff must exclude other possible causes.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Estate of Favazza, </em>No. 294705, 2011 WL 566830, at *3 (Mich.Ct.App. Feb.17, 2011) (citing Scott for proposition that \u201c[t]he motor vehicle accident need only be one of the causes of the injury, as there may be other independent causes.\u201d). Exacerbation of an existing hemorrhage by hitting one\u2019s head on a windshield is surely less attenuated causation than the alleged cause of injury in <em>Scott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Under Michigan law, \u201c[i]f an instruction is applicable to the case, accurately states the law, and was requested, the trial court must give it.\u201d <em>Whitman v. City of Burton, </em>810 N.W.2d 71, 293 Mich.App. 220 (2011) (citing <em>Lewis v. LeGrow, </em>258 Mich.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>175, 670 N.W.2d 675 (2003)). I believe the first instruction meets these criteria because causation was a significant issue in the case, the language came directly from a published decision which had recently been upheld by the state high court, and it was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">As to the second rejected instruction, Mich. Model Civ. Jury Instr. 50.11 allows juries to apportion damages when \u201can injury suffered by plaintiff is a combined product of both a preexisting <em>[disease/injury/state of heath] </em>and the effects of defendant\u2019s negligent conduct.\u201d If a jury is unable to separate the damages, the entire amount must be assessed against the defendant. A recent unpublished decision held that this \u201cinstruction is a negligence instruction that simply does not apply in first party, no-fault insurance litigation.\u201d <em>Chalko v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>No. 278215, 2009 WL 2003320, at *3 (Mich.Ct.App. July 9, 2009). However, the court made clear that the plaintiff had requested only an <em>unmodified </em>version of the instruction and \u201cdid not in any way preserve the notion that this standard instruction should be modified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This suggests that a modified instruction to account for the no-fault circumstances, such as Berry\u2019s, might have been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">A lengthy dissent in <em>Chalko </em>argued that some type of pre-existing injury instruction was required because \u201c[i]t is clear that first party no-fault insurance does provide for coverage for services that result from a combination of conditions so long as one of those conditions is an auto accident injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7 (Shapiro, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Morales v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>279 Mich.App. 720, 761 N.W.2d 454 (2008)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Shapiro observed that \u201cM Civ JI 50.11 is not in the \u2018negligence\u2019 section of the model jury instructions, but instead in the \u2018damages\u2019 section and so can be readily adapted to non-negligence cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. He also noted that, like Berry, the plaintiff offered evidence of a much stronger causal connection than in <em>Scott. Id. </em>at *8. As a result of these concerns, a mere \u201carising out of\u2019 instruction without an instruction accounting for a \u201ccombination\u201d injury constituted reversible error because \u201cit resulted in a failure to \u2018adequately and fairly\u2019 present \u2018the theories of the parties and the applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7, 9 (quoting <em>Case v. Consumers Power Co., </em>615 N.W.2d 17, 19 (Mich.2000)); <em>see also Kelmendi v. Citizens Ins. Co. of Am., </em>No. 264019, 2007 WL 419786, at *1 (Mich.Ct.App. Feb.8, 2007) (stating that combination injury instruction, such as Mich. Model Civ. Jury Instr. 50.11, \u201cmay have been useful to instruct the jury on how to evaluate [a] plaintiffs claim alleging aggravation of his pre-existing injuries\u201d in a no-fault case).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Under Michigan law, jury instructions \u201cshould not omit material issues, defenses, or theories if the evidence supports them.\u201d <em>Whitman, </em>810 N.W.2d at 87 (quoting <em>Case, </em>615 N.W.2d at 19). Without the requested modified 50.11 instruction (or the one discussed above), Berry\u2019s alternative theory of exacerbation was entirely omitted from the jury instructions, leaving the jury without any explanation as to what \u201carising out of\u2019 means. Although this instruction may have related more to damages than causation, it would have nonetheless made clear to the jury that apportioned damages\u2014 and thus exacerbation of injury\u2014was a viable option for its verdict. <em>See Chalko, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>2009 WL 2003320, at *6 (quoting <em>Case, </em>615 NW.2d at 19) (noting appellate courts review instructions \u201cas a whole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">For the reasons above, I believe the district court committed reversible error in denying Berry\u2019s proposed jury instructions and I would grant a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-5\">. Allstate relies heavily on the first, vacated Michigan Supreme Court decision without accounting for its reversal.
