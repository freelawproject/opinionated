Because Missouri has been released from federal custody, his sentence did not include a term of supervised release, and there are no continuing collateral consequences from the district court\u2019s amended judgment on revocation of supervised release, we deny Missouri\u2019s motion to have his sentence expire immediately and dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 12-18, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
