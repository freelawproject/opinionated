We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Cortez contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court impermissibly made the violent nature of his underlying offense the focal point of its sentencing decision, the consecutive sentence effectively postpones Cortez\u2019s access to intensive substance abuse treatment by seven years, and the sentence is longer than necessary to deter him from future violations. These contentions fail. The district court considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), and did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l), (f); <em>United States v. Simtob, </em>485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the conduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the violator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the violator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
