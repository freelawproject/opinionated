The BIA held that Petitioner did not establish that she was persecuted on account of a protected ground. Petitioner argues that the BIA erred by overlooking evidence that she was persecuted on account of her religion. Because the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record, we deny Petitioner\u2019s application for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">We have jurisdiction over this case under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The facts of the case are known to the parties. We repeat them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b585-17\">When the BIA has conducted an independent review of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) opinion, this court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Sinotes-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1190, 1194 (9th Cir.2006). When the BIA has adopted portions of the IJ\u2019s opinion as its own, this court \u201ctreat[s] the IJ\u2019s statements of reasons as the BIA\u2019s and review[s] the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence standard, \u2018administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1185 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an alien must show that she faces persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Navas v. I.N.S., </em>217 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir.2000). To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show that her \u201c \u2018life or freedom would be threatened\u2019 on account of one of the same protected grounds that apply under the asylum statute.\u201d <em>Al-Harbi v. I.N.S., </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner was targeted by the Mara Salvatrucha gang (MS) for criminal purposes, rather than on account of her religion, is supported by substantial evidence. The BIA correctly noted that there is no evidence in the record showing that any MS member ever referred to Petitioner\u2019s religion while threatening her. The BIA also noted that the gang members never objected to Petitioner\u2019s religious activities and were only angry that she was making negative comments about the gang. The BIA further noted that the gang members threatened to kidnap Petitioner from her uncle\u2019s house because her uncle was wealthy. This evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that MS targeted Petitioner to further its criminal agenda rather than because of her religion. Reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard, the BIA\u2019s decision is not so unsupported by the record that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Because Petitioner failed to show that she was targeted on account of a protected ground, the BIA did not err in holding that Petitioner is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Petitioner\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b585-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
