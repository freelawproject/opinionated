Caesar</author>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">appeals the district court\u2019s judgment on the administrative record upholding Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company\u2019s termination of her long-term disability (LTD) benefits. Because we conclude that Hartford\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Caesar began working as a claims adjuster for the Allstate Corporation in 1973 and participated in Allstate\u2019s LTD insurance plan, issued by Hartford. Caesar stopped working in September 2003 due to severe back and right leg pain. On October 8, 2003, she underwent a lumbar laminectomy and partial discectomy to remove a large extruded disc fragment. The goal of the surgery, performed by Dr. Christopher Furey, was \u201crelief of right leg pain.\u201d Caesar subsequently applied for LTD benefits, which Hartford approved effective January 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Caesar demonstrated gradual improvement after the surgery and was able to walk with a cane. Her condition began to worsen after a few months, however, and an MRI showed a recurrence of her disc herniation. Dr. Furey performed a lumbar revision and fusion on September 14, 2004. A March 31, 2005, CT scan revealed degenerative disc disease at the L4-L5 level with a successful fusion and no evidence of hardware failure. On June 23, 2005, Dr. Furey noted Caesar\u2019s leg pain had improved but that she suffered from \u201congoing back pain,\u201d that she \u201ccontinue[d] to remain disabled,\u201d and that it was \u201cunlikely that she will be able to return to work.\u201d When Dr. Furey saw Caesar on December 29, 2005, he noted that Caesar was doing \u201cfairly well\u201d and had improved since before her surgery, although she had \u201cbaseline chronic low back pain.\u201d Dr. Furey\u2019s notes also reflect that Caesar developed a \u201cfoot drop\u201d after the surgery and began wearing an ankle-foot orthotic (AFO) because of weakness in her right ankle.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">On August 19, 2005, Dr. Furey completed an Attending Physician Statement (APS) and a Physical Capacities Evaluation (PCE), indicating a primary diagnosis of spinal stenosis and secondary diagnoses of chronic back pain and leg pain and weakness. Dr. Furey stated that Caesar could sit, stand, and walk for up to thirty minutes at a time, up to one or two hours per day, and that she was \u201ctotally disabled permanently.\u201d On December 14, 2005, Hartford informed Caesar that she qualified as disabled under the \u201cany occupation\u201d standard and would continue to receive LTD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">In July 2006, Hartford requested updated information from Caesar\u2019s treating physicians. In a PCE completed on August 28, 2006, Dr. Furey stated that Caesar could sit for one or two hours at a time up to four to six hours a day\u2014an increase from the one-hour restriction he set forth just a month earlier\u2014but repeated that Caesar\u2019s chronic pain and limited motion rendered her \u201cpermanently disabled.\u201d In January 2007, a Hartford employee reviewed Caesar\u2019s claim and concluded that these restrictions and limitations were supported by the record and that Caesar remained disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">After moving to the Columbus area, Caesar began seeing Dr. David Brandt as her primary physician. On February 7, 2007, Dr. Brandt completed a PCE and an APS, stating that Caesar could only sit for up to two hours and could not stand or walk in a workplace environment. After reviewing these forms, a Hartford employee again concluded that Caesar was disabled. Dr. Brandt completed another APS on August 25, 2007, giving a similar assessment of Caesar\u2019s physical capabilities (sitting no more than two hours a day and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>standing for fifteen minutes every four hours), and stating that these restrictions were likely to be permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">During this time, Caesar saw another orthopedic specialist, Dr. Raymond Warupa, who treated her for a laceration and severe carpal tunnel syndrome on her left hand, and mild carpal tunnel and \u201ctrigger thumb\u201d on her right hand. On February 18, 2008, Dr. Warupa performed a carpal tunnel release on Caesar\u2019s left hand and a right trigger thumb injection. After an office visit on June 24, 2008, Dr. Warupa noted that the left hand surgery was successful and that Caesar was contemplating surgery to address the carpal tunnel symptoms on her right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Dr. Brandt also referred Caesar to Dr. David Hannallah, an orthopedic specialist, for her worsening lower back pain. According to Dr. Hannallah\u2019s notes on December 5, 2007, Caesar was experiencing numbness, tingling and weakness in both legs, she was unable to stand up straight or walk without a cane, she had \u201ca poor straight line gait,\u201d she continued to wear an AFO on her right ankle, and she appeared \u201cdiffusely weak in her lower extremities.\u201d Dr. Hannallah ordered an MRI, which showed \u201c[mjultilevel facet degenerative change in the lumbar spine,\u201d a central disk protrusion at the L5-S1 level having a mass effect on a nerve root, a right foraminal disc protrusion and moderate right foraminal narrowing at the L4-L5 level, and \u201cfacet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.\u201d On December 26, 2007, Dr. Hannallah reviewed the MRI with Caesar and told her that the disc protrusions were mostly on the right side and did not explain the pain that had developed on her left side, that additional surgery was unlikely to relieve her back pain, and that she should consider physical therapy and pain management injections.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">On July 24, 2007, Caesar\u2019s file was assigned to a new case examiner, Andrea Jolivet, who sent \u201cfunctionality letters\u201d to Drs. Brandt and Warupa, asking whether Caesar could work for eight hours with either sedentary or light duty work restrictions. Dr. Warupa responded that he agreed with both sets of restrictions, while Dr. Brandt responded that he agreed with neither. Dr. Brandt indicated that the restrictions should be amended to limit Caesar to no more than one half hour of sitting at a time or per day. Jolivet referred the file to a nurse to determine whether Dr. Brandt\u2019s restrictions and limitations were supported and, if not, whether a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) would be appropriate. The nurse recommended review by an orthopedic specialist, and Jolivet referred the file to an outside reviewer at Managing Claims, Managing Care (MCMC).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The MCMC reviewer, Dr. Joanne Werntz, completed a case report on February 22, 2008, concluding that Caesar would be able to perform sedentary work after she recovered from her carpal tunnel surgeries. When Dr. Werntz called Dr. Brandt, he stated that Caesar\u2019s pain was \u201creal\u201d and prevented her from sitting for more than one half hour every four hours, but Dr. Werntz found that this limitation \u201cwould be highly unusual ... based upon [Caesar\u2019s] type of surgery, the CT scan findings, and her stable clinical exams.\u201d When Dr. Werntz updated her case report on September 22, 2008, she also contacted Dr. Hannallah, but he responded that he did not give specific work restrictions and would rely on FCE results if asked to do so. Dr. Warupa told Dr. Werntz that Caesar should be able to return to work with minimal restrictions with regard to her hands. Noting that Caesar\u2019s chronic back pain had not previously limited her from working, Dr. Werntz concluded that Caesar was capable of working in a full-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>sedentary position with certain additional restrictions, such as use of an ergonomic chair and no standing or walking for more than five to ten minutes at a time. On October 22, 2008, Hartford informed Caesar that she no longer qualified as disabled under the \u201cany occupation\u201d standard and identified two sedentary claims examiner positions for which she would be qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Caesar retained counsel and appealed. She supplemented her medical file with the results of an FCE, which indicated that she was unable to perform even sedentary work, a vocational assessment, and additional medical records. Hartford sent the file to another company for independent reviews by three physicians: an internist, a psychiatrist, and an orthopedic specialist, Dr. William Andrews. Dr. Andrews, while not expressly disagreeing with the findings of the FCE, nonetheless concluded that Caesar was capable of working in a full-time sedentary capacity. Based primarily on this analysis, Hartford upheld its denial of benefits. The district court granted judgment for Hartford on the administrative record, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo and apply the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Cooper v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>486 F.3d 157, 164 (6th Cir.2007). When, as here, the plan administrator is given discretionary authority to determine benefit eligibility, we apply a deferential \u201carbitrary-and-capricious\u201d standard of review. <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder this standard, we will uphold the plan administrator\u2019s decision if it is the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and is rational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Hartford both pays long-term disability benefits and determines eligibility for those benefits, however, we consider this conflict of interest as \u201cone factor\u201d in evaluating its decision to deny benefits. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Based on our review of the administrative record, we conclude that Hartford\u2019s termination of Caesar\u2019s LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. Hartford found that Caesar was able to perform full-time sedentary work, a classification that involves \u201cmostly sitting\u201d and requires an employee to stand, walk, and lift \u201coccasionally\u201d (up to one third of the work day). But, according to the FCE and reports from Caesar\u2019s treating physicians, Caesar cannot sit for an eight-hour work day, even with intervals to stand, walk, or otherwise change position, and can only stand or walk for brief intervals.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">While noting that the FCE showed that Caesar\u2019s current physical capacities were \u201cin the below sedentary strength range,\u201d Dr. Andrews opined that Caesar was \u201ccapable of working in a full time sedentary capacity\u201d with certain additional restrictions, such as no standing or walking for more than fifteen minutes at a time. Dr. Andrews explained his disagreement with the FCE by stating that, in the sedentary capacity he described, \u201cthere are such minimal strength requirements that the claimant would be capable of this activity level.\u201d As noted above, however, a sedentary position involves \u201cmostly sitting\u201d as well as occasional standing, lifting, and walking. The occupational therapist who conducted the FCE concluded that Caesar could sit only \u201coccasionally\u201d and could not tolerate even occasional standing or walking, findings that would render Caesar unable to perform sedentary work. These findings were consistent with the restrictions and limitations provided by Drs. Furey and Brandt.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>An FCE is generally a \u201creliable and objective method of gauging the extent one can complete work-related tasks.\u201d <em>Huffaker v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 271 </em>Fed. Appx. 493, 500 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Brooking v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>167 Fed.Appx. 544, 549 (6th Cir.2006) (describing an FCE as \u201cobjective evidence\u201d of the claimant\u2019s back pain). The occupational therapist concluded that Caesar demonstrated overall good effort during the FCE and that her \u201csubjective reports of pain and associated disability\u201d were \u201cboth reasonable and reliable.\u201d The occupational therapist noted that Caesar showed objective signs of pain, such as an antalgic gait, shifting in her seat, grimacing, and using a wheelchair escort to her car after the three-hour exam due to pain and fatigue. The only explanation that Dr. Andrews offered for his disagreement with the FCE was his factually incorrect statement that its findings were consistent with the requirements of sedentary work, a position that was restated by Hartford in its denial of Caesar\u2019s appeal. The rejection of the FCE without a reasoned explanation supports a finding that the termination of Caesar\u2019s LTD benefits was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Leger v. Tribune Co. Long Term Disability Benefit Plan, </em>557 F.3d 823, 834-35 (7th Cir.2009) (concluding that the insurer acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to explain its disagreement with the results of the FCE); <em>Brooking, </em>167 Fed.Appx. at 549 (concluding that the insurer acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to account for the findings of the FCE).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Caesar also argues that Hartford acted arbitrarily and capriciously by disregarding the opinions of her treating physicians and relying on a file review rather than an independent medical examination. Although plan administrators need not accord special weight to the opinions of a treating physician, they \u201cmay not arbitrarily disregard reliable medical evidence proffered by a claimant, including the opinions of a treating physician.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>486 F.3d at 166-67 (citation omitted). Thus, \u201ca plan may not reject summarily the opinions of a treating physician, but must instead give reasons for adopting an alternative opinion.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>473 F.3d 613, 620 (6th Cir.2006). Dr. Furey, who performed Caesar\u2019s two back surgeries, consistently stated that Caesar was totally disabled and that her limitations were permanent. Dr. Brandt, Caesar\u2019s primary physician, told Dr. Werntz that Caesar could only sit for one half hour every four hours, that she needed to lie down frequently during the day, and that she could not work. Neither Dr. Werntz nor Dr. Andrews adequately explained their disagreement with these opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Dr. Werntz opined that, based on the clinical exams, which showed only right anterior tibialis weakness, and the March 2005 CT scan, which showed no new or recurrent disk herniation or hardware failure, Caesar \u201cwould not be considered totally disabled from any occupation and she could return to work with appropriate restrictions.\u201d But Dr. Furey was looking at these same findings\u2014his clinical exams and the CT scan\u2014when he concluded that Caesar was totally disabled. And although Dr. Werntz stated that the sitting limitation identified by Dr. Brandt would be \u201cunusual,\u201d she acknowledged that there was no evidence, such as surveillance video, to contradict it. Additionally, Dr. Werntz did not discuss whether Caesar\u2019s myriad other health problems might limit her recovery or how the various irregularities shown in the December 2007 MRI would affect her functionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The review conducted by Dr. Andrews was even more cursory. Dr. Andrews did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>not acknowledge the limitations recommended by Drs. Brandt and Furey, which were generally consistent with the findings of the FCE. His failure to discuss why he disagreed with their assessment of Caesar\u2019s functional limitations significantly \u201cdiminishes the strength of [his] conclusions.\u201d <em>Hunter v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>437 Fed.Appx. 372, 379 (6th Cir.2011). This is especially so because Dr. Andrews, like Dr. Werntz, did not examine Caesar, he did not speak with any of Caesar\u2019s treating physicians, and he appears not to have thoroughly reviewed the record, as demonstrated by his failure to note the frequent references to Caesar\u2019s foot drop. <em>See Calvert v. Firstar Fin., Inc., </em>409 F.3d 286, 296-97 (6th Cir.2005). Under these circumstances, the failure of the independent review physicians to adequately explain why they rejected the opinions of Caesar\u2019s treating physicians supports a finding that Hartford\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Cooper, </em>486 F.3d at 169-70; <em>Hunter, </em>437 Fed.Appx. at 379. Additionally, given that both of the independent review physicians at least implicitly discredited Caesar\u2019s subjective complaints of pain, Hartford\u2019s reliance on a file review rather than a physical examination further supports a finding that its decision was arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Smith v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>450 F.3d 253, 263-64 (6th Cir.2006); <em>Calvert, </em>409 F.3d at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Finally, Hartford terminated Caesar\u2019s LTD benefits even though there was no evidence that her condition had improved since the time that it found her disabled under the \u201cany occupation\u201d standard, another factor rendering its decision arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Kramer v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>571 F.3d 499, 507 (6th Cir.2009) (concluding that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily by canceling benefits \u201cthat had been paid for some five years based upon the initial determination of total disability\u201d absent any medical evidence of improvement). In the two years following her back surgeries, Dr. Furey consistently stated that Caesar was totally disabled and that her limitations were permanent, and Hartford awarded Caesar benefits on this basis. There is no evidence that Caesar\u2019s condition improved after that time, and there was no other evidence that would support a change in her eligibility, such as newly acquired skills or new information about her medical condition. <em>See Morris v. Am. Electric Power Long-Term Disability Plan, </em>399 Fed.Appx. 978, 984-85 (6th Cir.2010). Under these circumstances, Hartford\u2019s previous payment of benefits weighs against its decision to terminate those benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Because the evidence in the administrative record shows that Caesar is disabled under the provisions of the policy, we reverse the decision of the district court. We remand the case to the district court to grant Caesar\u2019s petition to reverse the administrative decision and award benefits plus interest from the date on which her benefit payments ceased.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
