J., Bryan, Briscoe, Page, Roberts and Boyd, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-10\"><em>John P. Poe, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-11\">The rulings of the Court below were erroneous. 1st. Because by granting the appellant\u2019s first and third prayers with the modifications put to them by th'e Court, and by rejecting his prayers as offered, the right of the appellant to recover was restricted to the diminution in the <em>market </em>value of the property generally, whereas he should have been permitted to claim damages for the diminution in the <em>rental </em>or <em>usable </em>value, as well as for the diminution in the <em>market </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>value. <em>Mackenzie </em>v. <em>The Chesapeake Telephone Co., </em>74 Md. In <em>Webster's case </em>the measure of damages insisted on by the railway company was the diminished <em>rental </em>value of the premises. The same rule should be applied here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">2d. Because the Court denied to the appellant the right to recover for the diminution in the value of <em>his property as and for a livery stable, </em>whereas, inasmuch as the property was originally built for such purpose, and in its existing condition w\u00e1s available for that purpose only, the appellant should have been permitted to go before the jury and claim such damages as the evidence showed he had sustained in the diminished value of his property for that purpose, occasioned by the construction and use of the railway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">The appellee contended that if the livery stable were torn down and replaced by a new and different structure, and the lot were utilized, or attempted to be utilized, for some other purpose than a livery stable, the property would be found not to have been injuriously affected at all in value by the construction of the railway. Surely this contention cannot be sound. The appellant was entitled to use his property for the purposes to which it was adapted and for which it had been used many years. The business carried on -was legitimate ; -was in no sense a nuisance, and but for the construction of the railway could have been continued to have been carried on as profitably as ever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">It would certainly be giving a narrow and unwarranted interpretation To the ordinance to adopt the contention of the appellee, and it is respectfully submitted, therefore, that all the prayers of the appellant as\u2019 originally offered should have been granted, without the modifications put by the Court to the first and third <em>\u25a0; </em>and that the Court also erred in granting the appellee\u2019s first and fourth prayers. It was error also to grant the appellee\u2019s second prayer. As an abstract proposition in a proper case it announces, perhaps, a correct principle, but in this case, it was calculated to mislead the jury, and for that reason it should have been rejected.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Francis K. Carey </em>and <em>William H. Buckler </em>(with whom were <em>Steele &amp; Semines </em>on the brief), for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-5\">The first exception taken by the plaintiff is based upon the Court\u2019s refusal to admit Webster\u2019s oral testimony in regard to the alleged reduction of the rent. It is unnecessary to call the Court\u2019s attention to the impropriety of such testimony on general principles under such circumstances. The landlord-and tenant, acting in entire harmony, docketing simultaneous suits by the same counsel, could, if they were so disposed, make up a claim based upon such testimony and the defendant would be wholly unable to disprove it. But there is no better established principle of law than that which requires a plaintiff to enforce his plain legal rights for his own protection and to use reasonable and proper precaution to prevent or diminish any injury for which he claims damages from another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first and third prayers as modified by the Court, correctly stated the law. In the case of <em>P. &amp; R. R. Co. </em>v. Getz, 113 Pa. 219, the Court held: \u201cWhether the assessment of damages be to the tenant in fee, for life, or for -years, the rule as to the measure of damages is preciselj' the same. What was the value of the property, that is to say, the tenant\u2019s interest therein, unaffected by the injury? What was its value as affected by the injury? The difference is the true measure' of compensation. The damage must be measured according to the market value for any useful purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">Thfe only changes made by the Court in the defendant\u2019s first and third prayers \\tfere to strike out the words \u201cas a livery stable\u201d in the third prayer and to substitute for the words \u201crental or usable value\u201d the words \u201cmarket value\u201d in both prayers. In the plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer he had used the language \u201cdecreased rental value <em>or market value',\u2019 </em>while the defendant\u2019s prayers had used the words \u201cmarket value.\u201d As it must be conceded that the words \u201cmarket value \u201d are comprehensive enough to include rental or usable value, it could only create confusion in the minds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the jury to permit the use of the included language in addition to the general terms. The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer as granted allowed the jury to find for the plaintiff, in damages, \u201cif the jury shall find from the evidence that the said property has been injuriously affected by the construction and use of the said railway.\u201d The vice of the plaintiff\u2019s second, fourth and fifth prayers is that they all attempt to confine the injury to the property as now improved as a livery stable, without regard to the question as to whether it may not be of greater value to the plaintiff for other purposes than it was before the structure was erected'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">As an illustration of the impropriety of such instructions the Court will observe that the application of a measure of damages to the property which limits the injury to the property for the use to which it happens to be put at the time of the alleged injury, might work the greatest hardship to the plaintiff. Thus, in the <em>Hibernian </em>case, which is now before this Court, and which was tried just before the <em>Burch case, </em>the lot is improved by an old brick building used for a school-house, and, as there was no necessity for approaching it by vehicles, it was conceded that, even from the plaintiff\u2019s standpoint, the injury to the property for the purposes to which it -was then adapted and for which it was being used, was insignificant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">The words \u201c market value\u201d are so comprehensive in then-character as to give to both parties the full benefit of any proof which can be adduced which tends to show whether or not the plaintiff is in any worse condition than he was before the structure complained of was built.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-7\">Roberts, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ary\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">This case, in almost every material respect, is identical with the decision of this Court in <em>Webster\u2019s case, </em>reported in 81 Md. 529. There was a judgment in favor of the plaintiff below (appellant here) for nominal damages, and from that judgment this appeal is taken. There are two exceptions contained in the record, the first of which relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the admissibility of the proof offered by the plaintiff, the other, to the rejection by the Court of the plaintiff\u2019s five prayers, and to the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s first and third prayers, with certain modifications made by the Court, and to the granting of the defendant\u2019s (now appellee\u2019s) first, second and fourth prayers. The essential facts are, that the plaintiff is now and has been for a number of years past, the owner \u00f3f a leasehold estate, for the term of ninety-nine years renewable forever, in a lot of ground and premises in the city of Baltimore, which is subject to an annual ground-rent of three hundred dollars. The lot is improved by a building, which has been used as a livery stable for a number of years, and is not in its existing condition adapted to any other purpose. The plaintiff has been accustomed to derive a large yearly rental from said premises as a livery stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The defendant has constructed, maintains and operates an elevated and surface railroad, which passes in front of the plaintiff\u2019s lot. The elevated position of the railroad is not directly in front of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, but begins about twelve feet distant from the northern boundary of the lot. The railroad has been in operation since the month of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-three. The plaintiff offered to prove by Webster who was the appellee in 81 Md. 529, that shortly after the cars began to run over the defendant\u2019s road, he and Webster, who was his then tenant, had modified the terms of the lease between them by reducing the rent from <em>$1,200 </em>a year, to $900 a year; that this reduction was made in order to retain Webster as his tenant, and in view of what they both believed would be the injurious effect of the construction and use of defendant\u2019s road upon the rental value of the property as a livery stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">This offer constitutes the plaintiff's first exception. We think the Court below was clearly in error in refusing to permit \u25a0 the testimony to be given. \u25a0 It was after all and at most nothing but an expression of the opinion of Webster, and of the plaintiff, as to the effect upon the plaintiff\u2019s lease, produced by the construction of the defendant\u2019s road. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>do not perceive where in any respect it violated any rule of evidence, and the fact that it may have been somewhat insignificant in its effect, its weight was for the jury, and not for the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Coming then to the consideration of the various prayers which constitute the second exception, we think there are but two propositions in the determination of this appeal now necessary to be decided. Separate consideration of the prayers contained in this exception will not therefore be requisite. The first proposition, which we think untenable, is the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s first prayer as modified by the Court. Without this modification made, the prayers correctly stated the law of the case, and should have been granted. Mr. Chief Judge McSherry, in delivering the opinion of this Court, in <em>Mackenzie's </em>case, 74 Md. 50, says : \u201c The true measure of damages in such a case as this, is not what a particular individual would be willing to charge for having the pole put up or remain ; nor the amount some other person might consider the rental value was depreciated for the purposes of his business ; but where the <em>land </em>of the plaintiff <em>is not taken nor his soil actually invaded, </em>the measure of damages, as adjudged in many cases, is either first, the extent to which the <em>rental </em>or <em>usable </em>value of the particular property has been diminished by the trespass or injury complained of; <em>Balto. and Ohio Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Boyd et al., </em>67 Md. 41 ; <em>Wood, &amp;c.,v. State, use of White, </em>66 Md. 61 ; or, secondly, the difference in the value of the property before the construction of the pole, and its value afterwards, if the depreciation in value has been caused by the erection and maintenance of the pole. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., </em>130 U. S. 426.\u201d And in <em>Webster\u2019s case, supra, </em>Judge Bryan said, \u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s prayer claims damages for the diminution of the rental value of his leasehold property. His testimony was that before the building of the road the annual value of the property was twelve hundred dollars, and the construction and use of the road reduced this value so much, that it was worth nothing. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>landlord remitted three hundred dollars of the rent, leaving him bound still to pay nine hundred dollars a year. If the jury found that the <em>usable </em>value of the property was destroyed or diminished by the cause alleged, they were justified in finding a verdict for damages done. Great exception is taken to the language of the prayer. But it seems to us that its fair meaning is that the jury are to find the damages which the plaintiff sustained as tenant of the premises by the diminution of. its rental value. It could not easily be construed as meaning that they were to find the damages which the landlord had suffered.\u201d The rule of law applicable in <em>Webster's case, </em>who was the then tenant of the plaintiff here, finds equal force and pertinent application in this case, where the original lessee is suing to recover damages for the injury done to his possession. The second proposition as contained in the plaintiff\u2019s prayers to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the diminution in value of his property \u00bfw <em>and for a livery stable </em>is undoubtedly correct. The property was originally built for such purpose and in its existing condition was available for that purpose only. He was therefore entitled to claim such damages as the evidence showed he had sustained in the diminished value of his property for that purpose, occasioned by the construction and use of the road. For the reasons assigned, the judgment below must be reversed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b392-6\">(Decided June 16th, 1896).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed with costs, and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
