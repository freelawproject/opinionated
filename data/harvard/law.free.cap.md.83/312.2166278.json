Bank </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>24 Md. 447 ; <em>Dietrich </em>v. <em>Balto. and Hall Springs Ry., </em>58 Md. 347 ; <em>Story Agency, </em>secs. 443 <em>et seq., </em>sec. 451. If, on .the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>A, B, C, </em>individuals, instead of employing <em>C, D, </em>F, separate agents, to make various ratings for them, agree to form an ordinary association, <em>X, </em>and employ a common agent, <em>Y, </em>to make the ratings, is the liability of <em>A, B, C </em>in any way altered for the ratings made by <em>G </em>and adopted and used by them, or any of them ? The mere fact that the brick addition upon which the insurance was placed had not itself been surveyed by the chief inspector in no wise absolves the appellee from liability imposed by the rating. Whilst schedules of rates must be based on an actual survey, <em>i. e., </em>of some building, there is nothing, says Taylor, the appellee\u2019s witness, to prevent a member of the association from applying a rate furnished by the association for a building to an adjoining building or addition. Undoubtedly it was the application of this rule that the appellee\u2019s president availed himself of in this case. Koppelman, who offered the risk to Williams, had insurance on Fischer\u2019s property. He knew Fischer used gasoline; he was satisfied with the rate of $1.90 as a satisfactory compensation. He did not decline to write Fischer\u2019s insurance because the brick addition had <em>not been </em>surveyed, nor because the rate was too low. They were both members of the same protective association, the Board of Underwriters. Both held high official position in their respective companies. Under these circumstances, is it a reasonable assumption that Koppelman meant to betray Williams into writing this insurance by misrepresenting the fact that the building had been surveyed by the chief inspector ? Is it not more reasonable to assume that in mentioning the rate, <em>$1.90, </em>Koppelman meant to be understood that under the rules of the association the <em>permissible </em>rate was $1.90? What could be urged as the motive for the deception ? Koppelman had exactly similar insurance in his company, and the petty brokerage commission that he secured is too trifling to be considered. Suppose, however, in the face of the unchallenged testimony of Taylor, that the rules of the association forbade the application of the rate of one building to an additional unsurveyed building, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Williams, the president of the appellee, acted on the supposition that the building insured had been rated by the association at $1.90, when, as a matter of fact, it had not, can it be ui'ged, in the name of justice, equity or fair dealing that he assumed this supposition under circumstances that would shift a loss from his shoulders to those of the insured ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-4\">It is conceded that the appellee had no actual knowledge that the rate $1.90 included the specific charge of $1.00 per hundred, for the use of gasoline. If then they are not charged with notice of knowledge of this fact <em>by law, </em>the appellant\u2019s contention must fail, for the question of knowledge is a requisite element in the doctrine of \u201c equitable estoppel.\u201d How can the appellee escape this imputation? The chief inspector is the agent of the appellee in making the rate, the very moment that the appellee adopts this rate, and the appellee is effected with knowledge of the agent\u2019s acts done in and about such rating. That the president of the appellee adopted this rate because it was the rate of the Board of <em>Underwxiters\u2014i. e., </em>made by the chief inspector, and he appx-oved of it as such, we have the unequivocal testimony of Williams and Koppelman, too. He did not adopt the rate as a random figui'e, suggested by Koppel-man, which stnxck him as fair. \u201c The px'emium he chai'ged,\u201d says Koppelman, \u201c was whatever the board rate was of the Fire Underwxiters. I mean the rate promulgated by the board. Thei-e was a slip showing what the x'ate was.\u201d \u201c I took it for gx'anted,\u201d says Williams, president of the defendant company, \u201c that this rate furnished by Mr. Koppel-man was the x-ate of the Board of Undex'wxitei's.\u201d If the appellee had x-ejected the rate, $1.90, as it had a light under the x'ules of the association to do, and had chai'ged a higher i-ate of their own, the question of agency <em>uel non </em>might be presented in a different aspect, and this considex-atiorx alone sex'ves, it is respectfully submitted, to establish the appellant\u2019s contention beyond the necessity of fux-ther discussioxi. The chief ixispector having been employed by the appellee for the specific purpose of making rates, the imputation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>knowledge to the principal, the appellee, of how these rates were made and the specific charges which they included, cannot fairly be contested. <em>Story on Agency, </em>sec. 140 (9th edit.); <em>W.

This policy was issued April nth, 1893, and declared that it was \u201cmade and accepted \u201d subject to certain conditions, among which were the following: 1st. That it should be void if the insured has concealed or misrepresented, in writing or otherwise, any material fact or circumstance concerning said insurance, or the subject thereof; and 2d. If (any usage or custom of trade manufacture to the contrary notwithstanding) there be <em>kept, used </em>or <em>allowed </em>on the insured premises benzine, benzole, dynamite, ether, <em>gasoline </em>or petroleum of greater inflammability than kerosene of the United States standard (which <em>last </em>may be kept for light) and kept for sale according to law, but in quantities not exceeding five barrels, provided it be drawn and lamps filled by daylight, or at a distance of not less than ten feet from artificial lights. These conditions were pleaded by the defendant company in answer to the declaration, and the case was tried in the Court below upon two issues: <em>(a) </em>Whether there had been any concealment by the insured of any material fact con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>cerning the insurance, or the subject thereof; and (b) whether the defendant company had consented to the use of gasoline and waived the condition of the policy relating thereto. It appears from the evidence that Fisher, the insured, held a policy for $2,500.00 on the building Nos. 2805 and 2807 Hudson street, issued by the German Fire Insurance Company, of which one Koppelman, a licensed insurance broker, was vice-president. This policy contained a written clause allowing the use of gasoline for illuminating purposes, and was issued in the month of November, 1889, upon a rating of one dollar and ninety cents per hundred, made by the chief inspector of the Association of Fire Underwriters of Baltimore City, of which association both the German Fire Insurance Company and the defendant company were members. This rating was made upon a slip of which contained a list of the \u201c deficiencies,\u201d the rate charged for each, and showed that one dollar of the one dollar and ninpty cents per hundred fixed as the rate for calculating the premium on this (Hudson street) building, was estimated for the use of gasoline for illuminating purposes. The total rating, but not the items, was furnished to the several members of the association, and the itemized \u201c slips \u201d were open to the inspection of the members, who might desire to see them. The building on Streeper street, and which was attached in the rear of, and communicated with the Hudson street building, was never surveyed or rated by the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Fisher, the insured, applied to Koppelman for insurance on the Streeper street building in the German Fire Insurance Company, which was declined ; whereupon he accepted Koppelman\u2019s offer to place it for him in another company. Koppelman sent his clerk to inspect the building and then wrote up the application for insurance on behalf of Fisher and took it to Williams, the president of the defendant company, who inquired what the rate was, and being told that it was $1.90 per hundred, issued the policy sued on, and delivered it to Koppelman, by whom it was delivered to Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>At the trial of the case below, four exceptions were taken by the plaintiff. The first and third exceptions relate to the refusal of the Court to allow the plaintiff to offer evidence tending to prove that the fire which destroyed the building \u201c was not started or caused by the use of gasoline.\u201d This testimony was clearly inadmissible, because it was not relevant to any issue made by the pleadings, or which could have been properly framed in a suit on the policy which is the subject-matter of this controversy. The condition of the policy was that it should be void if, among other things, <em>gasoline </em>was <em>kept, used </em>or <em>allowed </em>on the insured premises, and the question was whether there had been any violation of this condition on the part of the insured. The <em>cause </em>of the fire was not, in any way, involved, and as such testimony was calculated to mislead the jury it was properly rejected. <em>Howell's Exr. </em>v. <em>Balto. Eq. Society, </em>16 Md. 386, 387 ; 1 <em>May on hisiirance, </em>sec. 220 ; <em>Parson\u2019s Merc. Law, </em>505 ; <em>Kyte </em>v. <em>Com. Union Asso. Co., </em>149 Mass. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The second exception was to the overruling of the plaintiff\u2019s objection to evidence, offered by the defendant, tending to prove that the rate of one dollar and ninety cents, per hundred, was not an unusual rate\u2014not such a rate as, at the time the policy sued on was issued, would indicate to the insurer the fact that gasoline or any other material, equally hazardous, was to be kept, used, or allowed on the insured premises. The record shows that it was conceded in the Court below, as it was in the argument in this Court, that the defendant company did not have actual knowledge that gasoline was to be used on the insured premises ; but, it was claimed, that it should be held responsible on the ground that, being a member of the Association of Fire Underwriters which had rated Fisher\u2019s Hudson street building at one dollar and ninety cents per hundred, which rate included a chargeTor gasoline, and having issued the policy sued on at that rate, there was an adoption by the defendant company of the rating of the Hudson street building, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that it was, therefore, affected with constructive knowledge that gasoline was to be used, and was being paid for, and should be held to have waived its light to interpose the clause of the policy prohibiting the use of gasoline as a bar to this. suit. As will be seen hereafter, this testimony was not a necessary part of the defendant\u2019s case, but, if it saw proper to assume the burden of establishing a negative, there could be no valid objection to it, since it tended to prove that there was not, in the rate charged, anything that would put the insurer upon its inquiry, and charge it with that full knowledge of all the facts which was necessary to constitute a waiver of the clause of the policy relating to gasoline. <em>Reynolds v. Mut. Ins. Co., &amp;c., </em>34 Md. 280 ; <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>40 Md. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to strike out all the evidence of the chief inspector of the Association of Fire Underwriters, and the rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s second and third prayers, which constitute the fourth exception, raise substantially the same question, and they will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The contention of the appellant is that the implied knowledge which resulted to the appellee from the rate of one dollar and ninety cents per hundred, established by the Association of Fire Underwriters upon the Hudson street building, in which gasoline was allowed to be used, gratified the provision of the policy requiring an express written permit to be endorsed on it, and the appellee, therefore, was equitably estopped from pleading this condition in its defence. The doctrine of equitable estoppels is this: \u201c Where one party has by his representations, or his conduct, induced the other party to give him an advantage, which it would be against equity and good conscience for him to assert, he would not, in a Court of Justice, be permitted to avail himself of that advantage.\u201d It can only be relied on by a party who has been misled to his injury. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Walter et al., </em>8 Gill, 241 ; <em>Ins. Co. v. Gusdorf, </em>43 Md. 514; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Chesapeake Bank, </em>51 Md. 562 ; <em>Hurt </em>v. <em>Ripple, </em>11 Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Rep. 970; <em>Leather Manufacturers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Morgan et al., </em>117 U. S. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Applying this principle to the case before us, after a most careful examination of the record, we have been unable to discover anything in the declarations- or conduct of the president of the defendant company which tended, in any respect, to mislead a reasonably prudent man to his injury. To sustain the contention of the appellant in this case, would be to relieve the. insured from the discharge of his duty to the insurer and to himself. These obligations were: (1) to state to the insurer every fact relating to this insurance and the subject thereof; and (2) to read his policy, neither of which appears to have been performed. On the contrary, if it be true, as claimed by Fisher, that Koppelman knew that gasoline was to be used in the insured building, then, the proof is that intentionally, or otherwise, this information was not communicated to Williams, the president of the defendant company, who issued the policy. And, whether this omission was intentional or not, the insured is bound by it, because Koppelman was <em>his </em>agent and not the agent of the insurer. He wrote the application for the insurance and tpok it to Williams for Fisher, at his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Kven if it be conceded (for the sake of the argument) that the rate by which the premium was calculated did constitute an \u201c awakening circumstance,\u201d yet that mere fact was not sufficient to relieve the insured (or his agent) from his obligation to declare to the insurer that his purpose was to use gasoline. <em>Allegre </em>v. <em>Md. Fire Insurance </em>Company, 8 Gill &amp; Johnson, 190; 2 G. &amp; J. 162; <em>Augusta Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>12 Md. 374. As a depositor in a bank is under the duty of examining his pass-book and the vouchers returned with it, in order to ascertain if his account is correctly kept, so the insured was under the duty of reading his policy, so as to know whether its provisions were in accordance with his application, and the amount o.f premium charged. If Fisher had performed this plain duty, which ordinary diligence'in his affairs required, he would have discovered that by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>terms of his policy he was forbidden to \u201c <em>use or allow \" </em>gasoline on the insured premises, and this suit might have been .avoided. <em>Leather Manufacturers' Bank v. Morgan, </em>117 U. S. 106. The testimony of the chief inspector of the Association of Fire Underwriters related entirely to the rating of the Hudson street building, the items which made up the rate, and the custom of the association in furnishing the ratings to its members, and was offered for the manifest purpose of proving constructive knowledge by the president of the defendant company, as to the purpose of the insured to use gasoline, and of excusing Fisher from disclosing to' the defendant company every fact and circumstance which could possibly influence the mind of an intelligent insurer. It was legally insufficient for that purpose, because, by the express terms of the contract its validity depended on a full disclosure, <em>by the insured, </em>of every material circumstance relating \u00b10 the insurance, or the subject thereof, and the endorsement thereon of the permission to use gasoline. It was conceded that no such disclosure was made, and the mere fact that this policy was issued at the rate fixed by an association, of which the defendant was a member, <em>on an adjoining </em>building, was not sufficient to enable the assured to escape the consequences of the neglect of the plain obligation imposed on him by the contract, which he accepted, and knowledge of which is presumed from such acceptance. <em>Allegre </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>8 G. &amp; J. 190; <em>Ins. &amp; Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>12 Md. 374; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>34 Md. 280; <em>Busby </em>v. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>40 Md. 585-6 ; <em>Beck et al. </em>v. <em>Hibernia Ins. Co., </em>44 Md. 106. Besides, the record shows that notwithstanding the granting of the defendants motion to strike out the testimony of the chief inspector of the Board of Fire Underwriters, it was treated by the Court, in its rulings on the defendant\u2019s prayers, as still before the jury, and, therefore, no injury resulted to the plaintiff therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">It appears from the record'that no exception was taken to the granting of defendant\u2019s prayers, but inasmuch as they were discussed, as if excepted to, we think it proper to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that, for the reasons stated, the ruling of the Court below thereon was correct, and that the defence of the company is a bar to any suit on this policy. The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b345-6\">(Decided May 8th, 1896).</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
