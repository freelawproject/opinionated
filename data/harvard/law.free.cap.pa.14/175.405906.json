As a general demurrer, it must, therefore, be overruled, and the defendant have leave to answer over: 5 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser. </em>262; 2 <em>Barr </em>77; 5 <em>id. </em>18; 6 <em>id. </em>187. Indeed,_ as a short plea, it is so entirely uncertain whether it means to raise a question of fact or law, that it should not at all be allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-17\">Dec. 14, 1848, defendants demur to the lien filed, that it is not a lien, or bill of particulars, as required by the act of Assembly.

The plaintiffs offer to prove that they did the carpenter work, for which the lien is filed, under an agreement with defendants, that they should be paid by measurement, at 30 per cent, off the book, of prices. The defendants object to any evidence under the lien filed, unless evidence is given to show that the defendants agreed to pay $248.02 for work done. The lien being irregular, and no such specifications attached as required by the act of Assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">Per curiam. \u2014 The case was before the court on demurrer, and Judge Lowrie decided that the lien was sufficient, and I do not well see how a party who does work under a contract such as is offered to be proved, can be more specific than in this lien filed. Objection overruled, and evidence admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">The court charged that the lien filed was valid and sufficient in law to entitle plaintiffs to recover, if the jury found any balance due them.

On the trial, the plaintiffs proved that they did the work under an agreement with the defendants, that they should be paid by measurement, at the Pittsburg book of prices, thirty per cent. off. The evidence was objected to under the lien filed, unless evidence was first given to show that the defendants agreed to pay $248.02 for the work done. The evidence was properly admitted. When work is to be done by measurement, it would puzzle even a Pittsburgh lawyer to ascertain the price of the work before it was measured. The plaintiff\u2019s statement being for work and labor, the bill and statement constituted a valid and sufficient lien, and the evidence of Dunn was rightly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
