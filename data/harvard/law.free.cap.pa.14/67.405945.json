W. Stephens had been presented to the District Court sitting in chancery, against Forsyth, sheriff of Allegheny county, and William Nelson and others, heirs of Cornelia Stephens, daughter of Cornelia Stephens, which latter had been the wife of A. C. Stephens, and daughter of E. Gr. Nelson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">The plaintiff complained, in this case, that in 1830, E. Gr. Nelson died, leaving two children, William and Cornelia; William died in 1842, intestate and without issue; Cornelia married Allen Stephens. On 18th January, 1843, her husband and she mortgaged a lot of ground in Allegheny city, to plaintiff, and died 16th November, 1847, leaving a child which died an infant, leaving the defendants (except Forsyth) her heirs at law. Cornelia was born 8th June, 1822, and of course was under age when the mortgage was executed. <em>Sci. fa. </em>issued against Allen Stephens and the administrator of Cornelia on the mortgage No. 182, January, 1848, and judgment entered, and on <em>lev. fac. </em>the land was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale to complainant, for $2000; that the sheriff made a deed to him, which was acknowledged 28th May, 1848; the sheriff\u2019s deed \u25a0was not delivered, but the proceeds of sale were all coming to complainant; the costs were not paid, but that immediate application was twice made to sheriff for the delivery of the deed, and to pay the costs; the bill of the costs was not shown, because the costs, sheriff said, had not been taxed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">That the Nelsons, the defendants, on 28th September, 1848; obtained a rule to show cause why the sheriff\u2019s sale should not be set aside, and thereon the court ordered the sheriff to retain the deed till disposal of the rule, and on 16th October following,\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Ordered the sheriff\u2019s deed to be cancelled, the acknowledgment rescinded, the sale to be set aside, and the judgment to be opened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">That this was without any issue granted, and after the term had gone by from the time of the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed, and without allegation of fraud, and without any request on part of respondents to set the deed aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">The defendants demurred to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">Before the demurrer the bill was amended by consent, so as to assert that complainant was appointed'on 28th September, 1840, by the Orphan\u2019s Court of Allegheny county, guardian of Cornelia, and knew, of course, that she was not of age when she executed the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">The prayer was, that Forsyth may be decreed to deliver said deed, or another made and lawfully acknowledged, to complainant; and that the District Court may be ordered to cause any such deed to be properly acknowledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-10\">The court, Lowrie, J., dismissed the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-11\">The question was, whether the District Court can cancel a sheriff\u2019s deed after acknowledgment, and after the term has passed, when there is no allegation of fraud.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-12\">The case was argued by <em>Dunlop, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYy\">\u2014 He contended, that the District Court had no power, after acknowledgment, to set the deed and sale aside. It was too late, unless the sale and deed were assailed on the ground of fraud in themselves: 1 <em>Yeates </em>40; 2 <em>Pa. Rep. </em>231. After the term had passed, the court had no power to set aside the deed, or reverse their own decision : 12 <em>Peters </em>488, 492 ; 1 <em>Bin. </em>104.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-13\"><em>T. Williams </em>and <em>Kuhn, </em>for defendant in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABq\">In Pennsylvania, equity is law; the facts are for the jury; but whether, on any state of facts found by the jury, the party is entitled to equity, and the mode, manner, and extent of the relief, are for the court. No facts were in dispute; no issue was asked for : 16 <em>Serg. Rawle </em>278-9 ; <em>Story's Equity, </em>vol. ii., sects. 694-5, pp. 700, 702.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-14\">The objection, that the term had passed, is not fatal: 7 <em>Wend. </em>88 ; 20 <em>Johns. </em>50.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b68-15\">September 13, 1850.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AK3\">\u2014 Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AQE\">\u2014 A decree in equity produces its effect by controlling the course of the person, not by controlling a court of law, or any part of its machinery. A party may proceed at law, in the face of an injunction, and the court of law will adjudicate, if he will brave the consequences of the contempt. A court of chancery affects no superiority over any court of law whatever, or its officers; and pretends not to review their proceedings : so that the court, from which process has issued, is the only one to which the sheriff is answerable for the execution of it.</p>\n<p id=\"A3l\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
