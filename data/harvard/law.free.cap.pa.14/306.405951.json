Whether it was there an obstruction is a disputed question, and for the jury. The defendant came down with his raft, and in trying to avoid the plaintiffs\u2019 raft thus in Jhe schute, was thrown to the left-hand bank, below the dam, and was stuck on the shore. In this situation, another raft came down, struck the hind end of defendant\u2019s' raft and the upper end swung round and lodged against the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>raft. In this position, the defendant alleges that, if there was any cutting done, it was necessary and justifiable, in order to enable them to get their rafts loose and pass along the stream. The question is whether, if the plaintiffs\u2019 raft is so lodged upon his dam as to prevent rafts from passing over with safety, a person running along and thus obstructed, would have a right to remove so much of the obstruction as would enable him to pursue his voyage. And we think he would. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">We therefore think that if the jury believe the plaintiffs\u2019 raft was the cause of that of the defendant running on the shore and of the other raft jamming in between them, and that on account thereof it became necessary to remove a portion of the raft of the plaintiffs to enable him to get loose and pass, or if the jury believe it was necessary in order to clear the stream, the defendant might cut off some of the plaintiff\u2019s logs, in order to bring the raft around which lay below the plaintiff\u2019s, provided that no more was done than was necessary for that purpose, the defendant would be justifiable in so doing. If, on the other hand, it was not necessary to cut plaintiffs\u2019 raft for that purpose, but the act was wanton and uncalled for, or more injury was done than the circumstances required, then the defendant would be a trespasser, provided he was the person who did the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-7\">The jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-8\">Error was assigned to the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-9\">Arthurs, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACS\">contended that where a raft is stranded accidentally, the owner should have a reasonable time to remove it; which he contended plaintiffs had not: <em>Whar.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeI3\">\u2014 The law of the case was accurately laid down. It is certainly true that a nuisance can be lawfully abated only after as much time has been allowed to remove the cause of it as circumstances would permit, and by doing no unnecessary damage to it; but it is just as true, that a loss which must fall on one of two innocent persons, must be borne by him whose accident was the cause of it. The plaintiff\u2019s raft, in attempting to pass it over a mill-dam, was unskilfully or unfortunately managed; by reason of which, the defendant\u2019s raft, in following it, was jostled and thrown on rocks below, where it stuck fast. In a few minutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>another raft was lodged between the two, and lay foul of both. What was to be done ? Not only was the water abating, but the stream was crowded with rafts, momentarily descending; and an hour\u2019s delay might not only have deprived the defendant of the benefit of the flood, but have exposed his property to collision with rafts from above. In this emergency, he had a right to extricate it in the only way he could; and that he was compelled to cut loose was not his fault, but the plaintiff\u2019s misfortune. There was, therefore, no room for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
