Wallace and Stewart, made- 4th August, 1845, by which E. and James Wallace agreed to furnish a good six-horse team complete, and a driver for the same, for the term of one year, which was to be in the employ and under the direction of said Stewart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-10\">For and in consideration of which, said Stewart agrees to pay E. and James at the rate of two dollars and thirty-five cents for every day said team performs the duty required; also, to find the kind and quantity of feed said Stewart allows his own teams, shoe the horses, board the driver, and' keep the wagon in repair. The payments as follows, viz., one-fourth the pay, at least, in orders to Pittsburgh for bar iron, groceries, &amp;c.; any goods taken from the store of said Stewart to be at a reduction of 20 per cent, below his customary selling prices, the balance to be paid in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-11\">It is understood by the parties, that should the teams l'ie idle at any time, on account of inability to perform the duty required, or on account of wet days, said E. and James here agree to lose the time and allow said Stewart for the feed; should the team be obliged to lay idle on account of the wagon getting out of order, or for want of hauling, it is understood that Stewart is to be at the loss of the time, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-12\">It was testified, that the agreement with <em>Walker </em>was to be of the same character as that with the <em>Wallaces: </em>also, that Walker commenced hauling, and-was discharged about the first of January.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-13\">On the part of defendant it was testified, that Walker, after his discharge, left the neighborhood, and that he hauled for McKennans, at Lockport furnace, and for Ritter &amp; Irwin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>On part of plaintiff it was alleged, that Walker was not paid <em>by </em>the last-named persons for the hauling done for them; and on his part was offered evidence of judgments obtained <em>by </em>Walker against those persons, for hauling done by him. To the admission of this evidence, defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">Knox, President, charged as follows: \u2014 The defendant prayed for the following instruction, viz., that if the jury believed the plaintiff received his pay for the time he labored for defendant, left the neighborhood, and entered into the employ of other pcrpersons, the contract was thereby rescinded, and there could be no recovery: this instruction was refused, and the jury were told, that if Stewart, the defendant, had agreed to give the plaintiff work for a year, and discharged him without good cause before the expiration of the year, from that moment the contract was broken, and the defendant was liable for the damages which the plaintiff would sustain by reason of such violation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">If the plaintiff was out of employ for the entire year, holding himself ready at all times to labor for the defendant, he would be entitled to receive pay for the entire year; but he was not bound to remain idle at the risk of losing all claim upon the <em>defendant; </em>he might- seek employment and obtain it, (although not bound to do so,) and the defendant could -not complain, as it would reduce the damages, and thereby enure to his benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">In ascertaining the amount of damages, the jury were instructed, that they should consider how long the plaintiff was out of employ, and what his necessary expenses were in obtaining work, and compensate him accordingly, but not to include the money lost from McKennans, or Ritter <em>k </em>Irwin, for the reason, that the plaintiff, when he entered into their service, took upon himself the risk of recovering his pay; by doing so he precluded the defendant from offering him employment himself, or having it offered by others ; and it would be inequitable for the plaintiff to deprive the defendant of the right, and still hold him responsible for the solvency of the persons with whom he had voluntarily engaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">A verdict was rendered for plaintiff, for $863.66.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">On the part of defendant below, it was assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">1st. The court erred in admitting in evidence the record of a judgment in Cambria county, John S. Walker <em>v. </em>Ritter &amp; Irwin, mentioned in defendant\u2019s first bill of exceptions, as the same was entirely irrelevant and calculated to influence the minds of the jury against the interests of the defendant below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">2d. The court erred in their answer to the defendant\u2019s point asking for instructions to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\">8d.
