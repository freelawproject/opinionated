Plaintiff issued a <em>scire facias </em>against Seidenstriker, who was bail for Hutchison before the alderman. Defendant plead <em>nul tiel </em>record.

In the recognizance in this case, Seidenstriker is bound to pay all costs, &amp;c., no matter which party may be successful. The act of 1845 requires the condition to be for the payment of all costs accrued, or that may be legally recovered, and not, as in this one, that have or may accrue in prosecuting the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-10\"><em>Weaver, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhB\">referred to 9 <em>Watts &amp; Ser. </em>142; 5 <em>Watts </em>333; 2 <em>Ashmead </em>122; 5 <em>Watts &amp; Ser. </em>333; 13 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>243; 10 <em>id. </em>325.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b159-11\">Oct. 28.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aky\">\u2014 Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AID\">\u2014 This recognizance is within the rule of the conservative decisions.
