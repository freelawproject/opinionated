The property had been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale. The plaintiff Vie claimed as assignee of the sheriff\u2019s vendee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">On the trial, there was offered, on the part of plaintiff, the sheriff\u2019s deed and the assignment of it to him. It was objected, by defendant\u2019s counsel, that the deed of the sheriff was not acknowledged in open court; secondly, that the sale took place at the court-house, and not at or near the premises, which is admitted. The objections were overruled and defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">Verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">Error was assigned to the admission of the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-11\">Argued by <em>Bliher, </em>for plaintiff in error. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATv\">Cited <em>5 Humphrey\u2019s Rep. </em>577 ; Gift <em>v. </em>Anderson, <em>Kinne\u2019s Law Com. for </em>1847, p. 243, that personal property sold by the sheriff Or other officer, without such property being present at the time and place of sale, the sale is void, unless the execution debtor waive the necessity of its presence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-12\"><em>Mellon, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b99-13\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ail\">\u2014 There is no more reason that leasehold should be sold on the premises than that freehold should. It would frequently be difficult, and always unprofitable, to collect a crowd in a mine, or at a ferry, or on the shore of a <em>fishery; </em>for no man bids for either freehold or leasehold, without having investigated the qualities and value of the property. Better to have the sale where those who bid on the spur of the occasion usually congregate. As to the omission of the sheriff to acknowledge the deed in open court, it is sufficient to say there was no necessity for a deed at all. His return is evidence of the sale of a chattel, whether real or personal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
