The declaration alleged the suit to be on a certain promissory note or due bill, in writing. On the trial, the note in evidence was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-13\">\u201c Know all men by these presents, that I am in due Jacob Kroh two hundred dollars, lawful money, to be paid to the said Jacob Kroh at any time within two years, by delivering to him at Port Barnett, good and merchantable saw-logs, to be taken at the market price when delivered, without interest.

The note given in evidence is a note under seal. In this there is a variance: 9 <em>Parr </em>407; 5 <em>id. </em>508; 1 W. C. <em>C. Rep. </em>97. There was a variance between the declaration and the writ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>Giordon </em>was for defendant, but the court did not hear him.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Am9\">\u2014 There is no substantial variance. Though the cause of action is called in the statement a promissory note, it is also called a due bill, which in the parlance of the country means a sealed acknowledgment of debt and a promise to pay it. On a demurrer to evidence, we will not look very critically into such exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
