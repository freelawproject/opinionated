Both parties claimed through John McKee, who died intestate in 1814, seized of the land in question, leaving fonr children, Polly, John, Alexander, and Thomas, and a widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Alexander </em>died in 1843, and the <em>plaintiffs </em>are two of his children, and claim as his heirs: defendants being the son of <em>John </em>McKee, deceased, and the widow of Thomas, who died since the decease of Alexander, and defend upon title in Thomas, alleging that Alexander in his lifetime, by parol sale, conveyed all his undivided interest in the land to Thomas, received part of the purchase money, and put Thomas in possession, who had subsequently made valuable improvements on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">. On trial of the case, defendants offered in evidence a record of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Erie county, viz., the petition of Thomas McKee for leave to prove said parol sale, and the proceedings and adjudication thereon, which was objected to by plaintiffs and rejected by the court below, and exception sealed at the request of the defendants\u2019 counsel, which rejection is one of the errors alleged in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">The petition of Thomas McKee was addressed to the judges of the <em>Orphans\u2019 </em>Court, and, after referring to the fact of the parol sale and \u00a1payment of part of the purchase money, stated that petitioner was ready and willing to pay for the said land, or share according to the terms of the contract, all which he was ready to prove. He prayed the court to receive proof of the said contract, in order to the completing of the title, &amp;c.

These proceedings negative this altogether. The court never appointed such day, and it appears affirmatively that notice was not given, except of the taking the testimony before the commissioners, which of itself was very harmless as respects the interest of the heirs. Besides this, the proceedings contain no decree for a specific performance of the alleged contract, nor is any offered to be shown; without which, the evidence will be ineffectual and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-15\">The evidence was rejected, and exception on part of defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-16\">The defendants then again offered the same proceedings, and to follow it with the petition of John McKee, one of the defendants in this suit, and the administrators of Alexander McKee, deceased, to the Orphans\u2019 Court for leave to make a deed in pursuance of the alleged proof of contract, and the order of said court thereupon to make such deed, and the deed itself made in pursuance thereof, dated 25th March, 1846; and with proof that Thomas McKee paid the balance of the purchase money then remaining to said administrator, and the same was charged to him in his account, since confirmed in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and that distribution thereof has been made among the heirs of Alexander'McKee, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>To which evidence plaintiffs did then and there object, on. account of want of jurisdiction in the court and want of the essential adjudication or decree of the court, and because the guardian of plaintiffs could not, by receiving the money upon totally defective proceeding, divest the interest of the wards in the real estate of their ancestor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">By the court. \u2014 These latter proceedings have no validity, unless the court had jurisdiction in the former. The court had no authority to order a deed made, unless proceedings were previously recorded. They could not be recorded until certified by the clerk of the court, and he could only certify when and after the court had decreed a specific performance of the contract; and this latter the court could not do to affect the interest of the heirs, unless they had a day in court. All these requisites are wanting. They give no additional validity to these proceedings by accumulation of decrees, for all are dependent upon the jurisdiction and first decree. These failing, all fail, and are not cured by the act of the guardians in receiving the proceeds of the purchase money. If they could thus cure the defect here, they could in any and all cases, which could not be <em>tolerated. </em>The evidence is therefore rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">Whereupon the defendants, by their counsel, excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">It was assigned for error, that the court below erred in rejecting the record offered in evidence by defendants, as in defendant\u2019s first and second bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-9\">The case was argued by Babbit, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0Q\">\u2014 He contended that the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction of the subject, and the decree was intended and understood to be a final decree, and a decree of specific performance, and was so treated by the court in directing the administrator to make a deed. That though there may be errors apparent on the face of the record, the proceedings and decree should not be treated <em>as void. </em>That the errors are not examinable in a collateral action. That notice of the application was given. That it does <em>not </em>appear <em>affirmatively </em>that there was no day appointed for the hearing and no notice given. Both may have been done and omitted to be noticed on the record; it may be presumed: 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>193; Kimball <em>v. </em>Saunders, 10 <em>id. </em>207, 286; sect. 2 of act of 29th March, 1832, relative to Orphans\u2019 Courts, providing that the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Courts shall not be avoided collaterally. .

The 15th section of the act of 24th February, 1834, requires, in case of a contract in writing to convey, notice of the bill or petition to the heirs, to appear on a <em>clay certain </em>and answer \u2014 and the 16th section contains a similar provision as to a <em>parol contract.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\">That the Orphans\u2019 Court never made a decree for the <em>specific performance of the contract, </em>as directed by the 17th section of the act of 24th February, 1834; they adjudged only the proof sufficient, and direct the same to be endorsed upon the petition, and to be certified, &amp;c. That was not a proper decree to be made in the Orphans\u2019 Court, under the provisions of that act.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AJR5\">Oct. 9th,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b235-8\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4X\">\u2014 The record offered by the defendants below, exhibits a succession of radical mistakes from beginning to end. It is a little singular, that in spite of the unambiguous provisions of our statutes, relating to the contracts of decedents, court and counsel should have fallen into the error of confounding two distinct remedies, involving a confusion of jurisdiction, and a jumble of decrees, destructive of the whole proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">The acts of 1792 and 1818 provide a method for taking proof <em>in the courts of Common Pleas, </em>of the unexecuted real contracts of decedents, previous to the institution of any suit for the breach of them, and enable the executor or administrator to make the necessary conveyance, under the order of the court. This remedy being found imperfect, in certain cases, the act of February, 1834, was passed, conferring on the several <em>orphans\u2019 courts </em>the power^ elsewhere exercised by courts of chancery, of decreeing specific performance of these contracts. The difference between these several modes of procedure, and the results attained by each, is pointed out in Chess\u2019 Appeal, 4 <em>Barr </em>52, and McFarson\u2019s appeal, 1 <em>Jones </em>503, which show them to be strongly distinguished by features peculiar to each. Indeed, they possess no one leading characteristic in common. The jurisdiction exercised by the Common Pleas, is, in fact, a method devised to avoid common law suits for damages, was originated by statute, and is, perhaps, known only in Pennsylvania; while that conferred on the Orphans\u2019 Court, is, confessedly, borrowed from the long established practice of courts of equity. These important differences seem to have been overlooked by the defendants below. Apparently acting upon the notion, that the two jurisdictions are concurrent, they invoked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Orphans\u2019 Court to exert a power possessed by the Common Pleas only. This initiatory error was the propagator of others, equally gross. The step first consequent upon the presentation of the petition, would naturally be, to fix a day for the answer of the defendants, and giving notice thereof, by citation or other order. This, however, was wholly omitted, and instead, the court directed a commission to examine witnesses, of which notice was to be given to a guardian <em>ad </em>litem, appointed on the instant. Immediately on the return of this commission, and but one day after taking the single <em>ex parte </em>deposition, upon which the decree was founded, the court adjudged the proof to be sufficient, and directed it to be certified. Nay, if we are to give credence to the formal certificate of the proper officer, this adjudication was pronounced by the court of Common Pleas, to which the procedure would seem to have been transferred, without notice to any whose interests were to be affected. Treating this, however, as a clerical error, and conceding that the record remained in the Orphans\u2019 Court, the proffered evidence is encountered by the fatal objection, that the whole proceeding is <em>coram non judice; </em>a thing wholly void, for want of the requisite authority in the tribunal employed. As this fatal fact is apparent on the face of the record itself, there is nothing remaining, upon which to found the subsequent petition of John McKee\u2019s administrator, to the Orphans\u2019 Court, -for leave to make a deed,\u2019in pursuance of the alleged contract, the order of the court therein, and the deed made in pursuance of it. All these steps were of no avail to vest a title in the defendants below, for they are obnoxious, not only to the objection that the Orphans\u2019 Court was incompetent to give effect to the particular statute, under which they had place, but also, that the order, upon which they were based, was without efficacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">But were it possible to regard the proceeding as originating in an application for a specific performance, under the act of 1834, it would still \u2019 be found radically defective. In imitation of the known practice of courts of chancery, the 15th section of the act directs due notice of the bill or petition to be given <em>\u201c </em>to the purchaser, or the executors or administrators and heirs of the decedent, or devisees of such estate, as the case may require, to appear in such court, on a day certain, and answer such bill or petition.\u201d The 52d and succeeding sections of the act of 29th March, 1832, prescribe the mode to obtain the appearance of persons amenable to the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and to compel obedience to its orders and decrees. The process is by citation, returnable on a day certain, and to be duly served on the defendant, when he can be found within the proper county, or if not, then by other modes of notice pointed out. Where minors are interested, service is to be on the guardian, if there be one residing within forty miles. If not, the minor himself is to be notified, if above the age of four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>teen years, and if under that age, his next of kin. If, at the next session of the court thereafter, such minor shall not apply for the appointment of a guardian, a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may be designated, upon whom all notices shall be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The anxiety of the law makers to secure to defendants a day in court, after due notice, so sedulously manifested, is but in accordance with the principle, that before the rights of an individual can be bound by a judicial sentence, he shall have notice of the proceeding against him. This is announced to be an axiom of natural justice and of universal application, by Marshall, C. J., in the ease of the Mary, 3 <em>Peters\u2019 Con. Rep. </em>312. \u2022 Such notice is indispensibly necessary to give jurisdiction over the person of the party. Com. of Pilotage <em>v. </em>Low, <em>Charlton </em>298; Jones <em>v. </em>Kenny, <em>Hardin </em>96; and it has been truly said that, without citation and an opportunity of being heard, the judgment of a court, whether ecclesiastical or civil, is absolutely void: Com <em>v. </em>Green, 4 <em>Whar. </em>568. This principle was recognized in Ege <em>v. </em>Sidle, 3 <em>Barr </em>124, and in Ragan\u2019s Estate, 7 <em>Watts </em>440, 441, where Jackson <em>v. </em>Brown, 3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>459, is approvingly cited. The latter is an instance of its application in a collateral proceeding, in avoidance of a judgment rendered in partition. Indeed, its observance is felt to be so entirely essential to the preservation of individual right and the advancement of social obligation, that no official endorsement is required to enforce its general acceptance. Yet, as the record itself shows, in the case before us, this fundamental rule of right seems to have been entirely overlooked. No process was issued to call in the defendants; no day given them to dispute the assertions of the petitioner ; and no hearing had upon the merits of his case. In fact, the whole proceeding was <em>ex </em>parte, for it cannot be said the notice of taking depositions rescues it from this condition. That notice was to one invested with no right to represent the minor children. But had this been otherwise, there could regularly be no such notice before the parties were brought into court by process ; a preliminary step essential to the jurisdiction. They never were so brought in, nor was there any attempt made to bring them in. They were, consequently, without the power of the court, and are unbound by any decree pronounced against them. In truth, no final decree was pronounced by the Orphans\u2019 Court. Under the statute investing it with authority, the only final decree contemplated is of specific performance. The endorsement directed to be made on the petition presented, is not such a decree, nor any thing like it. Indeed, it was not intended to be; for it is obvious, that in directing this entry, those who' conducted the application, proceeded under the act regulating the Courts of Common Pleas, and, as already observed^ the remedy attempted was that which can only be administered in the latter tribunal. This mistake is radical and fatal. The Orphans\u2019 Court attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>to do something it had no authority to do. The attempt was, therefore, productive of no results. It could neither confer a right, nor redress a wrong. The power to divest men of their estates and transfer them to others, is a momentous one; to be exercised with great care and caution. Before it can be made effective, the court must possess itself, not only of the subject, but of the person whose interests are to be dealt with; and after this, the proper decree must be pronounced. In these essentials, the action of the Orphans\u2019 Court was altogether wanting. The court below was consequently right in rejecting the evidence, as of no importance in assisting a determination of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b238-7\">Gibson, C.
