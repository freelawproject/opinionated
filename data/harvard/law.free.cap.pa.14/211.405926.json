It also appeared that the defendants had never offered to give up or return the clock to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">The court allowed defendants to give evidence of the contract forming the consideration of. the note, upon the same principle as in case of a failure of consideration, to which plaintiff excepted. Evidence was given that Dewey guarantied that the clock should run; that Dewey went away after the clock was put up. No notice of dissatisfaction was given to Dewey. Defects in the clock were proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">On the part of the plaintiff, it was contended that, as defendants retained possession of the clock, and used it more or less up to the time the suit was brought, and had never offered to give up or return the clock, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-8\">On the part of the defendants, a point was propounded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">If the jury believe, from the evidence, that the clock was in any material particular defective, that it did not keep correct time, that it did not strike the time correctly, or that the hands designed to indicate the time, or any of them, on its several dials or faces, did not at the same period indicate the same time, and the defendants, for these reasons, or any other, were dissatisfied with its performance, then the verdict of the jury should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-10\">The court, Church, J., charged, <em>inter alia: </em>\u2014 It is a well-settled rule of law, that when, by the terms of a contract, the performance of the stipulations therein on part of plaintiff forms the considera-' tion and condition for the performance on part of defendant, it maybe considered as precedent to the right to recover; and unless the plaintiff shows a substantial compliance with such precedent condition, or some act or course of conduct on part of defendants showing a waiver of it, he must fail. A slight and immaterial failure or omission on part of plaintiff will not affect him. It must be in substance and material; something which in its character and extent goes to the very essence of the consideration as an entirety. This note is only payable on condition the clock performs to the satisfaction of defendants \u2014 not an arbitrary satisfaction \u2014 they are bound to be satisfied, and may be deemed to be so unless there be some substantial and just cause for dissatisfaction. If, then, you find that the clock was materially defective, and did not keep correct, regular time, nor strike correctly, regularly, and the hands on the dials did not indicate uniform similar time, these would justify the defendants in their dissatisfaction, and form a defence here. And if the plaintiff was to put the clock up and make it so perform, or else not have payment on the note as expressed in the note, the fact that the clock has remained where plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>left it until the suit brought, makes no difference. Defendants were not bound to return it unless an opportunity has been offered; especially if the residence of the plaintiff is at a distance, and unknown to defendants. They do not seek to recover, but to prevent a recovery against them. If there was only a slight defect, make _ such deduction as is right and just under the evidence, and as will make it good as stipulated for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\">To which plaintiff excepts generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-7\">Verdict was rendered for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-8\">It was assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-9\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKx\">\u2014 The transaction before us is analagous to a transaction between merchants, called <em>\u201c </em>sale or return;\u201d by the terms of which, the party to whom the goods are sent, is bound to return them with notice of his dissent within a reasonable time, or keep them on the terms of the offer; or it is perhaps strictly a conditional sale, of which the same principle is an element. Such was the sale in Humphreys <em>v. </em>Carvalho, 16 <em>East </em>45, and many other cases, which it is unnecessary to quote, the principle being settled; and the business is to apply it to the evidence. The defendant promised to pay the price at the expiration of a year, on condition that the clock should perform to the satisfaction of the burgess and town council, or their successors. The corporation, consequently, had a year to signify its determination. This is not a case of warranty, and it is immaterial whether the clock performed well or ill; it was the business of the burgess and council to judge of that, and keep the clock or return it, at the proper time. It was put up, and the plaintiff, who was probably a clock pedlar, went away. The burgess and council were ultimately dissatisfied with it, and after two years, took it down, but did not offer to return it, or attempt to give notice of their dissatisfaction. Three witnesses testified that they had not heard of the plaintiff\u2019s whereabout, then or since; the other witnesses were silent in respect to it. It is clear and indisputable law, that the burgess and council were bound to give notice of their dissatisfaction, with an offer to return the clock, or attempt to do it. They were not bound to follow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>plaintiff to a foreign country; but if foreign residence had been alleged, they would have been bound to prove it. If his residence was unknown, they were bound to prove that they had attempted to discover it. If it was known to be in a sister State, they were [ bound to prove that they had attempted to reach him through the post-office. But there was not a spark of evidence to prove that any effort had been made whatever <em>i </em>and the contract had become absolute. The cause, therefore, was not put on its proper point.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
