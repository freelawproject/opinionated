In the case of a writ of error by a corporation, the affidavit required by law may be made by an agent of the corporation though he is not expressly deputed for that purpose. The fourth section of the act of 22d of March, 1817, relative to suits brought by or against corporations, is not repealed, as respects such affidavits, by the third section of the act of 11th June, 1832, relative to affidavits in suing out writs of error.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">Error to the District Court of <em>Philadelphia county.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-10\">In order to obtain the writ of error in this case, an affidavit was made as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-11\">\u201c C.

That the act of 1817 was merely directory in cases where the corporation did not act by an agent or attorney.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-12\"><em>Hbod </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANO\">January 20th,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b443-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b443-14\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">\u2014 The act of 1832 enlarges the act of 1817, but does not repeal it. Why should not the affidavit be made as well by a special deputy as by a president, secretary, or treasurer? Such a deputy is within not only the letter, but the reason of the subsequent act, though corporations are not particularly mentioned in it. A corporation is certainly a party, and its deputy is its agent. An affidavit could seldom be made by an officer of a foreign corporation in time to supersede execution; and the proper officer of even a domestic one may be abroad at the important moment. As a preventive of abuse, the affidavit is not of sufficient worth to induce a rigid construction. Every man who has lost a lawsuit believes he has suffered injustice, and is willing to swear it; but his agent or attorney, less influenced by resentment, will swear with more caution. It sufficiently appears, in this instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>that the agent had authority to interfere. To require an express deputation, would be as inconvenient as to require an affidavit by a corporate officer. The practice has been otherwise, and we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
