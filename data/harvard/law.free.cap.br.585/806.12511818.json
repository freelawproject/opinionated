In particular, the bankruptcy court considered \"Ward's renewed argument that the [a]dversary [p]roceeding must be dismissed because the Original Complaint was not timely filed.\" Memorandum Opinion at 6. On this preliminary matter, the bankruptcy court concluded that because courts have harmonized the strict deadlines prescribed by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure with principles related to equity, the parties were entitled to rely on the information contained in the NDTex Court's notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Near the end of the opinion, the bankruptcy court summarized its findings on Ward's \"false oaths\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [The] Court finds that (i) Ward made numerous false statements during the Case under oath, including in his Schedules, Amended Schedules, [Statement of Financial Affairs], Amended [Statement of Financial Affairs] and in his testimony both at trial and at his \u00a7 341 meeting of creditors, (ii) Ward knew the statements were false when he made them,\n   (iii) Ward made the statements with fraudulent intent or, at the very least, with a reckless disregard for the truth sufficient to support a finding of fraudulent intent, as evidenced by Ward's serial false oaths and gross carelessness and outright disregard for accuracy in preparing documents filed under oath with this Court, and (iv) the false statements related materially to the Case because they each bear a relationship to Ward's business transactions or estate, and/or concern the discovery of assets, business dealings, or the existence and disposition of his property. Thus, the Court concludes that Ward's receipt of a discharge must be denied pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 54-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following its \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) analysis, the bankruptcy court changed focus and considered the creditors' contention that Ward's discharge should be denied under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Brief of Appellant at 32. Ward provides two primary contentions in support of his requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, he maintains that in light of the strict deadlines contemplated by Rules 4004 and 4007 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that the time to file objections to discharge or the dischargeability of individual debt could be extended after the expiration of the deadline contained in the EDTex Court's initial notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relatedly, Ward also avers that because the bankruptcy court did not exercise discretion in concluding that the creditors' Original Complaint was filed in a timely manner, the court should review that determination\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Ward argues that the bankruptcy court erred in denying him discharge under both \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) and \u00a7 727(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, as to \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A), Ward urges that the bankruptcy court's denial of discharge was clearly erroneous because the misstatements contained in his financial disclosures and oral testimony were made unintentionally rather than with fraudulent intent, and, further, they were relatively few in number, mostly immaterial, and occurred under significant time pressure and stress. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 24-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to \u00a7 727(a)(5), Ward contends that the bankruptcy court erred in denying him discharge because the creditors \"failed their initial burden to show that the debtor possessed 'substantial, identifiable assets' that are unavailable for distribution for creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 28, 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In their brief, the appellees address Ward's contentions in turn. First, the appellees argue that the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that they filed their complaint in a timely fashion because the bankruptcy court has equitable power to grant extensions for filing a complaint in cases where, as here, \"the [c]lerk of the [b]ankruptcy [c]ourt affirmatively represented to the parties in interest that the deadline was extended upon transfer of the case from the Eastern District of Texas to the Northern District of Texas.\" Appellees' Brief at 3. Second, the appellees maintain that this court should affirm the bankruptcy\n   court's decision to deny Ward's receipt of discharge under \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) and (a)(5) because the bankruptcy court's findings are not clearly erroneous.

Instead, the court of appeals concluded that because Neeley was aware of the bankruptcy proceedings and received notice of the date of the initial meeting of the creditors, the mere fact that the clerk failed to specify a bar date did not relieve Neeley from the requirements of Rule 4007(c). See\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519456,6126164\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/345/\">\n    815 F.2d at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In footnote 5 of\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit clarified that \"today's case is not one in which the clerk gave an affirmative but erroneous notice of a bar date upon which the creditor might reasonably have relied.\"\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519456,6126164\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/345/\">\n    815 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   347 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On appeal, Ward contends that the decisions cited by the bankruptcy court are distinguishable from the present case. With respect to\n   <em>\n    In re Castleman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   -in particular, their reliance on footnote 5 of\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   -Ward insists that because footnote 5 is \"clearly dictum,\" it has no precedential value and can be disregarded by a subsequent appellate panel. Brief of Appellant at 19. Ward also argues that reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Coston\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Dunlap\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because those cases involved instances \"where creditors [were] not able to protect or preserve their rights due to the ... procedural posture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. In Ward's view, this case is dissimilar from the facts of\n   <em>\n    In re Coston\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Dunlap\n   </em>\n   in that the creditors here never lost access to a forum in which to file a timely objection or motion for extension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Returning to the Fifth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   decision, Ward contends that even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that footnote 5 of\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   has persuasive value, reliance on a clerk's affirmative misstatement must be reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Ward, no evidence in the present case suggests that the creditors' reliance on the notice issued by\n   the NDTex Court clerk was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In fact, Ward maintains that the creditors' reliance on the affirmative misstatements found in the second clerk's notice was unreasonable because the creditors failed to act diligently in determining the applicable deadlines and, further, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure do not contemplate a reset of deadlines following a transfer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Rather than addressing Ward's contentions directly, the appellees emphasize the following language from\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   : \"Courts of Appeal are Unanimous that Clerks' Affirmative FRBP 4004 Error Allow Late Filing.\" Appellees' Brief at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704180\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/347/42/#p46\">\n    347 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   47 ) (capitalization and abbreviation in original). While the Fifth Circuit has yet to directly address the fact pattern presented by the instant case, bankruptcy courts in Texas and numerous courts of appeals agree that creditors' reliance on a clerk's affirmative misstatement is reasonable and permits late filing.

On the issue of a bankruptcy court's equitable powers under \u00a7 105(a), Ward highlights Fifth Circuit precedent stating that \"[t]he statute does not authorize the bankruptcy courts to create substantive rights that are otherwise unavailable under applicable law, or constitute a roving commission to\n   do equity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Coie v.

It is an entirely different matter for a bankruptcy court to abuse its equitable power by entertaining a late-filed motion for extension in the absence of any such error. This case involves the former situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To be clear, bankruptcy courts may not use their equitable power as a sword to increase their discretionary authority in a manner that conflicts with the Bankruptcy Code. See\n   <em>\n    Siegel\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1194. But numerous cases suggest that, in certain instances, bankruptcy courts may call upon principles of equity to shield unwitting parties and correct their own errors. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Themy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6530243,10512239\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/6/688/\">\n    6 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   689 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Francis v.

Allowing [the creditor] to go forward with his objection, however, will not\n   <em>\n    create\n   </em>\n   a substantive right ... but merely allow him to\n   <em>\n    exercise\n   </em>\n   that substantive right.\") (emphasis in original). After all, as the court noted in\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   , \"[c]lerks of court make more errors than one might expect.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704180\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/347/42/#p46\">\n    347 B.R. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, after reviewing footnote 5 of the Fifth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   opinion, the decisions from Texas bankruptcy courts in cases like\n   <em>\n    In re Castleman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Crawford\n   </em>\n   , and cases from numerous courts of appeals, the court is satisfied that the weight of case law favors the appellees' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ward calls attention to\n   <em>\n    Owen v. Miller (In re Miller)\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-80905-hdh-7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%206507922\">\n    2006 WL 6507922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 2006) (Lindsay, J.), cited by the bankruptcy court, to support his position that the bankruptcy court lacked the power to extend the deadline for filing objections. But, like the bankruptcy court below, this court finds the facts of\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   distinguishable from the facts in the present case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum Opinion at 9. While\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   is a case from the Northern District of Texas, the facts lack a clerk's affirmative misstatement on the deadline for filing objections.\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%206507922\">\n    2006 WL 6507922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"Although PACER showed inconsistencies concerning the date the section 341 meeting was to take place, it listed January 1, 2005 ... as the complaint filing deadline.

Actually, the facts of\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   appear more analogous to the situation presented in\n   <em>\n    Neeley\n   </em>\n   itself, rather than the one contemplated in footnote 5 of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, the facts do not suggest that the creditors purposefully flouted deadlines or engaged in intentionally dilatory tactics.

Yet in reading the bankruptcy court's meticulous recitation of Ward's \"serial false oaths,\" two themes stand out. First, Ward's mistakes were not few and far between, but rather frequent and purposeful, evincing a careless disregard for the truth.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Memorandum Opinion at 36 (\"Ward's purposeful and continuing misstatements regarding his gross income, coupled with the other false oaths ..., show a clear pattern of reckless disregard for the truth that this Court finds is sufficient to prove fraudulent intent.\"). Second, as a lawyer and a sophisticated businessman, Ward should have known better. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299693\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/564/#p575\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Ward is both a lawyer and a sophisticated businessman, having run multiple businesses over many years....

Accordingly, the court affirms the bankruptcy court's findings as to fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On the question of materiality, Ward contends that because some of the misstatements related to business rather than personal debts, they were immaterial to the proceedings before the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brief of Appellant at 27. But even if some of Ward's falsehoods were immaterial to the bankruptcy proceedings, Ward failed to address all of the bankruptcy court's false oath findings. Appellees' Brief at 11. In its opinion, the bankruptcy court made clear that each of the above false oath findings constituted a separate and independent ground for denying Ward's receipt of a discharge. Accordingly, in light of the overwhelming evidence in the appellate record, this court cannot conclude that the bankruptcy court's decision to deny discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A) was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   b.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(5), \"[t]he court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless ... the debtor has failed to explain satisfactorily, before determination of denial of discharge under this paragraph, any loss of assets or deficiency of assets to meet the debtor's liabilities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5).

He argues that because the testimony the bankruptcy court relied on only supported a finding that Ward was the sole officer between 2012 and 2014, it lacked any logical nexus with the entity's 2010 tax return.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brief of Appellant at 29-30; Reply Brief of Appellant at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its memorandum opinion, the bankruptcy court described Ward's testimony throughout trial as \"self-serving, not credible, or both.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. Continuing, the bankruptcy court found that \"Ward's testimony often changed based upon the situation he was presented with-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , he was the only officer, until shown substantial compensation to officers; the tax returns were accurate, until they conflicted with his schedules or were harmful to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given Ward's motives to obfuscate and propensity to contradict himself, the bankruptcy court had to make credibility determinations and draw inferences from the totality of Ward's trial testimony. In accordance with the requirements of Rule 4005, the appellees provided\n   <em>\n    some evidence\n   </em>\n   , the 2010 tax return. The tax return and the totality of Ward's trial testimony supported a finding that Ward received at least $900,000 as an officer of Lloyd Ward, P.C. in 2010. Indeed, as the bankruptcy court noted, \"[i]t is simply not plausible that Ward (a lawyer and sophisticated businessman) would permit an entity he controlled to file a tax return showing substantial compensation to him if, in fact, that money was not paid to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Ward also maintains that the bankruptcy court erred in inferring that compensation as stated on a company's tax return counts as an asset under \u00a7 727(a)(5). Brief of Appellant at 30. Referencing the Internal Revenue Code, Ward contends that compensation includes expenditures paid by a company, which would not count as an asset for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. The court finds this argument unpersuasive. Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"asset\" as \"[a]ll the property of a person (especially a bankrupt or deceased person) available for paying debts or for distribution.\"\n   <em>\n    Asset\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Surely $900,000 or $1,325,000 of wages paid to an officer, as reflected in a company's tax return, counts under this definition. And, further, no facts suggest that the figure reflected in the 2010 tax return was anything other than a direct payment from the company to Ward and, ostensibly, its other officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In consideration of the foregoing, this court concludes that the bankruptcy court did not err in determining that the appellees met their trial burden to establish a prima facie case. Because Ward does not present arguments contesting the bankruptcy court's finding that he failed to satisfy his burden to provide a satisfactory explanation, the court ends its analysis here. Therefore, the bankruptcy court's decision to deny Ward's receipt of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(5) is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the bankruptcy court's judgment is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of an individual debt is one of the \"core proceedings\" subject to this court's appellate review.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1), (b)(2)(I) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1) ; Appellees' Brief at 4 n.1 (docket entry 16).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In the previous civil case,\n    <em>\n     Parker v.
