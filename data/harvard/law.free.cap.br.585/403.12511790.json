In addressing this objection, this Court must determine whether (i) pro rata payments to a secured creditor distributed after the chapter 13 trustee fully pays administrative claims violate the equal monthly payment requirement and (ii) whether the debtor's chapter 13 plan appropriately provides for creditors to retain their liens if a case is dismissed or converted prior to completion of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Fed.

First, Propel complains that Debtor's Plan fails to provide for \"the Lender to receive fixed and equal payments.\" ECF No. 41. Propel's Objection is based upon the allegation that Debtor's Plan proposal to pay Propel's claim with interest, pro-rata over a period of 58 months rather than in fixed, equal monthly payments from month one, coupled with Trustee's policy of paying administrative claims prior to distributing funds, pro rata, to creditors violates the equal monthly payment requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I). This Court must determine whether pro rata payments to Propel distributed after Trustee fully pays administrative claims violate the equal monthly payment requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is undisputed that a bankruptcy court shall confirm a chapter 13 plan if,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the plan provides, with respect to each allowed secured claim, that \"if the property to be distributed pursuant to this subsection is in the form of periodic payments such payments shall be in equal monthly amounts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6557008,1156549\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/670/478/\">\n    670 F.2d 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486 (5th Cir. 1982). In the case of a chapter 13 plan, the \"property to be distributed\" is the payments made by the debtor to the chapter 13 trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(a).

The plain language of \u00a7 1326(b)(1)\"prohibits the chapter 13 trustee from making any payments to creditors under the plan until the \u00a7 507(a)(2) payments have been made ...

ECF No. 48 at 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Propel's reconciliation of the Code is erroneous.

The plain language of \u00a7 1326(b) requires full payment of administrative claims prior to-or simultaneously with-payments to other creditors; whereas, the plain language of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) does not include a requirement for equal payments to begin in the first month of the plan. While the Code does not prohibit equal monthly payments beginning in the first month of a chapter 13 plan and continuing until month sixty, this Court finds that Debtor's Plan does not violate \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) because it explicitly provides for pro rata payments to be made from months one through fifty-eight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DeSardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p808\">\n    340 B.R. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Propel's Objection largely focuses on Trustee's internal distribution procedures.

Here, Trustee distributed payments to Debtor's Counsel prior to confirmation and has chosen to utilize a procedure to pay Debtor's Counsel in full up front prior to beginning equal distributions to Propel and other creditors. Trustee is also required to pay any unpaid \u00a7 507(a)(2) claim \"before or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan.\" \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The Court will not direct Trustee to distribute plan payments in a rigid manner because of the flexibility of individual chapter 13 plans; however, Trustee must balance her directives under the Code and make distributions in accordance with the terms of a confirmed plan while also ensuring administrative claims receive priority.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1326(a)(2)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Irrespective of Trustee's distribution procedures, Debtor's Plan provides for Propel to be paid pro rata in months one through fifty-eight. ECF No. 37 at 7. An objection to confirmation must be based on the actual terms of a chapter 13 plan and not a chapter 13 trustee's internal procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Propel's Objection to Debtor's Plan is also based on Debtor's proposition to distribute on a \"pro rata\" basis rather than specified, equal monthly payments. ECF No. 41. As discussed above, secured creditors must receive equal monthly payments once the payments begin.\n   <em>\n    In re DeSardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p808\">\n    340 B.R. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although secured creditors are required to receive \"equal monthly payments,\" a plan that provides for \"periodic 'pro rata' payments does not necessarily result\" in a violation of \u00a7 1325.\n   <em>\n    In re Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20624566\">\n    2008 WL 624566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

In a chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor submits payments to the chapter 13 trustee and \"[t]he trustee\n   shall make payments to creditors under the plan.\" \u00a7 1326(c). Courts following the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   have noted that \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii) only requires a debtor \"to make equal monthly payments to the plan, ... not to a particular creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779095\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/394/198/#p205\">\n    394 B.R. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (Bankr.

A debtor submits the monthly plan payments to the chapter 13 trustee, who in turn distributes those funds to the debtor's creditors. \u00a7 1326. \" Sections 1322 and 1325 concern the contents of a plan and what a\n   <em>\n    debtor\n   </em>\n   must do to have a plan confirmed;\" whereas, \u00a7 1326 provides few directives to the chapter 13 trustee to indicate \"an intent to repose broad discretion in trustees for the administration of plans.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083290\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/403/5/#p14\">\n    403 B.R. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14-15 (Bankr.

ECF No. 37 at 1. The Plan pays Debtor's secured creditors throughout the life of the Plan and does not propose a balloon payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779095\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/394/198/#p205\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court finds that Debtor's proposal to continue making equal monthly payments of $1,100.00 and $1,200.00, respectively, to the same creditors throughout the life of the Plan satisfies Debtor's duty to make equal monthly payments pursuant to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I).\n   <em>\n    In re Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20624566\">\n    2008 WL 624566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, this Court agrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   . Propel's Objection conflates the requirements to confirm a plan with Trustee's duties to distribute payments to creditors.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1325\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1326. Trustee is not governed by the requirements of \u00a7 1325 when making plan distributions, but rather is governed by \u00a7 1326 and is well within the confines of the Code to distribute payments to creditors on a pro-rata basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083290\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/403/5/#p14\">\n    403 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   14-15 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Marks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3779095\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/394/198/#p205\">\n    394 B.R. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court finds that Propel's Objection as to \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) should be overruled because Debtor's Plan provides for equal monthly payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Debtor's Plan Provides that Propel Shall Retain Its Lien\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, Propel objects to Debtor's Plan because it does not comply with \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II) by providing that Propel shall retain its lien in case Debtor's case is dismissed or converted. At the November 30, 2017 confirmation hearing, the parties contemplated filing a motion for non-standard language to note that creditors shall retain their lien to the extent recognized by applicable nonbankruptcy law if the case is dismissed or converted without completion of the Plan. However, as of the time, Debtor has not filed a motion for non-standard language. Irrespective of the comments made at the confirmation hearing, this Court considers whether the existing language in Debtor's Plan satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A chapter 13 plan shall provide that \"if the case ... is dismissed or converted without completion of the plan,\" the secured creditor shall retain that lien to \"the extent recognized by applicable nonbankruptcy law.\" \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II). Paragraph 8 of Debtor's Plan-which contains treatment of Propel's claim-provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Subject to disposition of a timely filed motion to avoid a lien under \u00a7 522, or a\n   complaint to determine the extent or validity of a lien filed under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001,\n   <em>\n    each secured creditor shall retain the lien securing its claim.\n   </em>\n   The lien shall be enforceable to secure payment of the claim the lien secures, as that claim may be modified by the plan. The holder of a claim secured by a valid lien may enforce its lien only pursuant to \u00a7 362.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ECF No. 37 at 6 (emphasis added). In this case, Debtor has not filed a motion to avoid Propel's lien nor has she filed an adversary to challenge the extent or validity of Propel's lien. The Court agrees with Propel's contention that a chapter 13 plan must provide that secured creditors retain their lien in accordance with the Code. \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II). However, the Court finds that the existing language in the Plan satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Plan explicitly states that \"each secured creditor shall retain the lien securing its claim.\" ECF No. 37 at 6. Although Paragraph 8 of the instant Plan does not directly track the language of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II), the plain language of the Plan requires and ensures that secured creditors retain their liens, which would include Propel retaining its lien in the case of dismissal or conversion. Moreover, the Court shall confirm a plan that \"has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\" \u00a7 1325(a)(3). Debtor's Plan proposes that secured creditors retain their liens in accordance with the Code and therefore does not propose anything forbidden by law. ECF No. 37 at 6. There is no evidence-nor does Propel suggest-that Debtor filed her Plan in bad faith. Therefore, this Court finds that Propel's Objection should be overruled because Debtor's Plan satisfies the requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Each time a chapter 13 plan is brought before this Court, the Court is tasked with determining whether the plan complies with the requirements of the Code. In this case, Propel objected to Debtor's Plan on the basis that it did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) and \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II), respectively. This Court found that the Plan satisfies the equal monthly payment requirement of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) by provisioning for pro rata payments to secured creditors. Further, this Court found that the Plan adequately provides that Propel-and all other secured creditors-retain their lien in accordance with \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(II). Thus, Debtor's Plan complies with the requirements of \u00a7 1325 and this Court must confirm the Plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6557008,1156549\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/670/478/\">\n    670 F.2d at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
