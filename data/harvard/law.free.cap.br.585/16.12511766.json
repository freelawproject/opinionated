Littlefield, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   Currently before the Court is Endurance American Insurance Company's (\"Endurance\") Motion to Reconsider and/or Vacate the Dismissal Order, Convert to Chapter 7, and to hold the Debtor in Contempt (the \"Motion\"). The Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtor filed a voluntary chapter 13 petition on April 21, 2015, and the Debtor's Schedule C claims an inherited Individual Retirement Account (\"inherited IRA\") in the approximate value of $800,000 as exempt pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules \u00a7 5205(c). After considerable litigation regarding the Debtor's exemption, including two attempts at mediation with Chief Bankruptcy Judge Margaret Cangilos-Ruiz, Endurance filed a motion seeking, among other relief, to preserve the Debtor's inherited IRA. (ECF No. 152.) The Court entered an Interim Order resolving the inherited IRA portion of that motion on February 2, 2018. (ECF No. 163.) The Interim Order permitted the Debtor only to receive her required minimum distribution (\"RMD\") from the inherited IRA and directed the Debtor to provide Endurance with specific documentation regarding the inherited IRA. Further, the Court expressly retained jurisdiction \"regarding the interpretation, implementation and enforcement\" of the Interim Order and \"to hear and determine any matters or disputes arising from or related to this Order.\" On March 19, 2018, the Debtor filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, which the Court 'So Ordered' the same day. (ECF Nos. 166, 167.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Endurance filed this Motion on April 2, 2018, and, after learning new facts through the state court process, filed a declaration in further support of its Motion on April 12, 2018. Endurance's supplemental declaration includes Charles Schwab's response to an information subpoena that indicates the Debtor depleted the entirety of her inherited IRA nearly two years prior to dismissal of her case. Based on the additional submission, the Court advanced the scheduled hearing on the Motion and issued a\n   <em>\n    Sua Sponte\n   </em>\n   Order to Show Cause for Contempt. Over the course of evidentiary hearings held on April 16, 2018 and April 17, 2018, the Debtor confirmed that she transferred the entirety of her Charles Schwab inherited IRA to a Fidelity Investments\n   inherited IRA on or about April 2016. (Trial Tr. 20:11-12, 27:3-4, April 16, 2018; Trial Tr. 28:11-17, April 17, 2018.) By that time, the Debtor indicated she had also depleted two Charles Schwab investment accounts worth approximately $200,000. (Trial Tr. 32:20-33:4, April 16, 2018; Trial Tr. 29:14-30:7, April 17, 2018.) All of the Debtor's actions relating to the three Charles Schwab accounts were taken without Court approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the Debtor transferred the inherited IRA, she continued to withdraw funds from her Fidelity account for the remainder of her case. According to a Fidelity account statement for February 2018, the Debtor's inherited IRA had a balance of $630,659.18 on February 1, 2018, and she withdrew $6,000 that month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Debtor's Ex. 3.) The Debtor testified that she withdrew all of the remaining funds within the Fidelity account after her dismissal and transferred $300,000 to her son, Matthew, and $25,000 to her other son, David. (Trial Tr. 31:1-5, 62:4-8, April 17, 2018.) At the time of the second evidentiary hearing, she estimated that she still had between $200,000 and $210,000 in her possession-$170,000 in a bank account and $30,000 to $40,000 in cash. (Trial Tr. 14:7-11, 18:22-19:2, April 17, 2018.) The Court has not heard testimony or received evidence that accounts for the remaining funds withdrawn from the Fidelity inherited IRA. When asked about her intent, the Debtor testified that part of the reason why she withdrew the funds from her inherited IRA was to put the money beyond the reach of Endurance and her other creditors. (Trial Tr. 51:6-13, 52:12-17, April 17, 2018.) After completion of the two evidentiary hearings, the United States Trustee, Laurie Todd,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Chapter 13 Trustee all filed submissions in support of the Motion, and the Debtor filed opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court directed the Debtor to produce account statements for her inherited IRA in advance of the adjourned hearing on April 26, 2018. Prior to the hearing, the Debtor produced yearly statements for 2015, 2016, and 2017, but the Debtor did not produce a monthly statement for March 2018. At the hearing on April 26, 2018, the Debtor submitted the March 2018 statement and it contradicts the Debtor's testimony that she closed her Fidelity inherited IRA after her case was dismissed. Instead, the statement establishes that the Debtor withdrew $17,000 on March 9, 2018, and withdrew $600,296.44 on March 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the March 2018 statement, the Debtor's violation of the Interim Order is far worse than anticipated after the evidentiary hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e),\n   made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9023, is warranted \"when there has been a clear error or manifest injustice in an order of the court or if newly discovered evidence is unearthed.\"\n   <em>\n    Bace v.

Additionally, Endurance, with the support of the other parties, asserts that it should have had an opportunity to respond to the Debtor's request for voluntary dismissal because the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marrama v.

This provision states that \"[t]he debtor may convert\n   a case under this chapter ... to a case under chapter 13 of this title at any time ....\" Notwithstanding the seemingly absolute language within that provision, as well as the legislative history referring to conversion under \u00a7 706(a) as an absolute right, the Supreme Court determined that a debtor's right to convert is not absolute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To reach this conclusion, the Supreme Court considered the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 706(a), 706(d), and 1307(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 371-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the Court noted that a chapter 7 debtor's right to convert in \u00a7 706(a) is expressly limited by \u00a7 706(d), which prohibits conversion to \"another chapter of this title unless the debtor may be a debtor under such chapter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 371-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, based on this limitation, the Court looked to \u00a7 1307(c), pursuant to which a chapter 13 case may be converted to chapter 7 on a number of grounds, including bad faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 372-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taking \u00a7 706(d) and \u00a7 1307(c) together, the Supreme Court reasoned that a chapter 7 debtor who proceeds in bad faith cannot \"be a debtor\" under chapter 13 because a case may be converted back from chapter 13 to chapter 7 for bad faith pursuant to \u00a7 1307(c).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    at 374-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, the Supreme Court held that the \u00a7 706(a) right to convert is subject to a bad faith exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Marrama\n    </em>\n    did not overrule or abrogate\n    <em>\n     Barbieri\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the present matter, none of the parties argue that\n   <em>\n    Marrama\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   .

Based on the mandatory language in \u00a7 1307(e),\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   argued that the right to dismiss may no longer be absolute as a court may be required to convert a case when presented with competing \u00a7 1307(b) and \u00a7 1307(e) motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4096503\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/408/559/\">\n    408 B.R. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The linchpin of the\n   <em>\n    Marrama\n   </em>\n   decision was \u00a7 706(d)'s limitation on the right to convert, and, without an equivalent provision limiting the right to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 1307(b), this Court simply cannot hold that\n   <em>\n    Marrama's\n   </em>\n   analysis has any impact on\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marrama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    549 U.S. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553918\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/365/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The text of \u00a7 706(d) therefore provides adequate authority for the denial of [the debtor's] motion to convert.\"). For all of the foregoing reasons,\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   is still good law and continues to bind the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Beyond\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   , the parties argue, in equity, that the Debtor simply cannot be allowed to abuse the bankruptcy process and escape the Court's jurisdiction without consequence. The Court agrees that the Debtor's conduct during the pendency of her case seeps bad faith and believes that this case could serve as the posterchild for a bad faith exception to a debtor's right to dismiss a case. After nearly twenty-three years on the bench, this Court cannot recall another case involving more egregious post-petition conduct than the Debtor's conduct in this case. But for\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   , this Court would find\n   <em>\n    In re Rosson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937656,3857325\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/764/\">\n    545 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2008), and other similar cases, to be persuasive and would conclude that a bad faith exception to \u00a7 1307(b) exists to allow bankruptcy judges to prevent bad faith chapter 13 debtors from abusing the bankruptcy system. While an unwilling debtor cannot be forced to stay in chapter 13, that does not necessarily mean that a bad faith actor should be allowed to totally exit this Court's jurisdiction with ill-gotten gains. In such an instance, a conversion would be more appropriate. However,\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   is an impenetrable roadblock that prevents the Court from finding such an exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Reconsidering and/or vacating the dismissal order is not warranted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Reluctantly, the Court has no choice but to deny the Motion to reconsider and/or vacate the dismissal order pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and/or 60(b). Under either provision, Endurance's argument is that the Court should have allowed Endurance the ability to respond to the Debtor's request for voluntary dismissal. However, such a response would be futile since\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   still controls. The Debtor's nefarious conduct cannot serve as the basis for reconsideration of the dismissal order under either Rule 59(e) or 60(b). Unless and until Congress amends \u00a7 1307(b) or\n   <em>\n    Barbieri\n   </em>\n   is reconsidered by the Second Circuit or overruled by the Supreme Court, this Court's hands are tied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the portion of Endurance's Motion requesting that the Court reconsider dismissal and convert the Debtor's case to chapter 7 is DENIED.

The Court's estimate is based on the Debtor's 1099-R forms for the years 2014 and 2016, which show gross distributions from her inherited IRA of $33,411.82 and $36,402.34, respectively.
