The Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1), and (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Inherited Individual Retirement Account\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Janet R. DiStefano, the Debtor's mother, had two individual retirement accounts (\"IRAs\"). The Debtor was a beneficiary of one of her mother's IRAs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Ms. DiStefano passed away on or about February 16, 2008, the Debtor used the funds received from her mother to establish an inherited IRA through Charles Schwab. (ECF No. 101.) The parties agree that the Debtor's account was funded solely from Ms. DiStefano's bequest; the Debtor has not made any personal contributions to the inherited IRA. (ECF No. 101.) According to the Debtor's January 2018 Monthly Operating Report, the inherited IRA's book value is $800,000. (ECF No. 243.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Green Island Construction Group, LLC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The dispute between Endurance and the Debtor stems from the operation of Green Island Construction Group, LLC (\"Green Island\"). Endurance, acting as surety, issued performance and payment bonds on behalf of Green Island. To induce Endurance to issue the bonds, the Debtor, and other family members, including Burbridge, signed a written General Agreement of Indemnity to hold Endurance harmless. (ECF No. 44; Ex. A) Pursuant to the bonds, Endurance remitted substantial sums to claimants and filed an Amended Proof of Claim indicating that it has incurred a loss of $1,769,317.00 as a result of those payments, as well as accrued interest, costs, and fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Claim 4-2.) Prior to the filing of this bankruptcy case, Endurance commenced an action against the Debtor and the other indemnitors in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    The Debtor's Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor filed her chapter 11 case on May 20, 2015, and claimed her inherited IRA as exempt pursuant to New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\"C.P.L.R.\") \u00a7 5205(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 101.) Endurance filed a timely objection to the exemption on July 15, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 44.) This matter, together with the dispute in the Burbridge case, was referred to mediation with Chief Bankruptcy Judge Margaret Cangilos-Ruiz on September 3, 2015. (ECF No 55.) The parties' attempt at mediation failed and the matter was directed back to this Court on November 9, 2015. (ECF No. 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 18, 2016, the Court issued a Briefing Order and the matter became fully submitted on April 22, 2016. On April 20, 2016, Janice DiStefano, the Debtor's sister, filed an involuntary chapter 7 petition against Stanley DiStefano, Jr., an indemnitor to Endurance and brother of the Debtor, Janice DiStefano, and Burbridge. (Case No. 16-10694; ECF No. 1.) With the additional involvement of Stanley DiStefano, Janice DiStefano, and other family members, the parties agreed to return to mediation to attempt to reach a global resolution of all of the matters pending before the Court. As such, the matters were referred back to Chief Judge Cangilos-Ruiz on August 23, 2016, who entered an order conditionally approving the terms of a settlement among the parties on September 23, 2016. (ECF Nos. 135, 148.) The litigants endeavored to reduce the settlement to writing but, despite their efforts for nearly a year, were unable able to do so. After an opportunity to supplement the record, this matter once again became fully briefed on November 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Endurance argues that the inherited IRA: (1) is not exempt pursuant to \u00a7 5205(c)(1) as the property is not held in trust for the Debtor; (2) is not exempt pursuant to \u00a7 5205(c)(2) as the inherited IRA is not \"qualified\" as an IRA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) constitutes property of the estate pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, the Debtor argues that the inherited IRA is a \u00a7 5205(c)(1) exempt trust because the tax code refers to inherited IRAs as trusts. The Debtor further asserts that the inherited IRA is qualified as an IRA and thus exempt pursuant to \u00a7 5205(c)(2).

The manner in which the tax code categorizes an IRA is irrelevant to the determination of whether the property is held in trust for a debtor under New York law. Indeed, the Debtor has not provided the Court with any authority for the proposition that classification as a trust by another statutory scheme establishes whether the \u00a7 5205(c)(1) trust exemption applies. For these reasons, the Debtor's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The inherited IRA is not exempt pursuant to \u00a7 5205(c)(2)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The question of whether an inherited IRA is exempt under \u00a7 5205(c)(2) is a\n   matter of first impression. Section 5205(c)(2) exempts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [A]ll trusts, custodial accounts, annuities, insurance contracts, monies, assets or interests established as part of, and all payments from, either any trust or plan,\n   <strong>\n    which is qualified as an individual retirement account\n   </strong>\n   under section four hundred eight or section four hundred eight A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00a7 5205(c)(2) (emphasis added). Courts in New York have generally declined to extend this exemption to accounts which are not specifically included within the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Iacono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6111574\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/120/691/#p695\">\n    120 B.R. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 695 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1990). Therefore, in order for an inherited IRA to be exempt, the account must be \"qualified as an individual retirement account under section four hundred eight ... of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ....\" \u00a7 5205(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Plain Language\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A court's \"[s]tatutory analysis begins with the plain meaning of a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat.

Since \u00a7 5205 specifically refers to \u00a7 408, the Court must also look to the applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code for guidance. Although no relevant subsection of \u00a7 408 uses the word \"qualified,\" \u00a7 408(a) states \"the term 'individual retirement account' means a trust created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets [six] requirements ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While \u00a7 408(a) defines IRA, the Court must consider the broader context of the statute to determine the meaning of \"qualified\" as it is not defined in either statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of N.Y. v.

In this regard, a trust satisfying \u00a7 408(a)'s requirements is entitled to special treatment under the tax code. For example, an individual contributing to his or her IRA may deduct the contribution from his or her taxable income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20219\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

On one hand, since \u00a7 408(a) defines the term IRA, a reader could reasonably conclude that any trust or plan which meets the six requirements of \u00a7 408(a) is \"qualified\" as an IRA.
