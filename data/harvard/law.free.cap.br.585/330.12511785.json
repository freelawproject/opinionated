(2004 Exam Tr. 105:6-12, Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. B, ECF No. 11-5.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 19, 2013, the Debtor executed a loan agreement for $840,000 with First Jersey Credit Union to refinance the medallion, of which loan was subsequently assigned to the Plaintiff on the same day. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, ECF No. 1; Answer \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, ECF No. 1; Def.'s Aff. Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 14; Proof of Claim No. 1 Exs. A, F, Case No. 16-41529.). On April 11, 2016, Defendant filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code along with his schedules and SOFA (the \"Petition\"). (Pet., Case No. 16-41529, ECF No. 1.). Debtor listed his residence as 135-39 120th Street, South Ozone Park, NY 11420 (the \"Residence Property\") and claimed that he owned one-fourth of the Residence Property on Schedule A/B. (Schedules, Case No. 16-41529, ECF No. 1.). On Schedule C, he claimed a homestead exemption with respect to the Residence Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). In the SOFA, which the Debtor signed under penalty of perjury, he answered \"no\" to questions numbered seven and eight, which ask whether the Debtor made any payment on any debt owed to an insider, or made a payment or transferred property on account of a debt that benefited an insider, within the year prior to the filing of the Petition. (SOFA, Case No. 16-41529,\n   ECF No. 1.). Debtor also answered no to question numbered eighteen, which asks whether the Debtor sold, traded or transferred any property not in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs within two years prior to the filing of the Petition. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An initial meeting of creditors pursuant to \u00a7 341 of the Bankruptcy Code was held on May 20, 2016 (the \"341 Meeting\"). After the 341 Meeting, Debtor filed amended Schedule A/B and amended Schedule C on June 8, 2016 (the \"First Amended Schedules\"). (1st Am. Schedules, Case No. 16-41529, ECF No. 14.). Debtor changed the address of the property in which he claimed an ownership interest and in which he claimed a homestead exemption on these two schedules from the Residence Property to 130-03 122nd Street, South Ozone Park, NY 11420 (the \"Investment Property\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 8, 2016, Plaintiff conducted an examination of the Debtor pursuant to Rule 2004 (the \"2004 Examination\"). On July 7, 2016, the day before the 2004 Examination, the Debtor provided to the Plaintiff his bank statement for the month of May 2015. (Pl.'s Att'y Certification \u00b6 9, ECF No. 11-3.). According to the bank statement, there was a deposit of $55,000 into Debtor's bank account on May 18, 2015, within one year before the filing of the Petition. (2004 Exam Tr. 72:5-73:2; Def.'s Aff. Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, ECF No. 14.). On September 20, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint commencing the instant adversary proceeding (the \"Complaint\"). (Compl., ECF No. 1.). On October 24, 2016, Debtor filed an answer to the Complaint. (Answer, ECF No. 4.). Plaintiff conducted a deposition of the Debtor on January 12, 2017 and a deposition of Debtor's father, Sham Singh, on March 8, 2017 (the \"Depositions\"). On April 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(2)(A)&amp;(B) and 727(a)(4)(A) (the \"Summary Judgment Motion\"). (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 11.). On July 13, 2017, Defendant's counsel filed a declaration in opposition to the Summary Judgment Motion (the \"Opposition\"). (Def.'s Att'y. Decl. Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 13.). Debtor also filed second amended Schedule A/B and amended Schedule D on the same day of filing the Opposition (the \"Second Amended Schedules\"). (2d Am. Schedules, Case No. 16-41529, ECF Nos. 32-33.). Debtor amended Schedule A/B to state the nature of his ownership interest in the Investment Property as \"Fee simple\" rather than \"Equitable Interest\"; on Schedule D, he amended the value of the Investment Property from $570,000 to $538,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). The Debtor did not, however, amend Schedule C to remove his claimed homestead exemption in the Investment Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). On July 17, 2017, Plaintiff filed a reply to the Defendant's Opposition. (Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Att'y. Decl., ECF No. 17.). On August 8, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the above motions (the \"Hearing\") and reserved decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).

Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff has amply established a prima facie case that the Debtor made material misstatements with fraudulent intent. In response, the Debtor has failed to explain these misstatements, or to provide a credible explanation. Further, even after the Plaintiff objected to some of the apparent false statements made on Debtor's schedules or SOFA, Debtor still has not corrected his mistakes accordingly. Summary\n   judgment is therefore warranted on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Other Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Given the conclusion that discharge should be denied under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A), the claims under \u00a7 727(a)(2) will not be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the motion for summary judgment is granted and Defendant is denied a discharge pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A).
