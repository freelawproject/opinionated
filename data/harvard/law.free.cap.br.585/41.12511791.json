In December 2007, Lyondell was acquired in an LBO by Basell B.V. (\"Basell\"), a Netherlands-based petrochemical company. The LBO was arranged by Basell's indirect owner, Access Industries, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (\"Access\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), which, in turn, is owned by Leonard Blavatnik, an American multi-billionaire. Three months later, in March 2008, Lyondell was in need of additional liquidity, and obtained a $750 million revolving credit facility from Access, now known as the \"Access Revolver.\" Lyondell first drew on the Access Revolver for $300 million in October 2008, and repaid that draw over the next 5 days. A few months later, in December 2008, while on the brink of bankruptcy, Lyondell sought to draw the full amount of the Access Revolver. Access refused. A week later, Lyondell filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Edward S. Weisfelner, appointed by the bankruptcy court as Litigation Trustee of the LB Litigation Trust (the \"Trustee\"), pursued numerous claims against Access and Blavatnik. Two of these claims are now the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, the Trustee claims that Access breached the Access Revolver agreement by failing to lend pursuant to its terms in December 2008. Although at trial, the Trustee proved that Access breached the agreement, the bankruptcy court had held on Access's motion to dismiss that a provision of the agreement that limited its liability for damages was enforceable. The Trustee has appealed that ruling, and in the alternative, challenges the amount of the bankruptcy court's damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the Trustee seeks to recover the October 2008 repayments on the Access Revolver as avoidable preference payments. On summary judgment, the bankruptcy court held that the Trustee had proven four of the five elements of the claim. But on the last element, that Lyondell was insolvent when the repayments were made, the court ruled at trial that the Trustee failed to carry its burden to prove that insolvency. The Trustee now challenges that ruling, on both legal and factual grounds. For the following reasons, the bankruptcy court's judgment is affirmed in all respects, except as to its calculation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following facts are primarily drawn from the bankruptcy court's findings of fact after trial, and are not contested on appeal except where noted. Only those facts relevant to the issues on appeal are discussed below; further detail can be found in the bankruptcy court's thorough and well-reasoned April 21, 2017 opinion,\n   <em>\n    In re Lyondell Chem.

In 2005, the Access group acquired Basell, a Netherlands-based petrochemicals company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Soon after acquiring Basell, Blavatnik began to pursue combining Basell with an American refining company, with the goal of building a global petrochemical and refining company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Among the acquisition targets Access identified was Lyondell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Access and Basell made various offers to acquire Lyondell over the course of 2006 and 2007.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These offers began at a price of approximately $24 to $27 per share of Lyondell, and steadily increased from there.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In early 2007, Blavatnik and Access began seriously evaluating an offer to purchase Lyondell at $38 dollars per share.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Some members of Blavatnik's team expressed concerns about the amount of leverage needed to consummate a deal at that price, noting that in the\n   \"downside case,\" the resulting company could end up in financial distress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Despite the substantial analysis and modeling Access undertook at the $38 per share price, no deal was consummated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2007, Access acquired an 8.3% position in Lyondell, in order to increase the pressure on Lyondell to negotiate with Basell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By July 9, 2007, Blavatnik and Lyondell's CEO, Dan Smith, had reached a tentative arrangement for Basell to acquire Lyondell at a price of $48 per share.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, the Trustee presented evidence that this price was perceived internally at Access as too high, because it would not provide sufficient upside for Access in view of the payments necessary to service the required debt load.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the merger agreement between the Basell and Lyondell companies was signed on July 16, 2007.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the merger agreement was signed, financing needed to be arranged. Five major banks each committed billions of dollars to finance the merger, and each made internal projections for the resulting company based on non-public information regarding both Basell and Lyondell.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 79, 87-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Each of these banks engaged in an extensive diligence process commensurate with the lending exposure they were undertaking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 87-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court particularly focused on two models, one from Citibank, and one from Merrill Lynch, which each showed that they believed the debt associated with the merger was an acceptable risk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The merger closed on December 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the bankruptcy court aptly described it, the deal involved elements both of a merger and acquisition, as well as leveraged finance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the merger, Basell contributed its equity and borrowed funds from financing banks to purchase Lyondell, with the bank loans secured against the assets of the combined company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 79-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lyondell's previous shareholders and debtholders received approximately $19.63 billion as part of the transaction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contemporaneous with the closing, Citibank had prepared a valuation showing the Basell company assets were worth approximately $10-12 billion, which the bankruptcy court credited.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the closing, Basell renamed itself Lyondell Basell Industries (\"LBI\"), and Lyondell became one of LBI's subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Lyondell's liquidity and capital resources were then integrated into LBI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By early 2008, LBI began experiencing significant liquidity issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   LBI had $2.3 billion in liquidity at the close of the merger, but by February 2008, that cushion had dwindled to $895 million.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although LBI had ordinary seasonal needs that tended to negatively impact first quarter liquidity, a rise in oil prices, a sales decline, and various other unexpected costs caused liquidity to decrease more than anticipated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When the merger was first discussed, the participants contemplated that an additional unsecured revolving line of credit for LBI could become necessary, but the events of the first quarter necessitated its implementation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 27, 2008, Lyondell and LBI entered into a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility with Access: the Access Revolver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the bankruptcy court did not need to reach the factual validity of these allegations in light of its ruling on motion to dismiss, these allegations remain relevant to review of that ruling. The gravamen of the Trustee's additional allegations concern the allegedly one-sided negotiation process for the Access Revolver, and the imposition of extra-contractual conditions on its use beyond the written terms of the agreement. Thus, for example, the Trustee alleged that Access never wanted to be a lender to LBI; that it imposed an extra-contractual requirement that any draws be repaid immediately as soon as funds were available; and otherwise attempted to discourage use of the Access Revolver. The Trustee also alleged that, in December 2008, Access failed to lend to LBI because it preferred to lend on more favorable terms after the bankruptcy petition rather than as a general unsecured creditor. The complaint alleges that Access was well aware of LBI's precarious financial situation when it failed to lend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lyondell's bankruptcy petition was filed on January 6, 2009.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On that issue, the bankruptcy court ruled that the defendants had submitted some evidence tending to show that LBI was solvent.

The terms of Section 9.05 do not render the Access Revolver so unbalanced or oppressive that it should be set aside. As recognized by the bankruptcy court, Section 9.05 either entitled LBI and Lyondell to a refund of the expenses they incurred entering into the Access Revolver (less the value of the benefits they had already received), or to the benefit of obtaining liquidity at a fair price from Access. Under either result, Lyondell was not worse off for having entered into the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these circumstances, Section 9.05 and the Access Revolver as a whole did not so favor Access as to render it unduly oppressive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Trustee argues that because the defendants had no exposure to consequential damages, they could honor the Access Revolver only when they liked, while Lyondell and LBI had no options given their dire financial condition, and paid as if the Access Revolver imposed real obligations. But the limitation was not unreasonably favorable to Access. It was sufficient to restore Lyondell and LBI to at least the position that they would have been but for entering into the revolver. LBI and Lyondell therefore could not have suffered significant harm as a direct result of entering into the Access Revolver. This is not to say that providing restitutionary damages in every case suffices to render a limitation-of-liability clause enforceable, but where, as here, the Access Revolver effectively conferred a benefit on LBI and Lyondell, limiting the scope of that benefit in this manner does not render the contract unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Trustee also attempts to compare the Access Revolver to the contract at issue in\n   <em>\n    Blackrock Capital Investment Corp. v.

In that case, applying New York law, the court found exculpatory clauses in a contract between a parent and subsidiary unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 533. But the clauses and contracts at issue in that case were fundamentally different. In\n   <em>\n    Blackrock\n   </em>\n   , the subsidiary was required to pay substantial fees for management services to two parent corporations, with absolutely no recourse available if the parent companies failed to perform under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532. The clauses went as far as to effectively preclude lawsuits for breach of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 531-32. And, the subsidiary was required to indemnify the parents for any conduct the parents undertook pursuant to the agreements, even if that conduct was wrongful, with effectively no ability to supervise the parents' performance or otherwise control their activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, the Access Revolver did not prevent Lyondell or LBI from obtaining other funding, and provided sufficient damages exposure to prevent Lyondell or LBI from being significantly harmed as a result of having entered into the Access Revolver. The agreements at issue in\n   <em>\n    Blackrock\n   </em>\n   may have rendered the subsidiary there a \"hapless pawn destined for sacrifice on the altar of corporate law,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 533, but the Access Revolver cannot be so described.

To be sure, other lenders may not have wanted to lend to Lyondell or LBI on an unsecured basis because of their precarious financial situation-and that may even have been the fault of the defendants-but none of these harms were due to the Access Revolver.

In\n   <em>\n    Solow\n   </em>\n   , the First Department, by a 3-2 vote, found the\n   <em>\n    Kalisch-Jarcho\n   </em>\n   exception satisfied in a case where a management company demanded extra-contractual payments in exchange for performing a duty which it was already obligated to perform under a lease agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644690\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/47/239/\">\n    847 N.Y.S.2d at 55-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The dissent, by contrast, argued that the conduct was insufficient to constitute intentional misconduct under\n   <em>\n    Kalisch-Jarcho\n   </em>\n   , on the ground that the lessee had more than adequate recourse to protect itself under the lease agreement, and because conduct motivated by economic self-interest is not intentional misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60-61 (McGuire, J., dissenting). The\n   <em>\n    Solow\n   </em>\n   majority's opinion, to the extent it can be read to suggest that intentional breach of a contract, without more, may result in non-enforcement of an exculpatory clause, has been criticized by other courts as inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Noble Lowndes\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Process Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175140\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/125/#p138\">\n    839 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 n.7 (noting disagreement and collecting cases). Similarly, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Solow\n   </em>\n   states that \"ulterior motives\" or a desire to take economic advantage of a contractual counterparty are sufficient to trigger the exception, that too is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Noble Lowndes\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Solow\n   </em>\n   is best understood as a reflection of the common-law of contract view that, although a party to a contract always has the right to breach and pay damages rather than perform, he may not demand additional consideration to perform duties he is already obligated to perform. Intentional breach of a contract to lend, even if, as the Trustee alleges here, partially motivated by a desire to act as a post-petition lender, is not contrary to the rights afforded to a party to a contract to refuse to perform, and therefore is not analogous to the situation in\n   <em>\n    Solow\n   </em>\n   . The Trustee therefore failed to plead that Section 9.05 is unenforceable under the\n   <em>\n    Kalisch-Jarcho\n   </em>\n   exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the Trustee asserts that he should have been permitted to amend his complaint to assert additional allegations relating to this claim. Denial of leave to amend a complaint is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Illinois Nat'l Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123152,10537978\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/1248/\">\n    889 F.2d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Trustee's first set of additional allegations relate to the degree of control between Blavatnik and LBI and the extracontractual conditions placed on use of the Access Revolver. Because, as the Trustee himself claims, these allegations relate to the degree of control that the defendants had over LBI, the disparate bargaining power of the parties, and the negotiation of the Access Revolver, they do not establish substantive unconscionability or intentional misconduct. The second set of additional allegations, relating to the defendants' knowledge of LBI's precarious financial situation, similarly do not plausibly plead that they acted in a manner prohibited by the\n   <em>\n    Kalisch-Jarcho\n   </em>\n   exception, because they do not plead that the breach of contract was independently tortious or reflected a desire to inflict harm on Lyondell or LBI. Therefore, leave to amend would have been futile, and the bankruptcy court's decision denying leave to amend is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Although the majority nonetheless viewed the specific criminal statutory provisions at issue as placing the burden of proof on the prosecution, it called for legislative reform to place the burden on the defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5696729\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/217/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5696729\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/217/\">\n    832 N.Y.S.2d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5696729\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/8/217/\">\n    864 N.E.2d at 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (majority opinion). No similar statutory hurdle governs this case. More broadly, burdens of proof are usually allocated to the party that \"in general is in a better position\" to come forward with evidence.\n   <em>\n    Miles Metal Corp. v. M.S.

Because defendants are almost always in a better position than plaintiffs to prove the existence and value of their counter-performance, this Court predicts that, if the New York Court of Appeals were to be presented with the issue, it would hold that the burden of proof would be on the defendant to show the existence and value of any claimed counter-performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giuffre Hyundai, Ltd. v. Hyundai Motor Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898221\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/204/#p209\">\n    756 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    DiBella v.

Therefore, the burden was on the defendants to prove the value of their counter-performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The bankruptcy court's award is vacated and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the Trustee in the amount of the commitment fee. The Trustee sought recovery of the commitment fee which it paid to Access for the Access Revolver, a sum of approximately $12 million. In post-trial briefing, without contesting the value of the commitment fee, the defendants suggested that the Trustee's recovery should be reduced by the reasonable value of the counter-performance it received. But the defendants did not specify\n   any method or record evidence with which to value that performance. The bankruptcy court, after noting the limited argument from either side, took the defendants' invitation and decided that the Trustee's recovery should be offset by the reasonable value of the October Draw. It then apparently calculated the reasonable value of the October Draw as $4.8 million, or 40% of the commitment fee. Because the $300 million draw was made on October 15, and was repaid in equal installments on October 16, 17, and 20, this amounted to an effective annual simple interest rate for the October Draw of approximately 219%, not including the interest Lyondell paid to Access in October for borrowing under the Access Revolver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This value was not suggested by either party, no support can be discerned for it in the record, and it appears unreasonable as an interest rate for a commercial loan. This is particularly true here, where the October Repayments included the substantial interest rate dictated by the Access Revolver. That finding must therefore be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Remand for recalculation of the award is not required in these circumstances. The defendants had the burden to prove the existence and amount of any claimed offset. They failed to do so. Merely suggesting that the bankruptcy court should formulate an offset, without presenting any evidence or method with which to perform that calculation, was insufficient to carry their burden. Having been given a full and fair opportunity to do so below, the defendants are not entitled to try again. Therefore, as a matter of law, the defendants have failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove the existence and value of any claimed offset, and thus judgment should have been entered for the Trustee in the full claimed amount, without any offset. Accordingly, the judgment of the bankruptcy court is vacated and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the Trustee in the amount of the commitment fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Avoidable Preference Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Trustee asserts that the October Repayments were avoidable preference payments, and thus subject to recovery for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. To be avoidable as a preference payment, the payment must satisfy the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; specifically, it must have been:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   1. to or for the benefit of a creditor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   2. for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   3. made while the debtor was insolvent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   4. on or within 90 days before the date of filing of the petition ...; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   5. enable the benefited creditor to receive more than such creditor would have received had the case been a chapter 7 liquidation and the creditor not received the transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    In re Roblin Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n    78 F.3d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (2d Cir. 1996).

The bankruptcy court also ruled, without objection on appeal, that the Trustee has satisfied each element other than the third element (solvency) as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee argues that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law that Lyondell was insolvent as of the October Repayments, and that in any event, the bankruptcy court erred in its factual findings on this issue. For the following reasons, the Trustee's arguments are rejected, and the bankruptcy court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Presumption of Insolvency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Trustee argues that the bankruptcy court improperly failed to accord the Trustee the benefit of the presumption provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). In an avoidable preference action, \"the debtor is presumed to have been insolvent on and during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the petition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). The presumption is rebuttable if the debtor establishes \"some evidence\" of solvency. On summary judgment, the bankruptcy court ruled, and the Trustee does not challenge on appeal, that the defendants had submitted some evidence tending to support the solvency of the LBI, and that the case therefore needed to be tried. The Trustee, however, now claims that because defendants' proof at trial allegedly failed to match the evidence submitted on summary judgment, the vitality of the statutory presumption should have been reevaluated based on the trial record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Generally, a district court reviewing the decision of a bankruptcy court \"will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Universal Church v. Geltzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717080,3724064\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/218/\">\n    463 F.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228-29 (2d Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adelphia Business Solutions v.

The Trustee not only failed to bring this alleged error to the attention of the bankruptcy court, but also affirmatively agreed that the defendants had no obligation to produce any evidence establishing solvency, necessarily implying that the statutory presumption had been vitiated. At no point after summary judgment did the Trustee ever argue that he was entitled to the statutory presumption, on either of the arguments that he makes now: (1) because the summary judgment record became irrelevant at trial, or (2) because the trial proof failed to match the summary judgment record. Given the clear waiver, and affirmative disclaimer, the Trustee cannot now complain that the bankruptcy court failed to provide the benefit of the statutory presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In attempting to overcome his waiver, the Trustee relies on two statements in his closing argument at trial, which he claims sufficiently alerted the bankruptcy court to his position. They did not. These statements, which the defendants aptly characterize as stray comments, failed adequately to appraise the bankruptcy court that it was the Trustee's position that the statutory presumption should be revisited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Trustee fares no better with the claim that the issue of entitlement to the statutory presumption was \"passed upon below\" so as to come within an exception to the general rule requiring issues to have been fairly presented to the lower court. The passed-upon-below exception provides that, in certain circumstances, issues that were decided by the lower court may be heard on appeal, even if a party did not raise that issue in the lower court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The Trustee, however, is not in a position to claim the benefit of that exception. The Trustee's acquiescence in the ruling that the presumption had been rebutted, without calling the alleged error to the bankruptcy court's attention, constitutes waiver outside the contours of the passed-upon-below exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keshner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286427\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/232/#p235\">\n    794 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   236 ;\n   <em>\n    Millea v.

The Bankruptcy Court's Factual Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Trustee also challenges the bankruptcy court's ruling on the ground that his proof at trial was sufficient to demonstrate insolvency.

Under the \"balance-sheet insolvency\" test, a court considers whether the fair value of the debtor's assets is greater than the fair value of the debtor's liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Roblin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n    78 F.3d at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At trial, the Trustee's evidence on this issue was primarily provided by Anders Maxwell, his expert witness on valuation. The Trustee also claims that other evidence in the record suffices to establish Lyondell's insolvency as of the date of the October Draw repayments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   It bears noting, however, that the focus of the trial of the avoidable preference claim was on the solvency of LBI in October 2008, not the solvency of Lyondell as a stand-alone entity. In post-trial briefing, the Trustee contended that Lyondell was the appropriate debtor for this claim, and the bankruptcy court agreed.\n   <em>\n    Trial Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    567 B.R. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, Anders Maxwell's testimony focused entirely on LBI. He expressed no opinion whatsoever on the valuation of Lyondell as a stand-alone entity. Only in post-trial briefing was an attempt made to extrapolate the valuation Maxwell provided for LBI to a valuation of Lyondell, without any testimony to support the Trustee's methodology. Although not dispositive of the Trustee's claims here, it does limit the extent to which any errors, even if found, could be deemed reversible. Similarly, the non-expert evidence to which the Trustee points on appeal represented small portions of the Trustee's factual findings, and were not the focus of the parties' submissions. Although argument based on this evidence was not, in the main, waived for appellate consideration, the bankruptcy court's failure to address the evidence in detail must be considered in the context of its perceived importance to the case as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Anders Maxwell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The bankruptcy court ruled that the Trustee had failed to prove that Anders Maxwell's testimony was reliable, and therefore declined to consider it. If viewed as an exclusionary ruling under Rule 702, Fed. R. Evid., the ruling would be reviewed for abuse of discretion; if viewed as a factual finding that the testimony is entitled to no weight, it would be reviewed for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Restivo v. Hessemann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128851\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/547/#p575\">\n    846 F.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (2d Cir. 2017). A clear error is one that leaves the reviewing court \"with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Moreno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710864\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/64/#p72\">\n    701 F.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 (2d Cir. 2012). The rejection of Maxwell's testimony is upheld under the more demanding abuse of discretion standard, which incorporates the \"clear error\" standard for factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The bankruptcy court found that for four reasons, \"Maxwell's testimony [was] seriously flawed\": his use of December 2008 projections for his valuation of LBI as of October 2008; his use of an inflated tax rate assumption; his use of only one day of trading in his comparable companies analysis; and inconsistency with both his 2009 testimony on behalf of the Creditors Committee and his trial testimony regarding his December 2007 valuation of LBI.\n   <em>\n    Trial Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    567 B.R. at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee challenges each of these determinations, which are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    a. December 2008 Projections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The error the bankruptcy court found most troubling was Maxwell's reliance on projections first presented to LBI's board in December 2008 to value LBI as of October 2008, even though it was undisputed that the fortunes of LBI, and, indeed, the world economy as a whole, changed dramatically in November and December 2008.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the Trustee primarily argues that the bankruptcy court erred by failing to accord appropriate weight to certain evidence showing that at least the initial data for the December 2008 presentation would have been collected from the operating units on October 24, 2008. The bankruptcy court, however, found that it was highly implausible that the December projections would have been based on the exact same data as that provided in October, with no adjustments made in the intervening six weeks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It cannot be said that the bankruptcy court's finding, based on careful evaluation of and intimate familiarity with the record, is so clearly mistaken as to merit reversal. Therefore, there was no reversible error on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Inflated Tax Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Maxwell testified that the standard corporate tax rate should be used in a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") valuation. The bankruptcy court found that Maxwell's assumptions in support of that choice were incorrect. At closing argument and on appeal, the Trustee offered new arguments to support the selection of the standard corporate tax rate. Because these arguments were never offered by Maxwell during his testimony, they do not provide a basis for finding Maxwell's testimony to be reliable. Indeed, during cross-examination, Maxwell admitted that the tax rate that should be used was one most closely approximating the company's actual tax rate, rather than the standard corporate rate. Accordingly, it cannot be found on appeal, based on the evidence admitted into the trial record, that the bankruptcy court erred in finding Maxwell's testimony unreliable for using an incorrect tax rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Use of One Day of Trading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The bankruptcy court also found Maxwell's testimony to be unreliable on the ground that Maxwell used only one day of trading data in his comparable companies analysis, despite evidence that stock prices were highly volatile in late 2008, creating the potential for this component of the analysis to be unduly dependent on the particular day that Maxwell selected.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee on appeal cites to an extra-record treatise to suggest that this was not erroneous, but this argument was not made to the bankruptcy court despite a full opportunity to do so. There was no clear error in the bankruptcy court's finding, based on Maxwell's own testimony, that Maxwell's valuation was unreliable for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Trustee also suggests that the bankruptcy court erred in excluding portions of Maxwell's re-direct testimony based on new calculations he conducted after his cross examination, which purported to show that this potential problem with his analysis was immaterial. A decision to exclude evidence for noncompliance with expert disclosure requirements is reviewed\n   for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Funk v. Belneftekhim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276154\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/354/#p365\">\n    861 F.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365 (2d Cir. 2017). Rule 26(a)(2)(B)(i), Fed. R. Civ. P., requires that an expert provide \"a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them\" before trial. \"If a party fails to provide information ... as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information ... to supply evidence ... at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Although the bankruptcy court could have allowed Maxwell's new calculations, it certainly was not required to do so in light of their late disclosure. Finding no abuse of discretion, the bankruptcy court's exclusion of Maxwell's re-direct testimony to the extent it relied on new calculations is affirmed, and its finding that Maxwell's use of one day of trading data was a source of unreliability is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Inconsistency with Previous Valuations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, the bankruptcy court found that Maxwell's valuation of LBI as of October 2008 was inconsistent with previous work he had done on behalf of the Creditors Committee in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding, as well as the valuation he provided at trial for LBI as of December 2007.\n   <em>\n    Trial Opinion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268906\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/55/\">\n    567 B.R. at 106-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Trustee asserts that Maxwell provided persuasive explanations for the inconsistencies, which in the Trustee's view the bankruptcy court was compelled to accept. But the bankruptcy court, which heard the evidence and is most familiar with the record, found Maxwell's explanations unpersuasive, and indicative of Maxwell changing his methodology for litigation purposes rather than for legitimate economic reasons. This finding is one that is inherently credibility-based, and therefore is owed special deference by a reviewing court. In any event, Maxwell's and the Trustee's explanations are not so compelling as to merit reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Non-Expert Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Trustee also asserts that other evidence in the record, particularly a SEC form 10-Q Statement (\"10-Q\") showing Lyondell's financial condition as of September 30, 2008, is sufficient to support a finding that Lyondell was insolvent as of mid-October 2008. The bankruptcy court did not analyze the 10-Q in its findings, despite the Trustee briefly mentioning the 10-Q in its proposed findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The bankruptcy court's judgment on this issue is affirmed. The Trustee is correct that, on its face, the 10-Q shows a negative value for Lyondell's stockholders equity. But the 10-Q, by itself, is far from sufficient to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Lyondell was insolvent as of October 2008. In order to conduct the balance-sheet insolvency inquiry as described in\n   <em>\n    Roblin\n   </em>\n   , one has to calculate the fair value of the assets against the fair value of the liabilities.\n   <em>\n    Roblin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n    78 F.3d at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A balance sheet in a 10-Q statement, which shows the \"book value\" of assets and liabilities, can be a useful starting point for such an inquiry, but, absent unusual circumstances, is not its endpoint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Roblin\n   </em>\n   emphasizes that the relevant value for the balance-sheet insolvency inquiry is \"fair value,\" the value that a purchaser in the marketplace would ascribe to the asset or liability, not \"book value.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The two values can sometimes vary dramatically.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6463254,93711\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/30/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, on inspection of the balance sheet contained in this 10-Q, at least some of the liabilities appear to be contingent liabilities, not direct liabilities of Lyondell, or otherwise may have been fairly valued at different values than their face amount. Nor is the Trustee's attempt to pick away at one component of\n   Lyondell's assets, the \"Goodwill\" entry, persuasive. As the bankruptcy court found, there were significant negative events affecting Lyondell and LBI in November and December 2008, which would have been at least partially responsible for its later write-off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Regardless, the burden was on the Trustee to explain why the negative stockholders equity value on the balance sheet showed Lyondell's insolvency as of October 2008. This it has altogether failed to do, either in the bankruptcy court or on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not surprising in light of the focus of the Trustee below on Maxwell's testimony, and on proving the insolvency of LBI rather than Lyondell on a stand-alone basis. On a claim of this magnitude and complexity, the Trustee had to come forward with far more than an equivocal 10-Q to carry its burden of proof. Accordingly, there is not a fair basis to conclude that the 10-Q statement alone shows insolvency by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Trustee's other contentions based on the non-expert record have been considered and are deemed unpersuasive. Accordingly, the judgment of the bankruptcy court on the avoidable preference claim is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The judgment of the bankruptcy court is vacated and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the Trustee in the amount of the commitment fee for the Access Revolver, without offset. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Access has many subsidiaries and affiliates, but because the distinction between Access and its subsidiaries is immaterial on appeal, they are referred to here as \"Access.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    After examination of the briefs and the record, the Court deems oral argument unnecessary because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented therein, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed.
