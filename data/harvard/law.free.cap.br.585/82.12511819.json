On April 4, 2017, however, the Defendant filed a chapter 7 petition in this Court, and the bankruptcy was pending on the April 11, 2017 return date of the Plaintiff's contempt motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both parties appeared on the return date, (\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , dated Apr. 11, 2017 (\"\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   \"), at 1 (ECF Doc. # 1) ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Defendant provided proof of his pending bankruptcy to the DC Court.

The letter attached the\n   <em>\n    Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   which have already been described. The Court treated the letter and its attachments\n   as the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   commencing this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Defendant filed an\n   <em>\n    Answer\n   </em>\n   , dated Aug. 15, 2017 (ECF Doc. # 3), in which he admitted that the parties had entered into the Dowry, and the DC Court had held that the Dowry was an enforceable contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) After counsel appeared for the Plaintiff, she filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion.\n   </em>\n   She argued that the Dowry was not dischargeable pursuant to Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(15) because it was incurred \"in connection with a... divorce decree,\" (\n   <em>\n    Memorandum of Law in Support Of Motion of Plaintiff Sama'a Al-Hamdani for Judgment on the Pleadings Pursuant to Fed R.

The Plaintiff did not, however, make this argument in the\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   , limiting her\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   to non-dischargeability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15). As to that contention, the Defendant maintained that the Dowry \"was not incurred in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20), and the parties' contract was not a prenuptial agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-30.) Finally, the Defendant contended that the Dowry was too vague and uncertain to be enforceable as either a premarital or post-marital agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-34.) However, both parties had appeared at the contempt proceeding which resulted in the issuance of the\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   and the entry of judgment, and the Defendant has not explained the basis on which he can collaterally attack that judgment or the enforceability of the Dowry into which it merged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In deciding a motion under Rule 12(c), a court applies the same standards that govern a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    L-7 Designs, Inc. v.

Instead, the terms of the pre-existing debt must be fixed under a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement or in a divorce proceeding as part of a property settlement or division of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, neither the\n   <em>\n    Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n   nor the\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   altered or fixed the terms of the debt that pre-existed the divorce.

Further, the direction to pay the Dowry cannot be viewed as part of a property settlement under the\n   <em>\n    Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n   because the\n   <em>\n    Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n   did not include a property settlement or division of property. Accordingly, the Dowry was not incurred in the course of the parties' divorce or in connection with the\n   <em>\n    Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Contempt Order\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This does not, however, end the matter. The Dowry was not a commercial debt, and the pleadings suggest that it may have been incurred in the course of a separation or in connection with a separation agreement. The term \"separation agreement\" as used in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 523(a)(15) is not confined to its traditional meaning or labels.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Nov. 7, 2012). Generally, a dowry serves two purposes, and may be divided into two corresponding parts-\"prompt\" and \"deferred.\" The prompt portion is payable at the time the marriage contract is concluded, and serves as consideration for the marriage. The deferred portion must be paid only at the time the marriage is terminated, and serves as protection in the event of a divorce. JOHN L. ESPOSITO, WOMEN IN MUSLIM FAMILY LAW 23-24 (2d ed. (2001).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The pleadings suggest that the Dowry was contracted as part of a post-nuptial agreement made in contemplation of separation and, ultimately, a divorce. No portion of the Dowry was payable when the parties entered into the\n   <em>\n    Certificate of Marriage\n   </em>\n   ; the entire portion was \"postponed,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , deferred. Furthermore, the parties separated only five days later. The pleadings imply that parties contemplated that the obligation to pay the Dowry would be triggered by the parties' separation or, more likely, their divorce, and given the\n   subsequent divorce, in lieu of any alimony or other division of property. In those circumstances, the debt would be non-dischargeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At bottom, this is a contract dispute that cannot be decided on the pleadings. The Court must weigh the parties' testimony and other evidence to determine what they intended when they entered into the\n   <em>\n    Certificate of Marriage\n   </em>\n   that provided for the postponed Dowry. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   is denied, and the parties are directed to contact chambers and schedule a pre-trial conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Divorce Decree\n    </em>\n    is attached to the\n    <em>\n     Complaint\n    </em>\n    , filed June 27, 2017 (the \"\n    <em>\n     Complaint\n    </em>\n    \").
