(Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 10, Voluntary Pet. (Doc. 5-10).) On June 1, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court announced its ruling on the motion to dismiss. (Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9).) The Bankruptcy Court then entered a written order adopting its oral findings and formally dismissing the case. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 4, Order (Doc. 5-4) at 1.) Rain Tree then filed a motion to stay, (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 26, Mot. to Stay Pending Appeal (Doc. 5-26) ), which was denied, (Opp'n Br. of Appellee J &amp; F Partners, LLC (\"Appellee's Br.\"), Ex. 19, Mem.

(Doc. 7-1) at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 13, 2017, the bankruptcy trustee moved to dismiss this case for failure to provide proof of adequate insurance. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 2, Attach. 3, Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. 7-3).) On March 1, 2017, J &amp; F moved to dismiss this case for cause under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 2, Attach. 11, Mot. to Dismiss Case (Doc. 7-11) at 1.) On March 15, 2017, the Western District Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the motions, and on March 31, 2017, it issued a written order dismissing the case. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 5, Order on Mots. to Dismiss (Doc. 5-5) at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As relevant to this case, the Western District Bankruptcy Court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   it is clear to this Court that the Debtor has violated the Chapter 11 Operating\n   Order of this Court. While, typically, each one of the cited violations is not, in and of itself, sufficient to warrant a dismissal of a case, in this case all of the violations and deficiencies taken together are undoubtedly enough to warrant a dismissal.... The Debtor has been playing \"catch-up\" since the beginning of the case and this Court has made it clear that such would not be tolerated.

The Western District Bankruptcy Court further found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   cause exists for dismissal based on substantial continuing loss to the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of reorganization. The budget presented by the Debtor reflects a net operating loss for February through April, 2017. In addition, the budget includes payments of only $6,500 per month for Chapter 11 payments yet the Debtor offered no evidence that this payment amount would be sufficient under a Plan of Reorganization. Furthermore, this Court does not believe there is reason to believe that the numbers are realistic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) The relevant factual findings leading to these legal conclusions will be addressed as necessary hereafter in this court's analysis.

(Doc. 5-10) ), just one day after the Western District's written order was entered. On April 4, 2017, J &amp; F filed a motion to dismiss arguing that dismissal was warranted on grounds of res judicata and further arguing that reorganization was objectively futile and the filing was in bad faith. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 13, Mot. to Dismiss (Doc. 5-13) at 1.) On April 5, 2017, the Bankruptcy Administrator filed his motion to dismiss on similar grounds, arguing, inter alia, that no changed circumstances existed to justify the second Chapter 11 petition. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach 17, Mot. to Dismiss Case (Doc. 5-17) at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Middle District Bankruptcy Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motions to dismiss on May 4, 2017, and following that hearing, took the matter under advisement. (Tr. of May 4, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 8) at 192-93.) On June 1, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued oral findings, concluding that the case should be dismissed. (Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 13-14.) The Bankruptcy Court found that (1) Rain Tree failed to establish a sufficient change in circumstances to avoid the res judicata effect of the dismissal order of the Western District; (2) that there were adequate grounds to dismiss the case for \"cause\" under Section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code due to continuing loss and diminution of the estate and an absence of the reasonable likelihood of reorganization; and (3) further support for dismissal existed given a finding of bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-19.) On June 16, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued its written order dismissing the case and barring Rain Tree from refiling for 180 days. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 4, Order (Doc. 5-4) at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 16, 2017, Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to this court. (Notice of\n   Appeal (Doc. 1).)

(Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 10, Voluntary Pet. (Doc. 5-10) at 12.) According to Debtor's schedule that lease \"provides the Debtor with a 5 year Right of Renewal and a Right of First Refusal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) No value was listed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following dismissal of the case in the Western District, J &amp; F filed a Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay, which the Western District Bankruptcy Court granted. (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 2, Attach. 2, Mot. for Relief from the Automatic Stay (Doc. 7-2) ); Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 7, Order Granting Relief (Doc. 5-7).) After the Western District Bankruptcy Court entered its order granting relief from the automatic stay on January 30, 2017, J &amp; F filed a Complaint in Summary Ejectment in the Forsyth County, North Carolina General Court of Justice on January 31, 2017. (Br. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Appeal (\"Appellee's Mot. to Dismiss Br.\"), Ex. A, Ejectment Complaint (Doc. 18-1).) This Complaint asserted that Rain Tree failed to pay rent, was holding over, and demanded, among other things, to be put into possession of the premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following dismissal of the second bankruptcy case in the Middle District Bankruptcy Court on June 16, 2017, (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 4, Order (Doc. 5-4) at 1), J &amp; F filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in the summary ejectment action on September 18, 2017, (Appellee's Mot. to Dismiss Br., Ex. B, Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 18-2) ). On October 4, 2017, the Honorable Denise S. Hartsfield, North Carolina District Court Judge, granted the Motion for Summary Judgment on J &amp; F's claim for summary ejectment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C, Ejection Order (Doc. 18-4).) On October 16, 2017, a Writ of Possession was entered directing the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office to remove Rain Tree from the 5100 Lansing Drive, Winston Salem, North Carolina premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D, Writ of Possession (Doc. 18-5).) According to J &amp; F, on October 18, 2017, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office executed on the Writ of Possession, removing Rain Tree from the premises and returning possession to J &amp; F.

(Doc. 12) at 4-5.) One of these issues is whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in dismissing Rain Tree's case for cause under \u00a7 1112(b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7.) In dismissing the case, the Bankruptcy Court listed three independent bases for its decision: res judicata, cause under \u00a7 1112(b), and bad\n   faith. (Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 5-19.) This court finds that cause for dismissal existed under \u00a7 1112(b) for both substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and bad faith and will accordingly affirm the Bankruptcy Court. In light of this conclusion, this court will not reach Rain Tree's other assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Legal Framework\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), \"on request of a party in interest, and after notice and a hearing, the court shall convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 or dismiss a case under this chapter, whichever is in the best interests of creditors and the estate, for cause ....\" Section 1112(b)(4) then provides a non-exhaustive list of circumstances constituting \"cause,\" including: \"substantial or continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation[.]\" Dismissal for cause on this basis \"requires Movants to demonstrate the existence of both components: 1) the 'substantial or continuing loss or diminution of the estate' and 2) 'the absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Landmark Atl.

In support of this finding, the court found that \"the circumstances\n   underlying [the Western District's] order still exist[,]\" including: the disputed lease with existing nonpayment of rent, the non-curable nature of the lease, a net operating loss, and \"nothing left for the plan payments outside of a projected budget that the debtor has repeatedly failed to meet in light of the operation of this business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court went on to note additional evidence since provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   that the license in this case had been denied a renewal ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   There are many budget shortfalls.

(Doc. 12) at 14-15 (footnote omitted).) In so arguing, Rain Tree suggests that its case was improperly dismissed at too early a stage of the bankruptcy proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Rain Tree has not presented any authority supporting its contention that bankruptcy cases may not be dismissed under \u00a7 1112 prior to the expiration of the 120-day time frame for rejection or assumption of a lease under \u00a7 365. Given that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201112\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) contemplates decisions on motions to convert or dismiss being rendered within forty-five days of filing, without reference to the age of the case, it seems that Rain Tree's argument is without merit. However, this court need not definitively resolve this question for two reasons. First, even if the Bankruptcy Court improperly dismissed Rain Tree's case prior to the 120-day period provided by \u00a7 365, Rain Tree has presented no evidence sufficient to convince this court that, in light of the substantial continuing losses to its business, that Rain Tree could have successfully cured the arrearage under the lease with more time. Both bankruptcy courts, in dismissing Rain Tree's case, commented on Rain Tree's continual failure to pay rent. (Appellee's Br., Ex. 11, Order on Mots. To Dismiss (Doc. 28-15) at 4; Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 14, 19.) During this period, Rain Tree was unable to catch up on rent payments, as evidenced by its eventual eviction for nonpayment. (Appellee's Mot. to Dismiss Br., Ex. D, Writ of Possession (Doc. 18-5).)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) requires a debtor to continue paying rent during the pendency of a bankruptcy case, which did not occur in this case. Further, as a practical matter, Rain Tree enjoyed more than 120 days of Bankruptcy protection given the prior iteration of this case in the Western District. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 2, Attach. 1, Amendment to Voluntary Pet. (Doc. 7-1) at 1 (filing in Western District December 30, 2016); Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 4, Order (Doc. 5-4) at 1 (dismissal from Middle District on June 16, 2017).) Second, an independent basis for dismissing Rain Tree's case for cause, bad faith, is present, resulting in the same outcome regardless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rain Tree next argues that \"its license to operate was active at the time of its filing and had not been suspended\" and that \"the Bankruptcy Court erred when it found that Appellant's license was suspended and therefore the reorganization was futile.\" (Appellant's Br. (Doc. 12) at 15.) With respect to this argument, J &amp; F concedes that the Bankruptcy Court \"may have incorrectly reached a conclusion that the Appellant was operating without a license\" but argues that this \"fact alone has no bearing on the ultimate rulings ... because the dismissal under Section 1112(b)(4)(A) was also based on a multitude of other facts.\" (Appellee's Br. (Doc. 28) at 21.) This court agrees with J &amp; F that the Bankruptcy Court's determination that cause existed under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A) rested on many grounds other than the state of Rain Tree's license. Even assuming, arguendo, that the Bankruptcy Court's factual finding as to Rain Tree's license was incorrect, the remaining grounds constituting cause identified by the Bankruptcy Court independently support dismissal for cause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 14-15 (listing the disputed lease with nonpayment of rent, non-curable nature of the lease, net operating loss, failure to meet plan payments, budget shortfalls, non-escrow of property taxes, nonpayment of utilities, and Medicare payment deficiencies).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Accordingly, this court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in dismissing Rain Tree's case for cause under \u00a7 1112(b)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Bad Faith\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With respect to the Bankruptcy Court's finding of bad faith, Rain Tree argues that it was not engaged in forum shopping as both the Western District and the Middle District were appropriate fora. (Appellant's Br. (Doc. 12) at 16.) Rain Tree then repeats the arguments listed above, suggesting that it is improper for the Bankruptcy Court to have relied upon similar facts in support of its finding of both substantial continuing losses to the estate and bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A bankruptcy court's ultimate finding that a filing is not in good faith is \"one of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Carolin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533345\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/693/#p699\">\n    886 F.2d 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (4th Cir. 1989). As the Bankruptcy Court explained, in the Western District case, Rain Tree was successful in \"vigorously challeng[ing]\" transfer to the Middle District, and then filed in the Middle District just one day after its case was dismissed in the Western District. (Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 18.) This court does not find the Bankruptcy Court's finding that Rain Tree was engaged in forum shopping indicative of bad faith to be clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Again contending that its case was dismissed at too early a juncture, Rain Tree cites to\n   <em>\n    Carolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533345\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/693/#p699\">\n    886 F.2d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and contends that \"any dismissal based on the Appellant['s] inability to cure the commercial lease arrearages was premature at best and resulted in denying the Appellant access at the very portals of bankruptcy, before its ongoing proceeding had even begun to develop the total shape of the Appellant's situation.\" (Appellant's Br. (Doc. 12) at 15.) This argument ignores the procedural history of this case. While the\n   <em>\n    Carolin\n   </em>\n   court did emphasize that dismissing a bankruptcy case for lack of good faith at the time of filing, prior to a full development of the debtor's situation, was a drastic determination not to be made lightly, that case did not consider successive filings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533345\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/693/#p699\">\n    886 F.2d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The concern regarding dismissal of cases at an early stage is simply not present in instances of repeat filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656022\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/500/739/#p745\">\n    500 B.R. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745-46 (Bankr. D. Md. 2013) (\"That rationale would not seem to apply where a debtor has had numerous opportunities to reorganize successfully through several prior cases and has failed to do so. Here, for example, given his history in this court, in no way can the Debtor be said to be 'at the very portals of bankruptcy,' and his financial and personal situation has been fully developed through numerous hearings and proceedings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ultimately, this court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court's finding of both objective futility and subjective bad faith in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Premier Automotive Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505595,3576270\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/274/\">\n    492 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280-81 ;\n   <em>\n    Carolin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533345\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/693/#p699\">\n    886 F.2d at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The objective futility of Rain Tree's case is evidenced by those same facts indicating that there is not a likelihood of reorganization. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of June 1, 2017 Hr'g before Judge Benjamin A. Kahn (Doc. 9) at 14-15 (listing the disputed lease with nonpayment of rent, non-curable nature of the lease, net operating loss, failure to meet plan payments, budget shortfalls, non-escrow of property taxes, nonpayment of utilities, and Medicare payment deficiencies).) Subjective bad faith is evidenced by Rain Tree's use of bankruptcy proceedings to stall its inevitable eviction from the commercial facility and engagement in forum shopping. For this reason, this court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court appropriately\n   dismissed Rain Tree's case for cause due to a lack of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the reasons set forth above,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Order of the Bankruptcy Court (Doc. 5-4) is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This the 1st day of May, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    All citations in this Memorandum Opinion and Order to documents filed with the court refer to the page numbers located at the bottom right-hand corner of the documents as they appear on CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    This court notes that many of the issues Rain Tree raises on appeal overlap in a confusing manner but primarily boil down to complaints surrounding the three bases for dismissal identified by the Bankruptcy Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Western District Bankruptcy Court also dismissed Rain Tree's previous case for cause, finding \"substantial continuing loss to the estate and the absence of a reasonable likelihood of reorganization.\" (Bankruptcy R. on Appeal pt. 1, Attach. 5, Order (Doc. 5-5) at 6.)
