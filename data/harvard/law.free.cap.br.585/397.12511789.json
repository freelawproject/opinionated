In February 2016, Lucio Barragan-Flores (\"Debtor\") entered into two loan agreements with evolve Federal Credit Union (\"evolve\"). Proofs of Claim, ECF No. 7-4. The first loan was secured by a 2011 GMC Sierra (\"Sierra Loan\"), and the second loan was secured by a 2016 Toyota Camry (\"Camry Loan\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 8. Each loan was accompanied by a security agreement granting evolve a security interest in the vehicle securing the loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Significantly, the security agreements contain a cross-collateralization clause that states: \"Collateral securing other loans with the Credit Union may also secure this loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties stipulated that evolve holds a perfected security interest in each vehicle and that the cross-collateralization clauses in the security agreements are valid.

Bankruptcy Docket No. 1, ECF No. 7-2. Debtor's Petition listed the value of the collateral securing evolve's loans at $13,875 (the Sierra) and $15,225 (the Camry). R. at 23-24. To provide for the Sierra Loan, Debtor's Bankruptcy Plan proposed that he retain the Sierra and pay evolve $13,875 over sixty months at 5.25% interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.

On October 4, 2017, the bankruptcy court held a hearing and overruled evolve's objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bankruptcy Docket No. 14; R. at 103. The bankruptcy court then entered an order confirming the Plan. Bankruptcy Docket No. 15.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The dispute in this case centers on the Plan's treatment of the vehicles securing evolve's claims. As mentioned above, Debtor retained the Sierra and surrendered the Camry under the Plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court. evolve's argument on appeal is fairly straightforward. evolve\n   notes that both the Sierra Loan and the Camry Loan are secured by multiple pieces of collateral, namely the Sierra and the Camry, as a result of the cross-collateralization clauses. Appellant's Br. at 5-8. Further, evolve observes that while\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) allows a debtor to provide for a secured creditor's claim by either retaining or surrendering the collateral securing a loan, Fifth Circuit precedent prohibits a debtor from combining those options,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , retaining some of the underlying collateral and surrendering the rest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, evolve argues, the Plan violates \u00a7 1325(a)(5) because it impermissibly combines options by allowing Debtor to retain the Sierra and surrender the Camry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 1325(a) of the Bankruptcy Code contains a number of conditions that must be met before a bankruptcy court can confirm a Chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

In Texas, \"collateral may secure future as well as past or present advances if the security agreement so provides.\" Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code \u00a7 9.204 cmt. 5. Further, cross-collateralization clauses are applicable to all debts that \"were reasonably within the contemplation of the parties at the time the debt instrument was made.\"\n   <em>\n    W.

Here, the parties and the bankruptcy court all agree that both the Sierra and Camry secure the Camry Loan by virtue of the cross-collateralization clauses. R. at 83-84, 93, 105. Moreover, given that the Sierra Loan and Camry Loan were essentially made contemporaneously, this Court has no reason to believe that the parties contemplated otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Auto Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9994140\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/840/157/#p159\">\n    840 S.W.2d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Therefore, like the debtor in\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   who had to either cramdown or surrender all of the collateral securing the loan, Debtor must either cramdown or surrender all of the collateral securing the Camry Loan,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Sierra and the Camry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11765467,11641668\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/845/\">\n    168 F.3d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, under the Plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court, Debtor has retained the Sierra through cramdown and surrendered the Camry. That result is not only counter to the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   , but it also appears to contravene the Fifth Circuit's reading of the surrender provision in \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C). While the Fifth Circuit did not expressly hold that a debtor must always surrender all of the underlying collateral to provide for a claim under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C), the court's reliance on the Second Circuit's conclusion that identical language in Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code \"refers to all of the debtor's collateral\" strongly suggests that surrender under \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C) likewise involves all of the debtor's collateral.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11765467,11641668\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/845/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The bankruptcy court, however, reached a different conclusion. Focusing on the fact that evolve holds two allowed secured claims-one based on each loan-the bankruptcy court found that Debtor's Plan could be confirmed under \u00a7 1325(a)(5). R. at 124-27. The bankruptcy court explained that the Plan elected only one option under \u00a7 1325(a)(5) for each loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126. As to the Sierra Loan, the Plan chose cramdown, and as to the Camry Loan, the Plan chose surrender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the bankruptcy court reasoned that the Plan was permissible because\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   \"did not hold that a debtor must choose the same option under \u00a7 1325(a)(5) for two allowed secured claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court agrees with the bankruptcy court's general approach; evolve holds two allowed secured claims, and each claim should be analyzed separately despite the cross-collateralization clauses. Indeed, creditors who make multiple cross-collateralized loans to the same debtor often file separate proofs of claim for each loan, and bankruptcy courts analyze them separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re McPhilamy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272760\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/566/382/#p385\">\n    566 B.R. 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385-92 (Bankr.

D. Idaho 2011). Moreover, while evolve argues that \"the loans are effectively one obligation,\" it filed separate proofs of claim for each loan, and its Brief categorizes its secured claims as based separately on the \"Sierra Contract\" and the \"Camry Contract.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court respectfully disagrees with the bankruptcy court's finding that the Plan complies with \u00a7 1325(a)(5) as construed by the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Williams.\n   </em>\n   In its order denying evolve's Motion to Vacate, the bankruptcy court distinguished\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   based on the number of claims at issue. R. at 125. Unlike the creditor in that case, who held only one claim, evolve holds two claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763188\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/789/#p792\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet, the bankruptcy court's order does not address why that distinction is material, or why the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable when the same collateral secures more than one claim. Instead, the bankruptcy court focused on a debtor's right to choose a different option under \u00a7 1325(a)(5) for each claim, and did not discuss the disposition of each piece of collateral. Specifically, the bankruptcy court noted that \"[w]ith respect to one secured claim of evolve (based on the Camry Loan), the Debtor's Plan has provided for and selected only one option-surrender the Camry.\" R. at 126. That analysis overlooks the fact that the Camry Loan is also secured by the Sierra, and does not explain how Debtor can provide for evolve's claim based on the Camry Loan by surrendering only part of the underlying collateral. Rather, implicit in the bankruptcy court's analysis is the idea that, because the Sierra Loan is provided for in the Plan through cramdown, the Sierra is somehow no longer collateral for the Camry Loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763188\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/789/#p792\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court is unable to find support in the Bankruptcy Code or relevant case law for that result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    In re Williams\n   </em>\n   does not lend itself to any apparent distinction in cases where more than one claim is secured by the same collateral.
