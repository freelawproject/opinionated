(Docket Nos. 3, 9, 10, 12, &amp; 13). The Defendants also filed a response objecting to the Motion to Remand on September 5, 2017 and Plaintiff filed a response objecting to the Joinder Motion on September 19, 2017 (Docket Nos. 11 &amp; 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that on or about November 30, 2011, Linda Proctor Manton (\"Debtor\") transferred three parcels of real property to the Manton Family Partnership, LLP (\"MFP\") for no consideration. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *3, \u00b6 12). On or about January 30 or 31, 2012, the couple transferred $15,478.04 from a joint bank account to MFP for no consideration. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *4, \u00b6 13, 16). MFP is owned by the couple as limited partners, with TLM Diversified, LLC (\"TLM\") as the general partner. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *2, \u00b6 6). TLM is solely owned by the couple, with each owning a 50% membership interest. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *2, \u00b6 6). At the time of the transfers, the couple was indebted to several creditors including Plaintiff. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *2, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2013, the couple defaulted on Plaintiff's loan. Plaintiff foreclosed on the related secured property and obtained a deficiency judgment against the couple for approximately $750,000. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *2, \u00b6 8-9). Unable to satisfy the deficiency judgment, on November 30, 2015, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the \"Complaint\") including a count for fraudulent conveyance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Fraudulent Conveyance\n   Action\") against Debtor, Mr. Manton, MFP, and TLM (collectively, the \"Defendants\") in the Superior Court of Catoosa County, Georgia (the \"Superior Court\"). (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *1). In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleged that Debtor and Thomas L. Manton fraudulently transferred three parcels of real property and funds in the amount of $15,478.04 from their joint account to MFP and TLM. (Docket No. 1, Ex. A at *4-5, \u00b6 14-22). On July 14, 2017, the Superior Court entered a default judgment on all \"well pleaded allegations of the complaint\" against Thomas L. Manton, MFP, and TLM, with damages to be determined subsequent to a hearing on August 9, 2017. (Docket No. 1, Ex. W) (the \"Superior Court Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 13, 2017, before the Superior Court Judgment was entered, Debtor filed for relief under Chapter 7. (Case No. 17-40595, Doc.1). Debtor then received her discharge on July 19, 2017. (Case No. 17-40595, Doc. 35). On August 3, 2017, Debtor filed a Notice of Removal (\"Notice\") pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1452, and Rule 9027 of Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"FRBP\"). (Doc. 1). Trustee then filed the Motion to Intervene. In response to the removal, Plaintiff filed the Motion to Remand. On September 5, 2017, Defendants filed the Joinder Motion, seeking to substitute Trustee as the real plaintiff in interest, to dismiss First Bank of Dalton's claim, and to set aside the Superior Court Judgment as void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 12). Plaintiff opposes the relief sought in Joinder Motion. (Doc. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 30, 2017, the Court held a telephonic status conference regarding the various motions. The parties have failed to reach a unanimous consensus regarding the disposition of the pending motions. Trustee and Defendants filed joint status report and requested the Court to grant Trustee's Motion to Intervene, Defendants' Motion for Trustee Intervention as Plaintiff, and to deny Plaintiff's Motion to Remand. (Doc. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to that status conference, and the reports submitted by the parties following that status conference, and as will be set forth below, the Court concludes that (1) Trustee is entitled to intervene, (2) Trustee shall be substituted as plaintiff as the real party in interest, because he has the exclusive standing to bring a fraudulent transfer claim, and (3) the present proceeding shall not be remanded to the state court, because it was properly removed to the Court, Plaintiff failed to establish the grounds for mandatory abstention, and the Court declines to remand under permissive abstention, and denies Plaintiff's request for equitable remand. All other relief being sought in the Joinder Motion is not addressed at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Trustee's Motion to Intervene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Plaintiff's claims at issue in this proceeding are to avoid what it alleges\n   are fraudulent transfers of the three parcels of real property and funds from the joint bank account of the Debtor and her non-debtor husband to MFP for no consideration. Plaintiff brought these claims in the Superior Court pursuant to nonbankruptcy law, under Georgia's Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, O.C.G.A. 18-2-70,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which allows a creditor such as Plaintiff to bring such an action. Two well-established principles of bankruptcy law, however, are that fraudulent transfer actions become property of the estate, and that only the trustee has the power to prosecute a fraudulent transfer action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Property of the estate includes any interest that a trustee recovers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Section 550 provides, as applicable here, that \"to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, 553(b), or 724(a) of this title, the trustee may recover, for the benefit of the estate, the property transferred[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In turn, \u00a7 544(b)(1) provides that a trustee may avoid any transfer by the debtor that is voidable by a creditor holding an unsecured claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Therefore, any property that is recoverable as a result of a transfer that is voidable by an unsecured creditor becomes property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because any property recovered pursuant to a fraudulent transfer action is property of the estate, the fraudulent transfer action itself is a claim of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Highland Capital Mgmt.

Resnick &amp; Henry J. Sommer, 16th ed. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trustee and Defendants rely on FRBP Rule 7024, arguing that Trustee has established his right to intervene under both mandatory intervention and permissive intervention. Rule 7024(a)(1) provides that the Court must allow a party to intervene if that party \"is given an unconditional right to intervene by federal statute[.]\" Here, \u00a7 544 is a federal statute that clearly gives Trustee an unconditional right to intervene. Because Trustee has satisfied the requirements for mandatory intervention, the Court need not address permissive intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Additionally, pursuant to FRBP Rule 6009, \"[w]ith or without court approval, the trustee or debtor in possession may prosecute or may enter an appearance and defend any pending action or proceeding by\n   or against the debtor, or commence and prosecute any action or proceeding in behalf of the estate before any tribunal.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 6009. As set forth above, a fraudulent transfer action is a proceeding in behalf of the estate. The right to intervene in Rule 6009 is absolute and not subject to court approval.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1886567,6127623\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/714/1266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[w]ith or without court approval ....\"). Therefore, since the claims being asserted by the Plaintiff are in behalf of the estate, the Court finds that Trustee may intervene in this proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Debtor's Motion to Substitute Trustee as the Real Party in Interest as Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to this proceeding by FRBP Rule 7017, requires that \"an action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" FED. R. CIV. P. (17). A party authorized by statute to prosecute an action is a real party in interest. FED. R. CIV. P. (17)(a)(1)(G). As the case law cited above supports, \u00a7\u00a7 544 and 548 provide exclusive standing to a trustee to prosecute a fraudulent conveyance action unless the trustee has abandoned that claim or the automatic stay has been lifted.\n   <em>\n    In re Tessmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8933517\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/776/\">\n    329 B.R. 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Plaintiff's Motion to Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having decided that Trustee may intervene and be substituted as plaintiff, and because the Fraudulent Conveyance Action is a core proceeding as to which the Court has jurisdiction, the Court will deny the Motion to Remand. Plaintiff asserts that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action must be remanded to the Superior Court because: (1) Debtor did not have standing to remove the Fraudulent Conveyance Action; (2) even if Debtor had standing, only the claims against Debtor were removed, but not the claims against the non-debtor Defendants; and (3) the Court should abstain from hearing this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

A fraudulent transfer action is a civil action; it is not an action by a governmental unit to enforce its regulatory or police power; and it is not a proceeding before a tax court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The only question that remains is whether there is jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This provision creates jurisdiction in three categories of proceedings: (1) one arises under title 11, (2) one arises in a case under title 11, and (3) one that is related to cases under title 11. Because the parties did not dispute that the Court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334, but only disagreed about which type of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334, the Court will address that specific issue further below. For the purposes of whether the Fraudulent Conveyance Action\n   was a removable action, the parties have not disputed there is jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1334. Therefore, the Fraudulent Conveyance Action meets the requirements of \u00a7 1452(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Debtor may not remove the Fraudulent Conveyance Action to the Court because Debtor is not allowed to bring an avoidable transfer claim in the bankruptcy proceeding; only Trustee has the exclusive right to bring such claim.

The holding that the trustee, not the debtor, had exclusive jurisdiction to initiate such a proceeding is inapposite to whether the debtor, as a defendant in a fraudulent transfer action, has standing to remove the proceeding to the bankruptcy court.

Rule 9027(a)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If the claim or cause of action in a civil action is pending when a case under the Code is commenced, a notice of removal may be filed only within the longest of (A) 90 days after the order for relief in the case under the Code, (B) 30 days after entry of an order terminating a stay, if the claim or cause of action in a civil action has been stayed under \u00a7 362 of the Code, or (C) 30 days after a trustee qualifies in a chapter 11 reorganization case but not later than 180 days after the order for relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 9027(a)(2). Here, the 90-day removal period under (A) has lapsed. Debtor filed the Chapter 7 petition on March 13, 2017. Ninety days from the petition date was June 12, 2017. The Notice was filed on August 3, 2017, and therefore not within the 90 days prescribed by Rule 9027(a)(2)(A). The removal period under (C) is clearly inapplicable too, because Debtor's case is pending under Chapter 7. Therefore, Debtor must rely on the time period contained in (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the Court to find that the removal was timely pursuant to Rule 9027(a)(2)(B), the Court must find the following: (1) the Fraudulent Conveyance Action was stayed under \u00a7 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (2) the Fraudulent Conveyance Action was\n   removed within 30 days after the termination of such stay, if it has been terminated. FED. R. BANKR. P. 9027(a)(2)(B). Plaintiff argues that the actions against the non-debtor Defendants was never stayed, and seems to therefore argue that either Rule 9027(a)(2)(B) is inapplicable as to those Defendants, just as Rule 9027(a)(2)(C) is inapplicable, or that Debtor only had thirty days from the date she filed her bankruptcy case. Either way, Plaintiff asserts that the removal was not timely as to the Fraudulent Conveyance Action as against those Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Fraudulent Conveyance Action was Stayed Against All Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code precludes creditors from \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial ... proceeding against the debtor\" and from \"any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (3). Plaintiff asserts that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action was not stayed because the Fraudulent Conveyance Action involves non-debtor defendants and non-estate properties. Though Plaintiff cited multiple cases involving garnishees, guarantors or co-partners to support its argument, none of those cases involve fraudulent transferees or spouse of the debtor. Further, none of the claims in those cases that were not stayed affected property of the respective debtors' estates, which also distinguishes the Fraudulent Conveyance Action at issue in this case from those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the legal theory underlying the Fraudulent Conveyance Action against the non-debtor Defendants is that they were the recipients of fraudulently transferred properties, the transferees, and therefore Plaintiff may recover from them the property that was fraudulently transferred (or the equivalent value thereof). That very property, however, the property fraudulently transferred (or the equivalent value thereof) is the property that becomes property of the estate under \u00a7 541(a)(3), because \u00a7 550 explicitly provides that a trustee can recover transferred property,\n   <em>\n    from the initial or even subsequent transferees\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(2). Therefore, any attempt to exercise control over such property to satisfy a prepetition debt is stayed by \u00a7 362(a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Best Mfg.

Here, MFP is the transferee, of which TLM is the general partner, and the property that Plaintiff is trying to recover is property of the estate, thus, the Fraudulent Conveyance Action as against MFP and TLM was stayed by \u00a7 362(a). Plaintiff does not have any independent theory of liabilities against the other non-debtor Defendants, and therefore has no other legal basis to collect a debt directly from them, other than on the fraudulent conveyance claim. The only claims against the non-Debtor Defendants arise from the debts incurred by Debtor prior to filing for bankruptcy, and therefore these claims are attempts to collect upon prepetition debts from property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first case cited by Plaintiff is\n   <em>\n    In re Cole\n   </em>\n   , in which the creditor was seeking to collect upon a garnishee's independent liability for failing to comply with the applicable garnishment law, from the garnishee's independent assets.\n   <em>\n    Southwest Airlines Co. v.

Likewise, the next case cited by Plaintiff is\n   <em>\n    Credit Alliance Corp. v.

Neither is Plaintiff seeking to recover from independent assets, but rather, Plaintiff is seeking to recover the actual transferred property (or, effectively, the value that the non-Debtor defendants gained from it). Therefore, regardless of who the defendants are, the claims at issue in this case are attempts to collect on account of prepetition debts owed by the Debtor from property of the estate, and therefore all the claims at issue in this Fraudulent Conveyance Action against all the Defendants were stayed by the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This also includes the claim(s) against Defendant Thomas L. Manton on account of the approximately $15,000 transferred out of his joint account with Debtor. Section 541 of the Code governs what constitutes property of the estate in a bankruptcy case and provides that all legal and equitable interests of the debtor become property of the estate, including all interests in community property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is no allegation that the funds in the joint account belonged exclusively to Thomas L. Manton. Thus, all the transferred property constitutes property of the estate under \u00a7 541, and therefore all actions related to the recovery thereof or collection therefrom are also stayed by \u00a7 362(a). The Court finds that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action as to all Defendants is subject to the automatic stay of \u00a7 362(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Removal was Timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Having determined that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action that is the subject of this proceeding is subject to \u00a7 362, the Court concludes that the removal was timely because either the automatic stay has not terminated as to the Fraudulent Conveyance Action, or, alternatively, did terminate, but was removed within 30 days of such termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   An automatic stay remains in effect as to the estate property until it ceases to be property of the estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

N.D. Ala. 2006). Here, the case is not closed and Trustee has not abandoned nor distributed the assets. Thus, the allegedly fraudulently transferred property continues to be property of the estate.

Iowa 1990). As no order has been entered granting relief from the automatic stay, the 30-day period of Rule 9027(a)(2)(B) has not yet started to run. The Court concludes that the Notice was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that even if the automatic stay applied to the Fraudulent Conveyance Action and all the parties, the automatic stay terminated upon the entry of the discharge in Debtor's main case, pursuant to \u00a7 362(c)(2), not \u00a7 362(c)(1). Plaintiff misunderstands the effect of \u00a7 362(c)(2). A stay termination under \u00a7 362(c)(2) is only as to the debtor (who is then protected by the discharge order) but does not terminate the stay as to property of the estate. Moreover, Debtor removed the Fraudulent Conveyance Action on August 3, 2017, which is within 30 days of July 19, 2017, when the discharge order was entered, and thus is also within the requirements of Rule 9027(a)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 17-40595, Docket No. 35,\n   <em>\n    Order Discharging Chapter 7 Debtor\n   </em>\n   (July 19, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Either way, the Court finds that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action was timely removed by Debtor on August 3, 2017, pursuant to Rule 9027(a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Abstention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts that the Court is required, or in its discretion should, abstain from hearing the case because the current proceeding is not a \"core\" proceeding, and the factors justifying abstention are present. Plaintiff alternatively asserts that the Fraudulent Conveyance Action should be remanded based on equitable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mandatory Abstention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court must abstain from hearing a state law claim if all of the following requirements are met: (1) a motion has been timely filed requesting abstention; (2) the cause of action is essentially one that is premised on state law; (3) the claim is a non-core proceeding; (4) the proceeding could not otherwise have been commenced in federal court absent federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1334(b) ; (5) an action has been commenced in state court; and (6) the action could be adjudicated timely in state court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

A fraudulent transfer claim is a core proceeding in bankruptcy even though such claim was removed to the courts by a debtor, not a trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118120\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/413/621/#p630\">\n    413 B.R. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The court held that this was a core proceeding despite the fact that it was not filed by the trustee, but rather was filed in state court and removed by the debtor).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, Trustee filed the Motion to Intervene after Debtor removed the Fraudulent Conveyance Action, which clearly shows its intent to pursue the claim.

First, abstention would have a substantial effect on the administration of the estate, because this proceeding will recover value for the estate that would otherwise be unrecoverable due to the statute of limitations having expired for Trustee to independently seek recovery of fraudulently transferred property and/or Plaintiff recovering the transferred property for its own benefit and not the greater benefit of Debtor's estate and all her general unsecured creditors. Second, state law regarding fraudulent conveyances does not predominate over bankruptcy issues, because of the similarity between the Bankruptcy Code and Georgia's Uniform Voidable Transactions Act. Third, the Court has jurisdiction over the Fraudulent Conveyance Action pursuant to \u00a7 544, in addition to \u00a7 1334. Finally, and arguably most importantly, the Fraudulent Conveyance Action is a core proceeding, arising under Title 11, and directly affects property of the estate, which weighs heavily against abstention. Based upon the foregoing analysis, the Court is not persuaded to abstain in this proceeding under the permissive abstention provision of \u00a7 1334(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   3.

Therefore, for the same reasons that the Court declines to remand this case under the permissive abstention provision of \u00a7 1334(c)(1), principally because this is a core proceeding that directly affects property of the estate, the Court likewise declines to remand this Fraudulent Conveyance Action back to the Superior Court on equitable grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Trustee is entitled to intervene in any pending actions against Debtor.
