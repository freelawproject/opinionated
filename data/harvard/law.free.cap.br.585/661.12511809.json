The EDNY Bankruptcy Court Order ruled that (1) the automatic stay issued in the underlying EDNY bankruptcy proceeding applied to seven properties located in the State of Washington (the \"Washington Properties\"); (2) the Appellant's motion pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) seeking entry of an order determining that the automatic stay does not apply or, in the alternative, granting relief from the automatic stay to continue with a series of motions before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington (the \"Washington Bankruptcy Court\") is denied; (3) the Appellant may not proceed with its motions before the Washington Bankruptcy Court concerning the Washington properties; and (4) the request for a preliminary injunction filed by Olympia Office LLC is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the EDNY Bankruptcy Court Order is vacated and this case is remanded to the EDNY Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The CDC Bankruptcy and the Washington Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 10, 2011, CDC Properties I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"CDC\") filed a voluntary petition for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Washington Bankruptcy Court and was assigned case number 11-41010 (the \"CDC Bankruptcy Case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time of CDC's petition, it was the owner of the Washington Properties, which consist of: (1) 5000 Capital Boulevard Southeast, Tumwater, WA 98502; (2) 640 Woodland Square Loop Southeast, Lacey, WA 98503; (3) 637 Woodland Square Loop Southeast, Lacey, WA 98503; (4) 629 Woodland Square Loop Southeast, Lacey\n   WA 98503; (5) 4565 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Avenue Southeast, Lacey, WA 98503; (6) 645 Woodland Square Loop Southeast, Lacey, WA 98503; (7) 805 South Mission Street, Wenatchee, WA 98801; (8) 8830 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Avenue Southwest, Seattle, WA 98106; and (9) 1620 South Pioneer Way, Moses Lake, WA 98837.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Washington Properties were allegedly subject to Deeds of Trust with Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Fixture Filings (the \"Deeds of Trust\") as well as an Assignments of Leases and Rents and Security Deposits (the \"Assignment of Rents\") that resulted from a $43,257.50 loan to CDC on or about September 29, 2004. A deed of trust is \"[a] deed conveying title to real property to a trustee as security until the grantor repays a loan. This type of deed resembles a mortgage.\" Black's Law Dictionary 502 (10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2014). Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc. (the \"Original Lender\") provided the loans (the \"CDC Loans\") in the form of two promissory notes, Note A and Note B (together, the \"Notes\"). The Deeds of Trust and the Assignment of Rents for the Washington Properties were provided to the Original Lender as security. On or about September 30, 2005, the Original Lender allegedly assigned Note A to Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\") and Note B to U.S. Bank N.A. (\"U.S. Bank\"). The Appellant is the assignee of both Wells Fargo and US Bank and is the holder of both Notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2011, the Washington Bankruptcy Court confirmed CDC's plan of reorganization (the \"CDC Plan\"). Under the CDC Plan, the CDC Loans were allegedly restructured with the Notes, Deeds of Trust, and Assignments of Rents remaining in effect with new maturity dates and revised payment amounts. The Appellant alleges that the CDC Plan also prohibits the transfer of the Washington Properties unless the CDC Loans are fully repaid: \"The Reorganized Debtor may sell or refinance the [Washington Properties], or any component thereof, at any time if the proceeds of the sale or refinance are sufficient to pay all Allowed Claims in Classes 1-5 ...\" CDC Plan. Allegedly, the Deeds of Trust also prohibits the transfer of the Washington Properties without the prior written consent of the Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The CDC Plan also allegedly specifically addresses the Washington Bankruptcy Court's retention of jurisdiction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the Confirmation Date, the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction over the Reorganized Debtor and the Assets until the Plan is fully consummated and an order closing the Case is entered by the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court's retained jurisdiction shall give it authority to hear matters for purposes of administering the Plan, including without limitation: ... 5. To issue orders in aid of execution of the Plan and to issue injunctions or take such other actions or make such other orders as may be necessary or appropriate to restrain interference with the Plan or its execution or implementation by any entity; ... 8. To determine any disputes arising in connection with the interpretation, implementation, execution or enforcement of the Plan, the Confirmation Order, or any other order of the Bankruptcy Court; 9. To recover all Assets, wherever located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CDC Plan. The Washington Bankruptcy Court closed the CDC Bankruptcy Case on February 15, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Post CDC Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the Appellant alleges that CDC defaulted under the CDC Plan and the Deeds of Trust, the Appellee disputes that claim. On March 11, 2016, the Appellant commenced non-judicial foreclosure\n   proceedings involving the Washington Properties. On May 19, 2016, a Washington State court appointed JSH Properties, Inc. (the \"Receiver\") as the Receiver over the Washington Properties. This appointment was done at the request of the Appellant and by the commencement of a state court suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The non-judicial foreclosure sale of the Washington Properties was scheduled for October 21, 2016. Three days prior to the scheduled sale, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank assigned the CDC Loans to the Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Purchase of the Washington Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 23, 2016, Olympia Office LLC (\"Olympia\"), WA Portfolio LLC (\"WA Portfolio\"), Mariners Portfolio LLC (\"Mariners\"), and Seahawk Portfolio LLC (\"Seahawk\") (together, the \"Debtors\") purchased the Washington Properties from CDC by deeds (the \"Transfer\"). The Debtors acquired the Washington Properties as tenants in common, with Olympia, WA Portfolio and Seahawk each owning 30% and Mariners owning 10%. The Debtors purchased the Washington Properties for $100,000 in total. The Appellant vociferously disputes the validity of the Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On October 20, 2016, Olympia filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code with the EDNY Bankruptcy Court. At that time, Olympia had no employees and its bankruptcy schedules listed only give unsecured creditors with scheduled claims of $120,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Olympia, the Appellant, and the Receiver, executed a stipulation authorizing the Receiver to continue to possess and maintain the Washington Properties. The Appellee alleges that the Appellant agreed in that stipulation that the EDNY Bankruptcy Court would have jurisdiction over the sale of the Washington Properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 10, 2016, MLMT filed a motion in the Washington Bankruptcy Court to reopen the CDC Bankruptcy Case as well as a motion seeking to enforce the CDC Plan (together, the \"Washington Motions\"). The latter motion also asked the Washington Bankruptcy Court to declare that the Transfer of the Washington Properties was void and affirm that the Washington Properties are property of CDC's bankruptcy estate, rather than Olympia's bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 16, 2016, in response to what Olympia viewed as a violation of the EDNY Bankruptcy Court's automatic stay, Olympia commenced an adversary proceeding in the EDNY Bankruptcy Court, Case No. 16-08167, seeking a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") and preliminary injunction (\"PI\") against MLMT, barring it from proceeding with the Washington Motions in the CDC Bankruptcy Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The following day, MLMT filed its opposition to the TRO and PI and filed its own motion, asking the EDNY Bankruptcy Court to rule that the automatic stay does not apply to the Washington Motions, or, in the alternative, for relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 28, 2016, WA Portfolio, Seahawk, and Mariners filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions for relief in the EDNY Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   An injunction hearing was held both on November 21, 2016, and November 29, 2016. As stated above, Judge Trust issued the EDNY Bankruptcy Court Order on December 1, 2016. The EDNY Bankruptcy Court Order ruled that (1) the automatic stay issued in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding applied to the \"Washington Properties\"; (2) the Appellant's motion\n   pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) seeking entry of an order determining that the automatic stay does not apply or, in the alternative, granting relief from the automatic stay to continue with a series of motions before the Washington Bankruptcy Court is denied; (3) the Appellant may not proceed with its motions before the Washington Bankruptcy Court concerning the Washington properties; and (4) the PI filed by Olympia was denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response to the Appellant's brief in the instant appeal, the Debtors filed a motion to strike, seeking to eliminate the portions of the Appellant's brief that allegedly contained references to items outside the record. Specifically, the Debtors alleged that the Appellant's brief included a letter, two hearing transcripts, as well as post-appeal discovery allegations that were not included in the record before the EDNY Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Such a decision, it claims, is reserved for the Washington Bankruptcy Court, who expressly retained jurisdiction over the Washington Properties in the CDC Plan.
