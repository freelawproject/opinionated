(ECF No. 88 at 7). Wayne Hall asserted a $1,479,870.94 unsecured proof of claim in Caprock's bankruptcy case, owed after Caprock exercised its right of repurchase of Hall's Common Stock on February 13, 2015. (ECF No. 88 at 7). Caprock filed an objection to the proof of claim alleging that it is subject to mandatory subordination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Caprock's motion for summary judgment is granted. Hall's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Caprock supplies oil and gas businesses with customized rock drill bits for use in oil and gas drilling and exploration. (ECF No. 2 at 2). Hall served as Caprock's vice president and owned 177 shares of Common Stock in Caprock. (ECF No. 88 at 8). On January 1, 2010, Caprock and Hall entered into a Shareholder Agreement that restricted Hall's right to transfer his Common Stock but also dictated how his stock would be paid in case he separated from Caprock. (ECF No. 88 at 9). Whether Hall was terminated for cause or departed voluntarily, the Shareholder Agreement stated that Caprock had the right to \"repurchase\n   the shares of Common Stock owned by [Hall] at the time of termination.\" (ECF No. 88 at 9). The Agreement dictated the amount paid for Common Stock as the Attribution Amount, and separated the payment into \"five equal annual installments.\" (ECF N. 88 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These provisions of the Shareholder Agreement were triggered in January 2015, at which time, Caprock valued Hall's Common Stock at $1,783,228.00. (ECF No. 87 at 6). Caprock informed Hall of this valuation via e-mail. (ECF No. 87 at 6). At this time, Caprock proposed to Hall a Stock Purchase Agreement whereby Caprock would pay Hall the value of his Common Stock through an initial payment of $356,645.60 followed by four other annual payments of the same amount. (ECF No. 87 at 7). Hall failed to take action on Caprock's proposed Stock Purchase Agreement. (ECF No. 87 at 8). Caprock sent Hall another e-mail on February 13, 2015, advising him that it had elected to pursue its repurchase in accordance with the terms of the Shareholder Agreement and would send him an initial payment to be followed by four annual installments. (ECF No. 87 at 8). Caprock's e-mail stated that Hall's shares were \"redeemed and are no longer outstanding.\" (ECF No. 87 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Caprock sent Hall an initial check for $356,645.60 but failed to make any of its subsequent annual payments. On April 7, 2017, Caprock filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. (ECF No. 1). Hall filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case, alleging a right to payment of $1,479,870.94 for the \"2015 stock redemption.\" (Claim No. 14-1 at 2). Caprock objected to Hall's claim and sought to classify Hall's claim as subordinated in its proposed Plan of Reorganization pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 49 and 62). Hall filed a response to Caprock's objection. (ECF No. 71). The Court held a hearing on December 15, 2017, during which it instructed the parties to file cross motions for summary judgment on whether Hall's claim was subject to mandatory subordination under \u00a7 510(b). On February 2, 2018, the Court held oral argument regarding the briefed issue, after which it took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The District Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The goal of \u00a7 510(b) is to ensure the risk of loss is borne by equity holders who invest with the potential for significant financial gains rather than creditors who expect a fixed rate of return from a transaction.\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest Diving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n    579 F.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, creditors often examine a debtor's \"equity cushion\" before extending credit, thus subordinating an equity holder's interest is necessary to protect creditors' reliance on this equity cushion and preserve it in case of insolvency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In exchange for the upside of potential profits, part of the equity holders' bargain is the risk of losing their capital investments.\n   <em>\n    In re Granite Partners, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377728\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/208/332/#p336\">\n    208 B.R. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (Bankr.

(ECF No. 87 at 8). Hall urges that his rights were fixed once Caprock repurchased his shares, ending the Court's analysis. (ECF No. 87 at 9). However,\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   demonstrates that the Court may look behind the transaction to determine whether or not Hall's stock repurchase \"arises from\" the sale of a security under \u00a7 510(b) and whether subordination would satisfy its legislative purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377728\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/208/332/#p336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377728\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/208/332/#p336\">\n    at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The security at issue in this case constitutes common stock. (ECF No. 87 at 5). It is settled in the Bankruptcy Code that common stock shareholders are not paid until higher priority claims-secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and preferred stock shareholders-are satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n    579 F.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Wagering, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3511960,1091032\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/1067/\">\n    493 F.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071 (9th Cir. 2007) ). Accordingly, if Caprock had never elected its right to repurchase Hall's Common Stock, Hall could not argue that he was entitled to repayment as a general unsecured creditor. Like the judgment in\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   , looking behind the transaction demonstrates that subordination is appropriate because Hall's ultimate claim against the company is rooted in an equity interest. Characterizing his debt on par with other general unsecured creditors upsets\n   the hierarchy of the bankruptcy priorities and thus allows him a greater recovery than he would normally be entitled to at the expense of other creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, looking at \u00a7 510(b)'s legislative history in the context of securities fraud also supports the idea that subordination is appropriate. Section 510(b) was enacted to \"prevent disappointed shareholders from recovering their investment loss by using fraud and other securities claims to bootstrap their way to parity with general unsecured creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Telegroup, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395524,9391428\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/133/\">\n    281 F.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142 (3d Cir. 2002). Although securities fraud is not an issue in this case, Hall still seeks to elevate his claim to the status of a general unsecured creditor and recover what began with an equity investment. Like the equity holder in\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   , the legislative history of \u00a7 510(b) dictates that Hall cannot attempt to bypass the priority rules for bankruptcy claims by elevating what began as an equity interest to a general unsecured claim even in the absence of securities fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Hall's Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Hall points to a line of cases that purportedly hold that \"claims based on the nonpayment of a debtor's debt obligation issued to repurchase its own stock are not subject to Section 510(b) subordination because such claims are only for the recovery of an unpaid debt.\" (ECF No. 87 at 9). Specifically, the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re Mobile Tool Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   recognized that, when an equity holder exchanged its security for a partial payment and a note, \u00a7 510(b) was inapplicable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267455\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/306/778/#p782\">\n    306 B.R. 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782 (Bankr. Del. 2004). Once the equity was exchanged for notes, the court held the former equity holder's recovery was limited to a definite amount and lost the upside of unlimited recovery, making subordination inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267455\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/306/778/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While this argument comports with Hall's view of the transaction,\n   <em>\n    Mobile Tool\n   </em>\n   is not controlling precedent on this Court. Furthermore, the court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Mobile Tool\n   </em>\n   was limited to only one aspect of \u00a7 510(b)'s purpose-whether the former equity holder could experience greater profits after exchanging it for a note.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267455\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/306/778/#p782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This diverges from the Fifth Circuit's analysis of \u00a7 510(b)'s purpose which held \"the investors\n   <em>\n    initially\n   </em>\n   bargained for the risk and return expectations of investors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re SeaQuest Diving, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n    579 F.3d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (5th Cir. 2009) (emphasis added). The Fifth Circuit emphasized the initial election of the equity holder, pursuing greater return in exchange for lower priority, as a valid reason for subordinating their interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Hall's interest began as Common Stock and rose and fell with the fate of Caprock. (ECF No. 87 at 6). It is this initial election cited in\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   , rather than subsequent events that the Court uses to determine whether subordination is appropriate under \u00a7 510(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hall separately echoes the argument in\n   <em>\n    Mobile Tools\n   </em>\n   , purporting that the lapse of two years between Caprock's repurchase of his Common Stock and its bankruptcy filing support his classification as a general unsecured creditor because his right to share in Caprock's profits was terminated. (ECF No. 87 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   However, Hall's distinction fails to recognize the fact that, up until Caprock made its election, his Common Stock was subject to profit sharing. When purchase of the Common Stock was discussed, Caprock performed a valuation of the company and paid Hall's stock in accordance. (ECF No. 87 at 6). Until the repurchase, Hall's Common Stock was tied to the fate of the company and could have yielded a far higher rate of return than his investment. This separates him from other general unsecured creditors who only expected\n   a fixed rate of return from the beginning of their transactions.\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest Diving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n    579 F.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress did not intend to strictly limit application of \u00a7 510(b) to pre-issuance conduct. Section 510(b) was enacted under the assumption that when making an equity investment, a shareholder assumes the risk that security fraud may occur regardless of whether it occurs pre or post-issuance.\n   <em>\n    In re Telegroup, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395524,9391428\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/133/\">\n    281 F.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 (3d Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Granite Partners, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377728\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/208/332/#p336\">\n    208 B.R. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (Banrk. S.D.N.Y. 1997). The Fifth Circuit adopted this assumption in\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   and declined to draw a distinction between pre and post-issuance conduct interpreting \"arising from\" in \u00a7 510(b).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120617,4054070\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/411/\">\n    579 F.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Caprock's repurchase occurred two years prior to its bankruptcy, that fact is inadequate to confer general unsecured status onto Hall's claim. Accordingly, the distinction Hall seeks to draw based on the timing of this transaction is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The material facts of this case are not in dispute. Caprock elected to repurchase Hall's shares of Common Stock. Under the Fifth Circuit's broad view of \"arising from\" established in\n   <em>\n    SeaQuest\n   </em>\n   , Hall's proof of claim arises from Caprock's purchase of his Common Stock. Accordingly, Hall's claim against Caprock is subject to subordination under \u00a7 510(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court will issue a Judgment consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
