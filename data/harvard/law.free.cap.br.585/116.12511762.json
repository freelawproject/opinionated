R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to dismiss the amended complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") filed by Peter J. Barrett, Trustee for Debtor Chamberlayne Auto Sales &amp; Repair, Inc. (the \"Debtor\"). In the Amended Complaint, Barrett (the \"Trustee\") seeks to avoid and recover certain postpetition transfers made by the Debtor to VAC, to avoid and recover certain prepetition transfers that occurred within ninety days prior to the Debtor's bankruptcy filing, and to be awarded damages for VAC's alleged violation of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trustee argues that VAC's asserted security interests are invalid because VAC entered into an unlawful financing agreement with the Debtor. That agreement required the Debtor to give VAC physical possession of titles to cars the Debtor had purchased for resale. The Trustee's allegation that VAC violated the automatic stay stems from VAC's alleged postpetition collection of funds from the Debtor by illegally refusing to turn over vehicle titles in order to coerce the Debtor into making payments. VAC takes the position that its agreement with the Debtor gave it a valid and enforceable security interest in the Debtor's property and that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because each count relies on the erroneous assumption that its floor planning agreement was unlawful and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 24, 2017, the Debtor filed its voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

On July 16, 2015, the Debtor, a used automobile dealer, and VAC entered\n   into an agreement (the \"Agreement\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereby VAC would finance the acquisition of vehicles purchased by the Debtor for resale. The Agreement, prefaced by a one-page application entitled \"Dealer Floor Plan Agreement,\" includes an 18-page document entitled \"Demand Promissory Note and Security Agreement\" that provides that VAC may advance funds to the Debtor for the purpose of enabling the Debtor to purchase and hold inventory (a term defined as including all vehicles) for resale. The Agreement grants VAC a security interest in the Debtor's inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Appended to the Agreement is a one-page document signed by VAC and the Debtor entitled \"Basic Vehicle Acceptance Corporation Guidelines\" (the \"Guidelines\"). The Guidelines list \"basic rules you should be aware of regarding your Vehicle Acceptance Corporation Floor plan account.\" One of the rules included in the Guidelines and confirmed by the Debtor's signature states the following in bold print: \"All original vehicle title documents will be held by Vehicle Acceptance Corporation.\" The Amended Complaint alleges that the arrangement with VAC required the Debtor to give VAC physical possession of the titles to vehicles purchased by the Debtor, even though VAC was not listed as a lienholder on the title.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the ninety days prior to the January 24, 2017, petition date, the Debtor made payments to VAC in the total amount of $135,769.93. Between January 26, 2017, and February 16, 2017, the Debtor made postpetition payments to VAC totaling $56,701.90. The payments were made so that VAC would release the titles to vehicles the Debtor had sold and were made without the knowledge or consent of the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After the bankruptcy filing, VAC retained possession of titles to several vehicles that had been purchased by the Debtor for resale. The Trustee repeatedly demanded that VAC turn over the titles to those vehicles. The Trustee also demanded that VAC return the postpetition payments it had received from the Debtor. VAC rejected these demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Counsel for Honor Financial, an entity that had purchased the retail installment sales contracts for some of the vehicles sold by the Debtor, contacted the Trustee because the titles held by VAC had not been delivered to the purchasers at the time of sale and, as a result, the Division of Motor Vehicles could not process title documents in the new owners' names and could not record Honor Financial as lienholder. Honor Financial demanded that the Trustee resolve this problem. After the\n   Trustee retained counsel and prepared to initiate legal proceedings, VAC returned some of the titles necessary for Honor Financial to complete the transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although VAC knew, or should have known, that the Debtor had filed bankruptcy, it did not seek relief from the automatic stay and continued to operate as if no order for relief had been entered. VAC collected funds from the Debtor by holding vehicle titles in order to force the Debtor to continue to make payments and as a result, the Trustee and bankruptcy estate incurred damages, including attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, the Trustee asserts that Virginia law prohibits any creditor from taking possession of a title to a vehicle unless the creditor is listed as the lienholder on the title and that VAC's practice of taking physical possession of the titles as a form of security for its loan was illegal. The Trustee does not contend that the Agreement fails to grant VAC a security interest in the Debtor's inventory. Nor does the Trustee assert that VAC's security interest in the Debtor's inventory is avoidable because VAC failed to perfect its lien properly by filing a UCC financing statement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .9A-301.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no dispute that the financing statement was, in fact, properly filed. Rather, the Trustee argues that VAC's otherwise properly perfected security interest is invalid because VAC held the titles to vehicles that the Debtor purchased for resale until after those vehicles were sold to a consumer, a practice the Trustee claims is unlawful. The Trustee asserts no other basis for avoiding or invalidating VAC's lien. Thus, if it is not impermissible for a motor vehicle dealer's floor plan lender to hold the titles to vehicles subject to its lien, the Trustee's declaratory judgment and avoidance counts must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Virginia's motor vehicle laws are contained in Title 46.2 of the Virginia Code. Chapter 15 of Title 46.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2046.2-1500\">\n    Va.

As a motor vehicle dealer operating in Virginia, the Debtor is subject to and governed by the provisions of this Chapter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   One provision included in Chapter 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1542\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   clearly contemplates\n   that there may be situations in which a dealer does not have possession of the certificate of title to a vehicle when the vehicle is delivered to a customer. That section authorizes a dealer to issue temporary license plates and a certificate of origin for the vehicle when the dealer \"is unable at the time of sale to deliver to the purchaser the certificate of title ... because [it] ... is lost or is being detained by another in possession or for any other reason beyond the dealer's control.\" The same provision allows the effectiveness of a temporary registration to be extended beyond the initial 30-day period if the dealer is unable to produce the certificate of title within that time frame.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1542\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C),(D). While neither this provision nor any other statute in Title 46.2 specifically authorizes a floor plan lender to hold vehicle titles (or prohibits the practice), \u00a7 46.2-1542's language is tailored to address circumstances in which the dealer must retrieve a certificate of title from its floor plan lender in order to complete the sale process. If the legislature had intended to require a dealer to deliver the certificate of title to a customer at the time of the vehicle's delivery to the customer, one would question the reason for enacting \u00a7 46.2-1542.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has acknowledged on more than one occasion that under Virginia law a dealer may effectuate a sale without having possession of the certificate of title at the time the vehicle is delivered to the customer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tripp v.

Section 46.2-637 of the Virginia Code, a statute the Trustee claims prohibits the lender from holding titles, states that a security interest in a motor vehicle that is inventory held for sale \"shall be\n   <em>\n    perfected only\n   </em>\n   as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 8.9A-301 through 8.9A-527.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-637\">\n    Va.

Contrary to the Trustee's assertion, this language does not prohibit a floor plan lender from possessing certificates of title; rather, it provides that the lender's lien shall not be\n   <em>\n    perfected\n   </em>\n   unless the lender has complied with Virginia's version of the Uniform Commercial Code, which requires the filing of a financing statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    Va.

In the absence of any specific restrictions otherwise imposed by federal or state law, one may reasonably assume that the lending practices recommended in the OCC's Handbook are generally considered acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The OCC's Handbook states that in a typical floor plan arrangement, the dealer executes a loan agreement granting the bank a continuing security interest in the dealer's inventory, receipts and accounts receivable, and the bank perfects its security interest pursuant to article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When discussing the risks associated with floor plan lending, the OCC emphasizes the need for the bank to maintain an effective risk management system, since a lender who is unable to exercise full control over the inventory may find itself in a \"sold-out-of-trust position.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The OCC offers a comprehensive list of steps a lender should take to protect itself from a loss, including monitoring the dealer's inventory and conducting regular inspections. \"[F]loor plan lenders should regularly inspect and verify the inventory,\n   <em>\n    take control of title documents\n   </em>\n   , and, if necessary, take physical control of the inventory....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208\">\n    at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears that in the view of the OCC, a prudent floor plan\n   lender may hold the title documents to its collateral even when perfection of its security interest requires the filing of a financing statement. This may help explain the Trustee's inability to point to any statutes or regulations prohibiting the practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As previously observed, Virginia's motor vehicle titling laws, including those cited by the Trustee, were enacted to protect innocent parties. Allowing a floor plan lender to hold certificates of titles does not thwart this legislative intent. While a floor plan lender may potentially reduce its risk of loss by controlling title documents, the practice does not eliminate the possibility that its collateral may be subject to the superior claim of a dealer's customer or the customer's lender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A case decided by a district court in the Southern District of Texas, involving a factual scenario similar to the case before this Court, found that a \"buyer in the ordinary course of business\" has superior rights over the floor plan lender, despite the lender's having retained possession of the certificate of title, when the proceeds of sale were not passed on by the dealer to the lender.\n   <em>\n    Lundy v.

The Trustee has not cited, nor has the Court found, any statute or regulation prohibiting the practice. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Trustee's contention that the practice violates Virginia's motor vehicle titling laws. Therefore, the Court need not address the Trustee's further argument that the Agreement constitutes an unlawful, unenforceable contract. For these reasons, the Court will dismiss the Trustee's declaratory judgment and avoidance counts (Counts I, II and IV) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Count III of the Amended Complaint seeks relief for VAC's violation of the automatic stay.

Notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-617 and 46.2-628, whenever a dealer licensed by the Board sells or conditionally sells and delivers to a purchaser a motor vehicle, the dealer may issue temporary license plates and a certificate of temporary registration. The temporary license plates and the certificates for temporary registration shall be obtained from the Commissioner or may be printed according to terms set by the Commissioner and may be issued if (i) the dealer has the title or the certificate of origin for the vehicle or (ii) is unable at the time of the sale to deliver to the purchaser the certificate of title or certificate of origin for the vehicle because the certificate of title or certificate of origin is lost or is being detained by another in possession or for any other reason beyond the dealer's control. The temporary registration certificate shall bear its date of issuance, the name and address of the purchaser, the identification number of the vehicle, the registration number to be used temporarily on the vehicle, the name of the state in which the vehicle is to be registered, the name and address of the person from whom the dealer acquired the vehicle, and whatever other information may be required by the Commissioner. A copy of the temporary registration certificate and a bona fide buyer's order shall be delivered to the purchaser and shall be in the possession of the purchaser at all times when operating the vehicle. One copy of the certificate shall be retained by the dealer, which copy may be retained in electronic format under terms set by the Commissioner, and shall be subject to inspection at any time by the Department's agents. The original of the certificate shall be forwarded by the dealer to the Department directly on issuance to the purchaser if the vehicle is to be titled outside the Commonwealth, along with the physical or electronic application for title. The issuance of a temporary certificate of registration to a purchaser pursuant to this section shall have the effect of vesting sufficient interest in the vehicle in the purchaser for the period that the certificate remains effective for purposes of allowing the purchaser (a) to obtain and provide insurance coverage for the vehicle, including insurance indemnifying the purchaser against liability or providing for recovery for damage to or loss of the vehicle and (b) to operate the vehicle as if the purchaser had full rights of ownership, all subject to cancellation by applicable law or agreement between the dealer and the purchaser prior to the time the dealer submits an application for title along with all required fees. If the dealer or purchaser exercises the statutory or contractual rights to cancel a purchaser's contract to buy a vehicle before application for title to the vehicle has been submitted to the Department in the name of the purchaser, the dealer shall have the right to possession of the vehicle without claim of possession by the purchaser within 24 hours of written or oral notice to the purchaser and without regard to the provision of Title 8.9A, provided the dealer's right to possession is enforced otherwise in accordance with law and without breach of the peace. In the event the dealer regains possession of the vehicle, in the same condition, normal wear and tear excepted, as delivered to the purchaser, the purchaser shall have the right to possession of any trade-in and return of any down payment, and if the dealer fails to return the trade-in and/or down payment the dealer may be held liable under \u00a7 59.1-200 of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (\u00a7 59.1-196), in addition to any other rights and remedies available by statute or contract.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    B.

Under Virginia law, a dealer is exempted from the \u00a7 46.2-628 requirement to deliver the title certificate at the time of delivering the motor vehicle by the provisions of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1542\">\n     Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-1542\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (A). Interestingly, the Agreement provides that it will be construed under Texas law, although neither party has argued that Texas law should be applied to this case. Nevertheless, given the similarity between the motor vehicle titling laws, the Court's ruling would be the same were it to apply Texas law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Dota\n    </em>\n    , a floor plan lender argued that the buyer's failure to comply with the provision in COTA requiring a transfer of a vehicle's certificate of title at the time of sale (similar to what the Trustee contends is required under Virginia law) negated his \"buyer in the ordinary course\" assertion. The court rejected this argument, noting the intent of the Texas legislature to exclude motor vehicle dealers from this requirement. \"[T]he Bank's assertion that [the buyer] should have received the certificate of title to the Silverado at the time of sale misstates the COTA's requirements for transfer of a certificate of title pursuant to a subsequent sale by a licensed Texas dealer....\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1542\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1542\">\n     at 461\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Likewise, the Trustee's reliance on certain Virginia statutes for his argument that a dealer is required to deliver the certificate of title to the buyer simultaneously with the delivery of the vehicle is misplaced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    It is worth noting that while the specific issue was not raised, the court in\n    <em>\n     Dota\n    </em>\n    did not question the validity of the floor plan lender's loan agreement that required the dealer to arrange for the release of the original title from the Bank for each vehicle sold. As in the present case, the lender was not shown as lienholder on the title. In\n    <em>\n     Dota\n    </em>\n    , the dealer failed to apply the proceeds of the sale to the loan and failed to request or arrange for the Bank to release the title before filing bankruptcy. Having determined that the buyer was \"a buyer in the ordinary course of business,\" the court refused to order him to deliver the vehicle to the Bank.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gen.

Once again, the Trustee has disregarded a provision of Virginia's motor vehicle laws applicable to dealers.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2046.2-1532\">\n     Va.

Moreover, the Trustee's assertion that in the absence of actual fraud, disclosing mileage at the time of delivery of the vehicle on a separate form rather than on the title violates the Federal Odometer Act has been rejected at least twice by the District Court for the Western District of Virginia.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mayberry v.
