No. 91]; the Chapter 13 Trustee Jose R. Carrion's (hereinafter the \"Trustee\")\n   <em>\n    Trustee's Opposition to Motion to Alter or Amend Order Granting Trustee's Objection to Debtor's Claim of Exemptions\n   </em>\n   [Dkt.

No. 89], sustaining Trustee's objection to Debtor's exemption over a lump sum payment received post-petition, post-confirmation for the Debtor's accumulated but unused sick leave. Section 522(d)(5)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   states that debtors may exempt \"$1,250 plus up to $11,850 of any unused amount of the [homestead] exemption\" \"in any property\".\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5). The Trustee argued that exemptions can only be taken over property described in section 541, while Debtor argued that section 522 is also applicable to property of the estate acquired under section 1306. Upon consideration of the parties' arguments and the record, for the reasons set forth below, the court concludes that the Trustee failed to sustain his burden in objecting to the exemption and therefore, GRANTS Debtor's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Alter or Amend Order Granting Trustee's Objection to Debtor's Claim of Exemptions\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. No. 91].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2014, Debtor, a government employee, filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy\n   protection. Along with the necessary documents and schedules Debtor, on her Schedule B, listed $766.00 held in a bank account as personal property. On her Schedule C, Debtor exempted the bank account balance of $766.00 under section 522(d)(5). Debtor did not claim a homestead exemption. Furthermore, Debtor did not list the accumulated but unused sick leave hours held with her employer, the Puerto Rico Department of Education (hereinafter the \"Dep't of Educ.\"), as an asset. On December 9, 2015, Debtor's chapter 13 Plan was confirmed. [Dkt. No. 50]. As of the date of this Opinion &amp; Order, the case has not been closed, dismissed, or converted. The plan stated that the property of the estate would vest in the Debtor upon discharge or conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 6, 2016, the Puerto Rico Government Employees Association (\"AEELA\") filed a motion informing that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%203%2C%20%C2%A7%20862\">\n    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, \u00a7 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq., it had a statutory lien over Debtor's 83 days and 52 minutes of accumulated sick leave license with the Dep't of Educ. for an estimated value of $13,144.20. AEELA, furthermore requested, and the court authorized, the Dep't of Educ. to transfer $1,507.53 in full payment of AEELA's claim. [Dkt's. No. 57 &amp; 62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 13, 2016, in response to AEELA's motion, the Trustee filed a motion requesting the court to \"...order Debtor to, within 14 days, amend Schedules I and J to reflect her new economic situation and inform whether she has received the $11,636.67...and, if so, to inform why it was not submitted to the Trustee to increase the base of the plan\". [Dkt. No. 58]. On October 15, 2016, the Debtor amended item 35 of Schedule B (\"Other personal property of any kind not listed\") for the amount of $11,636.67, and in her amended Schedule C claimed the amount as exempt under section 522(d)(5). [Dkt. No. 60]. In a series of motions that followed, the Trustee requested that the remainder of the funds be sent to him for distribution under the plan, and objected to Debtor's exemption claim. The Trustee contends that section 522 is not applicable to property acquired pursuant to section 1306. The Debtor replied to these objections. [Dkts. No. 58, 61, 66, 70, 76, 86]. On August 18, 2017, the court entered an Order (the \"Exemption Order\") granting Trustee's objection and ordering the Debtor to submit the funds to the Trustee for distribution to the general unsecured creditors. [Dkt. No. 89].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, Debtor filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Alter or Amend Order Granting Trustee's Objection to Debtor's Claim of Exemptions\n   </em>\n   , now under consideration, contending the court erred by granting Trustee's objection. The reconsideration is premised on the argument that Trustee did not meet the burden of persuasion required by Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 4003(c) since exemptions under section 522(d)(5) can be taken over any property of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In deciding Debtor's motion, the court must address the following issues: (1) whether the Debtor's motion to alter or amend meets the legal requirements for reconsideration under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) ; (2) whether unused sick leave accumulated prepetition and unused sick leave accumulated post-petition are property of the bankruptcy estate; (3) whether a chapter 13 debtor may amend its schedules to claim an exemption over property not initially included in Schedule B, and (4) whether Trustee's objection met Bankruptcy Rule 4003(c)'s burden of persuasion requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Consequently, the courts that have addressed the issue after \u00a7 541's enactment have held that a debtor's unliquidated accrued leave is property of the bankruptcy estate. As such, the Debtor clearly had a property interest in his pre-petition accumulated leave as of the petition date. Thus, the fact that the Debtor's pre-petition accumulated leave was not a tangible, liquidated asset (i.e. reduced to a lump sum payment) as of the petition date is of no consequence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Fonseca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361567\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/542/628/\">\n    542 B.R. at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court finds persuasive the findings and conclusions of law as stated in\n   <em>\n    Fonseca\n   </em>\n   and applies them to the instant case.

Justice Scalia, writing for a unanimous court, provided a detailed examination of section 522. The court stated that section 522 : \"...sets forth a number of carefully calibrated exceptions and limitations\"; \"...exhaustively specifies the criteria that will render property exempt...\"; and \"...does not give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions based on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1196-97. The court concluded by stating that \"...\n   <em>\n    federal law\n   </em>\n   provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on this statutory framework and the case law regarding exemptions, the court concludes that the Debtor in this case may amend her schedules and exempt the proceeds of her unused but accumulated sick leave from property of the estate under \u00a7 522(d)(5). Although Trustee argues that debtors are barred\n   from claiming exemptions in property acquired post-petition because the introductory language of \u00a7 522(b)(1) only references \u00a7 541, and not the other bankruptcy types, Trustee's arguments and interpretation of the law are flawed.

Therefore, Trustee concludes that section 522 should be interpreted as \"...limiting the application of exemptions to property of the estate as defined under \u00a7 541.\" [Dkt. 101 at pg. 9.] Besides Trustee's own interpretation, three cases were cited in support of his conclusion.

And, finally, whether \u00a7 522 references \u00a7 1306 or not, has little, if anything, to do with chapter 13 debtors' ability to claim exemptions on property acquired post-petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A proper analysis of the functions of sections 541 and 522 reveals that the Code allows debtors to either\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   a property interest from the estate pursuant to sections 541 or to\n   <em>\n    exempt\n   </em>\n   it under section 522. In addition, a reading of section 522 reveals that the Code allows debtors to utilize recognized federal or state exemptions to withdraw interests from \"property of the estate\"\n   <em>\n    despite\n   </em>\n   the properties' kind's inclusion in the estate.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Cutignola\n   </em>\n   , 450 B.R. at 448. (Thus, Congress first dictated what would constitute \"property of the estate\" in general terms and only afterwards in accordance with specific types of bankruptcies. The latter specification, however, is in addition to the contents specified in section 541 and not to their exclusion or in spite of them. As the Debtor in this case pointed out in her initial response to Trustee's objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   With Section 541, Congress established a general definition for bankruptcy estates. With Section 1306, it then expanded on that definition specifically for purposes of Chapter 13 cases.

Section 541, by contrast, is a general provision that provides generic contours for bankruptcy estates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Carroll v.

Notably, Congress placed \u00a7 522 in 'Chapter Five of the Title XI'. The unambiguous text of \u00a7 103(a) states that \"...chapters 1, 3, and 5 of [the Bankruptcy Code] apply in a case under chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of this title....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11125565\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/258/286/#p290\">\n    258 B.R. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2001) (noting that Congress decided to include section 522\"...in Chapter Five of the Code, entitled 'Creditors, Debtors, and the Estate,' instead of placing a separate exemption provision in each chapter.\") This placement reveals what Judge Morris from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York described as the superiority of section 522 over the other sections of the Code: \"The superiority of \u00a7 522(b)(1), the right to exempt property, extends to all subsections of the Bankruptcy Code....\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cutignola\n   </em>\n   , 450 B.R. at 448. This interpretation is also consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Schwab\n   </em>\n   where it stated that \"[w]hen a debtor files [a] bankruptcy petition, all of the debtor's assets become property of the bankruptcy estate ...\n   <em>\n    subject\n   </em>\n   to the debtor's right to reclaim certain property as exempt....\"\n   <em>\n    Schwab\n   </em>\n   , 560 U.S. at 774,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454871,3641718,3815847\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2652/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted). The legal conclusion Trustee advances is in direct contradiction to section 103(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, even assuming that Trustee's interpretation of sections 522, 541 and 1306 is correct, this court declines the invitation to adopt his reasoning because it is contrary to the Code's fresh start principle, creates an exception to the application of section 522 where there is none, and would result in discrimination against debtors whose right to claim an exemption came into existence post-petition. The court finds persuasive the view that \"Congress balanced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors, and it is not for [courts] to alter this balance ....\"\n   <em>\n    Schwab\n   </em>\n   , 560 U.S. at 791-92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454871,3641718,3815847\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2652/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be strange, indeed, to allow debtors to amend their schedules at any point before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted, but to prevent them from exempting post-petition acquired property on a ground not specified in the Code. Restricting debtors from exhausting congressionally determined exemption values seems contrary to the Code's fresh start principle and should be avoided whenever possible. The court, therefore, concludes that debtors with unused exemptions may exhaust them through amendments whenever they come into possession of property that may be exempt. Trustee's arguments for abandoning this interpretation are unpersuasive. As the Debtor pointed out in her initial reply to Trustee's objection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   There is nothing in the language of \u00a7\u00a7 1306 or 541 to suggest that Congress intended to limit an individual's exemptions to only that property of the estate owned at the commencement of the case and to deny the debtor the opportunity to assert any remaining allowed exemptions in property of the estate acquired after the bankruptcy filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    In re Walley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347011\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/525/320/#p323\">\n    525 B.R. 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (Bankr.

However, on appeal, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit ruled that long established Supreme Court precedent holds that \"...tax refunds arising from pre-petition earnings or losses are generally considered property of the estate under \u00a7 541, as they are sufficiently rooted in the bankruptcy past and do not relate conceptually to future wages and it is not the equivalent of future wages.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   , 478 B.R. at 512.

The Bankruptcy Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   , furthermore, did not provide any reasoning for sustaining the inapplicability of section 522 to post-petition property other than the reference argument already discussed and this court does not find it instructive on the issues raised in this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The more reasoned approach to exemptions over property acquired post-petition in chapter 13 bankruptcies is that \"[t]he plain language of the Bankruptcy Code and Rules clearly indicate that the estate's right to property acquired post-petition is subject to the debtor's rights to exemptions....\" and not the other way around as Trustee suggests.\n   <em>\n    In re Cutignola\n   </em>\n   , 450 B.R. at 449.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Trustee's objection did not meet Rule 4003(c)'s burden of persuasion requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As noted in\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   , it is within the debtor's discretion to claim an exemption. \"A debtor need not invoke an exemption to which the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court may not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid statutory basis for doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825872,12701998\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1188/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Bankruptcy Rules allow debtors to amend their schedules as a matter of course before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In this case, the evidence established that Debtor did not claim a homestead exemption, and had available an unused portion of section 522's wild card exemption worth $12,324.00. On October 6, 2016, AEELA notified the court that it had a statutory lien over Debtor's 83 days and 52 minutes of accumulated sick leave and requested a transfer from the Dep't of Educ. On October 15, 2016, Debtor filed an\n   <em>\n    Informative Motion (Amended Schedules)\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. No. 60] notifying she was amending Schedules B and C of her bankruptcy petition to reflect and claim as exempt the proceeds of her accumulated sick leave in the amount of $11,636.67 under section 522(d)(5). The court's order granting AEELA's request was entered on November 3, 2016. [Dkt. No. 62.] On September 15, 2017, Debtor filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion Submitting Documents\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. No. 95] showing it had received a check in the amount of $10,312.82 from the Dep't of Educ. for her accumulated sick leave and amending Schedule B to reflect the new amount. [Dkt's No. 95 &amp; 96.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While the final value of the accrued sick leave remained speculative until her termination, Debtor had a property interest in\n   the accrued sick leave benefits on the date of her bankruptcy filing sufficient to bring them into her bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 541. The post-petition portion of Debtor's sick leave accrued under the expanded temporal definition of the estate under section 1306 and is, therefore, also property of the estate. The Rules allow debtors to amend their schedules as a matter of course. Debtor did just that. Under Rule 1009(a) she amended her schedules and withdrew $10,312.82 of her aggregate interest in her accumulated but unused sick leave hours from the estate. This placed Debtor on equal footing with other debtor homeowners. The same result would have been reached had she claimed the exemption upon filing. Unsecured creditors would not have received any amounts from the Debtor's accrued sick leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The chapter 13 Trustee filed a timely objection and bore the burden of showing that the exemption claimed in Debtor's Amended Schedule C was improper. Trustee's argument, however, was premised on the notion that the proceeds of Debtor's accrued sick leave were part of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to \u00a7 1306 and that \"...the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) specifically excludes from exemption property of the estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201306\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" [Dkt. No. 101 at pg. 4-5.] Those arguments were already discussed and are unavailing since under section 103, section 522 is of general applicability to all other chapters. Finally, the Trustee failed to specify any section of the Code that limits exemptions to property debtors own as of the commencement of the case. The Supreme Court was clear in\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   : \"...\n   <em>\n    federal law\n   </em>\n   provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemption on a ground not specified in the Code ....\"\n   <em>\n    Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825872,12701998\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1188/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1196-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, Debtor held a pre-petition property interest in her accumulated but unused sick leave sufficient to bring it within the scope of \u00a7 541. The hours accumulated post-petition constitute earnings or income of the Debtor and property of the estate pursuant to section 1306. Furthermore, \u00a7 522, being a section of general applicability, applies to all property of the estate, including property acquired post-petition. The Debtor in this case had not exhausted her wild card exemption and properly amended her schedules as permitted under Rule 1009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Upon reconsideration of the materials submitted and the parties arguments and claims, the court concludes that Trustee's objection did not meet the standard of Bankruptcy Rules 4003(c).
