INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The matter before the Court for determination is the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Maasai Holdings, LLC (\"Maasai\"). In connection with the motion, the Court must determine an issue of law as to whether Maasai's prepetition lien extends to any recoveries obtained by Stewart Grossman, the Chapter 7 Trustee (the \"Trustee\" or the \"Plaintiff\"), of the estate of Connolly Geaney Ablitt &amp; Willard, P.C. (the \"Debtor\"). The Plaintiff sets forth four counts in his Complaint, namely Count I under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) through which he seeks avoidance of transfers and the entry of a judgment against Durham Commercial Capital Corp. (\"Durham\") and Maasai with respect to \"Unfactored Collections, Cash Transfer and Assigned Accounts,\" less the \"Rebate,\" defined in the Complaint, in the amount of $1,057,137.75; Count II under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20109%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 6 through which he seeks avoidance of transfers and the entry of a judgment against Durham and Maasai with respect to \"Unfactored Collections, Cash Transfer and Assigned Accounts,\" less the \"Rebate,\" defined in the Complaint, in the amount of $1,057,137.75; Count III under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through which he seeks entry of judgment against Durham and Maasai, as initial transferees of \"Unfactored Collections, Cash Transfer and Assigned Accounts\" in the amount of $1,057,137.75 against Durham and in the amount of $1,024,799.48 against Maasai; and Count IV under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11 through which he seeks the entry of judgment against Durham and Maasai in an amount no less than $1,057,137.75, trebled, plus interest from the date the \"DCR Transfers,\" as defined in the Complaint, were made, and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 22, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Count V of his Complaint for Equitable Subordination against Maasai. The Court granted the motion on February 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issues presented by the Motion for Summary Judgment are whether there are material facts in dispute, and, in particular, whether Maasai's prepetition lien attaches to avoidance power recoveries or to any recovery by the Trustee with respect to his claim under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court heard the summary judgment motion on February 27, 2018. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court directed Maasai to file a supplemental brief regarding the avoidance power recovery issue by March 9, 2018 and the Plaintiff to file a response by March 16, 2018. After obtaining\n   a brief extension of time to file briefs, both parties complied with this Court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court shall enter an order denying Maasai's Motion for Summary Judgment as the Court concludes there are material facts in dispute. In addition, the Court rejects Maasai's contention that the Trustee's pursuit of fraudulent transfer causes of action against it and Durham are an exercise in futility because the receivables the Debtor allegedly transferred and which the Trustee seeks to recover would be paid, if recovered, to Maasai in partial satisfaction of its prepetition secured claim. The Court concludes, as the Trustee argued, that Maasai's prepetition lien does not attach to avoidance power recoveries or to any recovery under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For purposes of resolving the issue identified above, the Court accepts Maasai's statement of undisputed facts gleaned from the Plaintiff's Complaint which it set forth in its Supplemental Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. In his Response to Maasai's brief, the Trustee did not dispute the facts set forth in Maasai's supplemental brief. The Court paraphrases those facts below. That said, Maasai also references facts in its brief that it only mentioned in passing in its initial submissions in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, in particular, a mortgage securing an obligation that was not owed by the Debtor that was referenced in an Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement, the interpretation of which the parties dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or about December 21, 2007 Ablitt &amp; Charlton P.C. (a predecessor to the Debtor) executed and delivered to Sovereign Bank a certain promissory note (the \"Note\" or the \"DCR Note\") in the principal amount of $1,500,000.00. In connection with the transaction, the Debtor pledged as collateral, inter alia, all of the Debtor's present and future accounts receivable. On or about September 14, 2010, Sovereign Bank, as the seller, and DCR Mortgage IV Sub I, LLC (\"DCR Sub I\"), as the purchaser, entered into an Asset Sale Agreement, whereby DCR Sub I purchased all of Sovereign Bank's right, title, and interest in outstanding obligations owed by the Debtor. On or about January 28, 2013, DCR Sub I, as the assignor, and DCR Mortgage IV Sub III, LLC (\"DCR Sub III\"), as the assignee, entered into an \"Assignment of Loan Documents and Assumption Agreement,\" whereby DCR Sub I assigned to DCR Sub III all of DCR Sub I's right, title, and interest in outstanding obligations owing by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about February 7, 2013, DCR Sub III (\"DCR\"), as the seller, and Maasai as the purchaser, entered into a Loan Sale Contract, whereby DCR sold to Maasai all of its rights, title, and interest in outstanding obligations owing by the Debtor under the various loan documents (the \"Loan Documents\"). The loan was secured by a first position lien covering all assets of the Debtor pursuant to UCC-1 Financing Statement # 200705764210 recorded December 21, 2007 and assigned to Maasai by UCC-3 # 201312192320; and UCC-1 Financing Statement # 201110049970 recorded June 21, 2011 and assigned to Maasai by UCC-3 # 201312192230. The collateral securing the debt expressly included all \"General Intangibles,\" \"including, without limitation, all choses in action, causes of\n   action,\" and \"[a]ll products and proceeds of the foregoing ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Maasai also sets forth in its brief the following: 1) the Debtor was in default of its obligations to its secured lenders and had absolutely no ability to obtain financing from any source; 2) the Debtor's secured lender had accelerated both the $1.5 million revolving credit facility debt and a $4 million mortgage obligation, each of which were cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized; 3) Maasai stepped in to purchase or resolve these debts in default as part of the Note purchased from DCR and \"[t]hereafter, in addition to access to $3 million in new capital and a two-year debt forbearance on the $1.5 million the Note, the Debtor was also relieved of a $4 million guaranty obligation secured by a lien on all of the Debtor's assets\" pursuant to an Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement. Maasai explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee challenged the value of the mortgage release because the mortgage was not in the Debtor's name but rather in an entity wholly-owned by Debtor principal Steven Ablitt (\"Ablitt\"), SAA Group, LLC (\"SAA\"). However, the Debtor had guaranteed SAA's mortgage obligation and pledged all of its assets as collateral. The Debtor's assets were relieved of the $4 million guaranty in connection with Maasai's debt purchase. Thus $5.5 million in debt was lifted off the Debtor's receivables so it could use these receivables for working capital. Even assuming the facts as alleged, the Debtor received at least reasonably equivalent value for the transfers at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Further the Trustee admits in his complaint that the Debtor transferred accounts receivable to Durham, not cash. Without the release of security in the amount of $5.5 million Debtor would never have been able to transfer the receivables in the first place. All of the receivables transferred to Durham were subject to DCR's first lien at the time of transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Maasai, the revolving line of credit amount under the loan agreement was $1,493,612.61, plus an additional $263,964.82 disbursed at closing, for a total loan amount of $1,757,577.43. It adds that additional sums were then disbursed to the Debtor. For example, according to Maasai, Durham advanced: $1,215,185.47 to the Debtors in February 2013;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   $659,543.18 in March 2013; $877,217.30 in April 2013; and\n   $1,057,003.11 in May 2013. Maasai maintains that these advances continued through June of 2014. It further states that as a result of the Debtor's breach of the Loan Documents, it became entitled to collect from the Debtor's clients all monies owing to the Debtor for provision of legal services. It contends that the total amount due to it under Loan Documents as of the date the Debtor commenced its bankruptcy case was $3,006,493.72, together with such interest, fees and costs that continue to accrue after the petition date as allowable under applicable law and the Loan Documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Maasai\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Maasai maintains that it is not disputed that all of the receivables allegedly fraudulently transferred by the Debtor to Durham and/or Maasai were subject to DCR's lien at the time of transfer and that Maasai holds a valid, perfected security interest in all of the Debtor's assets as successor to DCR. That security interest, it contends, expressly includes a lien on \"causes of action\" and all \"products and proceeds\" thereof. Thus, it asserts the only issue is whether that prepetition lien attaches to any recovery the Trustee might realize under his fraudulent transfer causes of action or cause of action under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Maasai references\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) which provides, as a general rule, that property acquired by the estate or by the debtor postpetition is not subject to a prepetition lien, except as provided in \u00a7 522(b) which allows prepetition security interests to attach to postpetition property if the collateral which produces the proceeds was acquired by the debtor prior to the commencement of the case. It adds, citing, inter alia,\n   <em>\n    Butner v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    440 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    99 S.Ct. 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179364\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/48/#p55\">\n    59 L.Ed.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), that whether a creditor has a security interest in the proceeds depends upon state law. Recognizing what it contends is a split of authority, it maintains that the \"better reasoned\" decisions support its position. Because it has a valid lien encompassing causes of action and their proceeds, it argues, citing\n   <em>\n    Barber v. McCord Auto Supply (In re Pearson Indus.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6112018\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/178/753/\">\n    178 B.R. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 1995), and\n   <em>\n    In re Figearo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6543250\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/79/914/\">\n    79 B.R. 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Nev. 1987), that \"[t]here is no rational basis to cut off the application of those lien rights to the Trustee's causes of action or their proceeds.\" Maasai concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee should not be able to get around the enforceability of Maasai's lien simply because the causes of action have been brought post-petition. The causes of action and their potential proceeds are not postpetition assets under \u00a7 552. They continue to be Maasai's collateral, subject to its perfected lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly, allowing this litigation to continue is pointless because any recovery the Trustee might realize from the litigation would have to be paid to Maasai in partial satisfaction of its secured claim. The lawsuit should be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Maasai also argues in its brief that the Trustee cannot succeed in proving that the Debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers. It contends that the Debtor received two components of value, even assuming the Debtor \"paid\" for the debt purchase as alleged by the Trustee in his Complaint, namely 1) the Debtor had a $1.5 million secured debt that was in default, accelerated and cross-defaulted, which was effectively \"taken off its books\" by the Forbearance Agreement with Maasai, because the Debtor was relieved of the immediate obligation to satisfy that debt in default, thereafter enjoying a two-year breathing spell under the Forbearance Agreement that effectively became\n   permanent when the Debtor failed to satisfy any of the obligations to Maasai under the DCR Note and filed for bankruptcy protection; and 2) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement between and among SAA Group, LLC, a related entity controlled by Steven A. Ablitt that owned the Debtor's office space; the Debtor; Steven A. Ablitt; and DCR, which agreement was entered into in connection with the Maasai's purchase of the DCR Note, \"the seller [i.e., DCR] expressly agreed to release a $4 million-dollar mortgage obligation against SAA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Plaintiff contends that Maasai \"disregards all contemporary legal authority holding that a prepetition lien does not attach to avoidance recoveries, instead relying entirely on outdated and discredited decisional authority.\" He contends that, not only does Maasai's lien not attach to avoidance power recoveries, it also does not attach to any recoveries under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Relying upon\n   <em>\n    Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. UMB Bank, N.A. (In re Residential Capital, LLC)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202783\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/403/#p414\">\n    497 B.R. 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414-15 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2013), the Plaintiff maintains that it is \"well-settled\" that an all-asset prepetition lien does not attach to a bankruptcy trustee's recoveries obtained through the exercise his or her avoidance powers. The Trustee explains that, except as provided in \u00a7 552(b), \u00a7 552(a) provides that property acquired postpetition is not subject to a prepetition lien. Subsection (b), however, limits its scope to postpetition proceeds of the debtor's prepetition property, and expressly excepts the exercise of the trustee's avoidance powers under \u00a7 544. He argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Fraudulent transfer recoveries do not fall within the scope of Section 552(b) for two principal reasons.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]voidance actions, including those arising under state law, can only be brought by the trustee after the petition is filed under the trustee's section [544(b) ] rights.

The recitals and terms of the Forbearance Agreement make clear that the Debtor had indeed guaranteed the $4 million mortgage and, through cross-collateralization agreements, had secured that guaranty with an all asset security interest. Thus, prior to February 7, 2013, DCR had a security interest in the Debtor's assets to secure both (i) the $1.5 million line of credit note (the so-called \"DCR Note\" of which the Debtor was the primary obligor) and (ii) the Debtor's guaranty of the $4 million real estate mortgage (of which the Debtor's affiliate, SAA Group, LLC, was the primary obligor and mortgagor).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Forbearance Agreement however makes clear that the Debtor is not released of its guaranty obligation; instead, the guaranty obligation is merely converted from a secured guaranty to an unsecured guaranty. Forbearance Agreement, Par. 10. The Debtor is still independently liable for all real estate mortgage obligations. Indeed, the Forbearance Agreement expressly provides that \"[the Debtor] hereby reaffirms the full force and effectiveness of the AB Guaranty and acknowledges that the AB Guaranty continues to guaranty all SAA Obligations ..., and that [the Debtor]'s obligations under the AB Guaranty are separate and distinct from those of SAA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202783\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/403/#p414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202783\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/403/#p414\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Par. 22. Thus, the Debtor was not released from its guaranty obligations as Maasai had asserted in its Reply; therefore, the major premise for Maasai's claim that the Debtor received a $4 million benefit from the transfers is false, and Maasai's new argument fails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Plaintiff also rejects Maasai's \"access to capital\" argument, stating because the Debtor's accounts remained collateral for the $1.5 million DCR Note purchased by Maasai, the Debtor's sole access to capital was through Durham and under the Factoring Agreement, the Debtor already paid an upfront origination fee and had to pay a fee for each factored receivable. Thus, according to the Plaintiff, even if Durham subsequently provided $3 million in capital to the Debtor as Durham alleges, each subsequent advance made to the Debtor was made specifically in exchange for invoices worth more than the advance exactly as contemplated by the Factoring Agreement. The Plaintiff concludes that Maasai was unable to assign a monetary value to the benefit of purchasing receivables on a case-by-case basis, rejecting any notion that Durham provided $3 million of capital in exchange for the sum of $1,024,799.18, the amount of the constructive fraudulent transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The discrete rights dealt with relative to the interaction between avoidance claims and \u00a7 552 are the:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   1. Right to the avoidance claim asserted by the bankruptcy trustee,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   2. Rights to the property subject to the avoidance claim, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   3. Rights to the proceeds of the avoidance claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Most, if not all, courts agree that that a secured creditor who holds a security interest in property that is subject to avoidance by a trustee action has no interest in the trustee's avoidance claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Many courts stop the analysis and [sic] this point and hold that if the creditor lacks an interest in the avoidance claim, then it also lacks an interest in the proceeds attributable to the property in which it held a security interest. A standard bankruptcy treatise [\n   <em>\n    Colliers\n   </em>\n   ] has also taken this position, stating that since the fraudulent transfer and anti-preference claims are for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate \"it is difficult to see how such recoveries can be other than \"after acquired property\" within the meaning of section 552(a), rather than proceeds of prepetition collateral under section 552(b)(1).\" This language has been quoted in cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Other courts distinguish between the right to the bankruptcy trustee's avoidance claim and a lien that attaches to the collateral and the proceeds thereof, in the form of a settlement agreement or otherwise. These courts hold that the \"proceeds\" of the avoidance claim relative to recovering property remains subject to the pre-petition security interest thereon, even though that creditor has\n   no right to claim itself. Still other courts interpret the \u00a7 552(b) phrase \"Except as provided in section ... 547\" to mean that the security interest is subject to avoidance if it is obtained during the anti-preference period, i.e., generally 90 days; it does not mean \"that a prepetition security interest may never extend to property which is acquired post-petition through a [ 11 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 547 preference action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   There is some controversy relative to whether an avoidance claim can be brought with respect to property that is fully encumbered, since the recovery may only benefit the secured creditor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Peter Spero, Fraudulent Transfers, Prebankruptcy Planning and Exemptions, Fraudulent Transfers-Creditor Remedies, \u00a7 3:37.96\n   <em>\n    Treatment of avoidance of property subject to security agreement covering after acquired property, e.g., a floating lien,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 552\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , Avoidance claims as proceeds under \u00a7 552(b),\n   </em>\n   (West 2017) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   1.

In particular, the Court finds persuasive the reasoning of the decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Residential Capital LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202783\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/497/403/#p414\">\n    497 B.R. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the New York bankruptcy court, relying, in part, upon\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 552.02, observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Avoidance actions, including those arising under state law, can only be brought by the trustee after the petition is filed under the trustee's section ...

Further, because the Debtor does not own the right to pursue a fraudulent transfer action in bankruptcy (since that action belongs to the trustee post-petition under section ...

Gen. Laws ch. 93A. In the first place, Count IV of the Plaintiff's Complaint is a commercial tort claim as the Plaintiff alleges tortious conduct in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. For example, in \u00b6 46 of his Complaint, the Plaintiff alleges the following misconduct on the part of the Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Durham had no intention of canceling the DCR Note, but rather using the first lien position of the DCR Note to assert claims against the Debtor and to represent to other creditors, including, without limitation, LPS, that it held a senior secured position on the Debtor's accounts\n   receivable. More specifically, Durham and Maasai attempted to dissuade ServiceLink from exercising its rights as a secured party by intentionally and falsely representing to ServiceLink that, in connection with the Factoring Agreement, Durham was acting only as agent for Maasai, and that Maasai's secured position was perfected by the same financing statement that had perfected the DCR Security Interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   According to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Under Massachusetts law, commercial tort claims must be described with specificity in a security agreement in order to be considered part of that agreement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20106%2C%20%C2%A7%209-108\">\n    Mass.

Although Maasai attached the Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement to its Supplemental Memorandum of Law, the mortgage was not submitted as part of the record. Moreover, as correctly noted by the Plaintiff, although the Debtor's guaranty was no longer secured, it was not extinguished. Therefore, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material fact surrounding the transaction that warrant denial of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
