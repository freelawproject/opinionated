Connelly, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the Court on cross motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff Dulles Electric &amp; Supply Corporation (\"Dulles Electric\") reopened the bankruptcy cases of defendants, Michael Gerald Shaffer and David Eugene Osbourn, Jr., and filed separate complaints against each defendant initiating these adversary proceedings. Both complaints seek a declaratory judgment on the dischargeability of particular debts under essentially the same facts. The parties briefed the issues and waived oral argument; the Court took the\n   matter under advisement. For the reasons set forth below, the Court holds as a matter of law that the debts to Dulles Electric that arose after the individual guarantors filed chapter 7 were not discharged in the individual guarantors' bankruptcy cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   David Osbourn and Michael Shaffer were part owners of a business named \"St. James Electric, LLC.\" Stip. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2011, St. James Electric submitted a credit application to Dulles Electric to obtain credit for future purchases from Dulles Electric. Stip. \u00b6 5. At the same time, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer signed a Guaranty of Payment in which they guaranteed the debt owed to Dulles Electric by St. James Electric. Stip. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 8, 2013, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer each filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Stip. \u00b6 1. Each of them listed Dulles Electric as a creditor. Stip. \u00b6 1. Each of them obtained a discharge of their debts on February 20, 2014. Stip. \u00b6 3. Neither of them revoked or rescinded the Guaranty of Payment. Stip. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer each filed chapter 7, their corporation, St. James Electric, continued to operate. Stip. \u00b6 7. Dulles Electric continued to sell materials to St. James Electric on credit or account. Stip. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 6, 2015, St. James Electric filed chapter 7 bankruptcy. Stip. \u00b6 8. It listed Dulles Electric as a creditor for a debt in the amount of $20,000. Stip. \u00b6 9. No assets were available for distribution, and the chapter 7 case of St. James Electric was closed in May 2015. Stip. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dulles Electric asserts Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer remain liable to Dulles Electric for the debt for materials it sold to St. James Electric, after the co-owners filed their chapter 7 cases, based on the 2011 Guaranty of Payment. The parties agree that St. James Electric made the purchases after each co-owner filed chapter 7, but they disagree whether the co-owners were discharged of their personal liability for the postpetition corporate purchases. Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer contend the personal liability on the guaranty has been discharged for any purchases made by their corporation, even those made after their individual chapter 7 cases. Dulles Electric insists the personal liability on the guaranty was discharged only as to purchases made prior to the individual's chapter 7 bankruptcies, and the purchases made after their bankruptcies are postpetition debts for which the individuals remain personally liable under their continuing guaranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this bankruptcy case by virtue of the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 157(a), the delegation made to this Court by Order of Reference from the District Court entered on December 6, 1994, and Rule 3 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.

More to the point, Dulles Electric argues that the individuals entered into a continuing guaranty, which means that the individuals guaranteed an unlimited series of transactions, each of which is a new debt. The liability on the continuing guaranty, Dulles Electric argues, did not arise until St. James Electric made a purchase, which is an independent transaction and a new debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer counter that debt based on a guaranty signed in 2011 is a prepetition debt because the personal guaranty was made prepetition and the liability stems from that prepetition guaranty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the guaranty was made prepetition, at the time Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer filed chapter 7 bankruptcy, they had unmatured, contingent liability to Dulles Electric on that guaranty. Because the Bankruptcy Code allows unmatured and contingent liability to be discharged in chapter 7, the liability under the guaranty for the prepetition extensions of credit was discharged when the Court issued the discharge order for Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) ; 727. Whether the liability under the continuing guaranty was discharged for postpetition purchases remains in dispute because it is not obvious if postpetition extensions of credit for new purchases for materials are unmatured and contingent liabilities as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to the Fourth Circuit, the debt arises when the conduct which gives rise to the obligation arose.\n   <em>\n    Grady v. A.H.

If the conduct arose prepetition, certainly the obligation is prepetition. Hence the debt\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   arisen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code defines two key terms in this dispute: \"debt\" and \"claim.\" \"The term 'debt' means liability on a claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12).

Section 727(b) provides, inter alia, that \"a discharge under subsection (a) of this section discharges the debtor from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief under this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Consequently, the chapter 7 discharge in each of these bankruptcy cases discharged all of Mr. Osbourn's and Mr. Shaffer's\n   <em>\n    prepetition\n   </em>\n   liability on each right to payment, including liability on those rights to payment that were contingent and unmatured. The current dispute thus hinges on whether Mr. Osbourn's and Mr. Shaffer's liability on Dulles Electric's right to payment for postpetition extensions of credit to St. James Electric existed prepetition. If the liability existed prepetition, the debt was discharged. If the liability arose postpetition, the debt was not discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Nature of the Guaranty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dulles Electric asserts that Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer are liable for the balance owed on the postpetition extensions of credit based on the prepetition signing of a guaranty of payment. The Supreme Court of Virginia \"has defined a guaranty as 'an independent contract, by which the guarantor undertakes, in writing, upon a sufficient undertaking, to be answerable for the debt, or for the performance of some duty, in case of the failure of some other person who is primarily liable to pay or perform.' \"\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

As such, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer are more akin to co-signers: they agree that the creditor may look to them for payment of the obligation without first seeking payment from St. James Electric. As well, the guarantor will be liable for the future obligations incurred by the primary obligor.

For purposes of this case, if the conduct which gave rise to the obligation occurred before Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer filed bankruptcy, the liability on that obligation was discharged even if some of the transactions for which they would be obligated occurred after they filed bankruptcy. On the other hand, if the conduct which gave rise to the obligation occurred after their bankruptcy, the liability on that obligation was not discharged. In other words, if the obligation was postpetition, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer would be liable for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Is the conduct which gives rise to the obligation the signing of the guaranty or the extension of credit and default for which the guaranty was made?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Some courts have concluded that the conduct is postpetition if contractual transactions occurred postpetition. Logically, the conduct which gives rise to the contractual obligation can only occur if\n   credit is extended and a default occurs. Absent the extension of credit and a default, the primary obligor and thus the guarantor have no actual contractual liability. Put differently, if no credit is extended, no obligation to pay exists. In this way, the signing of a guaranty cannot by itself obligate the guarantor for credit if the credit is never extended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Brand\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

E.D. Mich. 2010). These courts find the guaranty is contingent and unmatured because it only obligates the guarantor if the other party (the maker) defaults; so the guaranty is contingent in the natural sense of the word. These cases assume the contingency is the future default on existing right to payment, not that the contingency is the extension of new credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   All of this means that it is not enough that the guaranty is signed prepetition if there is no ascertainable liability to guarantee.

Under a continuing guaranty, it is unknown what future extensions may be made and thus the liability as of the signing of the guaranty is not ascertainable. For these reasons, the continuing guaranty signed prepetition, while establishing a right to payment on current or committed rights to payment, did not create the liability for extensions of credit yet to be entered into or contemplated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Under the continuing guaranty, the contingent right to payment did not arise until purchase orders had been made.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this case, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer signed a continuing guaranty. They did not revoke the guaranty or terminate the guaranty. When St. James Electric requested and Dulles Electric agreed to extend credit to St. James Electric after November 2013, the right to payment for that credit arose. Because they signed a continuing guaranty, Mr. Osbourn and Mr. Shaffer did not at the petition date have liability for extensions of credit for purchases not yet contemplated or committed to be made. Under a continuing guaranty, each new purchase is a distinct debt; hence the guarantor could terminate or revoke the guaranty to avoid liability for future transactions. In this case, these postpetition new extensions of credit were not binding prepetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court concludes that Mr. Osbourn's and Mr. Shaffer's chapter 7 discharge orders did not discharge liability under the guaranty for the postpetition extensions of credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court will issue a separate order based on the conclusions in this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Clerk is directed to send copies of this Opinion to Ann E.
