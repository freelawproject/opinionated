This decision constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable here by Bankruptcy Rule 7052. To the extent that a finding of fact includes a conclusion of law, it is deemed a conclusion of law and vice versa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that plaintiff has failed to meet his burden with respect to each claim alleged in the amended complaint. Accordingly, the Court enters judgment for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this adversary proceeding on August 25, 2015, and filed an Amended Complaint on August 31, 2015 [dkt. 3]. The Amended Complaint alleges actual and constructive fraudulent conveyance claims against defendant pursuant to \u00a7 544(b) and the NYDCL\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a common law claim of unjust enrichment. Specifically, the Amended Complaint asserts eight causes of action: (1) constructive fraud under \u00a7 544(b) and NYDCL \u00a7\u00a7 273, 274 and 275 (First and Third Causes of Action), (2) intentional fraud under \u00a7 544(b) and NYDCL \u00a7 276 (Fifth Cause of Action), (3) recovery of the transfers, once avoided, under \u00a7 550 and NYDCL \u00a7 278 (Second, Fourth and Sixth Causes of Action), (4) recovery of attorneys' fees under NYDCL \u00a7 276-a (Seventh Cause of Action), and (5) unjust enrichment (Eighth Cause of Action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In anticipation of trial, the parties filed a Joint Pretrial Statement, which included the parties' agreement to reduce the amount sought to be recovered by plaintiff to $41,544.63 arising from thirteen separate transfers made by debtor to defendant during the period July 1, 2012 through December 27, 2012 (the \"Transfers\"). Additionally, for purposes of trial, the parties stipulated that debtor was insolvent at the time of the Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the section of the Joint Pretrial Statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   titled \"Plaintiff's Requested Relief,\" plaintiff asks that judgment be entered in his favor and against defendant under \u00a7 550 and NYDCL \u00a7\u00a7 275, 276 and 278, and under a common law claim of unjust enrichment. At trial plaintiff did not argue or present evidence in support of his claim for recovery under NYDCL \u00a7 275 (First Cause of Action) and \u00a7 276 (Fifth Cause of Action). Nor did plaintiff put forth evidence to support his demand for attorneys' fees under NYDCL \u00a7 276-a (Seventh Cause of Action). Similarly, although the First Cause of Action seeks to avoid the Transfers under NYDCL \u00a7 274, at trial, plaintiff did not argue or present evidence in support of that claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, at trial, plaintiff placed primary emphasis on his allegation that pursuant to \u00a7 544(b) and NYDCL \u00a7 273, the payments made by debtor to defendant, to wit, the Transfers, were constructive fraudulent conveyances because debtor did not receive fair consideration for the payments and debtor was insolvent when it made the payments. Although not articulated as such at trial, the Court infers that this argument by plaintiff applies equally to his claim of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following findings of fact are based on the trial testimony provided by defendant-the\n   only witness at trial-as well as the exhibits entered into evidence at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. The Transfers at Issue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the period July 1, 2012 to December 27, 2012, debtor issued thirteen checks to defendant totaling $43,544.63\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   as follows: (1) Check No. 1071 dated July 1, 2012 in the amount of $6,000 [Ex. 5]; (2) Check No. 1180 dated August 2, 2012 in the amount of $1,126.81 [Ex. 6]; (3) Check No. 1185 dated July 30, 2012 in the amount of $2,046 [Ex. 6]; (4) Check No. 1233 dated August 16, 2012 in the amount of $6,371.82 [Ex. 7]; (5) Check No. 1040 dated September 1, 2012 in the amount of $3,000 [Ex. 8]; (6) Check No. 1136 dated September 29, 2012 in the amount of $3,001 [Ex. 9]; (7) Check No. 1137 dated September 29, 2012 in the amount of $2,999 [Ex. 10]; (8) Check No. 1335 dated October 22, 2012 in the amount of $1,000 [Ex. 11]; (9) Check No. 1229 November 2, 2012 in the amount of $5,000 [Ex. 12]; (10) Check No. 1380 dated November 21, 2012 in the amount of $1,000 [Ex. 13]; (11) Check No. 1417 dated November 30, 2012 in the amount of $5,000 [Ex. 14]; (12) Check No. 1433 dated December 21, 2012 in the amount of $1,000 [Ex. 15]; and (13) Check No. 1444 dated December 27, 2012 in the amount of $6,000 [Ex. 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the Transfers were made. Tr. 1:13, 18-20. Defendant testified that, other than a check in the amount of $1,000 for a Christmas bonus [Ex. 15], Tr. 23:24-25, 24:2-6, the payments received by her from debtor in 2012 were for services rendered to debtor. Tr. 67:9-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. Defendant's Work History and Relationship with Debtor\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2006, at the age of 17, defendant started working for debtor, a merchant processing services company, after answering a Craigslist advertisement. Tr. 3:20-24, 4:3-8, 50:12-17, 51:12-13, 56:3-5. Defendant contacted potential customers by phone, prepared proposals, answered customer inquiries and provided general customer service. Tr. 55:11-16, 51:5-7, 55:14-56:2. Defendant was compensated as an independent commission-based salesperson, not a salaried employee of debtor. Tr. 71:13-16. She received a draw against commissions of $6,000 per month. Tr. 4:9-22. Defendant did not have a written contract with debtor setting forth the terms of her engagement. Tr. 9:17-22. Rather, according to defendant, per a verbal agreement with debtor, defendant was entitled to a 50% commission on each account she successfully solicited for debtor. Tr. 8:21-9:2. Defendant testified that during 2012, she generated 1,200 merchant accounts for debtor. Tr. 8:8-9, 43:14-16. These accounts, according to defendant, generated income to debtor in excess of $600,000. Tr. 64:7-15, 65:12-13. Defendant testified that she did not receive commissions due for the accounts generated by her for debtor in 2012. Tr. 66:17-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2010, defendant, with the help of debtor's principal and accountant, Svetlana Shneydershteyn (\"Shneydershteyn\"), formed Merchant Marketing Group (\"MMG\"). Tr. 56:6-10, 5:23-6:20. Defendant's 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns each included Schedule C-Profit or Loss\n   From Business (Sole Proprietorship) and Schedule SE-Self-Employment Tax, and her 2012 and 2013 state tax return included a copy of Schedule C that was filed with defendant's federal tax returns [Exs. 21 and 22]. According to defendant, in 2012, MMG had gross receipts of $18,000. Tr. 31:12-18; Schedule C-Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) [Ex. 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shneydershteyn issued checks on behalf of debtor payable to defendant, individually, and MMG. Tr. 5:16-6:2. Shneydershteyn decided how and when the checks were payable and in what amounts they were made. Tr. 6:23-7:7. Shneydershteyn, on behalf of debtor, also issued 1099 forms to defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 29:13-17. In 2013, defendant noticed incorrect calculations on certain residual reports provided to her by debtor. Tr. 42:21-43:7. After she approached Shneydershteyn regarding the incorrect calculations, defendant received a letter terminating her relationship with debtor. Tr. 43:4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant testified that she is still owed unpaid commissions for work performed from 2010 through 2013. Tr. 42:12-14. On December 4, 2014, defendant filed a proof of claim in debtor's chapter 7 case for unpaid commissions totaling $2,170,000 [Proof of Claim No. 7-1, Ex. 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   III. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted above, plaintiff seeks to recover the Transfers as constructive fraudulent transfers pursuant to \u00a7 544(b) and NYDCL \u00a7\u00a7 273 - 275. In the alternative, plaintiff seeks to recover the Transfers as intentional fraudulent transfers pursuant to \u00a7 544(b) and NYDCL \u00a7 276, and demands attorneys' fees under NYDCL \u00a7 276-a. Finally, plaintiff asserts a common law claim of unjust enrichment. The Court first considers the legal principles applicable to an action under \u00a7 544(b) and the NYDCL. The Court will then discuss each cause of action in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 544(b)(1) authorizes a trustee to \"avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Hence, under \u00a7 544(b), the trustee may avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor or an obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. The parties do not dispute that in this action the \"applicable law\" for purposes of \u00a7 544(b) is the NYDCL, and that the action was timely commenced under \u00a7 546(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[A]s long as the statute of limitations has not expired as of the petition date, a trustee is permitted to bring New York fraudulent conveyance actions looking back six years from the [petition date] in accordance with section 544(b) at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   point during the two-year period set out in section 546(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

To prevail on his constructive fraudulent conveyance claim, plaintiff must establish that (1) debtor made the Transfers, (2) debtor was insolvent or was thereby rendered insolvent by the Transfers, and (3) the Transfers were made without fair consideration. No dispute exists as to the first and second elements-the trial record shows that the Transfers were made and the parties stipulated that debtor was insolvent at the time of the Transfers. It is the third element on which the parties strongly disagree. While plaintiff acknowledges that debtor received consideration for the Transfers in the form of services rendered, and has not contested the value of those services, he nevertheless argues that the services were provided by MMG and not by defendant, the recipient of the Transfers. Tr. 46:5-8, 57:19-25, 58:14-22. Plaintiff contends that payment should have been made to MMG, which according to plaintiff actually performed the services. In short, plaintiff asks: what did debtor receive from defendant in exchange for the Transfers? His answer: nothing. Defendant, however, takes a different view of the significance of what services were rendered and by whom. In the main, defendant argues that the Court must look to what a debtor-transferor received in exchange for the property conveyed. Defendant contends that debtor received an economic benefit from the services rendered, and that she did not benefit from the Transfers to the detriment of creditors of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the crux of this dispute is not whether debtor received consideration for the Transfers, but rather, who rendered the services for which debtor paid, and whether at the end of the day the net effect of the Transfers reduced the assets of the bankruptcy estate and lessened the funds available for distribution to unsecured creditors. For the reasons set forth below, plaintiff has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to relief under his legal theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, while plaintiff argues that MMG rendered services to debtor, and not defendant, the trial record shows that MMG is a sole proprietorship owned by defendant. Defendant's 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns each included Schedule C-Profit or Loss From Business (Sole Proprietorship) and Schedule SE-Self-Employment Tax, and her 2012 and 2013 state tax return included a copy of Schedule C that was filed with defendant's federal tax returns [Exs. 21 and 22]. Defendant testified that Schedule C reflected profits and losses for MMG. Tr. 31:12-18. The Second Circuit has recognized that \"a sole proprietorship has no legal existence apart from its owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Lattanzio v. COMTA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868950\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/137/#p140\">\n    481 F.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (2d Cir. 2007). \"As a general matter, the income and expenses of a sole proprietorship are the income and expenses of [owner of the business].\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart v.

As noted above, the evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that MMG is a sole proprietorship owned by defendant. This evidence conflicts with plaintiff's theory of the case that debtor paid defendant for services provided, not by defendant, but MMG. Because MMG is a sole proprietorship,\n   and therefore has no legal existence apart from defendant, its owner, payments made to defendant were in exchange for services she provided to debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to the value of the consideration exchanged between debtor and defendant, plaintiff does not argue nor did he introduce evidence to show that the value of the merchant accounts generated by defendant for the benefit of debtor was not a \"fair equivalent\" for the Transfers. Defendant testified that she received the Transfers, i.e., $41,544.63, for services she rendered to debtor. Tr. 55:11-56:2, 67:5-16. According to the unrefuted trial testimony of defendant, during 2012, she generated 1200 merchant accounts for debtor, Tr. 8:8-9, 43:14-16, which in turn generated in excess of $600,000 of income to debtor, Tr. 64:7-15, 65:12-13, and for which she did not receive any commissions, Tr. 66: 17-24. The Court carefully considered whether any basis for discrediting defendant's testimony existed but found none. Defendant testified consistently and credibly as to the Transfers and her work relationship with debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Secondly, plaintiff failed to show how the challenged transaction diminished debtor's estate and adversely affected creditors. \"[I]f the debtor receives property ... that is substantially equivalent in value to the property given or obligation incurred by him in exchange, then the transaction has not significantly affected his estate and his creditors have no cause to complain.\"\n   <em>\n    Rubin v.

At the end of the day, debtor received the value of those accounts, and, thus, a \"fair equivalent\" for the payments it made to defendant for services rendered. Debtor's creditors suffered no adverse impact by the Transfers-the net effect of the transaction on debtor's estate and the funds available for debtor's unsecured creditors is null.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Lastly, because defendant gave equivalent value in exchange for the Transfers, and plaintiff did not argue or present evidence that defendant acted with actual or constructive knowledge of any fraudulent scheme, the requirement under NYDCL \u00a7 272 that defendant act in good faith has\n   been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HBE Leasing Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118756,7410295\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/623/\">\n    48 F.3d at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, based on all of the credible evidence at trial, the Court finds that plaintiff has failed to establish that the Transfers were made without a fair consideration.
