The record before the Court consists of 329 exhibits admitted into evidence, including the deposition testimony of three witnesses (Tim Bero, Steven Barborini, and Scott Braum) and the live testimony of nine witnesses: Larry Belk, Butch Cash, Robert Keith Cash (\"Keith Cash\" or \"Keith\"), Defendant, Carl Lansden, Hugh Lansden, Margarette Lon-Britton, Stephen Moseley, and Grace Phillips. Following the trial, the Court directed the parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and post-trial briefs. Both Plaintiffs and Defendant filed their initial documents on September 23, 2016 [Docs. 83, 84], followed by responses thereto on October 28, 2016 [Docs. 85, 86].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

and (3) whether Plaintiffs are entitled to a money judgment against Defendant and whether any such money judgment should include attorneys' fees, court costs, and/or punitive damages. The parties agreed with the Court's restatement of the issues.

SUMMARY OF DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After engaging in an extensive review of the record, including creation of a chronology covering more than 20 years and containing 487 separate entries based on the 329 exhibits and the trial testimony, the Court finds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) the Finance Agreements entered into between Plaintiffs and TG International, Inc. (\"TGI\") and/or MP International, Inc. (\"MPI\") from 2005 to 2009 were not obtained through false pretenses, false representations, and/or actual fraud such that any amounts due thereunder that were not otherwise re-obligated in the ISDA, to the extent that Defendant might have been personally liable on the original obligations, were discharged on March 16, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) Defendant executed the ISDA both in his individual capacity and on behalf of TGI, and he received a direct benefit from execution and implementation of the ISDA such that he is personally liable to Plaintiffs for any breach of the ISDA;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) the ISDA was not procured through false pretenses, false representations, and/or actual fraud with respect to the FTZ Inventory (as defined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), such that any obligations due from any default thereunder concerning the FTZ Inventory were discharged on March 16, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (4) the ISDA was procured through false pretenses, false representations, and/or actual fraud of Defendant with respect to the ARMACO Inventory (as defined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), and the obligations due from the default of the ISDA concerning the ARMACO Inventory were not discharged on March 16, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (5) pursuant to the ISDA, Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneys' fees and court costs incurred in connection with enforcement of the ISDA in the amounts of $100,000.00 paid to John Lucas and an amount to be determined for the services of Winchester, Sellers, Foster &amp; Steele, P.C., which amounts are nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (6) Plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $7,000.00 paid to Matthew Cook because they were not incurred to enforce the ISDA; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (7) Plaintiffs are not entitled to punitive damages against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendant graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1991 and started Tennessee Guns Corporation in the mid-1990s. In the early 2000s, he obtained a firearms license with the United States Department of State and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (the \"ATF\") and began importing for sale weapons and ammunition, including surplus military assault rifles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2001, Defendant purchased all shares and took sole ownership of Tennessee Guns Corporation, the assets of which were subsequently purchased in 2003 by TGI, which, since 2005, has been owned by MPI. Both TGI and MPI are Tennessee corporations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At all relevant times, Defendant was the sole shareholder of MPI (and of TGI, until MPI purchased his TGI shares in 2005), and he served as the president of both from the dates of incorporation until December 10, 2013, when he relinquished his ownership and operational control in both companies. Defendant's primary role with TGI was sales, and his sister, Grace Phillips, who served as secretary and Chief Operations Officer, handled the day-to-day operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As of the trial date, TGI was still \"technically\" in business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant met Keith Cash in 2002 or 2003, and Keith subsequently introduced Defendant to Plaintiffs. Keith Cash became interested in firearms manufacturing, and he held three federal firearms licenses (\"FFLs\"): to manufacture ammunition, to manufacture firearms, and to import weapons. Keith was the sole owner of Waffen Werks, a company formed in 2002 that assembled firearms and imported materials from Europe and the Middle East. TGI was Waffen Werks's biggest client, with Waffen Werks assembling parts kits and firearm components imported by TGI into working firearms to be sold by TGI in the United States. Waffen Werks was a wholesale company and ceased doing business in 2014, after which Keith Cash terminated his FFLs. He and his spouse subsequently started a consulting business called United Defense Consultants, LLC, and he again obtained and at the time of trial possessed FFLs to manufacture firearms and import weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Carl Lansden testified that he learned of the TGI investment opportunity through his great-nephew, Keith Cash. The funds that Carl loaned to TGI came from his personal investments and family savings. Carl does not possess a FFL and is not engaged in the firearms business. Carl was the first of Plaintiffs to loan to TGI, in June 2005 [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 39], in part to help Keith, who received a benefit from the relationship between TGI and Waffen Werks. For that reason, initial contracts between Carl Lansden and TGI included a provision requiring that Waffen Werks would be the manufacturer of the firearms purchased with proceeds of Carl's loans to TGI. Carl testified that he did not meet Defendant in person until 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Shortly after Carl made his first loan to TGI, Butch Cash (Carl's nephew and Keith's father) also made his first loan to TGI. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 5.] Like Carl, Butch does not possess a FFL and is not engaged in the firearms business. He funded Waffen Werks to help his son \"make a living.\" Also like Carl, one of the main purposes of his agreeing to make loans to TGI was to assist Keith and Waffen Werks, which were to receive work from TGI in connection with TGI's importation of firearms parts purchased with proceeds of Butch's loans to TGI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Hugh Lansden (Carl's son and Keith's second cousin) rehabs old houses for resale. He learned about the investment opportunity with Defendant and TGI through his father, and he made a single loan to TGI in October 2008. He testified that his loan to TGI is his sole experience loaning money for profit. In order to fund the loan, he took out a line of credit against a couple of his rental properties. As of the time of trial, the resulting debt had not yet been fully satisfied, despite that some payments had been made. Like Butch and Carl, Hugh does not possess a FFL, and he is not engaged in the firearms business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. TGI's Relevant Business Operations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During the relevant time period, TGI was purchasing firearms and/or firearms parts from formerly Soviet bloc countries, including primarily Hungary, through ARMACO Trading, Ltd. According to Defendant, ARMACO, located in Budapest, was a licensed seller of weapons that had previously been used in the service of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense. ARMACO would bid with the Hungarian government to purchase and export the weapons. After a winning bid, ARMACO would acquire the weapons from the government. Sometimes ARMACO would contract with FEG, a Hungarian licensed arms manufacturer, which would manipulate the weapons into firearms or parts that were importable into the United States under highly regulated permits. TGI would obtain the necessary permits and import the FEG-manipulated materials into the United States, sometimes in ready-to-sell condition and sometimes in need of further manipulation by a state-side firearms manufacturer like Waffen Werks. Other times, TGI would purchase non-importable materials from ARMACO and have them shipped to the FTZ\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for demilitarization by Northwest Imports, Inc. (\"NWI\"), the operator of the FTZ located in Longview, Washington. Once de-militarized, the importable parts would be shipped to TGI or one of its firearm manufacturers like Waffen Werks. TGI paid NWI and its sister company, TNW Firearms, Inc. (both owned by Tim Bero), for manipulation and storage of\n   weapons received from ARMACO (and other sellers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant's ATF Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In an \"Open Letter to Federally Licensed Firearms Importers and Registered Importers of U.S. Munitions Import List Articles\" dated July 13, 2005 (\"July 2005 ATF Open Letter\"), importers were advised the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has determined that the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) permits no exceptions that would allow frames, receivers or barrels for otherwise non-importable firearms to be imported into the United States ...

Importers who import such components for any purpose other than repair or replacement of existing firearms, e.g., for assembly into new firearms, will be exceeding the scope of the import authorization in violation of law. If ATF determines, through inspection or otherwise, that an importer willfully violates the import provisions of the GCA, the Importer's license is subject to revocation pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20923\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Importers holding approved import permits for non-importable barrels and receivers will receive a letter prior to September 10, 2005, advising them that their permit has been suspended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This determination affects importers as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   1.

G.] An Open Letter to Federally Licensed Firearms Importers and Registered Importers of U.S. Munitions Import List Articles dated November 22, 2005 (\"November 2005 ATF Open Letter\"), further explained the July 2005 ATF Open Letter as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   In an open letter dated July 13, 2005, licensed and registered importers were advised that the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3) established the standards for the importation of firearms and ammunition into the United States. In particular, section 925(d)(3) provides that the Attorney General shall authorize a firearm to be imported if it meets several conditions: (1) it is not defined as a firearm under the National Firearms Act (NFA); (2) it is generally recognized to be particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes; and (3) it is not a surplus military firearm. However, the subsection further provides that \"in any case where the Attorney General has not authorized the importation of the firearm pursuant to this paragraph, it shall be unlawful to import any frame, receiver, or barrel of such firearm which would be prohibited if assembled.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Importers were further advised that ATF has determined that the language of section 925(d)(3) permits no exceptions that would allow the frames, receivers, or barrels for otherwise nonimportable firearms to be imported into the United States. As a result, ATF would no longer approve ATF Form 6 import permit applications for importation of any frames, receivers, or barrels for firearms that would be prohibited from importation if assembled. No exceptions to the statutory language, for example for the repair or replacement of existing firearms, will be allowed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ATF recognizes that certain firearm barrels may be used to assemble either an importable or a nonimportable firearm. With this fact in mind, ATF believes that such 'dual use' barrels would be eligible for importation into the United States under section 925(d)(3) for commercial purposes, provided prospective importers of such barrels make representations indicating that neither the importer nor subsequent purchasers of the barrels will use the barrels to assemble nonimportable firearms. Importers of such barrels must provide sufficient information,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , specific model designation(s) of the firearm(s) that the barrels will be used to assemble, in the \"Specific Purpose of Importation\" section of the ATF Form 6 that would enable ATF personnel to establish that the barrels are being imported for the assembly into importable firearms. If the dual use barrels are being imported for resale to third parties, the importer must state in the \"Specific Purpose of Importation\" section of the ATF Form 6 that purchasers have been or will be advised that the barrels may only be used for assembly into certain importable models and must list the specific models for which the barrels will be sold.

This memo states that you are submitting this application under the \"Dual Use Barrel Doctrine.\" The memo further stated that in March 2006, ATF clarified its position on the dual use barrels and that ATF can approve importation permits for dual use barrels when the application is supported by information sufficient to show the barrels will be used by the importer to assemble firearms that would otherwise qualify for importation under 18 USC 925(d)(3). Section 925(d)(3) explains that firearms are not eligible to be imported if they are National Firearms Act firearms, surplus military firearms, or firearms not generally recognized to be particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.

The declaration further stated that the Civil Forces were volunteers and had nothing to do with the military, but had been directly commanded by the Hungarian Socialist Party.

This situation is different than most in that these defense articles, according to your supporting documentation, had been possessed by a \"Civilian Force\" in Hungary and had at one time been stored in Ministry of Defense (MoD) storage facilities.

Additionally, to better regulate the industry, beginning in 2003 (after the ATF was moved from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice), the ATF routinely conducted annual compliance inspections of FFL holders. ATF inspections of TGI usually occurred between August and October of each year. Through the inspections, which were conducted by approximately fifteen agents and took approximately thirty days, the ATF performed a number of reviews such as comparing the company's inventory with its books, checking serial numbers on weaponry in the company's possession, and categorizing inventory by origination and destination locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The ATF's annual inspection of TGI for 2009 commenced on October 23.

[Trial Ex. 216.] Specifically, the Plea Agreement stated the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   In 2006, the defendant, acting by and through the Federal firearms licensee (FFL) Tennessee Guns International, Inc. (hereinafter, \"TGI\"), a corporate entity located in Louisville, Tennessee, in which the defendant serves as owner and president, sought to import from Hungary several thousand firearm parts kits, which included firearm barrels. The defendant identified the barrels as originating from machineguns previously in Hungarian military stores. ATF denied the defendant's request to import the firearm barrels pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3), which prohibits the importation of any firearm frame, receiver, or barrel of an NFA firearm or surplus military firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   In an effort to circumvent ATF's denial of the importation of the firearm parts kits, the defendant hired a foreign corporation, ARMACO Trading, Ltd. to disassemble the machineguns previously in military stores and assemble semiautomatic rifles using the surplus military machinegun barrels. The defendant,\n   without identifying the previously unapproved barrels on an ATF Form 6 or ATF Form 6A, filed documents seeking approval for importation of several thousand completed, \"sporting\" firearms. Because the ATF Form 6 and ATF Form 6A submitted by the defendant through TGI did not properly identify the origin or prior status of the barrels, ATF and CBP [the U.S. Customs and Border Protection] approved the completed firearms with surplus military, machinegun barrels for importation. The completed firearms were imported into the U.S. and introduced into commerce through sales by TGI to customers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Later, the defendant hired Northwest Imports, Inc., a company that operates a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) in Oregon, to perform manufacturing work. The defendant filed ATF Form 6 documents with ATF to import the machineguns from Hungary for the stated purpose of sales to law enforcement and government. Upon approval by ATF, the defendant imported Hungarian surplus military, machineguns into the FTZ of Northwest Imports, Inc. The defendant then shipped semiautomatic, firearm receivers from TGI out to the FTZ in Oregon where workers of Northwest Imports, Inc. assembled the receivers into more complete firearms using the surplus military, machinegun barrels. The defendant then filed documents with ATF to import the assembled firearm into the United States without properly identifying, as required, the country of origin of the barrels or their status as prohibited barrels under 18 U.S.C. Section 925(d)(3). The firearms and prohibited barrels passed through Customs and entered into the United States, where they were received by the defendant's business. There, the prohibited barrels and other parts were removed for use in assembling complete firearms, and the used receivers were returned to the FTZ to be reused with other barrels. Proper identification of the surplus military, machinegun barrels would have resulted in the denial of the defendant' [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] request to import the firearms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Initially, the defendant utilized approximately 300 sporting firearm receivers imported from Hungary to bring barrels from the FTZ into the United States. The serial numbers of the initial 300 receivers were altered each time to allow the defendant's ATF Form 6A to reflect a \"new\" firearm for importation. However, at some point the defendant contracted with NoDak Spud, LLC (NoDak Spud), a domestic FFL, to purchase firearm receivers capable of being fitted to the prohibited machinegun barrels. The defendant then shipped the domestically manufactured NoDak Spud firearm receivers into the FTZ where Northwest Imports, Inc. employees assembled firearms using the prohibited machineguns barrels. On ATF Forms 6 and 6A, the defendant fraudulently declared to ATF and CBP that the firearms and firearm barrels had been manufactured in Hungary, despite the fact that the defendant was at all times aware that the firearms were manufactured in Edina, Minnesota by NoDak Spud. Furthermore the defendant failed to properly identify on ATF Forms 6 and 6A\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the barrels were prohibited by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3), having been previously advised by ATF that importation of the barrels was prohibited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The defendant's proper identification of the origin of firearm barrels would have resulted in denial by ATF and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the request to import them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   [Trial Ex. 216, pp. 2-3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant still insists that the ATF applied to him a novel interpretation of its regulations to mean that barrels that were once part of a machinegun were not importable under the principle \"once a machinegun, always a machinegun.\" Nonetheless, Defendant pleaded guilty, and his plea resulted in entry of a criminal judgment against him on March 31, 2014, by which he was placed on probation for one year and ordered to pay a $100.00 penalty and to perform 100 hours of community service. [Trial Ex. 219.] Defendant also was banned from possessing any firearms, and he had to resign from TGI and MPI and divest himself of ownership in MPI as part of his Plea Agreement. He also agreed to the civil forfeiture of the seized firearms, parts kits, and barrels. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 216, \u00b6 12.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Prices likewise affect the market. As a result, Defendant, on behalf of TGI, sought non-traditional sources of financing with individuals who were interested in a high rate of return based on significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional lending, and approximately 50% of TGI's financing came from private investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2005, Plaintiffs Carl Lansden and Butch Cash began loaning money to TGI and MPI through loans negotiated by Defendant.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 39.] Between September 9, 2005, and August 28, 2008, Butch Cash loaned TGI a total of $366,817.97. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 5.] On October 9, 2008, Hugh Lansden loaned TGI $290,000.00.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Included within the \"Major Terms and Conditions\" of the September 12, 2007 commitment letter was a requirement for TGI and MPI to serve as guarantors, and Defendant executed guaranties on behalf of both corporations when the loans were closed and at other times through April 30, 2013. [Trial Exs. 176G, 176H, 251.] Citizens loaned Defendant an additional $730,000.00 under a Master Promissory Note (Pursuant to Revolving Credit Agreement) on February 20, 2008. [Trial Exs. 177A, 177D.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   All of the debt owed by Defendant to Citizens was cross-collateralized, guaranteed by TGI and MPI, and secured by Defendant's residential real property and the inventory of TGI, as reflected in the respective security agreements [Trial Exs. 175A-D, 176A-L, 177A-L, 177O] and UCC-1 statements filed by Citizens in December 2008. [Trial Exs. 68, 187, 188.] Defendant testified that \"it was his understanding\" that the lien granted to Citizens on TGI's inventory simply served as a \"back-up\" to the real property lien up to the amount of $730,000.00 and because he was not required to contact Citizens when inventory was sold in the ordinary course, he did not consider the debt he owed to Citizens to be an actual encumbrance against TGI's inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Default and the Resulting ISDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   According to Defendant, by mid-2009, following the inauguration of President Barack Obama, assault rifle sales drastically decreased, leaving TGI, MPI, and Defendant unable to service their respective debt obligations, including those to Plaintiffs. On October 5 and 6, 2009, Defendant refinanced several loans in the total principal amount of $1,255,370.57 owed to Carl Lansden. [Trial Ex. 190.] One month later, Butch Cash notified Defendant that he could no longer renew any existing loans with maturity dates of November 30, 2009. [Trial Ex. 191.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Within a few days of the November 27, 2009 ATF raid and seizure of TGI inventory, Plaintiffs went to the TGI facility and met with Defendant in person to find out what had happened. The loan agreements between TGI and Plaintiffs provided that loan proceeds were to be used to purchase specifically identified inventory and that repayment would occur immediately on the sale of such inventory to TGI's customers or, regardless of customer payment for the inventory, within a certain period of time (usually within six months) after the loan originated. When Plaintiffs questioned Defendant about the ATF seizure, Defendant assured Plaintiffs that the seized property would be returned and could be sold to satisfy the debts owed to Plaintiffs. Defendant also asked for and received a two-month moratorium on accrual of interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In mid-December 2009, Defendant met with Carl Lansden and Keith Cash at the TGI facility to discuss the outstanding loan obligations and how to proceed. Within a day or two of that meeting, Waffen Werks\n   received certain inventory from TGI, and Keith and Defendant signed a receipt on December 22, reflecting the following \"collateral\" was picked up by Waffen Werks with the value (not stated in the receipt) to be applied against the money owed to Carl Lansden: (1) Finnish P-08 (13 pieces); (2) FPK parts kits (447 pieces); and FPK 7.62x54R receivers (859 pieces).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Trial Ex. 132.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Also in December, Carl was advised by Keith that the VAT applicable to TGI's materials in Hungary was due. ARMACO was required to pay a value-add tax (\"VAT\") of 25% of the value of the firearms when it contracted with FEG to manipulate the weapons. The VAT was refunded by the Hungarian government when the materials were exported. For much of the relevant time period, FEG was making regular shipments to or on behalf of TGI so that ARMACO was willing to pay the VAT and receive the refund after the materials were exported. After TGI's business started declining in 2009, however, in early September 2009, TGI directed ARMACO to hold off on planned shipments and also asked ARMACO to loan TGI funds for the last 2,500 of 20,000 SA2000M rifles that were being manipulated by FEG. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 82, 83, 121, 122, 123, 124.] ARMACO eventually agreed to a short-term (six-month) loan at 25% interest but also demanded that TGI pay interest on the VAT payments made by ARMACO for materials that were not being shipped on the agreed schedule. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 84, 85, 86, 87, 125.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   During the discussions between ARMACO and TGI about the short-term loan, FEG gave notice to ARMACO that without payment from TGI for the 2,500 SA2000M rifles, and without a firm order for the remaining 10,000 pieces, FEG would have to close the factory and lay off its workers. [Trial Ex. 86.] After the ATF seizure, Defendant notified ARMACO that TGI would not be able to import the SA2000M rifles with original AMD-65 barrels because the ATF had deemed the AMD-65 barrels to be machinegun barrels. [Trial Ex. 88.] In response, ARMACO demanded immediate payment of the refundable VAT, which totaled $60,653.39, and interest of $10,107.23 on the short-term loan. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 89, 92, 93, 94.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   After Defendant mentioned to Carl that the VAT was due in Hungary and that failure to make the payment could result in loss of 12,500 firearms, Carl agreed to help, and he contributed approximately $70,750.62, which was paid to ARMACO by Waffen Werks. [Trial Exs. 90, 91, 133.] Apparently, Carl (if not Butch and Hugh) and Defendant began negotiations then for an inventory-for-debt swap as evidenced by Defendant's December 28, 2009 letter to ARMACO concerning the payment by Waffen Werks, which reflects that TGI was \"in the process of transferring ownership of a yet to be determined portion of the 10,000pcs [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of dismounted AMD's stored at FEG to Waffen Works.\" [Trial Ex. 90.] Carl testified that he had no idea at the time of the VAT payment that $10,097.23 of the total he contributed for the VAT was not for the VAT but, instead, was for interest on a short-term loan that TGI owed to ARMACO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant's December 28 letter to ARMACO also reported that the \"ownership transfer [to Waffen Werks] will involve some several thousand units[, and u]pon the transfer, Waffen Werks will become responsible for the costs regarding this sub set [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of AMD's.\" [Trial Ex. 90.] Defendant also advised that \"[t]he remaining quantity of dismounted AMD-65 and the 2,500 pcs of SA2000M are still our property [and w]e consider the agreements between TGI and ARMACO to still be valid in regards to the loan on the 2,500 pcs of SA2000M and for ARMACO's commission.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant and TGI's financial troubles that existed at the time of, but were significantly exacerbated by, the ATF seizures continued into 2010, and on January 6, 2010,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Butch Cash and TGI entered into a memorandum of understanding (\"January 6 MOU\") about the repayment of financing agreements having a principal balance of $208,469.59. The January 6 MOU stated that \"[a]s of November 25th, 2009 the lender agrees that no new interest or penalties will accrue on any principal balances due.\" [Trial Ex. 62.] The January 6 MOU also references a debt-for-inventory swap and identifies the inventory as \"located at TGI, FEG factory in Hungary and FTZ # 120 in Washington State.\" The document also includes the following provision: \"The total principal due will be assessed a 10% premium of $20,846.96 to cover the associated extra costs in the importation and ultimate sale of the inventory in the U.S.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Finally, as relevant here, the January 6 MOU required TGI to issue sales invoices/vendor credits to Waffen Werks for 110% of the total principal balance owed in order to transfer the ownership of the inventory to Waffen Werks, and such invoicing and acceptance of the inventory by Waffen Werks would \"effect payment of the balances due and the lender will issue a statement that their respective loans have been paid in full and that TGI is released from all obligations.\" [Trial Ex. 62.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Similarly, TGI and Carl Lansden entered into a memorandum of understanding dated January 26, 2010\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"January 26 MOU\") for a debt-for-inventory swap relating to the debt TGI owed to Carl. [Trial Ex. 249.] The January 26 MOU sets forth the principal balance owed of $1,344,847.80. [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .] The January 26 MOU contains all of the same terms as the January 6 MOU.

Moseley testified that he received the initial draft of the ISDA from either Defendant or his sister on April 21, and he made the revisions reflected in the red-lined version, including adding \"individually\" to Defendant's signature line as well as the portion of the ISDA that released Defendant from personal liability once \"title, equity and ownership\" of the inventory had been transferred. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 202.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    ARMACO Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   According to Exhibit D to the ISDA, which is a copy of Invoice # 40432 dated January 27, 2010, addressed to Waffen Werks from TGI, Plaintiffs were to receive 10,000 AMD-65 parts kits, each having an agreed-upon value\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   of $61.50, computing to a total value of $615,000.00 (the \"ARMACO Inventory\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D.] Exhibit D reflects that the ARMACO Inventory was located at the ARMACO facility in Hungary and identifies it as \"collateral\" for Plaintiffs' loans to TGI. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Exhibit D also reflects the following: \"[v]alue to be applied against loan principle per agreement reached 12/21/09.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Although the ISDA expressly stated three times that the inventory was unencumbered, ARMACO made it clear to Defendant on February 19 and March 9, 2010, that there were outstanding invoices owed by TGI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Trial Exs. 77, 97;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 96.] Indeed, financial problems relating to the ARMACO Inventory predated the ATF raid. Defendant and TGI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   were making late payments to ARMACO in May 2009, as reflected in emails, messages, and letters. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 80, 81, 82, 121.] On October 20, 2009, ARMACO notified TGI that the entire project would collapse if TGI did not pay for the four shipments, referencing a fax sent on October 19 and an offer for financing even though the price for the loan was high. [Trial Ex. 123.] When TGI did not make a payment, ARMACO notified Defendant on October 21 that it was canceling the order and stopping delivery by FEG. [Trial Ex. 122.] TGI continued negotiations with ARMACO in the fall of 2009, seeking financing and additional time. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Exs. 83, 84, 85, 124, 125.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The situation with ARMACO escalated, and on November 10, 2009, ARMACO sent an email to Defendant marked \"Top Urgent!!!!\", advising that because FEG had not received TGI's payment for the 2500 SA2000M weapons or a firm order for the remaining 10,000 AMD units, FEG would terminate activity and lay off workers on November 11, 2009; and all of the goods currently being held by ARMACO would have to be placed in guarded storage for which ARMACO would invoice TGI. [Trial Ex. 86.] This was followed two days later by a fax from ARMACO to Defendant, advising that \"[i]t is unprecedented and unacceptable the behavior you are handling the critical SA2000M issue. Our faxes of key importance are not responded, our calls on the phone are not answered, your due transfers in USD for enabling us due deliveries are not effected, after all of these our cooperation becomes disputable.\" [Trial Ex. 194 (\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   throughout).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Several months later, when ARMACO did not receive payment after its March 9 letter, ARMACO emailed Defendant again on April 20, demanding payment. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 98.] This demand came only nine days before execution of the ISDA, and it, in connection with the many communications with ARMACO in the months and days leading up to April 29, 2010, make it clear that ARMACO did not intend to release any of the inventory until commissions and fees were paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Additionally, approximately seven weeks before the ISDA was executed, on March 8, 2010, Defendant renewed the $730,000.00 \"inventory line of credit\" with Citizens, including the \"blanket lien on assets\" of TGI and MPI. [Trial Ex. 177B.] Given Defendant's business background and experience, as well as the number of loans he was a party to over the years, the Court finds disingenuous Defendant's testimony that he did not consider the ARMACO Inventory to be encumbered by the Citizens lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    FTZ Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In addition to the ARMACO Inventory, Plaintiffs were to receive specific inventory (a total of 12,800 items) located in the FTZ (the \"FTZ Inventory\") with a collective agreed-upon value of $1,128,627.93. [Trial Ex. 2, Ex. E.] The FTZ Inventory is listed on Exhibit E to the ISDA, which is a copy of Invoice # 40443 dated January 28, 2010, addressed to Waffen Werks from TGI. Exhibit E also identifies the FTZ Inventory as \"collateral\" and references an agreement reached on December 21, 2009. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Despite the ISDA's description of the FTZ Inventory as unencumbered, on April 2, 2010, NWI's owner, Tim Bero (the operator of the FTZ), signed a Chattel Lien Notice, which was recorded in Washington on April 13, 2010, asserting a $275,000.00 claim against the inventory for a debt by TGI. [Trial Ex. 214.]\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Defendant\n   claims that he was unaware of the lien until after the ISDA was signed (and the record supports that Defendant did not receive a copy of the Chattel Lien Notice until after May 21, 2010 [Trial Ex. 129] ), on February 23, 2010, Tim Bero wrote to Defendant to provide storage invoices for November 2009 and January and February 2010, indicating that an inventory report for all TGI property in the FTZ would be available for review only after payment of the storage invoices. [Trial Ex. 149.] Moreover, on April 15-a mere two weeks before the ISDA was signed-Tim Bero's wife wrote to Defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   It has come to our attention that you are in the process of turning over the entire AK type inventory, located in [FTZ] # 120, site 1, over to Waffen Works [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   Please be advised that Northwest Imports cannot release any items from the zone until all open invoices, including any storage and attorney fees associated with this merchandise, are paid in full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   [Trial Ex. 150.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Additionally, as with the ARMACO Inventory, the FTZ Inventory was subject to Citizens' lien, renewed by Defendant on March 8, 2010, covering all of TGI's inventory. [Trial Ex. 177B.] Thus, Defendant's representation in the ISDA that the FTZ Inventory was unencumbered was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Delivered TGI Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In addition to the ARMACO Inventory and the FTZ Inventory, the ISDA also transferred to Plaintiffs inventory located in Knoxville. [Trial Ex. 2, Ex. B.] Exhibit B to the ISDA, consisting of a document entitled Delivered TGI Inventory, identified a total of 19,207 assorted firearms, kits, sets, and accessories that, according to the ISDA, had been delivered to Plaintiffs prior to execution of the ISDA on April 29, 2010. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] It is undisputed that, at the time it was executed on April 29, 2010, Plaintiffs were in possession of the Delivered TGI Inventory listed on Exhibit B to the ISDA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   with the exception of the accessories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs subsequently sold the Delivered TGI Inventory for less than they anticipated it would be worth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Premium Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Under paragraph 1 of the ISDA, Plaintiffs were \"entitled to receive and recover from TGI a premium, in the form of additional inventory of TGI (the 'TGI Premium Inventory'), as liquidated damages and as a partial offset to additional expenses Lender is expected to incur with respect to portions of the TGI Inventory and the TGI Premium Inventory, said TGI Premium Inventory being valued at $185,626.97 according to 'TGI Costs' as defined at paragraph\n   4.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Trial Ex. 2, \u00b6 1.] Plaintiffs assert that the TGI Premium Inventory consisted of 2,500 additional firearms (SA2000M rifles) located in Hungary; however, the exact weapons were not expressly listed in the ISDA or its exhibits. Defendant disagrees with Plaintiffs and argues that the 2,500 additional firearms were not connected to the Premium Inventory. Defendant asserts that the Premium Inventory was included in the inventory transferred by the ISDA as 10% of the loan values at the time, as evidenced by Exhibit A to the ISDA, which is a balance sheet reflecting the amount of the debt owed to Plaintiffs, including a \"10% up charge\"; the value of the inventory identified in Exhibits B, D, and E; and the amount of cash payments made by TGI to Carl and Hugh Lansden between November 29, 2009, and execution of the ISDA. The problem with Defendant's argument is that it ignores the plain language of the ISDA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Lender does furthermore acknowledge and agree that no further accruals of penalties, interest or other charges of any sort shall arise with respect to the Finance Agreements\n   <em>\n    beyond amounts recited upon\n    <em>\n     Exhibit A\n    </em>\n    hereto\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     provided, however, that lender shall nevertheless be entitled to receive and recover from TGI a premium, in the form of additional inventory of TGI (the \"TGI Premium Inventory\")\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , as liquidated damages and as a partial offset to additional expenses Lender is expected to incur with respect to portions of the TGI Inventory and the TGI Premium Inventory, said TGI Premium Inventory being valued at $185,626.97 according to \"TGI Costs\" as defined at paragraph 4. hereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   [Trial Ex. 2, \u00b6 1 (emphases added).] That is, the ISDA clearly (1) defines the inventory shown on Exhibits D and E as the \"TGI Inventory\" and (2) expressly references Exhibit A (on which appears a \"10% up charge,\" the amount of which is included in inventory being transferred that is identified in Exhibits B, D, and E) as not affecting Plaintiffs' entitlement \"to receive and recover from TGI a premium, in the form of\n   <em>\n    additional inventory\n   </em>\n   of TGI (the 'TGI Premium Inventory'),\n   <em>\n    as liquidated damages and as a partial offset to additional expenses\n   </em>\n   \" Plaintiffs were expected to incur. [Trial Ex. 2, \u00b6 1 (emphasis added).] Thus, the only reasonable interpretation of paragraph 1 of the ISDA is that the inventory values identified on Exhibit A (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the inventory identified on Exhibits B, D, and E) do not include the TGI Premium Inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other than setting the value of the TGI Premium Inventory at $185,626.97 (which is 10% of the principal and interest due to Plaintiffs as of November 25, 2009), the ISDA is silent as to specifics of the TGI Premium Inventory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Keith Cash testified that, in his attempts to get the ARMACO Inventory and in response to his family's request that he go and negotiate a resolution, he made three or four trips to Europe to talk with the chairman of ARMACO, beginning in February or March 2010-before execution of the ISDA. Plaintiffs all testified that they understood that the only costs they would need to pay to have the inventory shipped from Hungary would be air freight, which\n   except for the fact that ocean/air transport was included, seems to comport with the ISDA provision that the inventory value included \"the actual purchase price paid by TGI ..., plus any ocean/air transport, duties, broker fees,\n   <em>\n    manufacturing, disassembly\n   </em>\n   , storage, commissions, insurance and excise taxes incurred by TGI on the TGI Inventory.\" [Trial Ex. 2, \u00b6 4 (emphasis added).] Keith, however, testified that he understood that a demilitarization cost of $7.20 per weapon on the 10,000 pieces would need to be paid because TGI had not paid it. Defendant also testified that the demilling cost per rifle was $7.20, but he indicated that the demilling cost was included in the price of the rifle when it shipped. In any event, sometime later, Keith learned that in addition to demilling costs of $7.20 per unit, ARMACO was claiming that TGI also owed storage and guardian fees totaling approximately $250,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   On June 14, 2010, ARMACO faxed a letter to Waffen Werks, addressed to Keith, referencing a June 8 message \"detailing TG unpaid invoices, and understanding [Waffen Werks's] need for some time to determine a course of action.\" [Trial Ex. 134.] The letter also advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   \u2022 Our pre-licence for WW is submitted to our Authority weeks ago.

FEG is, because of the negligence for payments of TG, for any reason, drifted into a close to bankruptcy state.

[\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Court infers from these documents that Keith and Plaintiffs first learned of TGI's debt to ARMACO in early June 2010.

Here we enclose our fax sent to Mr. Cash in the subject of pending payments on 08 June, 2010.\" [Trial Ex. 280.] That same letter also advised that ARMACO had paid 4,600,000 HUF\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   to FEG \"as part of storage costs\" in order to stop the electricity from being disconnected and that, without a payment, \"the goods cannot be removed from FEG or from Hungary.\" [Trial Ex. 280.] The letter continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   Having this self explanatory fax [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the June information provided to Waffen Werks about unpaid invoices], WW is slowly stepping back and Mr. Cash is foreseeing the delivery of 500 pcs AMD parts kits monthly, when WW receives the green light from BATF and the instructions how to proceed with the barrels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   Any movement of goods depends on payment.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 260.] Keith testified that on that trip, he negotiated an agreement, subject to approval of Plaintiffs [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 138], between Waffen Werks and ARMACO. Keith and ARMACO's chairman signed a document entitled \"Minutes of Meeting,\" in which it was proposed that Waffen Werks would pay a unit price of $134.15 (including fees for conversion, disassembly/demilling, and export packing, together with a commission to ARMACO) for the 10,000 converted AMD-65 firearms into SA2000M rifles with a newly manufactured SA receiver, to be manipulated and shipped in lots of 800 units per month after immediate payment of (1) the original $7.20 per piece demilling cost (a total of $72,000.00) plus (2) $25,000.00 of a total of $100,000.00 for guarding and storage costs.

Initial Financing Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Based on the record, the Court has determined that the question of nondischargeability\n   centers solely around the negotiation and execution of the ISDA. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs were initially introduced to Defendant through Keith Cash because he knew that Plaintiffs were interested in making investments with high return rates. From Carl Lansden's and Butch Cash's first loans to TGI in 2005, their business relationship with Defendant went well until the gun industry itself began suffering a major decline, thus causing TGI's cash flow to significantly drop, leaving it unable to satisfy its loan obligations not only to Plaintiffs, but to other lenders and vendors alike. Although there is evidence in the record to reflect that Defendant knew that there were problems with importing AMD-65s and that he was falsifying the Forms 6 submitted to the ATF as early as 2007,\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   whether there was any sort of misrepresentation, false pretense, or actual fraud concerning negotiation of the initial loans between Plaintiffs and Defendant is irrelevant for purposes of this adversary proceeding because all of the past due monies owed to Plaintiffs under those original loans were restated and, in essence, reaffirmed through the ISDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Additionally, the initial financing agreements were between Plaintiffs and TGI, not Defendant. Plaintiffs also did not offer any evidence to rebut Defendant's insistence (confirmed by Grace Phillips) that the ATF re-interpreted its regulations before its inspection and raid in November 2009. Finally, although Defendant did not raise accord and satisfaction as an affirmative defense, the very title of the ISDA-Inventory\n   <em>\n    in Satisfaction of Debt\n   </em>\n   Agreement-establishes that it was intended as an accord and satisfaction of the initial financing agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    C. ISDA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   The ISDA, which incorporates the past due sums owed to Plaintiffs from the various loans made to TGI, expressly states that the inventory to be transferred was unencumbered when it was not. Because the ARMACO and FTZ Inventories were not unencumbered, Plaintiffs were unable to take control of the inventory, which constituted a breach of the parties' agreement. Thus, having determined that the question of nondischargeability centers solely around the negotiation and execution of the ISDA, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of proof for each element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Money/Benefit to Defendant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   With respect to the first element, this Court has previously held that a debtor is not required to \"directly and personally receive every dollar lost by the creditor\" to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) ; rather, \" 'if the debtor benefits in some way from the property obtained through his deception, the debt is nondischargeable.' \"\n   <em>\n    Haney v.

N.D. Ohio May 1, 2017) (finding that the defendant obtained a financial benefit from a down payment deposited into an LLC's bank account that was owned and controlled by him and from which his livelihood was provided and that he received \"at least an indirect tangible financial benefit ... within the Sixth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   analysis[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The Court finds that Defendant unquestionably received a benefit from the ISDA and rejects his argument that he was required to personally guarantee the ISDA to be liable thereunder. First, and most obviously, Defendant received a benefit individually, as well as in his capacity as owner of TGI, to be expressly released from claims and liabilities by the very terms of ISDA itself. Defendant executed the ISDA not only as president of TGI, but individually [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 2], and it is undisputed that the release of liability and Defendant's \"individual\" signature line were added by his attorney, Stephen Moseley. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ex. 202.] During his testimony, Defendant stated that he never intended to personally guarantee the ISDA but only signed in an individual capacity because Carl Lansden did not want Defendant, as president of TGI, to have the ability to suspend the agreement in the future. The ISDA, however, expressly provides that upon delivery and transfer of \"title, equity and ownership of all of the TGI inventory and all of the TGI Premium Inventory\" to Plaintiffs, they agreed to \"release and forever discharge ... TGI, its officers, directors and constituents, specifically and including without limitation, Charles M. Jones, III ... from all damages, costs, expenses, liabilities and other obligations of any type or sort with respect to each and all of the Finance Agreements,\" and as with the individual signature line, this language was added by Defendant's attorney of more than thirty years. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Further, notwithstanding Defendant's contention that he did not personally intend to obligate himself under the ISDA, Plaintiffs each testified that Defendant's individual signature and obligation under the ISDA were a mandatory requirement in their minds, and they would not have agreed to the ISDA had they not believed that both TGI and Defendant, individually, were obligated under the ISDA. It is also irrelevant that Defendant may not have signed any other of TGI's documents or loans in an individual capacity. The ISDA was an arrangement between those specific parties, and they were within all rights to negotiate the terms as they chose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   In addition, notwithstanding that the monies to be repaid under the ISDA were initially loans made to TGI, Defendant was the sole shareholder of TGI, and it was the business from which he made his livelihood. As he testified at trial, Defendant's household expenses in early 2009 were approximately $40,000.00 each month, and he earned enough through TGI to service\n   those obligations. Once TGI's business began waning significantly (which happened before but was exacerbated by the ATF raid) so that TGI was not earning sufficient income to meet its financial obligations, Defendant likewise could not meet his own personal financial obligations. More importantly, the record also reflects that Defendant made forty-one loans to TGI of at least $883,000.00 that were not paid in full until after execution of the ISDA, such that it was in Defendant's personal interest for TGI to resolve its financial problems with Plaintiffs, allowing it to pay its debt obligations to Defendant. [\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 12.] One final factor in the benefits-theory analysis is the fact that the very inventory that Defendant transferred to Plaintiffs in the ISDA was also subject to the security interest of Citizens for loans to Defendant, individually. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 68, 175A-D, 176A-L, 177A-L, 177O, 187, 188.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Thus, the Court finds ample evidence that Defendant benefited both individually and as owner of TGI by entering into the ISDA with Plaintiffs, and the debt forgiven by Plaintiffs under the ISDA provided a tangible and significant benefit not only to TGI but also to Defendant, thus satisfying the first element of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) as to all aspects of the ISDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    False Pretenses and/or False Misrepresentations and Defendant's Intent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   The second and third elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) that must be satisfied are whether the benefit that Defendant obtained by the ISDA was obtained through either false pretenses or material false representations\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   and whether Defendant acted with fraudulent intent through such false pretenses or false representations to induce Plaintiffs to enter into the ISDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan recently defined \"false pretenses\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   \"A 'false pretense' involves an implied misrepresentation or conduct intended to create or foster a false impression.

The Court also finds that Defendant acted with fraudulent intent to induce Plaintiffs' execution of the ISDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Based on the record before it, and notwithstanding Defendant's testimony to the contrary, the Court finds that when the parties were negotiating the ISDA, Defendant was aware of and made false representations to Plaintiffs concerning the ATF's stance on the importability and resale of the \"dual use\" firearms with barrels that were previously part of a machinegun. Hugh Lansden testified that he was never told that any of TGI's Forms 6 had been denied before 2009, and that after the raid, he and the other plaintiffs went to the TGI facility to meet with Defendant, who said that he would get all of the seized inventory back. Similarly, Butch Cash also testified that he had no knowledge that the ATF had ever denied any of TGI's Forms 6 before the raid. He also clarified that the ISDA required Defendant to withdraw the pending Forms 6 because of his trouble with the ATF. Carl Lansden testified that Defendant explained that the ATF was taking the position that \"once a machinegun, always a machinegun,\" but that the firearms pledged as collateral had never been in the military and that the firearms in Hungary were not machineguns and could be sold whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   As early as 2006, the ATF had rejected Defendant's Form 6 applications and was advised by a letter dated October 12, 2007, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   [I]n March 2006, ATF clarified its position on the dual use barrels and that ATF can approve importation permits for dual use barrels when the application is supported by information sufficient to show the barrels will be used by the importer to assemble firearms that would otherwise qualify for importation under 18 USC 925(d)(3) [, which] explains that firearms are not eligible to be imported if they are National Firearms Act firearms,\n   <em>\n    surplus military firearms\n   </em>\n   , or firearms not generally recognized to be particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes .... ATF has read all supporting documentation submitted with application # 07-04297 [for firearms at ARMACO] ..., [and] ATF has determined that the AMD-65 parts kits with barrels are not importable pursuant to 925(d)(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   [Trial Ex. 166, Attach. D (emphasis added).] The supporting documentation referenced in the ATF's rejection letter included a declaration from a Hungarian official explaining that the AMD-65 assault rifles sought to be imported from Hungary by TGI were never used by any military.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Not only did Carl Lansden testify that Defendant told him that the ARMACO Inventory had never been in the military, but Butch Cash also testified that during the ISDA negotiations, Defendant provided to Plaintiffs a copy of the documentation from the Hungarian official that had been rejected by the ATF in October 2007. Defendant denies that he gave the documentation to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The record reflects that nearly one month after the ISDA was signed, Defendant wrote to ARMACO asking for a copy of the same Hungarian documentation, saying that \"\n   <em>\n    [m]ost\n   </em>\n   of this documentation was taken from us when the BATF first took our inventories of the SA2000M ... in November 2009.\" [Trial Ex. 99 (emphasis added).] Still, given Defendant's continuing assertion that the firearms were importable because they \"were owned not by the Army but by the Workers' Militia\" [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ], and given that Defendant's letter to ARMACO asking for another copy indicated only that \"most\" of the documentation was taken by ATF, the Court rejects Defendant's denial that he used such a claim-or provided a copy of some of the Hungarian documentation-to convince Plaintiffs that the ATF was wrong and that the ARMACO Inventory was importable. And, given Defendant's knowledge of the ATF's rejection when he presented the information to Plaintiffs (whether orally or in writing) in an effort to assure them that the ARMACO Inventory would be importable, such was a false representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Additionally, notwithstanding his testimony that he did not consider that the debts owed by TGI to Citizens, ARMACO, or NWI constituted any actual encumbrance against TGI's inventory, and that he did not hide the fact that TGI owed money to those entities, as previously stated, the Court also finds that Defendant intentionally and falsely represented to Plaintiffs that the inventory was unencumbered when the record establishes that it was encumbered by the consensual liens of Citizens, the perfected and registered lien of NWI, and the imposed lien of ARMACO. Defendant's silence concerning the debts owed and the communications he had with Bero and ARMACO that the inventory would not be released until payment was received and his subsequent express representations in the ISDA that the inventory was unencumbered, notwithstanding his knowledge to the contrary, were material misrepresentations made with fraudulent intent.

At trial, each Plaintiff testified credibly that he was told and believed that the ARMACO Inventory was, as reflected in the ISDA itself, unencumbered. Each Plaintiff also testified that he would not have agreed to the ISDA had he known that the ARMACO Inventory was encumbered in any way or that any of the firearms to be transferred under the ISDA were illegal and/or not importable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Plaintiffs had a history of loans with TGI: both Carl Lansden and Butch Cash began loaning TGI money in 2005, and there was a four-year history of timely repayment of loans by TGI before the ATF's seizures. Additionally, Plaintiffs knew that Keith Cash had been working with Defendant for years, and their association with TGI was aiding Waffen Werks, which was how Keith Cash made his livelihood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   As for the inception of the ISDA, Butch Cash testified that although he believes he prepared the first draft and was actively involved in the negotiations, the ISDA was Defendant's idea. That the ISDA was Defendant's idea was also confirmed by Hugh Lansden's testimony. Butch Cash also testified that Defendant had neither said nor\n   done anything to lead Plaintiffs to believe that he was untrustworthy and that neither Defendant nor Keith Cash told Plaintiffs that money was owed against any of the ARMACO Inventory or that there were any liens or debt owed on any of the inventory being transferred by the ISDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   These facts support Plaintiffs' reasonable expectation that Defendant was trustworthy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Plaintiffs also were justified in believing Defendant's representations concerning the ATF and the future ability to import the ARMACO Inventory, especially in light of the Forms 6 that Defendant provided to Plaintiffs showing approval for importation of the type of items that were included in the ARMACO Inventory. Although the Forms 6 later proved to be false, there was no reason for Plaintiffs to believe that they were anything but valid when they entered into the ISDA. Both Butch Cash and Hugh Lansden testified that Defendant did not tell Plaintiffs that that the ATF had rejected TGI's Form 6 applications before 2009. Carl Lansden testified that he was unaware that the barrels being imported by Defendant and TGI were illegal, as did Hugh, who testified that if he had known that Defendant was importing illegal barrels, he would not have loaned TGI money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Concerning whether the ARMACO Inventory was unencumbered, at trial, Keith Cash testified that he told Plaintiffs that there would be other costs associated with getting the ARMACO Inventory out of Hungary;\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the Court finds that his testimony concerning what he-and in turn, Plaintiffs-knew prior to execution of the ISDA with respect to the ARMACO Inventory was not credible and, in any event, was insufficient to prove that either he or Plaintiffs knew before April 29 that the ARMACO Inventory was not unencumbered. First, Keith's trial testimony during cross-examination by Defendant's counsel, that he became aware that TGI owed guardian and storage fees to ARMACO before execution of the ISDA, directly contradicted his deposition testimony a year before trial, when he testified that he was unaware that any costs were owed on the ARMACO Inventory. His attempt to provide an adequate explanation of the discrepancies when Plaintiffs' counsel impeached him at trial was unpersuasive. Furthermore, even if Keith was aware before execution of the ISDA that TGI owed money to ARMACO for storage and guardian fees, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Keith and/or Plaintiffs would have been aware that ARMACO would not release the ARMACO Inventory until those fees were paid. There is, however,\n   documentary proof that\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   knew that ARMACO would not release the inventory unless TGI made significant payments to ARMACO, and as previously discussed, Defendant's failure to so notify Plaintiffs constitutes a material omission and evidence of false pretenses on his part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   <em>\n    FTZ Inventory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' testimony that they did not expect to pay storage fees or demilling costs to obtain the FTZ Inventory, there is evidentiary proof that Waffen Werks-and Keith Cash as its owner-were notified in writing that there were other costs being imposed on the FTZ Inventory and it would not be released unless the past due amounts were paid. The question is whether Keith's knowledge is imputable to Plaintiffs, which is answered by deciding whether Keith was acting as Plaintiffs' agent before the ISDA was executed. Plaintiffs have insisted that Keith did not become their agent until execution of the ISDA. Hugh testified that Keith was designated as Plaintiffs' agent right before they executed the ISDA because he possessed a FFL and was highly knowledgeable about importing guns. Carl testified that Keith was not authorized to act as his agent prior to April 29, 2010, and he expressly denied that Keith possessed the authority to act on his behalf with respect to picking up the firearms reflected in Trial Exhibit 132 on December 22, 2009. Butch testified that he never told Defendant that Keith could speak for him and never authorized Keith to act as an agent for him before April 29, 2010; that Carl first asked Keith to be Plaintiffs' agent during the meeting held at Moseley's office; and that it seemed like a natural progression for Keith to be Plaintiffs' agent based on his experience, that he had a FFL, and that he had a relationship with Defendant.

Keith also was the person who picked up TGI inventory to be credited to the debt owed to Carl in December 2009, after the ATF raid. Keith testified that both Carl and Butch knew that he was taking possession of the inventory identified on a receipt signed by Keith and Defendant on December 22, 2009. Carl denied at trial that Keith was authorized to pick up the inventory items or to sign the receipt, but those same items were listed in the Delivered TGI Inventory in Exhibit B to the ISDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Trial Exs. 2, Ex. B; 132.] Also, the January 6 and January 26 MOUs, although\n   superseded by the ISDA, identify Waffen Werks as the entity to which ownership of inventory will be effected to repay TGI's debt. [Trial Exs. 62, 250.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   Critically, Keith was the middleman between Plaintiffs and Defendant during negotiation of the ISDA. As early as December 2009, Defendant was advising ARMACO that TGI was \"in the process of transferring ownership of a yet to be determined portion of the 10,000 pcs of dismounted AMD's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] stored at FEG to Waffen Werks.\" [Trial Ex. 90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Exs. 92, 95.] Keith travelled to Germany in March 2010, to meet ARMACO's chairman and answer his questions about Waffen Werks's ability to obtain the necessary permits so that ARMACO could obtain the necessary Hungarian permits to export to Waffen Werks. Moreover, Keith was intimately involved in the pre-ISDA negotiations such that he and his staff were communicating directly with Drew Derco and Matt Cook, the attorneys advising and representing Plaintiffs during those negotiations. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Ex. 245.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Thus, under a totality of the circumstances, it was not unreasonable-in fact, it was entirely reasonable based on Plaintiffs' conduct and acquiescence concerning Keith's involvement-for Defendant and Keith to believe that Keith and, by extension, Waffen Werks, were acting as agents for Plaintiffs before actual agency commenced on April 29, 2010. Critically, it was also reasonable for others dealing with the parties during that time, including Tim Bero and others with NWI, to believe that Keith was Plaintiffs' agent. Why else would Tim Bero's wife send to Waffen Werks a letter on March 31, 2010, attaching the unpaid TGI invoices for storage from January 2010 through April 2010 and the inventory completed by the CBP in connection with the ATF raid? Keith testified that he had communications with Tim Bero about the money owed by TGI, and the March 31 letter supports that testimony (\"Mr. Bero requested that I fax the storage invoices .... I look forward to working with you in the future.\"). [Trial Ex. 273.] Despite the express testimony of Butch and Carl that Keith never told them that there was money owed with respect to either the ARMACO or the FTZ Inventory, Keith testified that he did tell Plaintiffs that there was money owed to the FTZ. As referenced above concerning the ARMACO Inventory, the Court does not find Keith's testimony to be particularly credible; however, in this instance, there is documentary proof that Keith, who was at the time Plaintiffs' agent under the doctrine of apparent agency, knew about TGI's debt concerning the FTZ Inventory. Thus, once Keith was notified by NWI about these expenses relating to the FTZ Inventory, no matter the amount, Plaintiffs were on constructive notice to determine the accuracy of the information. As a result, Plaintiffs' reliance on Defendant's representations that the FTZ Inventory was unencumbered was not justifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   In summary, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden of proof that they are entitled to a determination of nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) as to any outstanding amounts attributable to the ARMACO Inventory but have not met their burden of proof with respect to the FTZ Inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   In the Sixth Circuit, bankruptcy courts possess the jurisdiction and authority to adjudicate the validity of a claim and award damages, \"inclusive of compensatory and punitive damages, costs, interest, and attorney's fees\" in connection with an adversary proceeding to determine dischargeability.\n   <em>\n    R &amp; L Pricecorp LLC v.

The Court now agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendant waived the affirmative defense of mitigation by failing to raise it in any pleading filed with the Court. Defendant argued that he was not required to plead mitigation because mitigation is not listed in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c). [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 84, p. 56.] Not so. It matters not that this case is governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that Rule 8(c) does not list mitigation of damages as an affirmative defense. \"[B]oth the federal rule and the state rule [concerning the requirement to plead affirmative defenses] are phrased as being inclusive, and not exhaustive. In other words, the absence of the [mitigation of damages] defense in the list of various kinds of defenses that may be asserted to a cause of action does not mean that it should not be considered as an affirmative defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Seaver v.

[Trial Ex. 183.] (This appears to be contrary, in spirit if not in fact, to what Defendant told ARMACO on July 20 when he said that \"[b]ased on recent comments from our BATF and our Washington, DC attorney, it is now our belief that BATF will never reverse its improper opinion that the original barrels are not importable.\" [Trial Ex. 102.] Defendant went on to explain to Citizens that TGI was in the process of shifting of its business from primarily manufacturing to importation of surplus firearms and ammunition, referencing a March 2010 contract with a company in Ukraine and a contract with a company in Romania for collectible pistols, as well as a contract with Bulgaria, all of which were anticipated to yield gross profits in the next twelve months of $2,450,000.00 plus gross revenue of $245,000.00.
