Detweiler Enterprises, Inc. (\"JJDEI\") and Sequatchie Mountain LLC (\"Sequatchie LLC\"). Sequatchie LLC was established by Detweiler to facilitate the Sequatchie Pointe project (\"Sequatchie Pointe\"), a planned development of over 6,756 acres of land straddling Marion County Tennessee and Dade County Georgia. Lots were sold between October 2006 and October 2008 by the Sequatchie Pointe sales force.

Plaintiffs appealed the bankruptcy court's rulings from the trial and upon reconsideration. No cross-appeal was filed.

No. 1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs identify three items in the statement of issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1. Did the trial court err by finding against the Plaintiffs because Detweiler's agents made fraudulent representations rather than Detweiler making the fraudulent representations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Did the trial court err by finding Detweiler was not liable for the actions and or inactions of his agents, employees, and independent contractors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Did the trial court err by not applying Tennessee law when the Plaintiffs were defrauded in Tennessee land purchases and Tennessee had the most significant contracts to the allegations?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Pls. Br. at 1151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As plaintiffs describe it,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [t]he crux of this appeal turns on the issue of whether Detweiler can be held liable for the fraudulent actions and inactions of his agents. This case presents a slightly more nuanced question about who possessed the requisite knowledge to knowingly make a material misrepresentation to the purchasers. Detweiler certainly knew that the development was financially inviable and admitted as much during his deposition. However, while instructions to invent construction deadlines were given to the salespeople, none of them had knowledge of the financial invaibility [sic] of the development. As that salesforce was working for Detweiler, and by not informing the staff that these sales representations were false, Detweiler must be held liable for those fraudulent misrepresentation [sic]-and the analysis needs to focus on what Detweiler knew, and when, rather than what the salespeople knew.... The trial court erred by examining whether the sales people were aware of the inviability of the project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1172-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The issues on appeal focus on questions of agency law, and the choice of law applicable thereto. But the underlying premise asserted in the statement of issues regarding Detweiler's liability is that the Sequatchie Pointe sales force made fraudulent representations about project completion deadlines. The bankruptcy court ruled, however, that neither Detweiler nor the\n   Sequatchie Pointe sales force made false representations with an intent to deceive plaintiffs regarding project completion deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although not specifically identified in the statement of issues, plaintiffs challenge the bankruptcy court's rulings on issues of both fact and law concerning the premise underlying their statement of issues-allegedly false representations made to plaintiffs with an intent to deceive about construction timelines.

The issue before the bankruptcy court regarding this element was whether Detweiler and the Sequatchie Pointe sales force either knew the timelines for completion of amenities and utilities were false, or were grossly reckless regarding the truth of the timelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The bankruptcy court concluded that, although the timelines turned out to be inaccurate, the sales force did not know their statements were false because they were simply passing along information provided by their supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to Detweiler, the bankruptcy court found that even though Detweiler directly made representations regarding project timelines to some plaintiffs, or confirmed representations made by the sales force, there was no evidence that Detweiler knew at the time that those representations were false.

From this factual determination, the bankruptcy court concluded that when Detweiler and the sales force represented timelines for project completion to plaintiffs purchasing lots between 2006 and 2008, they did not intend to deceive plaintiffs because, at the time the lots were sold, Detweiler intended to complete Sequatchie Pointe and did not know that, ultimately, he would be unable to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Challenges on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the primary question on appeal is what Detweiler knew about the viability of the Sequatchie Pointe project and when he knew it, and that issue is central to analysis of plaintiffs' \u00a7 523 nondischargeability claims. Underlying this primary issue are plaintiffs' factual and legal challenges to the bankruptcy court's conclusion that neither the Sequatchie Pointe sales force, nor Detweiler, made false representations to, or intended to deceive, plaintiffs who purchased lots between 2006 and 2008 regarding project completion deadlines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But, before those challenges can be addressed, the Court must first rule on two independent legal issues raised by plaintiffs on appeal. The first is whether the bankruptcy court properly excluded the HUD\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   report as evidence of alleged false representations, and the second is whether the bankruptcy court applied the proper legal standard for determining fraudulent intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The bankruptcy court did not err in excluding the HUD report as evidence of misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In their post-trial brief submitted to the bankruptcy court, plaintiffs argued that the HUD report prepared by Detweiler for Sequatchie Pointe, and provided to plaintiffs, contained false representations regarding the project and should be considered by that court as evidence for plaintiffs' \u00a7 532(a)(2)(A) claims. The bankruptcy court ruled, however, that the alleged deficiencies in the HUD report could not be used as a factual basis for plaintiffs' false representation claims because that issue was raised by plaintiffs for the first time in post-trial briefing in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), and was not tried by implied consent. But, because Detweiler cross-examined plaintiffs at trial as to whether they received the HUD reports in refuting plaintiffs' justifiable reliance, the bankruptcy court considered the reports for the limited purpose of weighing that defense.\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11. Although not identified in the statement of issues, plaintiffs contend on appeal\n   that the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to consider the HUD reports as additional evidence of fraudulent representation under \u00a7 534(a)(2)(A). (Pls. Br. at 1200-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The relief plaintiffs seek on appeal is a reversal of the bankruptcy court's ruling and remand for a determination of damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1204.) But even if the Court were to reverse the bankruptcy court's exclusion of the HUD report, the only relief that this Court could provide is to remand the case to the bankruptcy court for a determination as to whether the HUD report constituted a false representation under \u00a7 532(a)(2)(A) and, if it did, whether that finding affected the outcome of the bankruptcy court's analysis of fraudulent intent. Thus, the Court considers the HUD issue first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs do not contend that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that: (1) plaintiffs raised the issue of the HUD report's deficiencies in support of their fraudulent misrepresentations claim for the first time in their post-trial brief, (2) there was no discussion or testimony at trial regarding the HUD report's alleged deficiencies, and (3) defendant was not on notice of the issue of the HUD report's deficiencies prior to plaintiffs' post trial brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11. But plaintiffs argue on appeal that the HUD report was prepared by Detweiler and stipulated into evidence at trial, and that Detweiler used the report at trial in an attempt to show that plaintiffs did not justifiably rely on any alleged misrepresentations regarding their properties that were made by Detweiler or the Sequatchie Pointe sales force. Plaintiffs reason, therefore, that in their post-trial brief they were merely pointing out the deficiencies in the report, and those deficiencies should be admissible as evidence of false representations. (Pls. Br. at 1200-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs cite no legal authority in support of their argument that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law by excluding the HUD reports as evidence of misrepresentation by Detweiler.

Br. at 1173.) Fraudulent intent can be found based upon circumstantial evidence and the totality of the circumstances. As the bankruptcy court pointed out, fraudulent intent could be established from circumstantial evidence by showing, for example, that Detweiler continued to sell lots after he knew\n   the project was impossible to complete.\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *15. The bankruptcy court found, however, that the evidence showed Detweiler did not know Sequatchie Pointe could not be completed until January 2009 and, because the last lot was sold in 2008, that court concluded that Detweiler did not possess fraudulent intent at the time construction completion timelines were represented to plaintiffs. This conclusion contains both factual and legal components.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Sequatchie Pointe was funded by a package of agreements with the lender, ArborOne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the issue of Detweiler's intent, the bankruptcy court considered Detweiler's deposition testimony that he always intended to complete the project and did not realize the project could not be finished until ArborOne required 100% of lot sales.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court also considered the testimony of Robert Spivey (\"Spivey\") and Russell Phillips (\"Phillips\"), both of whom had knowledge of the ArborOne financing and defaults. They testified that: (1) ArborOne did not require 100% of lot sales until January 2009, and (2) completion of Sequatchie Pointe did not become unfeasible until January 2009 when ArborOne required 100% of lot sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6. \"The testimony of Mr. Phillips and Mr. Spivey confirm [sic] that ArborOne continued to fund the project until January of 2009.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16. After considering all the evidence, the bankruptcy court found that ArborOne did not require 100% of lot sales (effectively ending funding for the project) until January 2009 when an installment loan payment was missed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bankruptcy court also found that Detweiler personally signed for Sequatchie Pointe loans, mortgaged other properties, and sold receivables in order to procure funds for Sequatchie Pointe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6.

Plaintiffs contend that the bankruptcy court \"turned a blind eye\" to Detweiler's admission that he knew \"it was over\" when he received a letter from the lender on May 16, 2007 and, thus, representations to plaintiffs purchasing lots between 2006 and 2008 regarding project completion timelines were false and made with the intent to deceive. (Pls. Br. at 1164-65, 1174-77.) The Court applies the clearly erroneous standard to plaintiffs' appeal of this factual issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The \"admission\" to which plaintiffs refer is Detweiler's deposition testimony that, \"[w]hen [ArborOne] sent me a letter and said they wanted 100 percent of the [lot sales], I knew it was over with.\" (Pls. App. at 1332.) Plaintiffs maintain that this admission concerns a letter Detweiler received from ArborOne dated May 16, 2007. (Pls. Br. at 1174.) But Detweiler testified at his deposition that he did not know the date when ArborOne required 100% of lot sales. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. App. at 1332.) Plaintiffs argue that the bankruptcy court \"gives no explanation for why the [bankruptcy] court believes the May 16, 2007 letter does not say exactly what it says.\" (Pls. Br. at 1177.) But on appeal, plaintiffs do not point this Court to any language in the May 16, 2007 letter regarding 100% of lot sales, nor did the Court's examination of the letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   reveal such language. Plaintiffs contend that multiple deponents testified about the May 2007 letter, but do not point the Court to any testimony that ArborOne actually required 100% of lot sales in May 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The bankruptcy court considered the May 2007 letter from ArborOne at trial, and found that it advised Detweiler of technical defaults related to owner equity in the project, but waived the default under conditions (other than 100% of lot sales) that were met by Detweiler.\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. Plaintiffs' argument on appeal attempts to reframe Detweiler's \"admission\" that he knew the project could not be completed when ArborOne required 100% of lot sales, to an admission that he knew the project could not be completed when the loans were in curable default of the owner equity provision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Br. at 1175 (\"[A]nd all of the purchases occurred when Detweiler was in default of, at the very least, his equity to debt ratio obligation.... This is all a critical component of understanding exactly when Detweiler explicitly stated that he knew he would never complete the project[.]\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The bankruptcy court's finding that Detweiler did not know that he could not complete Sequatchie Pointe until January 2009 when ArborOne ceased funding the project is not clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs' entire argument is based upon the premise that the bankruptcy court should have viewed the facts differently. But that court's factual determination as to when Detweiler knew the project could not be completed is not clearly erroneous simply\n   because a different conclusion may have been possible.\n   <em>\n    In re Cottingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141564\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/473/703/#p705\">\n    473 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   705-06 ;\n   <em>\n    Gen.

The bankruptcy court's fact finding that Detweiler did not realize that he could not complete the project until January 2009 is supported by the record and, considering all of the evidence, this Court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that an error has been committed.\n   <em>\n    In re Cottingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141564\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/473/703/#p705\">\n    473 B.R. at 705-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue on appeal, as they did at trial, that Detweiler's intent to defraud is demonstrated by his alleged instructions to utilize construction equipment on weekends to make it appear that construction was being done, and to use CB\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   radios to make it appear that lots were being sold. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Br. at 1162-73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   With respect to the alleged use of radios by the Sequatchie Pointe sales force to broadcast fake lot sales, plaintiffs cite the testimony of project manager Dan Graber (\"Graber\") and salesperson Brandon Olinger (\"Olinger\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Br. at 1163.) But the bankruptcy court found that the testimony of Graber was not credible for reasons detailed in that court's rulings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Olinger's testimony does not help plaintiffs' cause. Olinger testified that (1) Graber had the idea of using \"walkie-talkies\" and a \"failed attempt\" to use them, (2) but he never had one, and (3) was not aware of radios ever being used to convey fake lot sales at Sequatchie Pointe. (Adversary Case Doc. No. 213-1 at page 25-26 of 93.) Detweiler, who had used radios in the past for a different project, denied that CB's were used at Sequatchie Pointe. (Pls. App. at 1329.) As before, plaintiffs' argument regarding the radios simply advocates a different view of the evidence. This is insufficient to establish that the bankruptcy court was clearly erroneous in finding that plaintiffs failed to show radios were actually used to broadcast fake lot sales as described by Graber, or that any impetus for doing so arose from Detweiler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   With respect to the use of construction equipment on weekends, Detweiler testified that he may have told Graber to operate construction equipment on weekends if there was an actual construction purpose, but not simply to make it appear that construction was underway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1330.) Other than the testimony of Graber (whom the bankruptcy court determined was not credible), there is no evidence that any use of construction equipment on the weekends was not actually for a construction purpose, and the bankruptcy court's finding in that regard is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nor did the bankruptcy court err in its legal conclusion that, based on the totality of the evidence, Detweiler did not possess an intent to defraud. \"A fraudulent promise under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) requires proof that at the time the debtor made it, he or she did not intend to perform as required.\"\n   <em>\n    Risk v.

The bankruptcy court did not err in concluding plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proof as to the Sequatchie Pointe sales force with respect to elements 1 and 2 of their \u00a7 523 claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the bankruptcy court erred in examining whether the Sequatchie Pointe sales force had an intent to deceive plaintiffs and should have, instead, focused on whether Detweiler had an intent to deceive. Plaintiffs' theory is that, even if the sales force did not intend to deceive plaintiffs, Detweiler is liable because he knew that Sequatchie\n   Pointe was not viable from the inception of the project, and is therefore responsible for the representations of his sales force that ultimately proved to be inaccurate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Br. at 1192.) The Court has held, however, that the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding the plaintiffs failed to establish the first two elements of their \u00a7 523 claims as to Detweiler. Because the Court has affirmed the bankruptcy court's ruling that Detweiler did not possess fraudulent intent at the time the sales force represented project completion timelines to plaintiffs, it is arguably unnecessary for the Court to consider plaintiffs' appellate arguments regarding the sales force. The Court will nevertheless briefly address those arguments for the sake of completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiffs concede that the Sequatchie Pointe sales force was unaware of the financial viability of the project, but insist that the sales force was grossly negligent by representing construction timelines to plaintiffs with no supporting knowledge, and intentionally deceived plaintiffs with deceptive sales practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1170 n.3.) These arguments are unavailing on appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, gross negligence is not the legal standard for analyzing either the first or second element of a \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Looney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180569\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/453/252/#p259\">\n    453 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   259 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Rembert,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"191538,1275437\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/141/277/\">\n    141 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280-81 ). But even if gross negligence were sufficient for the first element, plaintiffs' arguments would still fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   With respect to plaintiffs' contention that the Sequatchie Pointe sales force represented construction timelines to plaintiffs with no supporting knowledge, plaintiffs do not maintain that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the timelines represented to plaintiffs by the Sequatchie Pointe sales force were based upon bond documents for the roads and upon information received from Graber, the Sequatchie Pointe project manager.\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Ervin Moore (\"Moore\") testified with respect to project timelines that members of the sales force \"were only using the information at hand[,]\" that he did not \"think that any of [the sales force] literally went out there to mislead anyone.\" (Pls. App. at 1478.) Moore's testimony was corroborated by the testimony of other members of the sales force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The bankruptcy court's factual finding that the Sequatchie Pointe sales force used construction timelines provided to them by their supervisor is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that some members of the sales force were told by Graber at a meeting to lie about project completion dates and, thus, intended to deceive plaintiffs by doing so. (Pls. Br. at 1157, citing the deposition of Moore.) Moore, who was present at that meeting, testified that Detweiler was not present and there was no indication that Graber's statements originated with Detweiler in any way. As Moore put it, \"I think it was all [Graber].\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. App. at 1465-67.) Indeed, Moore testified that, in his view, Detweiler would have fired a sales person for misrepresenting or lying to a prospective purchaser. (Def. App. at 2311.). Moreover, plaintiffs have not shown that members of the sales force actually lied to plaintiffs about deadlines. Finally, plaintiffs contend that the sales force intentionally deceived plaintiffs by employing deceptive sales practices by using a radio to call out fake lot sales, which has already been addressed by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments on appeal regarding the first two elements of their \u00a7 523 claim as to the Sequatchie Pointe sales force simply advocate their own view of how the bankruptcy court should have construed\n   the facts. That court's findings of fact, however, are not clearly erroneous simply because two different views of the evidence are possible.\n   <em>\n    In re Cottingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141564\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/473/703/#p705\">\n    473 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   705-06 ;\n   <em>\n    Gen.

The bankruptcy court's factual findings are supported by the record, and this Court is not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Thus, the Court concludes that the bankruptcy court's findings of fact underlying its legal conclusion that the Sequatchie Pointe sales force did not make false representations with an intent to deceive plaintiffs regarding project completion timelines are not clearly erroneous. And, after conducting a de novo review, the Court also concludes that the bankruptcy court did not commit an error of law in holding that these facts were insufficient for plaintiffs to establish the first and second elements of their \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claims.\n   <em>\n    In re Cottingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4141564\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/473/703/#p705\">\n    473 B.R. at 705-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Thus, the bankruptcy court found Detweiler was liable through the theory of imputed fraud for the misrepresentations concerning bonds to the McAvoys, Stones, and Ferkinhoffs, and those debts were not dischargeable.\n   <em>\n    In re Detweiler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n    2017 WL 650062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19. That ruling by the bankruptcy court is not on appeal here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The issue of imputed agency concerning representations about project completion deadlines was not decided by the bankruptcy court (under federal or state law) because the bankruptcy court determined that, while Detweiler may not have recognized his limitations and may have underestimated the experience required to complete a project like Sequatchie Pointe, those shortcomings did not equate to a finding of intent to deceive under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) under federal bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Because the Court has affirmed the bankruptcy court's ruling that, as a matter of law, neither Detweiler nor the sales force made false representations or intended to deceive plaintiffs with respect to representations concerning project completion deadlines, there is no liability to impute in either direction between Detweiler and the Sequatchie Pointe sales force.

It is not the Court's duty to search the record and discern, on plaintiffs' behalf, which facts and arguments are relevant to their arguments on appeal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Kennedy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11098870,11108159\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/576/\">\n     249 F.3d 576\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 579 n.3 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing\n    <em>\n     Morales v.

At trial, plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to an adverse inference with respect to Detweiler and his daughter, Cheryl McDonald (\"McDonald\"), because they did not testify at trial. The bankruptcy court declined to apply a negative inference because plaintiffs subpoenaed both witnesses and both were available to testify. Detweiler was present at trial. Although plaintiffs could have called Detweiler and McDonald to testify, they did not do so, electing instead to introduce Detweiler's deposition testimony.\n    <em>\n     In re Detweiler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n     2017 WL 650062\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9. Plaintiffs mention the issue of adverse inference in a footnote (Pls. Br. n.4), but do not challenge the bankruptcy court's finding regarding the availability of Detweiler and McDonald to testify at trial, or that plaintiffs made a tactical decision to neither call those witnesses at trial nor introduce their deposition testimony into evidence. Nor do plaintiffs argue that the bankruptcy court incorrectly applied the law with respect to adverse inferences. To the extent that plaintiffs' footnote constitutes an appeal of the bankruptcy court's adverse inference ruling, the Court has reviewed both the underlying facts and law, and finds no error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Plaintiffs do not challenge on appeal the bankruptcy court's general description of Detweiler's financing arrangements for Sequatchie Pointe.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Detweiler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20650062\">\n     2017 WL 650062\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5. Briefly, JJDEI purchased the land for Sequatchie Pointe for $10,898,600.00. The project was financed by ArborOne Enterprises, Inc. (\"ArborOne\") utilizing two loans and a revolving line of credit that involved Sequatchie LLC, JJDEI, Detweiler, and Wilder Mountain LLC (one of JJDEI's previous projects). Detweiler received default letters from ArborOne in December 2006, May 2007, and July 2007 related to the covenant requiring Detweiler to maintain 35% equity in the project. In these letters, ArborOne set forth terms by which ArborOne would waive the default, and Detweiler met those terms. In January 2009, however, the loans were declared in default because an installment payment was missed. Detweiler appealed and attempted to refinance the loans, but ArborOne denied his appeal by letter dated April 2, 2009.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Spivey testified that Detweiler's default in January 2009 was the first monetary default of his loan with ArborOne for Sequatchie Pointe.
