In the Complaint, Plaintiff seeks a determination that the debt owed him by Defendant-Debtor is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (a)(6).

[Doc. # 13-2, p. 3]. On July 13, 2015, Defendant-Debtor and Plaintiff entered into an oral business agreement though which Defendant-Debtor agreed to perform repairs and improvements on a 1937 Ford replica kit car (\"Ford Automobile Project\"). [Doc. # 12-1, p. 1; Doc. # 13-2, p. 3]. In exchange, Plaintiff alleges that he paid Defendant-Debtor a $3,500 deposit, with a definite total cost of $5,500 due upon completion of the improvement work. [Doc. # 13, p. 2; Doc. # 13-2, pp. 3-4]. Defendant-Debtor, on the other hand, alleges that Plaintiff paid a deposit of $1,500, with an estimated total cost ranging from $5,500 to $6,500 due upon completion. [Doc. # 12, pp. 1-2; Doc. # 12-1, p. 2]. Defendant-Debtor further alleges that he did not give Plaintiff a definite total cost because Defendant-Debtor charged an hourly rate and could thus only provide Plaintiff with a cost estimate. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Per Defendant-Debtor's version of events, Defendant-Debtor completed work on the first batch of Ford parts, after which Plaintiff picked up the finished parts, paid Defendant-Debtor with two separate checks amounting to $2,000, and dropped off a second batch of Ford parts. [Doc. # 12-1, p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant-Debtor asserts that he informed Plaintiff in October of 2015 that the total cost of the Ford Automobile Project would exceed the earlier estimate of $5,500 to $6,500, that $1,801.54 was due for work already performed, and that additional funds were needed for Defendant-Debtor to continue the project. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff refused Defendant-Debtor's request for additional funds and in response, Defendant-Debtor demanded that Plaintiff remove the unfinished automobile from Defendant-Debtor's premises and pay the outstanding balance. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. # 13-2, p. 2]. The parties agree that Plaintiff removed some of the parts from the premises, but could not fit all of the parts into his truck. [Doc. # 12-1, pp. 2-3; Doc. # 13-2, p. 4]. Though Plaintiff intended to return and pick up the remaining parts, Defendant-Debtor asserts that he informed Plaintiff over the phone that he refused to turn the parts over \"[u]nder Ohio common law provisions.\" [Doc. # 13-2, p. 4; Doc. # 12-1, p. 3]. Defendant-Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment also avers that the retained parts have already been removed from Defendant-Debtor's possession by the Wood County Sheriff's Department. [Doc. # 12, p. 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's version of events surrounding the breakdown of the Ford Automobile Project differs from Defendant-Debtor's in the following respects: 1) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant-Debtor said, \"get your f---ing parts out of my shop and you don't owe me a dime,\" once Plaintiff refused Defendant-Debtor's request for additional funds [Doc. # 13-2, p. 4]; 2) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant-Debtor refused to turn over Plaintiff's remaining parts while stating, \"if you don't give me\n   an additional $1,800.00, you won't get your remaining parts,\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]; and, 3) Plaintiff also alleges total damages amounting to $20,647.00 \"as a result of Defendant's breach of our initial agreement....\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 25, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant-Debtor and \"Randy's Body and Paint\" in the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas, Case No. 2016 CV 30 (\"State Court Action\"), for money damages stemming from Defendant-Debtor's allegedly improper handling of the Ford Automobile Project. [Doc. # 13, Pl. Ex. A]. Relevant here, Count Six of Plaintiff's complaint (\"Count Six\") alleged violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"OCSPA\"), a statute that, among other things, authorizes an award of treble damages and attorney's fees to a prevailing litigant. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 4-5;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ohio%20Rev.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201345.09\">\n    Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1345.09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), (F)(2) ]. Following Defendant-Debtor's failure to timely file a response to the complaint, Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment. [Doc # 13, Pl. Ex. B]. Plaintiff attached two affidavits to the motion, one describing Plaintiff's damages estimate and the other Plaintiff's attorney's fee estimate. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 6-8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant-Debtor again failed to timely respond and on March 16, 2016, the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas entered a Default Judgment (\"Default Judgment\") against Defendant-Debtor. [Doc. # 1, Pl. Ex. C]. The Default Judgment contains the following pertinent language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff's Complaint herein was filed on or about January 25, 2016. Service was perfected on both Defendants via certified mail on or about February 3, 2016, pursuant to Ohio Civil Rule 4.1(A)(1)(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Twenty-eight (28) days has passed since the service upon the Defendants, and the Defendants have otherwise failed to plead or appear herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Plaintiff further submitted evidence by and through the Affidavit of James Launder and Bradley S. Warren, supporting Plaintiff's claims for damages herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Judgment shall be issued in favor of the Plaintiff, and against the Defendants, Randy Doll, aka Randall Doll and Randy's Body and Paint, jointly and severally, in the aggregate amount of $22,109.50 ($20,647.00 pursuant to Plaintiff's Exhibit 'A' and $1,462.50 in attorney fees, pursuant to Count Six of the Complaint and 'Exhibit B' of the Plaintiff Motion for Default)...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant-Debtor attempted to file an Answer on March 22, 2016, but the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas vacated the late-filed Answer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. D, E]. Defendant-Debtor also filed a Motion for Relief from Judgment that was denied by the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas on June 13, 2016. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. F, H].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Defendant-Debtor filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition. [Case No. 16-33793, Doc. # 1]. Defendant-Debtor's Schedule E/F listed Plaintiff's Default Judgment as a nonpriority unsecured claim with an unknown value. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 19]. Plaintiff timely filed an Adversary Complaint objecting to discharge of the Hancock County judgment debt on April 3, 2017. [Doc. # 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's Adversary Complaint seeks relief on three counts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant-Debtor's handling of the Ford Automobile Project constituted the taking of Plaintiff's money and property by false pretenses, false representation, or actual fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (a)(6). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 4]. Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant-Debtor's retention of\n   the body panels was willful, malicious, and a cause of economic injury under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Third, Plaintiff contends that the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas' Default Judgment binds the parties and entitles Plaintiff to a nondischargeability determination on theories of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   and collateral estoppel. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In his Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff focuses solely on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argues that this court must give preclusive effect to the Default Judgment and determine that Defendant-Debtor's debt owed Plaintiff is nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (a)(6). [Doc. # 13, pp. 4-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his Answer, Defendant-Debtor asserts that the Hancock County Court of Common Pleas' Default Judgment does not contain any findings of fact or law and is thus not due preclusive effect under theories of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   or collateral estoppel. [Doc. # 4, p. 3]. Defendant-Debtor further contends that this Adversary Proceeding should be dismissed for Plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In his Motion to Dismiss and for Summary Judgment, Defendant-Debtor asserts three bases for relief. [Doc. # 12]. First, Defendant-Debtor argues that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the Default Judgment because it contains no findings of fact and did not give Defendant-Debtor an opportunity to present evidence regarding the Ford Automobile Project dispute. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 4]. Second, Defendant-Debtor contends that Plaintiff has failed, in this case, to meet his burden of proving that Defendant-Debtor made false representations with an intent to deceive under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 4-6]. Third, Defendant-Debtor argues that his retention of the Ford automobile body panels was supported by Ohio repairman's lien law, was not wrongful and malicious, and that Plaintiff suffered no irreparable economic harm as a result. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 6-7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, summary judgment is proper only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

[Doc. # 1, p. 4]. While this allegation is relatively threadbare and conclusory, the record's lack of objective evidence regarding Defendant-Debtor's intent counsels against the court's grant of summary judgment under \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Radabaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347057\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/460/#p467\">\n    307 F.3d at 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Defendant-Debtor claims that he retained these parts \"[u]nder Ohio common law provisions,\" the only evidence offered in support consists solely of Defendant-Debtor's affidavit which is, itself, relatively threadbare and conclusory on this issue. [Doc. # 12-1, p. 3]. Without getting to the merits of that\n   claim, the court finds that \"a subjective assessment\" of Defendant-Debtor's credibility via trial is warranted here, particularly given Defendant-Debtor's characterization of his refusal to turnover Plaintiff's parts as \"[u]under Ohio common law provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347057\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/460/#p467\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Laskey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784368\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/441/853/\">\n    441 B.R. at 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Moreover, without evidence detailing precisely what occurred during the course of the Ford Automobile Project, the court is unable to determine whether, as a matter of law, Defendant-Debtor's retention of Plaintiff's automobile parts constitutes an \"intentional injury\" under\n   <em>\n    Geiger\n   </em>\n   . While Defendant-Debtor may have been holding onto Plaintiff's property in good faith, the parties appear to agree that, at least initially, Plaintiff was going to be allowed to remove all of the automobile parts. [Doc. # 12-1, p. 2; Doc. # 13-2, p. 4]. The basis for the change in Defendant-Debtor's position is not reflected in the sparse record before the court, nor is the vague reference to \"Ohio common law provisions\" sufficient. [Doc. # 12-1, p. 3]. As is the case with Defendant-Debtor's pursuit of summary judgment on Plaintiff's \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) claim, the court's ability to draw competing inferences against both parties relative to Defendant-Debtor's retention of Plaintiff's parts weighs against the granting of summary judgment on Plaintiff's \u00a7 523(a)(6) claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"90651\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/338/318/#p327\">\n    338 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   327 ;\n   <em>\n    Varrasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118515,1848796\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/760/\">\n    37 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Accordingly, the court will deny Defendant-Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's \u00a7 523(a)(6) claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Taken as a whole, the record in this case, including the parties' motions, briefs, exhibits, and affidavits, do not provide the court with a sufficient basis to grant either party judgment as a matter of law. Thus, court finds that summary judgment is inappropriate based upon the existence of genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendant-Debtor made material misrepresentations or intended to defraud Plaintiff during the course of the failed Ford Automobile Project, or intended to injure Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   THEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, good cause appearing,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 13] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant-Debtor's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 12] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a pretrial hearing is hereby scheduled for April 18, 2018, at 10:30 a.m., in Courtroom No. 1, Room 119, United States Courthouse, 1716 Spielbusch Avenue, Toledo, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Defendant-Debtor's Motion is titled \"Motion to Dismiss Adversary Proceeding &amp; Motion for Summary Judgment.\" [Doc. # 12].
