Carruth and William Leslie Doggett (the \"Minority Shareholders\") appeal from the bankruptcy court's denial of their motion for relief from the automatic stay and motion for reconsideration in debtor Terell W. Eutsler's (\"Debtor\") chapter 13\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   bankruptcy case. They seek to enforce an option agreement to purchase certain stock from the Debtor. We AFFIRM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts are undisputed. In 1995, the Debtor and Stephen Dorr incorporated Softbase Development, Inc., a closely-held\n   Texas corporation. The Debtor is the president of Softbase and a member of its board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Initially, the Debtor and Mr. Dorr each owned half of the stock. In 1998, the Minority Shareholders purchased 49 percent of the stock for $155,000. Thus, the Debtor and Mr. Dorr each owned 25.5 percent, and the Minority Shareholders each owned 24.5 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the Minority Shareholders bought their stock, the parties entered into a Stock Restriction/Buy-Sell Agreement (the \"Buy-Sell Agreement\"). Among other things, the Buy-Sell Agreement provided that, upon the occurrence of certain \"terminating events,\" one of which was \"the filing of any proceedings for bankruptcy ... by a Shareholder,\" that shareholder was required to give written notice to the corporation and the other shareholders. The corporation then had the option, but not the obligation, to purchase the shareholder's stock at a price based on a formula. If the corporation did not timely exercise the option, then the other shareholders had the same option.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 12, 2015, the Debtor filed his chapter 13 petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington. He valued his interest in Softbase at $5,000. He did not schedule the Buy-Sell Agreement as an executory contract in Schedule G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The bankruptcy court confirmed the Debtor's amended chapter 13 plan on June 3, 2015. The form plan provides blanks for the debtor to list assumed and rejected contracts, but the Debtor did not complete either space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Dorr received notice of the bankruptcy filing as one of the Debtor's unsecured creditors. The Debtor did not send notice of his bankruptcy filing to Softbase or the Minority Shareholders. Neither Softbase nor the other shareholders (Mr. Dorr and the Minority Shareholders) exercised an option to purchase the Debtor's stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A year and a half later, on December 16, 2016, the Minority Shareholders filed a motion seeking relief from the automatic stay (\"Motion for Relief\"). They argued that the Debtor's bankruptcy filing was a \"terminating event\" that triggered the purchase options in the Buy-Sell Agreement. They claimed that they only discovered the Debtor's bankruptcy case on November 18, 2016, when an inspection of Softbase's records revealed the bankruptcy. Because Softbase did not exercise its right to purchase the Debtor's stock, the Minority Shareholders argued that they were entitled to purchase the Debtor's shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Minority Shareholders contended that cause existed to lift the stay because their rights under the Buy-Sell Agreement were unaffected by the Debtor's bankruptcy. They argued that the Buy-Sell Agreement was an executory contract within the meaning of \u00a7 365(a) and, because the Debtor did not accept or reject the Buy-Sell Agreement in his plan, \"the Agreement rode-through Debtor's bankruptcy unaffected.\" They argued that the ipso facto provision (that triggered the option rights upon the Debtor's bankruptcy filing) was enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, the Minority Shareholders argued that the shares were not property of the Debtor's estate and were not subject to the automatic stay because the confirmed chapter 13 plan did not address the Buy-Sell Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor opposed the motion. He argued that if he lost his Softbase stock, his employment would terminate and he would have no income with which to fund his plan. He also contended that the thirty-day period for the Minority Shareholders to\n   exercise the purchase option had expired because Softbase had notice of his bankruptcy as of April 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, he argued that the Buy-Sell Agreement is not an executory contract under \u00a7 365 because the Minority Shareholders failed to exercise their purchase option, which is the only feature of the Buy-Sell Agreement that would give rise to a performance obligation and make it an executory contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the hearing on the Motion for Relief, the chapter 13 trustee sided with the Debtor and expressed concern that granting the requested relief would imperil the Debtor's ability to fund his plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After receiving post-hearing briefing, the bankruptcy court denied the Motion for Relief. The court held that the Buy-Sell Agreement was not an executory contract under the so-called \"Countryman\" definition. As we explain below, a contract is \"executory\" under that definition only if, as of the petition date, all parties to the contract owe duties that, if not performed, would constitute a material breach excusing the other parties' duty to perform. Applying Texas law, the court held that no breach of any of the parties' outstanding obligations as of the petition date would have constituted a material breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court also held that the Bankruptcy Code barred enforcement of the ipso facto provision of the Buy-Sell Agreement. Finally, it was \"concerned that Mr. Eutsler's employment may be in jeopardy if he was forced to sell his interest in the company. Mr. Eutsler's employment income is necessary to make his Chapter 13 Plan payments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Minority Shareholders filed a timely motion to reconsider the ruling on the Motion for Relief (\"Motion for Reconsideration\"), and the bankruptcy court denied it. The Minority Shareholders then filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders denying the Motion for Relief and the Motion for Reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 157(b)(2)(G).

Neither party disputes the second point. With respect to the third point, the Minority Shareholders argued that cause existed to lift the stay solely because the Buy-Sell Agreement rode through the bankruptcy unaffected; conversely, they conceded that, if the Buy-Sell Agreement was not an executory contract and therefore could not \"ride through,\" cause to lift the stay did not exist. Thus, our analysis turns on whether the Buy-Sell Agreement is an executory contract. We hold that the bankruptcy court was correct under controlling\n   Ninth Circuit law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The key, it seems, to deciphering the meaning of the executory contract rejection provisions, is to work backward, proceeding from an examination of the purposes rejection is expected to accomplish. If those objectives have already been accomplished, or if they can't be accomplished through rejection, then the contract is not executory within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act.\"). A very recent law review article makes a powerful argument in favor of a \"modern contract approach\" to executory contracts. Under that approach, all contracts with any unperformed obligation on either side, material or not, are \"executory contracts\" under \u00a7 365. Jay Lawrence Westbrook &amp; Kelsi Stayart White,\n    <em>\n     The Demystification of Contracts in Bankruptcy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Am.%20Bankr.%20L.J.%20481\">\n     91 Am.

The alternative approaches have much to recommend them; the Countryman definition turns on factors that have little if anything to do with the underlying policies of bankruptcy law and produce anomalous results in some cases.

If the Debtor breached that obligation and secretly sold half of his shares to a third party without giving notice to his fellow shareholders, and one of the other shareholders later tried to sell his stock, some judges might find that the Debtor's prior breach of the Buy-Sell Agreement excused the other shareholder's obligation to sell to the Debtor.

Section 365(d)(2) provides that, in a chapter 13 case, \"the trustee may assume or reject an executory contract or unexpired lease of residential real property or of personal property of the debtor at any time before the confirmation of a plan\" or an earlier date set by the court. But this must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 1329, which broadly authorizes post-confirmation modifications of chapter 13 plans. That section does not specifically mention the assumption or rejection of executory contracts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Oseen v.

It does, however, permit amendments to \"increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan,\" \u00a7 1329(a)(1), and assumption or rejection of a contract often changes the amount distributed to the other party to the contract. (In fact, if assumption or rejection did not change the creditors' distributive rights, assumption or rejection would probably be a meaningless gesture.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
