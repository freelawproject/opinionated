As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    In re Fetman\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Within this Circuit, a constructive trust has been imposed against a bankruptcy estate\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   where a court has found some pre-petition unjust conduct by the debtor relating to the subject property. The reason for this apparent limitation is that, under New York law, a constructive trust is meant to be \"fraud-rectifying,\" rather than \"intent-enforcing.\" That is, a constructive trust should not be imposed merely to give effect to a prior agreement, but instead should be reserved for situations in which a party's misconduct gives rise to his unjust enrichment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269706\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/567/702/#p706\">\n    567 B.R. at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The Defendant's constructive trust claim fails on this ground as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While the Defendant asserts that the parties' intent was for the Defendant to own the Property, there is no contention of any fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the Debtor in failing to convey the entirety of the Property to the Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 1 Tr. 11:9-13, ECF No. 61. Though the Defendant has claimed that the \"estate ... is seeking to enrich itself and dissolve its debts by selling the [P]roperty\" to the detriment of the Defendant, this conduct is not attributable to the Debtor. Opp'n 14, ECF No. 56. To the contrary, according to the Defendant's own submissions, the Debtor has stated that she had no intention of selling the Property, and \"wanted to drop the [b]ankruptcy case\" when the Trustee raised the possibility of a sale. Debtor's Letter to the Trustee 3, ECF No. 56-7. Similarly, the Debtor states in her affidavit attached to the Defendant's Opposition that \"I agreed that I would change the title to his name only. We decided to wait a year for his credit to get established and he would get a mortgage on his own.\" Debtor's Aff. \u00b6 11, ECF No. 56-2. That the parties' ultimately failed to give effect to this agreement does not, on its own, afford this Court the ability to impose a constructive trust. For the Court to do so would be to engage in an act of \"intent enforcement\" that is contrary to the constructive trust's purpose.\n   <em>\n    First Cent.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212917,9191807\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/209/\">\n    377 F.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, far from yielding an unjust outcome, the fact that the Debtor held title to the Property in her own name conferred a considerable benefit on the Defendant in allowing him to reside in the Property. If not for the Debtor's ability to purchase the Property, the Defendant's poor credit would have prevented him from having any interest in the Property whatsoever, including a possessory interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Apr. 4, 2016 Depo. Tr. at 29:20-23, ECF No. 51-3. The Debtor also brought about this possibility at a considerable detriment to herself, as she alone was liable on the initial Chase Mortgages, and remains solely liable on the Second Mortgage.

Through this defense, he seeks to obtain the benefit of that promise-that is, the transfer of the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under New York law, a transfer of real property is subject to the State's Statute of Frauds, and must therefore be in writing to be enforceable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Oblig.%20Law%20%C2%A7%205-703\">\n    N.Y.

The Debtor and the Defendant have provided no evidence of a deed or conveyance in writing purporting to transfer the Debtor's remaining undivided one-half interest. Although the Defendant's Mortgage was indeed based on a writing-albeit one that was never recorded-it did not by its terms convey title to the Property. LBR 7056-1 Stat. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, ECF No. 51-20.

However, he has made no such showing. As was discussed above, the assertion is that he will be injured by the \"loss of [his] initial $350,000 deposit,\" Opp'n 17, ECF No. 56, is contradicted by the fact that he voluntarily released the Debtor from her obligation to repay this sum in exchange for a one-half interest in the Property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   LBR 7056-1 Stat. \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, ECF No. 51-20. In this light, the loss of the right to the return of his deposit is not an injury, but was part and parcel of the transfer effected by the 2012 Deed. To the extent that he feels injured by the result of this transaction, it is nevertheless a result that he brought upon himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robins v.
