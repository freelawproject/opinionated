VI at 175 (bankruptcy court noting same). The dispute in this case centers on the fact that Chase is not in possession of the Note. The bankruptcy court found that Chase's claim was allowed based on Colorado's lost instrument statute. The lost instrument statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (a) of this section must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that proof is made, section 4-3-308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%204-3-309\">\n    Colo.

The Bankruptcy Court's Factual Findings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Evidence that Chase Possessed the Note\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Debtors first argue that the bankruptcy court misapplied the Colorado UCC because \"Chase Bank presented no competent evidence that it had in fact taken possession of the original [Washington Mutual] note.\" Docket No. 18 at 33. Specifically, debtors state that Chase offered \"hearsay electronic business records\" that showed that Chase \"had a copy (upon multiple copies) of the WaMu Note in its file.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Debtors' argument that the bankruptcy court \"misapplied\" the UCC attempts to evade the clear error standard for factual findings. The bankruptcy court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Chase produced convincing evidence the Note was scanned into its business records. The business records of Chase, kept in a vault in Louisiana and provided as exhibits, contained a copy of the Note. The original Note was removed from the vault and transferred to Chase's prior attorney, and was thereafter lost and has not been returned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Specifically, the \"scan date\" for Chase's electronic records shows the original Note was scanned into its record-keeping system on September 17, 2009. The Court finds this business record, together with the testimony of Chase's representative regarding the procedures of creating the record, demonstrate Chase possessed the original Note in its Louisiana facility on that date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   R. VI at 176 (footnote omitted). In fact, debtors never argue that the bankruptcy court committed \"clear error\" in making such findings. Nevertheless, the Court will review the basis for the bankruptcy court's findings under the clear error standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the hearing, Chase offered the testimony of Marilyn Lea. R. V at 731. Marilyn Lea was employed by Chase as a mortgage banking research officer and testified that she reviewed Chase's business records on a daily basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 731, p. 90, ll. 10-19. Ms. Lea testified about the manner in which the FDIC transferred documents to Chase,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 737, p. 96, ll. 4-11, and testified regarding Chase's procedures for scanning original notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 758-59, pp. 117-18, ll. 19-25, 1-18. She further testified to the authenticity of a screenshot showing that the Note was scanned into Chase's system on September 17, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 751, p. 110, ll. 15-21. The bankruptcy court found that Ms. Lea was credible. R. VI at 177. Based on Ms. Lea's testimony, the bankruptcy court admitted Exhibit L, the screenshot of the scanned Note, as a business record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 756-57, pp. 115-16, ll. 18-25, 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 15-2 (Exhibit L).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Debtors argue that Ms. Lea's testimony did not lay a proper foundation for the screenshot because Ms. Lea \"never saw the original blank endorsed WaMu Note; she never spoke with a person at Chase Bank who took possession of the original WaMu Note; she was not the person who allegedly scanned in the original WaMu Note to Chase Bank's system.\" Docket No. 18 at 34. Debtors' argument is misplaced. A business record can be admitted by \"anyone who demonstrates sufficient knowledge of the record keeping system that produced the document.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Hardison v. Balboa Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"160584\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/4/663/#p669\">\n    4 F. App'x 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669-70 (10th Cir. Feb. 16, 2001) (unpublished). Accordingly, Ms. Lea's lack of personal knowledge with respect to the Note is irrelevant to the admissibility of the screenshot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Debtors also argue that Exhibit L was admitted only for a limited purpose by the bankruptcy court. Docket No. 18 at 34. The bankruptcy court ruled that it would admit the screenshot \"as a business record contained in the records of Chase Bank and [that it] establishes that and nothing further.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. V. at 756-57, pp. 115-16, ll. 25, 1. The bankruptcy court's limitation is consistent with the purpose for which Chase offered the screenshot: to establish that Chase had the Note in its files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Debtors provide no basis to overturn the bankruptcy court's credibility determination regarding Ms. Lea. The Court finds that the bankruptcy court relied on competent evidence that Chase took possession of the Note in 2009 and did not err in concluding that Chase had met its burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Applicability of the PAA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Debtors next argue that, even if Chase had possession of the Note, it lacked authority to enforce the Note because Chase failed to comply with its agreement with the FDIC. Docket No. 18 at 37-41. Chase acquired Washington Mutual's assets from the FDIC pursuant to the PAA. R. IV at 294, \u00b6 7. Debtors argue that section 3.3 of the PAA required a separate deed or bill of sale for each note. Docket No. 18 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Section 3.3 of the PAA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Manner of Conveyance; Limited Warranty; Nonrecourse; Etc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   THE CONVEYANCE OF ALL ASSETS, INCLUDING REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY INTERESTS, PURCHASED BY THE ASSUMING BANK UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE MADE, AS NECESSARY, BY RECEIVER'S DEED OR RECEIVER'S BILL OF SALE, \"AS IS\", \"WHERE IS\", WITHOUT RECOURSE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ASSETS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, ENFORCEABILITY, COLLECTIBILITY, DOCUMENTATION OR FREEDOM FROM LIENS OR ENCUMBRANCES (IN WHOLE OR IN PART), OR ANY OTHER MATTERS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Docket No. 14-3 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The bankruptcy court stated that the PAA was irrelevant to debtors' obligation on the Note \"because the Note was indorsed in blank and Chase was the holder of the Note on the date of the bankruptcy provision.\" R. VI at 177. Debtors argue that the PAA is relevant because Chase's failure to comply with the PAA makes it impossible to verify the chain of title. Docket No. 18 at 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Debtors cite no Colorado law that supports their claim that a chain of title is relevant to the lost instrument statute where the underlying instrument is indorsed\n   in blank. A note indorsed in blank is enforceable by the bearer upon transfer.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%204-3-205\">\n    Colo.

Chase thereby possessed the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition, \u00a7 3.3 of the PAA addresses limitations on Chase's ability to seek recourse against the FDIC for defects in title; it does not describe the necessary paperwork to complete all valid transfers. In fact, the clause limits itself to those conveyances where a receiver's deed or receiver's bill of sale is \"necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%204-3-205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Debtors cite several cases to support their argument that \u00a7 3.3 bars Chase's claim, but the factual circumstances of the cases are not analogous.

The bankruptcy court also stated that \"there is no question that the original paper Note was lost, possibly in transmission to or from Chase's prior counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178.

Docket No. 18 at 48. However, the bankruptcy court did not conclude that the Note was lost in the transfer to Chase's foreclosure counsel. R. VI at 178 (noting that it was \"possibly\" lost in transmission to or from Chase's prior counsel). Nor was Chase required to prove the manner of loss.

The bankruptcy court found that \"Debtors' insistence Chase must produce metadata from its computerized document storage system indicating the exact date of the creation of each record is not reasonable under the circumstances.\" R.
