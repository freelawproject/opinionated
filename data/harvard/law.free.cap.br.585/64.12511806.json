For the reasons stated below, the Court denies both Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To understand the present Motions, some background on Debtor's related bankruptcy case is necessary. The Debtor filed for Chapter 11 relief on February 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Allegedly Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n   (\"Undisputed Facts\") \u00b6 1 [ECF No. 18]. Debtor was the proposed purchaser of the real property located at 45 John Street, New York, NY (the \"Property\") under a September 19, 2014 contract with 45 John Lofts LLC, the owner at that time. Undisputed Facts \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. The Debtor alleges that after making a down payment of $14.33 million toward the $65.9 million purchase price, the principals of 45 John Lofts LLC, Chaim Miller and Sam Sprei, misappropriated the bulk of the deposit and then failed to close. Motion \u00b6 7. The resulting default interest and potential foreclosure action motivated Debtor's Chapter 11 filing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its resolution of the bankruptcy, the Debtor together with 45 John Lofts LLC (collectively the \"Sellers\") agreed to sell the property to the Purchaser. Cross-Motion at 2; Undisputed Facts \u00b6 3. The parties entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated October 19, 2015 (the \"APA\") [ECF 1-1], for the sale and purchase of the Property. Undisputed Facts \u00b6 3. The APA set a purchase price of $73M. APA \u00a7 3.1. For the purposes of this adversary proceeding, the relevant provisions of the APA include the following definitions and representations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   - \"Debtor and 45 John Lofts collectively, the '\n   <em>\n    Seller'\n   </em>\n   ....\" (APA at 1);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   - \"The [Property] is sold and shall be conveyed free and clear of all claims, liens, taxes, and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever, to the fullest extent permitted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (f)....\" (APA \u00a7 2.1);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   - \"The [Property] is currently vacant and no person or entity has any right or option to lease or acquire any portion thereof.\" (APA \u00a7 7.1.3); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   - \"Seller has not entered into any leases, licenses or other occupancy agreements, or any service contracts or other contracts or agreements affecting any portion of the [Property].\" (APA \u00a7 7.1.5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The APA was approved by this Court pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Order Confirming Debtor's Chapter 11 Plan Of Reorganization As Supplemented And Approving The Sale Of Real Property At 45 John Street, New York To 45 NY LLC Free And Clear Of All Claims, Liens, Taxes And Non-Permitted Encumbrances\n   </em>\n   dated December 22, 2015 (the \"Approval Order\") [Case No. 15-10368, ECF No. 184].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Purchaser closed on the Property on January 15, 2016 (the \"Closing\"). Motion \u00b6 9. Before closing on the Property, the Purchaser conducted on-site due diligence during which it encountered a cell tower structure on the Property (the \"Cell Tower\"). Undisputed Facts \u00b6 8. As it turned out, an earlier fee owner of the Property had entered into an N.Y. Structure Lease Agreement, dated December 14, 2004 (the \"Cell Tower Lease\"), with Lin Cellular Communications Corporation (NY), LLC, which subsequently became Cingular Wireless PCS LLC (also known as AT &amp; T Wireless) (hereinafter \"AT &amp; T\"). Undisputed Facts \u00b6 9. On or around the date of the Closing (January 15, 2016), the parties established an escrow of $25,000 to be held by \"Kevin Nash, Esq. of Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein LLP, as disbursing agent under the Plan ... pending resolution of the motion to terminate or reject the [AT &amp; T] Cell Tower Lease,\" and memorialized by an \"Escrow Receipt.\"\n   <em>\n    Complaint to Recover Money From Debtor\n   </em>\n   Ex. B (the \"Escrow Agreement\") [ECF No. 1]. The parties\n   dispute what was known by whom regarding the Cell Tower Lease at the time of the Closing, what representations were made regarding any planned removal of the Cell Tower, the purpose and scope of the Escrow Agreement, and the impact of the Cell Tower on the condition of the Property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Undisputed Facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ultimately, the Debtor filed\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Motion To Terminate Cell Tower Lease Or Alternatively To Reject Cell Tower Lease\n   </em>\n   (the \"Rejection Motion\") [Case No. 15-10368, ECF No. 188]. That Rejection Motion was opposed by AT &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    See AT &amp; T's (A) Objection To Debtor's Motion To Terminate Cell Tower Lease or Alternatively To Reject Cell Tower Lease And (B) Motion Pursuant To FRCP 60(B) For Relief From Sale Order\n   </em>\n   (the \"Rejection Objection\") [Case No. 15-10368, ECF No. 193]. In late June 2016, the Court held a hearing on the Rejection Motion (the \"Rejection Hearing\"), at which time the Court denied the Rejection Motion and granted AT &amp; T's requested relief under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H'rg. Tr. [Case No. 15-10368, ECF No. 223]. The Court memorialized its ruling with a subsequent order dated July 11, 2016 (the \"Rejection Order\") [Case No. 15-10368, ECF No. 221]. No appeal was filed from the Rejection Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the Rejection Hearing, the Court touched on the issue of potential Debtor liability related to the Cell Tower Lease as it attempted to ascertain the parties' views on their respective rights and any anticipated additional litigation. After the Court explained that its understanding at that time was that such liability was limited to the $25,000 held in escrow, the Court requested confirmation of its understanding from Debtor's counsel while inviting \"anybody else [to] chime in if they disagree[d] or ... want[ed] to be heard on th[e] issue.\" Hr'g. Tr. 14:18-20. Debtor's counsel responded affirmatively and Purchaser's counsel said nothing. Hr'g. Tr. 14:18-15:7. The Court followed up on these comments with a similar observation in the Rejection Order, while explicitly preserving AT &amp; T and Purchaser's \"rights, claims, and defenses under the Cell Tower Lease and applicable non-bankruptcy law ....\" Rejection Order at 2. The parties dispute the significance of the Court's statements as well as each other's responses (or lack thereof). These disputes are at the core of the Motion and Cross-Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 6, 2016, Purchaser commenced the instant adversary proceeding asserting claims against Debtor for breach of contract under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See Complaint to Recover Money From Debtor\n   </em>\n   (the \"Complaint\") at 4, \u00b6 17 [ECF No. 1]. In the Complaint, Purchaser alleges that Debtor breached the APA by (1) failing to ensure the Property was \"free and clear of all claims, liens, taxes and encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever\" (APA \u00a7 2.1); (2) failing to ensure the Property was \"vacant and no person or entity ha[d] any right or option to lease or acquire any portion thereof\" (APA \u00a7 7.1.30); and (3) falsely representing that it had \"not entered into any leases, licenses, or other occupancy agreements, or any service contracts or other contracts or agreements affecting any portion of the John Street Property\" (APA \u00a7 7.1.5). Purchaser contends that the result of these alleged breaches of the APA is that Purchaser is unable to use the premises as intended. Complaint \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alleging that the continuing presence of the Cell Tower has \"caused considerable damage\" to the premises);\n   <em>\n    see Declaration of Vlad Tsirkin\n   </em>\n   (\"Tsirkin Decl.\") \u00b6 13 [ECF No. 16-8]. Purchaser specifically requests that the Court award damages of $500,000 (Complaint \u00b6 20), which matches its report of AT &amp; T's estimated cost to remove or\n   relocate the Cell Tower (Complaint \u00b6 17). Purchaser contends that it is now entitled to prevail on its claims as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cross-Motion at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Debtor does not deny the existence of a contract or that Purchaser upheld its performance obligations by paying the purchase price. Rather, Debtor challenges the breach allegations and offers several affirmative defenses that it argues should result in summary judgment in its favor. Specifically, Debtor argues that Purchaser waived its contractual rights to sue for breach of the APA by its actions in relation to the Rejection Hearing (including the creation of the escrow), and that the Court's Rejection Order precludes Purchaser's Complaint under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and the law of the case. Motion \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Motion for Summary Judgment Dismissing\n   </em>\n   (\"Debtor Reply and Opp.\") at 4-6 [ECF No. 17]. Debtor asserts that if it does not prevail on its affirmative defenses, the Court should deny summary judgment to the Purchaser because Debtor has not breached APA Sections 7.1.5 or 7.1.3, and because in regards to Purchaser's rights to sue, the APA and Escrow Agreement read together are at best ambiguous.

This standard bankruptcy sale language, written in parallel to the language of the cited Bankruptcy Code provision, is clear and unambiguous on its face. Based on the undisputed facts, the continuing validity of the Cell Tower Lease places the Debtor in breach of this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Purchaser claims that Debtor breached APA Section 7.1.5. That Section,\n   in relevant part, states that \"Seller has not entered any leases ... affecting any portion of the John Street Property.\" Debtor counters that it \"was entirely accurate in this statement, as the Debtor was not a party to the Cell Tower Lease, which is dated 2004, some ten years before the Debtor became a contract vendee of the Property.\" Debtor Reply and Opp. at 4-5. As the text of Section 7.1.5 is unambiguous, and the Debtor did not enter into Cell Tower Lease, the Debtor would appear at first blush to prevail on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, Section 7.1.5 actually represents that not only the Debtor, but also 45 John Lofts, LLC, the entity controlled by Chaim Miller and Sam Sprei, had not entered \"any leases ... affecting any portion of the John Street Property.\" APA \u00a7 7.1.5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   APA at 1 (defining \"\n   <em>\n    Seller\n   </em>\n   \" as \"Debtor and 45 John Lofts collectively\"). Purchaser correctly pointed out that \"the Cell Tower Lease ran with the [Property]\"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Reply To Debtor's Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (\"Purchaser Reply\") at 4 [ECF No. 20]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Lease reads: \"[t]he terms and conditions contained in this Agreement will run with the Property and bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.\" Purchaser Reply at 4 n.2 (quoting Cell Tower Lease \u00a7 22(c) ). While Debtor never actually acquired the Property, it is undisputed that 45 John Lofts, LLC was the owner prior to the Closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the undisputed facts, therefore, 45 John Lofts, LLC-and accordingly the \"Seller\" as defined under the APA-was in breach of Section 7.1.5 at the date the contract was signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Purchaser's third breach allegation relies on APA Section 7.1.3, which states that \"the John Street Property is currently vacant and no person or entity has any right or option to lease or acquire any portion thereof.\" APA \u00a7 7.1.3. Debtor argues that this representation was true as \"the import and intent of this representation was that there were no people residing as tenants in the building.\" Debtor Reply and Opp. at 5. The Court finds this provision to be clear on its face and in support of Purchaser's interpretation. By use of the words \"person or entity\" the contract clearly contemplates that a business (such as AT &amp; T) as well as an individual might lease space within the building. APA \u00a7 7.1.3. By use of the words \"any portion thereof,\" the contract left open-ended the nature of the \"right or option to lease or acquire\" beyond the traditional tenancy of an apartment or office unit within the building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Residential Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222156\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/533/379/#p395\">\n    533 B.R. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (intent \"must be gleaned from within the four corners\" of the written instrument).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Notwithstanding the breach of these three APA provisions, summary judgment for the Purchaser is not appropriate because Defendant has raised material questions of fact regarding the effect of the Escrow Agreement and its waiver defense. Specifically, Debtor argues that the Purchaser's rights to sue under the APA were modified and/or waived by the Escrow Agreement. That Agreement in its entirety is only a single paragraph and reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Escrow Receipt: The undersigned Kevin Nash, Esq. of Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein LLP, as disbursing agent under the Plan shall hold the sum of $25,000 in escrow (the \"Escrow\") pending resolution of the motion to terminate or reject the [AT &amp; T] Cell Tower Lease (the \"Lease\"). The motion to terminate or reject the Lease will be filed within 10 days of the date hereof for a hearing at the first available date. The escrow shall remain in place for a period of no more than 90 days and may be used to fund any resolution of the [AT &amp; T] claim. In the event the Lease is not terminated and the equipment is not removed (at no cost to Purchaser), within 90 days, the escrow agent will turn over the Escrow to Purchaser without any further notice [of] delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Escrow Agreement. The parties offer competing interpretations of the purpose and intended reach of the Escrow Agreement. Debtor alleges that the Escrow Agreement was intended to establish the $25,000 as a cap on all potential Debtor liability related to the Cell Tower Lease. Motion \u00b6\u00b6 2-5. In contrast, Purchaser contends that the escrow was only \"intended to cover the Plaintiff's attorneys fees' [sic] in connection with the removal of the Cell Tower structure\" and was neither \"a cap on damages\" nor \"Plaintiff's sole remedy.\" Cross-Motion at 3; Tsirkin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds the Escrow Agreement to be ambiguously written and potentially supportive of either parties' interpretation. The Escrow Agreement dictates clearly the conditions upon which the disbursing agent is to turn over the escrow to Purchaser, but nothing else. It makes no mention of attorneys' fees, limits, caps, remedies, or damages of any kind. A reasonably intelligent person might extrapolate not only the two proposed interpretations, but several others as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DPH Holdings Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321661\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/553/20/#p27\">\n    553 B.R. at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under New York law, a contract is ambiguous if its terms could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person ....\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake Energy Corp. v.

But the extrinsic evidence here is just as ambiguous as the text itself. Purchaser submitted the Declaration of its Chief Financial Officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsirkin Decl.

Second, Debtor highlights Purchaser's silence during the Rejection Hearing regarding the Cell Tower Lease and any related liability in the face of repeated reference to the issues and questioning by the Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as a statement filed by the Debtor prior to the Rejection Hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Altogether, these competing facts offer no improved clarity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition to the lack of clarity about the meaning of the Escrow Agreement, the factual picture is further muddied by the \"no modification\" clause in the APA. APA \u00a7 19. That clause dictates that the \"APA may not be modified, changed, supplemented or terminated, nor may any obligations hereunder be waived, except by written instrument signed by the party to be charged or by its agent duly authorized in writing or as otherwise expressly permitted herein.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Purchaser relies on the \"no modification\" clause to challenge the Escrow Agreement's validity as a modification of the APA. Purchaser Reply at 4-5; Motion \u00b6\u00b6 2-5. The Escrow Agreement was signed only by Kevin Nash, counsel to the Debtor, and not by any representative of the Purchaser, supporting the notion that the Escrow Agreement may simply be an escrow arrangement rather than a binding contract modification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Argilus, LLC v.

Moreover, Counsel for the Purchaser was not just present and observing the proceedings, but thoroughly active throughout the Rejection Hearing, speaking substantially more than Debtor's counsel.

The only motions argued in front of the Court at the Rejection Hearing on June 27, 2016 were the Debtor's Rejection Motion and AT &amp; T's Rejection Objection. The Court's verbal order (and subsequent written Rejection Order) granting AT &amp; T's 60(b) motion was made expressly in reliance on the fact that AT &amp; T did not receive proper notice of the bankruptcy sale in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's verbal order (and subsequent written Rejection Order) denying Debtor's Rejection Motion was made expressly in reliance on finding that (1) AT &amp; T presented evidence that it had in fact continued making lease\n   payments until sale of the Property to Purchaser; and (2) that the Debtor conceded it was not a party to the Cell Tower Lease originally or at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For neither ruling was an interpretation of the Escrow Agreement, the purpose of the $25,000 escrow account, or any other limit on Debtor liability discussed or relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While the Court did raise the escrow in an attempt to prevent additional litigation, the Court's statements during the Rejection Hearing regarding Debtor liability were not a ruling but merely an effort at clarifying the situation. The Court repeatedly noted on the record that its\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   at that time was that Debtor's liability related to the Cell Tower issue was limited to the $25,000 placed in escrow. Hr'g. Tr. 11:23-12:9, 14:4-8; 14:17-15:5, 16:16-23, 18:3-10. The Court requested clarification from Debtor's counsel while inviting \"anybody else [to] chime in if they disagree or ... want to be heard on th[e] issue.\" Hr'g. Tr. 14:18-20. In the preamble to the Rejection Order, the Court wrote: \"\n   <em>\n    it appearing\n   </em>\n   that the Debtor's liability in connection with the Cell Tower Lease is a $25,000 escrow account that was established at the closing on the sale at the request of the Purchaser.\" Rejection Order at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Admittedly, the Court indicated reliance on the alleged liability limit when preserving AT &amp; T and Purchaser's rights outside of the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g. Tr. 18:5-13 (ruling that AT &amp; T and the Purchaser's rights in respect of the post-sale lease payments were preserved while observing that the \"issue does not concern the debtor's estate given the debtor's lack of any further liability relating to this lease or any claims that the debtors might have arising under this lease.\"); Rejection Order at 2 (\"ORDERED, that all of AT &amp; T's and the Purchaser's rights, claims, and defenses under the Cell Tower Lease and applicable non-bankruptcy law are preserved ....\"). But this does not change the fact that (1) the Court never actually\n   <em>\n    ruled\n   </em>\n   on the issue but rather merely observed what \"appeared\" to be the state of the facts; and (2) the question of Debtor liability simply was not a legally relevant factor for the actual motions under consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. v.
