Bankruptcy Case No. 15-03967. He averred that he had no \"contingent and unliquidated claims of every nature.\" (Docket No. 54-4 at 2). In December 2016, while the bankruptcy case ran its course, Plaintiff sued Defendant alleging local and federal employment law violations. (Docket No. 1). The bankruptcy proceeding continued until June 26, 2017, when the bankruptcy court discharged Plaintiff's debts, discharged his Chapter 13 trustee, and closed the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 54-2. Plaintiff never disclosed his claims against Defendant to the bankruptcy court during the six month overlap between both cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the bankruptcy case deprives Plaintiff of standing and that his non-disclosure to the bankruptcy court judicially estops Plaintiff from bringing this case.

And this is where the potential dispute of material fact arises. Plaintiff argues that the Bankruptcy court \"did not rely on the information contained in the schedule when he ordered the discharge.\" (Docket No. 55 at 5). Instead, Plaintiff alleges that it relied on a certification that Plaintiff had paid off his debts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, Plaintiff argues that he was discharged despite his omission, not on the basis of it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant counters that merely discharging a debtor entails an acceptance on the basis of Plaintiff's omission. Further factual development and legal argumentation in the summary judgment context is warranted for the Court to decide if it should dismiss the case or not on judicial estoppel grounds. Hence, Defendant's motion is denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Leave to Amend Answer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant may amend its answer and assert the affirmative defense of judicial estoppel. Rule 15 of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedures states the Court \"should freely give leave [to amend a pleading] when justice so requires.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a)(2). Here it is clear that Plaintiff misinformed the Bankruptcy court by not listing this claim in his filing. It is also possible the Bankruptcy court discharged him\n   <em>\n    on the basis of\n   </em>\n   his filing. Therefore, justice requires allowing Defendant to amend its complaint and assert estoppel. Plaintiff's conduct, if ultimately subject to judicial estoppel, should not go unpunished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss as to standing is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice. Its motion to dismiss as to judicial estoppel is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice and the issue is deferred for consideration at the summary judgment stage. Finally, Defendant's motion to amend its answer is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Court notes that this responds in part to Defendant's request at Docket No. 53 at 2, n. 2. (\"However, should the Court decide to treat Defendant's motion as a motion for summary judgment, Defendant respectfully requests that it be given reasonable notice and opportunity to present material and argument pertinent to such motion.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiff fleetingly refers to the bankruptcy attorney's decision to move for an order discharging debt as opposed to a voluntary dismissal. Plaintiff implies this was a factor in \"a botched bankruptcy proceeding,\" that is negatively affecting this case. (Docket No. 55 at 5). Plaintiff does not elaborate this point in his motion. As this decision may have impacted Plaintiff's ability to bring this claim, the Court requests additional clarification as to the bankruptcy action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
