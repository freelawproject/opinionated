Reid &amp; Hellyer, APC (\"R &amp; H\") and Walter Wilhelm Law Group, a Professional Corporation (\"WWLG\") (together, the \"Appellants\") appeal from the bankruptcy court's Order Granting Trustee's Motion for an Order Authorizing a Surcharge Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) in the Amount of $350,000, which issued on April 4, 2017 (the \"Surcharge Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   WWLG submitted Appellants' Joint Opening Brief on November 6, 2017 in Case No. ED CV 17-895 MWF. (Docket No. 20). On December 6, 2017, Appellee Richard J. Laski Lt., Chapter 11 Trustee, submitted an Answering Brief and Request that the Appeals be Dismissed for Lack of Standing. (Docket No. 21). On December 27, 2017, Appellants submitted their Joint Reply Brief. (Docket No. 22). Unless otherwise noted, throughout this Order, all citations are to the docket in Case No. ED CV 17-895 MWF, though identical briefs have been filed in Case No. ED CV 17-947.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has reviewed the papers filed in this appeal, and determined that it is appropriate for decision without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for February 26, 2018, was vacated. Appellant WWLG's request for leave to appear telephonically (Docket No. 24) is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Order is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   . The bankruptcy court correctly applied binding Ninth Circuit authority when it granted the requested relief in the Trustee's Motion for an Order Authorizing a Surcharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 5, 2016, the bankruptcy court issue an Order Granting Chapter 11 Trustee's Motion for Order Approving Settlement Agreement Between the Trustee and Greenlake Real Estate Fund, LLC Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019 (the \"Settlement Order\"). (Supplement Excerpt of Record (\"SER\") 1 (Docket No. 21-2) ). Among other things, the Settlement between the Trustee and secured creditor Greenlake capped any future surcharge at $350,000. (Answering Br. at 2). Appellants filed notices of appeal regarding the Settlement Order, and the appeals were consolidated before this Court as Case No. EDCV 16-1768-MWF. (Docket No. 10,\n   <em>\n    In re Wrightwood Guest Ranch, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. EDCV 16-1768-MWF). In this Court's Order re Chapter 11 Trustee and Appellee's Motion to Dismiss Consolidated Bankruptcy Appeals (\"Dismissal Order\") dated December 7, 2016, this Court dismissed the appeal of the Settlement Order for lack of standing and mootness. (Docket No. 32,\n   <em>\n    In re Wrightwood Guest Ranch, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. EDCV 16-1768-MWF). Appellants then appealed this Court's Dismissal Order to the Ninth Circuit. (Docket No. 35,\n   <em>\n    In re Wrightwood Guest Ranch, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. EDCV 16-1768-MWF). That appeal is currently pending before the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Meanwhile, on March 14, 2017, the Trustee filed in bankruptcy court a Motion for Order Authorizing a Surcharge Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) in the Amount of $350,000 (the \"Surcharge Motion\"). (SER 2 (Docket No. 21-3) ). The Surcharge Motion documented over $449,035 in fees and costs incurred by the Trustee's accountant and counsel (the \"Trustee Professionals\") in preserving and disposing of the property located in Wrightwood, California (the \"Property\") in a manner that benefitted Greenlake. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the Motion sought a \u00a7 506(c) surcharge in only the agreed-upon capped amount of $350,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Appellant R&amp;H filed an Opposition to the Surcharge Motion on behalf of its client, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, as well as itself as a purported administrative creditor. (SER 3 (Docket No. 21-4). Appellant WWLG joined in that Opposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the Surcharge Motion. (Appellants' Joint Excerpts of Record (\"ER\") at 12, 28 (Docket No. 20-1) ).

In the context of this appeal, the bankruptcy court's conclusion regarding whether \u00a7 506(c) permits the Trustee and his professionals to surcharge a secured creditor is a question of law subject to de novo review.\n   <em>\n    In re Debbie Reynolds Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090458,9499204\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1061/\">\n    255 F.3d 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065 (9th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6099970\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/66/97/#p99\">\n    66 B.R. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (9th Cir.

(Opening Br. at 9-10). Appellants argue that\n   <em>\n    Debbie Reynolds\n   </em>\n   is bad law because it encourages trustees and secured creditors to engage in \"mischief\" by cutting deals to label expenses as surcharges, such that unsecured creditors would be excluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5; Reply at 2). Indeed, as Appellants point out, the bankruptcy court itself noted the possibility for this kind of mischief, while also acknowledging that\n   <em>\n    Debbie Reynolds\n   </em>\n   was \"binding\". (ER 37-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As Appellee, the Trustee argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Debbie Reynolds\n   </em>\n   makes sense: \u00a7 506(c) surcharges are intended to reimburse claimants for reasonable and necessary expenses that directly benefited the secured creditor. To distribute a surcharge on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis pursuant to \u00a7 507 to all holders of administrative claims would defeat the purpose of the provision.

As such, it does not come out of the debtor's estate, but rather comes directly from the secured party's recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Debbie Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090458,9499204\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1061/\">\n    255 F.3d at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Unsecured creditors ... may not seek payment for monies expended on behalf of the estate from the collateral of a secured creditor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090458,9499204\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1061/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090458,9499204\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1061/\">\n    at 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, standing under \u00a7 506(c) is limited to trustees and debtors-in-possession.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090458,9499204\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1061/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Trustee therefore argues that, because Appellants have no ability to seek a surcharge or any portion of the surcharge, they have no standing to appeal the Surcharge Order. In other words, because the \u00a7 506(c) surcharge is not estate property, Appellants have no direct claim to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellants argue that they performed significant work in the underlying Chapter 11 matter on behalf of the Debtor and the Unsecured Creditor's Committee, and are entitled to some fees for that work. Because the $350,000 surcharge is being distributed to the Trustee Professionals only, administrative creditors like Appellants are at risk of receiving nothing from the insolvent estate. As a result, Appellants argue that they are \"aggrieved persons\" who are directly and personally affected by the Surcharge Order. (Reply at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court need not decide whether Appellants meet the prudential standing requirements of bankruptcy law but observes that, if it were forced to rule on the issue, it would likely find that the Appellants do not have standing to appeal the Surcharge Order. Generally speaking, Appellants may be \"aggrieved\" by the Surcharge Order in that the Trustee Professionals are receiving payment via the surcharge and Appellants are receiving none. (Reply at 1). However, in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Debbie Reynolds\n   </em>\n   , it does not appear that they are \"aggrieved\" such that they meet the more exacting requirements for appellate standing under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court does recognize a certain circularity to this conclusion that renders it a close issue: Because the Trustee and Greenlake entered a Settlement in which Greenlake agreed to pay the surcharge for the expenses incurred by the Trustee Professionals in their efforts to sell property on behalf of the estate, the bankruptcy court ordered the surcharge distributed to the Trustee Professionals, and because the payment is a surcharge under \u00a7 506(c), the Appellants by definition have no interest in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In any case, whether or not the Appellants meet the prudential standing requirement makes no difference because, as discussed above, the Court concludes that the bankruptcy court correctly applied Ninth Circuit law when issuing the Surcharge Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the Surcharge Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
