Subsequently, and while the motion to dismiss was pending, TGF filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the District of Maine. This Ruling resolves the motion to dismiss the complaint, and also considers the changed circumstances resulting from TGF's bankruptcy proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the allegations of the complaint, Plaintiffs Louis Ferrara and Melissa Ferrara are citizens of Connecticut. The Ferraras do business under the trade name of the third Plaintiff, New England Alpacas, whose principal place of business is located in Killingworth, Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this action against defendants Ryen Munro and Tripping Gnome Farm, LLC (\"Defendants\"), seeking contractual damages \"arising from the Defendants' refusal to pay the Plaintiffs commission on the Defendants' sale of certain alpaca[s] to non-party Pamela Brewster and her company Stillmeadow Farm, LLC,\" located in Stonington, Connecticut. Doc. 1 (\"Complaint\"), \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs allege that they entered into a binding contract with Defendants \"under which the Defendants were obligated to pay the Plaintiffs a commission on the sale of alpacas by Defendants to Ms. Brewster and her company during a two-year period ending June 19, 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to these alpaca sales, however, Defendants have allegedly \"repeatedly refused to pay [Plaintiffs] the commission owed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their Complaint, Plaintiffs have included the following state law claims against both Defendants: breach of contract, unjust enrichment, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of Connecticut's Unfair Trade Practices,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    Conn.

In addition, both defendants, Munro and Tripping Gnome Farm, LLC, move to dismiss the action based on Connecticut's \"prior pending action doctrine,\" which, as Defendants assert, \"applies in this diversity case, as well as federal abstention principles.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 14, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     NOTICE OF BANKRUPTCY FILING BY TRIPPING GNOME FARM, LLC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court previously intended to resolve the motion to dismiss [Doc. 14] in its entirety herein.

Prior to June 20, 2011, Plaintiffs engaged \"in the business of buying, raising, selling and brokering the sale of alpacas\" at their place of business in Killingworth, Connecticut. Doc. 1, \u00b6 8. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, who \"engaged in the business of breeding, raising, selling, and brokering the sales of alpacas,\" deceived them into disclosing the name of an interested alpaca buyer \"by falsely leading the Plaintiffs to believe that if [they] did so, the Defendants would pay [them] the commissions set forth in the Contract.\" Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 64. Thereafter, by \"refusing to pay the agreed-to commissions, and by Munro preventing TGF from doing so, the Defendants gained an unfair business advantage over the Plaintiffs and all other similar businesses in that the Defendants illegally and unfairly made their products and services cheaper to sell to Connecticut\n   residents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201454\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 65. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' conduct has been \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, ... unscrupulous,\" and offensive to the public policy of Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In contrast, Defendants allege that no binding written contract exists because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Defendants \"never signed.\" Doc. 15, at 1. Munro states in his Declaration that \"[t]he Plaintiffs and the Defendant Tripping Gnome Farm, LLC never agreed on the terms of the Master Contract that was sent\" and \"[t]his lawsuit is based on the unsigned, draft Master Contract.\" Doc. 16, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The alleged \"Agreement,\" as presented by Plaintiffs, contains only the signatures of Melissa Ferrara and Louis Ferrara. Doc. 22, Ex. A (\"Brokering and Boarding Contract\"), at 12. No signature of Ryen Munro, in either his individual capacity or as a member or manager of TGF, appears on that contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue that, despite the lack of a binding contract, Plaintiffs have commenced a series of \"four cases between Defendants and Plaintiffs\" regarding this same contract dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1-2. Defendants describe the four cases as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) an action that Tripping Gnome filed in the Cumberland County, Maine Superior Court (PORSC-CV-2014-00157), seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the parties' rights and obligations (the \"Maine Case\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) an action that Plaintiffs subsequently filed in Connecticut Superior Court (MMXCV14-6011790-S) (the \"First Connecticut Case\"), as a result of which the Maine Case was stayed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) another action that Plaintiffs filed in Connecticut Superior Court (MMX-CV15-6013059-S) (the \"Pending Connecticut Case\"), which is nearly identical to both the First Connecticut Case and the instant case and which was filed after rulings adverse to Plaintiffs in the First Connecticut Case, thus allowing Plaintiffs to continue to pursue essentially the same case regardless of those adverse rulings; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) now, the present case, in this federal Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Doc. 15, at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants state that three of the four cases-\"all but the First Connecticut Case [ (2), above], which Plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew after filing the Pending Connecticut case\"-remain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs have \"repeatedly and unjustifiably tried to drag Ryen Munro into... three Connecticut cases as a party despite the absence of any allegations that Mr. Munro acted in any capacity other than as a manager of Tripping Gnome.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, each time the Connecticut Superior Court has ruled against Plaintiffs, they \"have disregarded the ruling and tried again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants conclude that the present action before this Court is \"no more than the latest harassing effort to pursue Ryen Munro, and also to effectively create an 'insurance policy' in the event that the pending Connecticut litigation is dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, \"[t]he prior dismissals of Ryen Munro from Connecticut state court actions should be followed by his dismissal from this case as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Standard for Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2), Fed.
