Dkt. 6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed by United Credit Corp of Brookhaven (\"United Credit\"); the Defendant United Credit Corp of Brookhaven's Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or Stay Claims Pending Arbitration (\"United Credit's Brief\") (Adv. Dkt. 7) filed by United Credit; the Response to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or Stay Claims Pending Arbitration (the \"Debtor's Response\") (Adv. Dkt. 10) filed by the debtor, Dennis Wayne Cain (the \"Debtor\"); the Memorandum Brief in Support of Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or Stay Claims Pending Arbitration (Adv. Dkt. 11) filed by the Debtor; the Defendant United Credit Corp of Brookhaven's Reply to Debtor's Response to Motion to Compel Arbitration (\"United Credit's Reply\") (Adv. Dkt. 12) filed by United Credit; the Supplemental Brief in Support of Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or Stay Claims Pending Arbitration (the \"Debtor's Supplemental Brief\") (Adv. Dkt. 17) filed by the Debtor; and the Defendant United Credit Corp of Brookhaven's Reply to Debtor's Supplemental Brief in Support of Plaintiff's Response to Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss or Stay Claims Pending Arbitration [\n   <em>\n    AP DKT. # 17\n   </em>\n   ] (\"United Credit's Supplemental Brief\") (Adv. Dkt. 18) filed by United Credit in the Adversary. At the Hearing, Bryce Kunz represented the Debtor, and Adam Stone represented United Credit. During the Hearing, the Debtor and United Credit (collectively, the \"Parties\") introduced into evidence one (1) stipulated exhibit. The issues in the Adversary are: (1) whether the Parties formed an agreement to arbitrate, (2) whether the arbitration agreement actually contains a delegation clause requiring the Parties' claims to proceed to arbitration, and (3) whether compelling arbitration presents an inherent conflict between the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") and the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Code\"). The Court, having considered the pleadings, evidence, and arguments of counsel, finds as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of this Adversary pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On June 3, 2016, the Debtor entered into the Mississippi Disclosure Statement, Promissory Note and Security Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") with United Credit (Ex. 1). The Debtor financed $2,087.18 with a 42.41% annual rate of interest to be paid in eighteen (18) equal installments of $160.00 for a total payment to United Credit of $2,880.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, the Debtor obtained from United Credit credit life insurance at $70.00, credit disability insurance at $109.44, and credit property insurance at $131.25. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. The Loan Agreement consists of two (2) pages. The Debtor's signature appears at the bottom of the first page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3. The Arbitration Agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\") consists of two (2) pages and follows the Loan Agreement. (Ex. 1). The Arbitration Agreement covers \"claims relating to [the Loan Agreement].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4. In United Credit's Brief, United Credit asserts that the Arbitration Agreement contains a delegation clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   5. On January 5, 2017, the Debtor filed a petition for relief under chapter 13 of the Code. (Bankr. Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   6. On October 13, 2017, the Debtor filed the Complaint (the \"Complaint\") in this Adversary alleging that United Credit violated the Truth in Lending Act (\"TILA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Regulation Z by providing misleading and incorrect disclosures on the Loan Agreement (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 5-6). For example, the Debtor alleges that United Credit did not pay to the appropriate insurance company the amounts required for the Debtor's life insurance, disability insurance, and property insurance (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 3-4, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18). The Debtor further asserts that United Credit \"received and/or retained an undisclosed portion of the funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Citations to the record are as follows: (1) citations to docket entries in the above-styled adversary proceeding (the \"Adversary\") are cited as \"(Adv.

On November 15, 2017, United Credit filed the Answer and Affirmative Defenses to Complaint [Adv. Proc. Dkt. # 1] (Adv. Dkt. 5), denying that it violated the TILA and demanding \"a jury trial on all of the claims raised in the Adversary Proceeding Complaint.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    8. On November 16, 2017, United Credit filed the Motion to Compel Arbitration or Stay Claims. In support of compelling arbitration, United Credit asserts that the Debtor signed both the Loan Agreement and the Arbitration Agreement and thus \"specifically agree[d] to be bound by its terms.\" (Adv. Dkt. 6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    9. On December 12, 2017, the Debtor filed the Debtor's Response. In support of litigation, the Debtor asserts that compelling arbitration would conflict with the principles of the Code. (Adv. Dkt. 10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    10. On December 27, 2017, United Credit filed United Credit's Reply asserting that the Code does not conflict with the FAA. (Adv. Dkt. 12).

To provide United Credit an opportunity to respond to new arguments and authorities raised by the Debtor at the Hearing, the Court instructed the Debtor to file a supplemental brief on or before January 26, 2018 and directed United Credit to file its responsive brief within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the Debtor's supplemental brief. The Parties\n    filed the briefs accordingly. (Adv. Dkt. 17 &amp; 18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    13. On January 25, 2018, the Debtor filed the Debtor's Supplemental Brief, asserting that \"[t]here is an inherent conflict between the [Code's] ability to alter pre-petition contracts and the seeming inability to alter pre-petition arbitration agreements[,]\" and that \"[t]he core/non-core distinction is not dispositive, and there may be a question of whether or not this particular matter is core or non-core.\" (Adv. Dkt. 17).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    14. On February 9, 2018, United Credit filed United Credit's Supplemental Brief, asserting that the Debtor's claims are non-core and that the FAA does not conflict with the Code. (Adv.

In response, the creditor asked the bankruptcy court to compel arbitration of the TILA claim. Additionally, the creditor asserted that the TILA claim was non-core. The bankruptcy court delayed confirmation of the debtor's plan until resolution of the dispute. With respect to the TILA claim, the bankruptcy court found that \"the resolution of the TILA issue will clearly affect the [d]ebtor, as well as the plan he will be able to\n    propose, and ultimately creditors.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 642. More specifically, the bankruptcy court found that \"the resolution of this dispute will establish whether [the creditor] is a secured or unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy case, thereby affecting how creditors will share in the [d]ebtor's assets, and in what priority.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    As a result, the bankruptcy court held that the adversary proceeding was a core matter and denied the creditor's motion to compel arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In United Credit's Supplemental Brief, United Credit argues that\n    <em>\n     In re Larocque\n    </em>\n    is factually distinguishable from the Adversary because \"[n]o creditors are being prejudiced by any delays in the adjudication of the Debtor's claims.\" (Adv. Dkt. 18). On February 8, 2017, the Debtor filed the Motion to Avoid Nonpossessory, Nonpurchase, Money Security Interest to avoid United Credit's security interest in the Debtor's personal and household goods that have been claimed exempt in the Bankruptcy Case. (Bankr. Dkt. 36). On March 8, 2017, the Court issued the Order avoiding United Credit's nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in the Debtor's household goods and personal goods. (Bankr. Dkt. 59). Additionally, on February 10, 2017, the Debtor filed the Objection to Proof of Claim, requesting that the Court allow United Credit's claim in the amount of $2,264.45 as an unsecured claim. (Bankr. Dkt. 39). On April 5, 2017, the Court issued the Order sustaining the Debtor's Objection to Proof of Claim and allowing United Credit's claim as unsecured. (Bankr. Dkt. 72). Finally, on April 10, 2017, the Court issued the Order Confirming the Debtor's Plan, Awarding a Fee to the Debtor's Attorney and Related Orders. (Bankr. Dkt. 75).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    After fully considering the matter, the Court agrees with United Credit that\n    <em>\n     In re Larocque\n    </em>\n    is factually distinguishable from the Adversary. Unlike in\n    <em>\n     In re Larocque\n    </em>\n    , the Court has determined already that United Credit is an unsecured creditor and confirmed the Debtor's chapter 13 plan. Thus, the Debtor's claims \"do not depend on provisions in the Bankruptcy Code for their existence [but] [r]ather, they are 'non-core' or 'related' proceedings that would not be in this court but for the filing of the [Bankruptcy Case].\"\n    <em>\n     First Franklin Corp. v.

N.D. Miss. 2005). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Adversary is a non-core proceeding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In the Debtor's Supplemental Brief, the Debtor asserts that \"[t]he core/non-core analysis is helpful in identifying conflicts, but shouldn't be the end of the analysis about validity of an arbitration agreement in bankruptcy.\" (Adv. Dkt. 17 at 3). To support this assertion, the Debtor makes the following arguments: (1) the Debtor \"does not have the same background financially as the debtors in Chapter 11 cases which predominately make up the 5th Circuit law\"; (2) the outcome of the Adversary will directly impact the validity of United Credit's proof of claim and amount to be paid; (3) the Debtor and United Credit would have to travel to a new forum to resolve a mere \"application of the law\" issue already before the Court; and (4) \"this Court's ability to enforce its orders relating to assets of the estate, the discharge, the viability of the plan, the credibility of this proof of claim, and gaining assets for other unsecured creditors are all implicated through this [A]dversary.\" (Adv. Dkt. 17 at 3-4). In response, United Credit asserts that \"[t]he Fifth Circuit has never held that arbitration agreements are invalid in a consumer, Chapter 13 context\"; the Debtor objected to United Credit's proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Case, not in the Adversary, and the Court issued an order allowing United Credit's proof of claim as an unsecured claim; and \"[c]ompelling arbitration does not affect the\n    Court's ability to enforce its orders relating to assets of the [e]state.\" (Adv. Dkt. 18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    It is well-settled in the Fifth Circuit that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    [W]here the cause of action at issue is not derivative of the pre-petition legal or equitable rights possessed by a debtor but rather is derived entirely from the federal rights conferred by the Bankruptcy Code, a bankruptcy court retains significant discretion to assess whether arbitration would be consistent with the purpose of the Code, including the goal of centralized resolution of purely bankruptcy issues, the need to protect creditors and reorganizing debtors from piecemeal litigation, and the undisputed power of a bankruptcy court to enforce its own orders.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     In re Nat'l Gypsum Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509017,269243\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/1056/\">\n     118 F.3d at 1069\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Here, the Court has confirmed the Debtor's chapter 13 plan and determined that United Credit is an unsecured creditor. All that remains to be decided between the Parties is whether United Credit is liable to the Debtor under the TILA. Depending on the outcome of the arbitration, the Debtor may amend his chapter 13 plan so that it accurately reflects the arbitrator's decision.
