Although the bankruptcy court observed that the appellant \"offered no evidence\" supporting her contention that she in fact owned shares in UDW, and had therefore \"failed to establish that she is a party-in-interest with standing to contest recognition\" of the Cayman Proceedings, the bankruptcy court nonetheless treated the appellant's objection as if she had standing and reached the merits of her objection.

In contrast, the bankruptcy court determined that, in light of the fact that several directors of the debtors had residences in the Cayman Islands, the debtors held regular board meetings in the Cayman Islands, several significant officers of UDW resided and worked in the Cayman Islands, office and administrative, services for the debtors were performed from the Cayman Islands, the share certificates of UDW's subsidiaries securing the various debt obligations were held in the Cayman Islands, the debtors all had bank accounts used for the debtors' business in the Cayman Islands, and the debtors' books and records were held in the Cayman Islands, that the debtors' COMI was the Cayman Islands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 696-98, 702. The bankruptcy court further determined that the debtors had not manipulated their COMI in bad faith and that the requirements of sections 109(a) and 1517(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, necessary for a bankruptcy court to confirm a foreign proceeding under Chapter 15, were met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 699-700, 706-707.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The bankruptcy court therefore granted the JPLs' petition for recognition of the Cayman Proceedings under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code and ordered related relief, including an automatic stay of all proceedings against the debtors in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201520\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although the appellant did not seek a stay of the Enforcement Order, on September 7, 2017, the appellant filed a notice\n   of appeal of both the Recognition Order and the Enforcement Order.

As of the initiation of the Cayman Proceedings, UDW was insolvent and had an upcoming interest payment that it did not have the money to pay, and the appellant does not contest the debtors' insolvency prior to the Cayman Proceedings. UDW also would not have had sufficient assets to pay off its debt at maturity later in 2017, which would have triggered cross-default provisions in the debtors' credit agreements, accelerating approximately $3.7 billion in debt. Moreover, under the Cayman Scheme, UDW's debt was to be exchanged for new equity representing the value of UDW immediately prior to the restructuring of the other debtors. Kandylidis Decl. \u00b6 19. That is, the total value of UDW, represented by\n   the new equity, would go to UDW's creditors pro rata, with no value left for its pre-restructuring shareholders. The appellant, as a purported shareholder, did not stand to lose anything from, and thus had no pecuniary interest in, UDW's restructuring. While the Cayman Scheme called for a small portion of new equity-0.02%-to go to pre-reorganization shareholders, it did so not because those shareholders were entitled to those newly issued shares (i.e., not because the debtors' creditors had all been paid in full), but rather in an effort to avoid having to re-register UDW's shares on the NASDAQ, which would have \"adversely affected\" the newly issued shares.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Mem. Law Opp'n to Appellees' Mot. Dismiss Ex. C at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The appellant also contends that because UDW's pre-restructuring shareholders were to receive 0.02% of the UDW's newly issued equity under the Cayman Scheme, that she had a pecuniary interest in UDW's restructuring. However, the fact that UDW's creditors chose to provide its pre-restructuring shareholders with this nominal amount of new equity in an effort to avoid having to re-register its stock on NASDAQ, thereby providing increased liquidity for the creditors' own shares of UDW, does not change the fact that the appellant was not entitled to receive anything as part of the debtors' restructuring because the debtors' creditors had not received the full portion of their claims. While unsecured creditors may have standing to challenge such \"gifts\" to shareholders when their own recovery is adversely affected, none of the creditors in this case opposed this plan, and the appellant does not point to any authority for the proposition that such \"gifts\" provide the recipient shareholders with standing to contest the restructuring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DBSD N. Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742306,4096487\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/634/79/\">\n    634 F.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"Absent the consent of all impaired classes of unsecured claimants, therefore, a confirmable plan must ensure either (i) that the dissenting class receives the full value of its claim, or (ii) that no classes junior to that class receive any property under the plan on account of their junior claims or interests.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rather than contesting the debtors' insolvency, the appellant contends that under the decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' in\n   <em>\n    In re Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868908,4175933\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/127/\">\n    714 F.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013), shareholders of an insolvent entity have standing to contest recognition of the entity's reorganization under Chapter 15. However,\n   <em>\n    In re Fairfield Sentry\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. In that case, a shareholder of Fairfield Sentry Limited, a feeder fund that invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, appealed the district court's judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's order recognizing the liquidation of Fairfield Sentry Limited, the feeder fund, in the British Virgin Islands under Chapter 15. The shareholder's standing was not contested, and the shareholder's appeal was decided on the merits. However, there was no indication that the case involved any creditors of the feeder fund-or that any existed-other than its shareholders, who therefore would have had a claim to any proceeds of the liquidation. In fact, the Court of Appeals explained that, as of the date of the petition for recognition of the foreign liquidation, the feeder fund had tens of millions of dollars in liquid assets and billions in claims and causes of actions.\n   <em>\n    In re Fairfield Sentry Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868908,4175933\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/127/\">\n    714 F.3d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that, while seeking a stay is not explicitly required in order to pursue an appeal, \"[t]he party who appeals without seeking to avail himself of that protection does so at his own risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Chateaugay I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12257664,10512144\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/322/\">\n    988 F.2d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, the appellant did not seek a stay of the bankruptcy court's recognition of the Cayman Proceedings. The appellees argue persuasively that, since the finalization of the Cayman restructuring on September 22, 2017, the debtors' positions have comprehensively changed, and the Cayman reorganization has been substantially completed, because the debtors have issued new equity and made cash distributions to creditors and entered into a new secured debt facility, as well as a long-term management services agreement. There is thus a strong presumption that the appellant's appeal is moot because the debtors' reorganization has already been substantially completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The appellant argues that the cases dealing with reorganizations under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and recognition under former Bankruptcy Code section 304 have no force in the context of Chapter 15, which replaced former section 304. However, the appellant cites no authority for this proposition, and it is unpersuasive. The inequity of unwinding a reorganization that has been substantially completed, and which the appellant failed to seek to stay, applies equally in the context of foreign reorganizations as it does to domestic ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chateaugay I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12257664,10512144\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/988/322/\">\n    988 F.2d at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that in the bankruptcy context \"the ability to achieve finality is essential to the fashioning of effective remedies.\"). Moreover, the principles of comity that underlay the recognitions of foreign reorganizations under former Bankruptcy Code section 304 apply just as forcefully in the context of recognitions of foreign proceedings under Chapter 15. As the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals explained, \"[c]entral to Chapter 15 is comity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ad Hoc Group of Vitro Noteholders v.

Congress explicitly instructed that \"[i]n interpreting [Chapter 15], the court shall consider its international origin, and the need to promote an application of this chapter that is consistent with the application of similar statutes adopted by foreign jurisdictions.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201508\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And just as under former Bankruptcy Code section 304, concerns of comity and the interest in promoting the application of statutes in foreign jurisdictions that are similar to United States bankruptcy proceedings weigh heavily in favor of recognizing reorganization schemes enacted by foreign authorities. Because the appellant has failed to show why these same concerns do not apply in this case, the appellees' motion to dismiss this appeal as equitably moot is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The appellant has moved to strike the appellees' reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss. The gist of the appellant's argument is that, unless the district court orders otherwise, under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8013(f)(3)(B) a reply brief must not exceed ten pages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8013(f)(3)(B), and that the appellees' reply brief, \"which is 15 pages long, exceeds the 10-page limit ....\" Appellant's Letter Mot. Seeking Strike Appellees' Reply Brief (Dkt. No. 26) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The appellant's letter motion lacks merit and is denied. The appellees' reply brief is ten pages long.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Reply Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Dismiss. (Dkt. No. 24). The appellant's argument is based on the contention that because Rule 8013 does not specifically exempt the cover page, table of contents, table of authorities, and the signature block from the ten-page limit, that the Rule' ten-page limit is inclusive of this non-substantive content. The appellant does not posit any rationale for why non-substantive portions of a brief should count toward a page limit. Under the appellant's reading of Rule 8013, in fact, no cover page, table of contents, or table of authorities is required, and litigants would therefore have an incentive to exclude such non-substantive-but useful-content in order to save space for argument. Such an outcome is not required by the Rule. In any event, the Court would grant any necessary motion to include these non-substantive items\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Rule 8013(f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk is directed to close Docket No.18, dismiss the appeal, and close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    UDW's three subsidiaries are Drill Rigs Holdings Inc.
