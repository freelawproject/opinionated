From the Petition Date through August 31, 2017, Ms. Peterson's Chapter 13 bankruptcy was assigned to the Former Trustee. Approximately two and a half years after the Petition Date, on March 7, 2013, Ms. Peterson filed her Fifth Amended Chapter 13 Plan (\"5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amended Plan\"). ECF No. 245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Ms. Peterson's Judgment against Hannah Woldeyohannes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A brief background regarding a pre-bankruptcy judgment obtained against a third party, Hannah Woldeyohannes (\"Ms. Woldeyohannes\") is important to understand Ms. Peterson's 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amended Plan and this AP Complaint. Throughout the AP Complaint, Ms. Peterson references a judgment obtained against Ms. Woldeyohannes and acknowledges her status as a judgment creditor of Ms. Woldeyohannes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP Complaint, AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6 12 (\"judgment proceeds from a business fraud case\"), \u00b6 34 (\"as a judgment creditors in a Chapter 7 case\"), and \u00b6 35. Accordingly, this court takes judicial notice of the documents filed in Ms. Woldeyohannes's\n   Chapter 7 bankruptcy case (\"Woldeyohannes Case\"), case number 11-20003 and in Ms. Peterson's Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, case number 10-23429.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January of 2011, Ms. Woldeyohannes filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. ECF No. 1 in case number 11-20003. In the Woldeyohannes Case, Ms. Peterson filed a proof of claim asserting a debt owed by Ms. Woldeyohannes of $248,117.52. POC 2-1 in case number 11-20003. As a basis for her claim, Ms. Peterson attached a copy of a judgment dated November 13, 2009 obtained against Ms. Woldeyohannes (\"Woldeyohannes Judgment\") in an action pending before the Connecticut Superior Court entitled\n   <em>\n    Alyssa Peterson v. Hannah Woldeyohannes\n   </em>\n   and bearing docket number HHD-CV-04-0834966-S. POC 2-1, P. 6 of 21. The Woldeyohannes Judgment awarded Ms. Peterson damages of $118,500.00. POC 2-1, P. 20 of 21. The Woldeyohannes Judgment was later amended to include an award of interest, bringing the total award to $195,482.96 as of November 13, 2009. POC 2-1, P. 5 of 21;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Ms. Peterson' Schedule A, ECF No. 18 in case number 10-23429. The Woldeyohannes Judgment also determined that Ms. Woldeyohannes was the sole owner of a limited liability company named A to Zee, LLC, and prohibited Ms. Woldeyohannes from assigning her interest in A to Zee, LLC, and/or encumbering the assets owned by A to Zee, LLC. POC 2-1, P. 6 of 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May of 2012, the court (Dabrowski, J.), in the Woldeyohannes Case, granted Ms. Peterson's motion seeking relief from the automatic stay to pursue collection of the Woldeyohannes Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF Nos. 56 and 61 in case number 11-20003. Thereafter, in December of 2012, Ms. Peterson filed an amended motion for relief seeking permission to pursue collection of the Woldeyohannes Judgment against the assets of A to Zee, LLC. ECF No. 85 in case number 11-20003. In her amended motion, Ms. Peterson noted that subsequent to the entry of the Woldeyohannes Judgment, she commenced an action entitled\n   <em>\n    Alyssa Peterson v. Carlton Hume, Hume &amp; Associates, LLC, J.

AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 67-69. In Count Seven, Ms. Peterson seeks an order of the court re-opening the Woldeyohannes Case and appointing Chapter 7 Trustee, John O'Neil, as a receiver to recover undisclosed or unpursued assets.

AP-ECF No. 13. In the Motion to Dismiss, the Former Trustee asserted that Ms. Peterson's AP Complaint should be dismissed because she cannot demonstrate any factual basis to infer that the Former Trustee was negligent or somehow owed, or breached, any duty in any of the ways alleged in the AP Complaint.

At the heart of these allegations is Ms. Peterson's assertion-and erroneous assumption-that the Former Trustee owed a duty to Ms. Peterson to pursue collection of various assets of her bankruptcy estate. None of these provisions impose such a duty. Section 541 describes what property interests of the debtor will be included in-or excluded from-the bankruptcy estate. Section 558 provides that the bankruptcy estate shall have the benefit of any defense available to the debtor as against any entity other than the estate, including personal defenses. 5\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 558.01 (16th).

Ms. Peterson's assertion that the Former Trustee owed a duty under \u00a7 542 fails to appreciate that Ms. Peterson, as a Chapter 13 debtor, retained the power to compel turnover of property of the estate.

The court notes that Ms. Woldeyohannes did not receive a chapter 7 discharge of any debt-including the debt owed to Ms. Peterson. To this court's knowledge, nothing is prohibiting Ms. Peterson from taking further action in State Court to pursue collection of the Woldeyohannes Judgment. Accordingly, Count Five of the AP Complaint fails to state a claim for relief on this basis because neither \u00a7 323(a), nor \u00a7 1302(b), impose on a Chapter 13 Trustee a duty to pursue assets of the estate or reduce judgments in favor of the debtor into money that can be used to fund a chapter 13 plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Ms. Peterson also asserts that the Former Trustee violated Rule 3.1 and 3.3 of the Connecticut Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 3.1 provides in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Likewise, Rule 3.3, entitled Candor toward the Tribunal, mandates, in relevant part, that \"[a] lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal.\" Rule 3.3(a)(1) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Reviewing the AP Complaint with leniency in favor of Ms. Peterson's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, the court, at most, construes the AP Complaint as asserting that the Former Trustee \"expressed doubts\" about the feasibility of Ms. Peterson's proposed Chapter 13 plans.

AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 67-69. Under Connecticut law, \"[t]he essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury.... Duty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and is imperative to a negligence cause of action....

Here, Ms. Peterson's claims in Count Six fail to sufficiently plead that the Former Trustee breached a duty owed to Ms. Peterson. To the extent that Ms. Peterson in Count Six relies upon \u00a7\u00a7 541, 542, 323(a), and 1302(b), or upon Rules 3.1 and 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, to establish a duty, those claims fail for the same reasons stated above regarding Count Five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On numerous occasions in the AP Complaint, Ms. Peterson cites to Judge Dabrowski's Order, ECF No. 215, entered on January 17, 2013, granting Ms. Peterson\n   relief from stay to pursue her interests in Ms. Woldeyohannes's wholly-owned limited liability company, A to Zee, LLC. ECF No. 215, P. 1-2;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP Complaint, AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36, 40, 41, 22. Ms. Peterson asserts that this Order imposed a duty upon the Former Trustee to pursue assets in the Woldeyohannes Case. The court disagrees. The plain language of the Order shows it authorized Ms. Peterson to pursue collection of assets of A to Zee, LLC and imposed a duty upon Ms. Peterson to 'immediately turn[ ] over [any funds or other property recovered] to the [Former Trustee]'. ECF No. 215. Nothing in the Order imposed a duty upon the Former Trustee to affirmatively pursue or collect the Woldeyohannes Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Ms. Peterson's AP Complaint fails to allege any other basis for finding that the Former Trustee owed Ms. Peterson a duty to pursue assets in the Woldeyohannes Case. And, while Ms. Peterson pleads that the Former Trustee \"breached her duty to the Chapter 13 estate\" or \"is personally liable,\" the court is not required to \" 'accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864585\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/659/#p673\">\n    714 F.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (2d Cir. 2013) (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jazini v.

In the absence of facts suggesting the Former Trustee was negligent in her statutory duties or a duty imposed by court order, the court concludes that Count Six shall be dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Count Seven\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In Count Seven, Ms. Peterson seeks an order of the court re-opening the Woldeyohannes Case and appointing Chapter 7 Trustee, John O'Neil, as a receiver to recover undisclosed or unpursued assets. AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59. The court dismisses Count Seven for a number of reasons. First, the initiation of an adversary proceeding is not the proper procedural vehicle to seek to re-open a bankruptcy case. Second, neither the Chapter 7 debtor, Ms. Woldeyohannes, nor the Chapter 7 Trustee, or any creditors of Ms. Woldeyohannes are on notice of this attempt to seek re-opening of the Woldeyohannes Case. Third, and most importantly, Count Seven will be dismissed as an impermissible attempt to have this court reconsider prior decisions rendered in 2016. The Woldeyohannes Case was closed on June 26, 2014 after the Chapter 7 Trustee filed his final account and distribution report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry dated June 26, 2014 and ECF No. 187 in case number 11-20003. In November of 2015, Ms. Peterson moved to reopen the Woldeyohannes Case so that a Chapter 7 Trustee could seek turnover of settlement funds that allegedly went-improperly-to A to Zee, LLC, recover undisclosed bank accounts and seek disgorgement of attorney's fees paid to the Law Office of Patrick Boatman, LLC. ECF No. 188 in case number 11-20003. These are the same allegations that form the basis of this AP Complaint. After oral argument, the court denied Ms. Peterson's request to reopen the Woldeyohannes Case. ECF No. 200 in case number 11-20003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court also denied Ms. Peterson's request for reconsideration on the basis that Ms. Peterson simply sought to re-litigate the same arguments and failed to identify any change in controlling law, new evidence or a need to prevent manifest injustice justifying reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 204 in case number 11-20003. Ms. Peterson did not appeal either the denial of the motion to reopen, ECF No. 200, or the denial of the motion for reconsideration, ECF No. 204. The court declines to permit Ms. Peterson what would amount to a 'third bite of the apple' to re-litigate the issue of whether the Woldeyohannes Case should be re-opened. Accordingly, Count Seven is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. Count Eight\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In Count Eight, Ms. Peterson seeks an order granting her a chapter 13 discharge despite the lack of completion of her 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Amended Plan and an order allowing her creditors to pursue causes of action against the Former Trustee for the Former Trustee's alleged negligence. AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 57-58. As with Count Seven, Count Eight should also be dismissed for a number of reasons. First, to the extent Ms. Peterson is asking the court to grant her a hardship discharge pursuant to \u00a7 1328(b), the proper procedure to seek such relief is through a motion filed in her main Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in accordance with Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4007(d) and 9014. Pursuant to Rule 4007(d), upon the filing of a motion for discharge under \u00a7 1328(b), the court shall fix a time for the filing of any complaint to determine dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and give at least 30 days' notice of that deadline to all creditors. Fed.R.Bankr.P. 4007(d) ;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   8\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1328.03 (16th). Here, Ms. Peterson's creditors have no notice that she is seeking a discharge without completing her plan payments. As the relief sought is not procedurally proper as a count in an adversary proceeding, the court dismisses Count Eight on that basis and without prejudice to Ms. Peterson's ability to file an application for discharge pursuant to \u00a7 1328 in her main bankruptcy case. To the extent that through Count Eight Ms. Peterson seeks an order authorizing her creditors to pursue the Former Trustee for alleged negligence, she fails to identify a legal basis for such relief. As Ms. Peterson has not proffered a cognizant legal theory on which this relief may be granted, Count Eight is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e. Count Nine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In Count Nine, Ms. Peterson seeks an order invalidating a mortgage lien executed by A to Zee, LLC and recorded on the land records of Hartford, Connecticut by the Law Firm of Patrick W. Boatman. AP-ECF No. 6, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, Exhibit J. Ms. Peterson asserts the mortgage lien should be invalidated because the Woldeyohannes Judgment prohibited Ms. Woldeyohannes from encumbering any assets of A to Zee, LLC and because the Former Trustee was negligent. For the reasons stated above relating to Count Five, Ms. Peterson has failed to sufficiently plead that the Former Trustee owed Ms. Peterson a duty that was breached. On that basis, any relief under Count Nine as to the Former Trustee is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Additionally, to the extent that Ms. Peterson alleges that Ms. Woldeyohannes violated the Woldeyohannes Judgment, Ms. Woldeyohannes is not a defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this adversary proceeding and, more importantly, such a claim is better addressed by the State Court that rendered the Woldeyohannes Judgment. Ms. Peterson, as noted above, retained control over the assets of her bankruptcy estate, including the right to seek a remedy for an alleged violation of the Woldeyohannes Judgment from the State Court. The court concludes that Ms. Peterson has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted against the Former Trustee, and accordingly, Count Nine is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In conclusion, after consideration of the arguments presented by the Former Trustee and Ms. Peterson, the court concludes that for the reasons stated herein, including Ms. Peterson's failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, dismissal of counts five through nine of Ms. Peterson's AP Complaint is warranted. The court has considered all other arguments presented by Ms. Peterson and finds them unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW THEREFORE\n   </strong>\n   , it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , that the Former Trustee's motion to dismiss, ECF No. 13, is GRANTED and counts five through nine of Ms. Peterson's complaint are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Plaintiff Alyssa Peterson also named as defendants Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., and the current Chapter 13 Standing Trustee, Roberta Napolitano.
