It was held in that case, after considering but not ruling upon the constitutional issues, \u201cthat the defendant is entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right on his appeal in this case pursuant to the statutes of this state\u201d. <em>Id. </em>511.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Desjardins, </em>110 N.H. 511, 272 A.2d 599 (1970), it was stated that although the defendant who is charged with drunkenness (penalty not exceeding six months) would not be entitled to trial by jury under the Federal Constitution, he would be so entitled \u201cby virtue of statute enacted pursuant to the authority of art. 77, part II of the constitution [of this State]. RSA 502-A:11\u201d. <em>State </em>v. <em>Despres, </em>107 N.H. 297, 220 A.2d 758 (1966), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ring, supra, </em>were cited for this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Despres, supra, </em>contains the statement that \u201cIn this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>state the statutory scheme for the trial of misdemeanors is a trial in the first instance in a municipal or district court with an absolute right of appeal to the Superior Court where the trial is de novo before a jury\u201d, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Ring, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Thus, it appears that the holding of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ring, supra, </em>that by statute in this State a person is entitled to a right to trial by jury on appeal to the superior court of a conviction in municipal or district court has been affirmed on two occasions. Although the holding of <em>Ring </em>is clearly based on this court\u2019s construction of the statute, and although the legislature has met six times in the six and one-half years since <em>Ring, </em>it has given no consideration to amending the statute. In view of this history, we decline to reconsider <em>Ring </em>and the defendant is entitled by statute to be tried by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\n<em>Exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
