Retailers\u2019 invoices which accompanied shoes returned to the defendant, when offered in evidence through the defendant\u2019s president, bore handwritten notations concerning the reason for rejection. The documents were excluded from evidence by the District Court (Daubenspeck, J.) subject to defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The court ruled in writing that the invoices were inadmissible under RSA 521:2, and inadmissible under common-law exceptions to the hearsay rule, and found and ruled that the defendant had not satisfied its burden of proof that the tongues were unmerchantable. Verdicts were returned for Howard Laces, Inc. in both actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">No record of the testimony was made. In the circumstances it cannot be said as a matter of law that the court erred in finding that the burden of proof was not satisfied, or in ruling that the evidence was inadmissible under either the statute or common-law principles. RSA 521:2; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Reenstierna, </em>101 N.H. 286, 288, 140 A.2d 572, 574-75 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
