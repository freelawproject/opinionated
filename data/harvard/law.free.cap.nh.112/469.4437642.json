The reserved case transferring the issue presented by the plaintiff\u2019s exception states that \u201cno evidence was presented to the court\u201d when the order of March 8, 1971, was entered, and that the plaintiff \u201cpresented no evidence on her motion to reinstitute payments\u201d filed in May 1971; but that the \u201ccourt was asked to take judicial notice of the file\u201d in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">A divorce was granted to the plaintiff in June 1967, and pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the defendant was ordered to make weekly payments for the support of two minor children, then three and four years of age, and for the support of the plaintiff so long as she remained unmarried. The order was modified in September 1967 to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the amount payable to the plaintiff for her own support. In October 1969, following hearing at which time it appeared that the plaintiff had remarried, the defendant\u2019s right of visitation with the children was modified to provide that he should have them with him for one month during the summer, other provisions relating thereto to remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In early 1970, the defendant sought custody of the children, alleging that the plaintiff had wilfully refused to allow him to have the children with him over the Christmas Holidays as provided by the original decree of divorce. An order entered on February 2, 1970, upon this motion denied custody to the defendant, and further provided as follows: \u201cThe libelee at his option shall be allowed the right to have the children fly to New Hampshire for visitation periods. On failure to comply with visitation rights, support payments will be held in abeyance pending a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In early 1971, the defendant moved for enforcement of the order of February 1970, alleging that the plaintiff had been residing in Liverpool, New York, that he had attempted to communicate with his children during the Christmas 1970 season, and that he was informed and believed that they had taken up residence elsewhere in parts unknown. The order of the Court (Perkins, J.) entered upon his motion, as to which the reserved case states no evidence was presented, was dated March 8, 1971, and provided: \u201cArrearage in support payments ordered held in abeyance and present support payments suspended pending further order of the Court.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s motion for rehearing was denied by <em>Perkins, </em>J. on March 23, 1971. Her motion to reinstitute support payments was thereafter filed in May 1971, and following the hearing at which the court was asked to take judicial notice of the file, was on August 31, 1971, denied without prejudice \u201con the evidence presented\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The only record before this court is that appearing in the file of the superior court. It is evident therefrom that the order of March 8, 1971, said to have been entered without presentation of evidence, was entered in enforcement of the court\u2019s previous order of February 2, 1970, and was strictly in accordance with the terms of that order, the plaintiff having failed to comply therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The latest order, entered on August 31, 1971, was properly based upon the record in the superior court file which was evidence warranting the action of the court in declining to revoke the order of March 8,1971, by reinstating the previous support order. The burden is on the plaintiff to establish that discretion was abused. <em>Timmins </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>103 N.H. 459, 174 A.2d 419 (1961): <em>Muder </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>109 N.H. 71, 242 A.2d 396 (1968). The record in this court contains nothing to support a claim of error or abuse of discretion. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>109 N.H. 41, 242 A.2d 78 (1968); <em>see Benjamin </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>99 N.H. 117, 119-20, 106 A.2d 187, 189 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The order complained of was not inappropriate in view of the plaintiff\u2019s disregard of prior orders of the court granting the defendant the right to visit his children at reasonable times and places.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
