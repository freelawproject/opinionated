They sell pizzas and foods to be taken out from the same premises. In 1966 the defendant under the name of \u201cMr. Take Out\u201d opened a takeout store on the opposite side of Main Street, from which he sold pizza and other products. The plaintiffs by bill in equity sought an injunction against use by the defendant of the word \u201cMister\u201d and the abbreviation \u201cMr.\u201d, or \u201cany words colorably similar to names or abbreviations used by the petitioners as a part of their trade name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">The Superior Court <em>(Grant, </em>J.) found that \u201cconfusion has arisen and is likely to arise in the future\u201d from continued use by the defendant of \u201cMr. Take Out\u201d, and enjoined him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cfrom using the abbreviation \u2018Mr.\u2019 in conjunction with the words \u2018Take Out\u2019\u201d in the conduct of his business in Keene. The questions of law raised by the defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred by the presiding justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">RSA ch. 349 provides for the registration of trade names, and at pertinent times during this litigation RSA ch. 350 provided for the registration of trademarks. Each statute expressly provided that nothing contained therein should \u201cadversely affect the rights or the enforcement of rights . . . acquired in good faith at any time at common law\u201d, in either trade names or trademarks, as the case might be. RSA 349:11; RSA 350:15. Since the decree herein was entered, RSA ch. 350 has been replaced by enactment of the Model State Trademark Act, effective September 1, 1969. RSA ch. 350-A(supp.). This likewise preserves common-law rights, in identical language. RSA 350-A:14(supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The defendant cannot be held to have violated RSA ch. 349, by use of the trade name \u201cMr. Pizza\u201d registered by the plaintiffs. However, the evidence disclosed that the plaintiffs\u2019 trade name was exhibited both over the door of their place of business and in their advertising with the capital M of \u201cMr.\u201d, and the capital P of \u201cPizza\u201d in script, and the balance of the printing in block letters. The defendant, in the sign displayed over his place of business used script letters in the abbreviation \u201cMr.\u201d, and block letters in the words \u201cTake Out\u201d. Additionally, the plaintiffs\u2019 sign bore a caricature of a man over the word \u201cPizza\u201d, while the defendant\u2019s sign bore a sketch of a man with a chef\u2019s cap, to the left of the abbreviation \u201cMr.\u201d and above the word \u201cPizza\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">There was evidence of confusion on the part of the public concerning the source of the parties\u2019 products. The plaintiffs claimed that a secondary meaning or significance attached to their trade name by reason of its use over a period of five years in Keene, in part as a result of advertising in which a photograph of the plaintiff husband appeared in conjunction with the name \u201cMr. Pizza\u201d. <em>See </em>Trademarks, Tradenames, and Trade Practices, 52 Am Jur. <em>s. </em>130 (1944); <em>Armstrong Paint and Varnish Words </em>v. <em>Nu-Enamel Corp., </em>305 U.S. 315, 83 L. Ed. 195, 59 S. Ct. 191 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">It could reasonably be found upon the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 trade name, by reason of its use for five years as a trade or service mark, had acquired a secondary meaning or significance in the eyes of the public sufficient to entitle it to protection. <em>Bogosian </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>99 N.H. 340, 111 A.2d 190 (1955); <em>Nardini &amp;c Co. </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>93 N.H. 364, 42 A.2d 325 (1945); <em>see </em>Developments in the Law \u2014 Trademarks and Unfair Competition, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 814, 823-24 (1955); RSA 350:9 (II), 12 and 17; <em>cf. </em>RSA 350-A:11(I)(supp.), 12(supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Since the words \u201cpizza\u201d and \u201ctake out\u201d are in common use upon restaurant signs, what served to distinguish the plaintiffs\u2019 place of business from other pizza and takeout shops was the use of the prefix \u201cMr.\u201d and the outline of a man. <em>Cf. Mr. Travel, Inc. </em>v. <em>VIP Travel Service Inc., </em>268 F. Supp. 958 (N.D. Ill. 1966). These salient features were adopted by the defendant. <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Stork and Gift Shop, </em>137 N.J. Eq. 475, 45 A.2d 688 (1946); 1 Nims, Unfair Competition and Trademarks 5. 221(f) (4th ed. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 right to an injunction depended upon their showing that substantial likelihood of confusion resulted from defendant\u2019s use. Restatement of Torts, 5. 727, Comment <em>c; ss. </em>728, 729 (1938); Prosser, Torts 5. 130, at 957, 958 (4th ed. 1971). While there was evidence of actual confusion on the part of the public during the few weeks that the defendant\u2019s store had been in operation before hearing, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights were not solely dependent upon this proof. They were not required to stand by until actual confusion caused damage. Where an injunction is sought as is the case here, \u201cthe determinative factor... is not that purchasers have, in fact, been deceived, but that there is a reasonable likelihood thereof.\u201d 3 Callman, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies 5. 80.6 (3d ed. 1969); Developments in the Law-Trademarks and Unfair Competition, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 814, 862 (1955). The issue of confusing similarity is one of fact. Restatement of Torts, <em>s. </em>728, Comment a (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">As in <em>Nardini &amp;c Co. </em>v. <em>Sterling Co., </em>93 N.H. at 367, 42 A.2d at 327, the injunction issued by the trial court was a qualified one, prohibiting only use of \u201cthe abbreviation \u2018Mr.\u2019 in conjunction with the words \u2018Take Out\u2019 as presently used in the conduct of defendant\u2019s business conducted on Main <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Street in Keene\u201d. We hold that the court\u2019s finding, that \u201ccertain confusion has arisen and is likely to arise in the future . . . particularly as the defendant is currently using the abbreviation ... in a certain script identical with, or closely imitative of the \u2018Mr.\u2019 used by the plaintiffs ....\u201d, is sustainable upon the evidence. Accordingly the limited injunction based thereon is likewise sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-5\">Griffith, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
