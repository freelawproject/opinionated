In 1966 plaintiffs entered into a purchase and sale agreement for lots No. 1 and No. 1A on the island as shown on a plan of lots prepared by the defendants. Adjacent to lot No. 1A the plan showed a fairly substantial area of shoreland designated \u201cOwners Retained\u201d and not laid out in lots. There was evidence that the plaintiffs were informed at the time of the purchase and sale agreement that defendants planned to build in that area. The agreement of purchase also incorporated certain proposed restrictions on the use of the lots purchased by buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Sometime after the plaintiffs completed the purchase of lots No. 1 and No. 1A they learned that the defendants proposed to subdivide and sell at least part of the area designated on the plan as \u201cOwners Retained.\u201d Plaintiffs in their bill in equity sought an injunction against any subdivision or sale by the defendants of the \u201cOwners Retained\u201d area.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">No special findings were requested of or made by the trial court and the sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence required the trial court to grant the injunction against subdivision or sale by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The plaintiffs have based their prayer for injunction on a claim that the phrase \u201cOwners Retained\u201d on the plan coupled with the information that the owners intended to build a home in that area implied a promise that the area would not be subdivided or sold by the owners. The evidence did not require the trial court to accept this claim as correct and we would be warranted in sustaining dismissal of the petition on this ground alone. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>102 N.H. 256, 154 A.2d 750 (1959); <em>Fournier </em>v. <em>Kattar, </em>108 N.H. 424, 238 A.2d 12 (1968). However the events subsequent to the agreement of sale provide evidence completely contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 theory of an implied promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The restrictions in the agreement of sale were redrafted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>at the time of conveyance and the plaintiffs\u2019 deed was made subject to these redrafted restrictions which were incorporated by reference and recorded simultaneously with their deed. There was evidence that these restrictions were read and accepted by the plaintiffs at the time of the closing. The only reference in this case to subdivision of land on the island is contained in the recorded restrictions and reads as follows: \u201cNone of the lots as conveyed shall be subdivided into any smaller lots.... These restrictions shall not apply to land retained by the owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The language excepting the land retained by the owners from the subdivision restriction is an absolute bar to the plaintiffs. The claimed implied promise cannot be considered a collateral matter unmentioned in the deed as in <em>Claveau </em>v. <em>Plantier, </em>102 N.H. 487, 161 A.2d 166 (1960). Here the language of the deed is the opposite of plaintiffs\u2019 claimed understanding and supports the dismissal of their petition. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Company, </em>47 N.H. 235 (1866); <em>Association </em>v. <em>Drill Company, </em>66 N.H. 267, 20 A. 330 (1890); <em>Redlon Company </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>89 N.H. 137, 195 A. 348 (1937); Annot., 38 A.L.R. 1310 (1925); 6 Powell, Real Property para. 902 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-7\">Grimes, J. did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
