Trial was by the superior court without a jury before <em>King, </em>J. Following his conviction upon the indictment charging him with robbery, defendant moved that the verdict be set aside and one of not guilty entered, or in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that there was not sufficient credible evidence before the trial court to warrant the verdict of guilty. To the denial of these motions the defendant duly excepted. The questions of law presented by these and other exceptions taken at the trial were reserved and transferred by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The only direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in the robbery came from the testimony of an alleged accomplice, Norman Maibe, presently under indictment for the same robbery. Maibe, who was present during all of the proceedings, before and after the commission of the crime, testified to defendant\u2019s role both in the planning and execution of the robbery. The robbery occurred at approximately 9:00 p.m. when two men entered the paint store at 1237 Elm Street, Manchester. Present at the time of the robbery were the manager, a stock boy and two customers. According to their testimony, two individuals entered the store and ordered them to the back of the building. All testified that one robber was about 6\u20192\u201d in height, had dark hair and wore a silk stocking over his face. The other was agreed to be shorter in height, wore a bandana around his face up to his eyes and a large \u201chippie-style\u201d hat with a wide brim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>light colored hair sticking out beneath the hat. The taller man carried a gun. The robbers took a cash box from the store\u2019s safe and wallets from those present and made their escape. The tall man was subsequently identified by the witnesses as an individual named Nicholas Kolinas. Kolinas was indicted for the robbery and entered a plea of guilty at his trial. The other individual, alleged to be defendant West, was never directly identified by the eyewitnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">As we said recently in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rumney, </em>109 N.H. 544, 258 A.2d 349 (1969), \u201cIt is established law in this jurisdiction that the uncorroborated testimony of an alleged accomplice is competent evidence upon which to found a verdict, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Desilets, </em>96 N.H. 245; <em>State </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>106 N.H. 152, 154.\u201d There is no statute to prevent the application of the rule in this case. We also recognize and reaffirm our acceptance of the rule that such testimony, though competent, must be received with caution and \u201ccannot be accepted by a jury if it appears on its face to be \u2018bald perjury, preposterous, or <em>self-contradictory.\u2019 State v. Rumney, supra </em>at 545, 258 A.2d at 350. Counsel for defendant argues that the testimony given by Norman Maibe falls within this category. The record does not support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Witness Maibe placed defendant West at the scene of the crime on the day and time in question. Other than the testimony of another participant, Nicholas Kolinas, defendant only offered the testimony of a close friend, Joseph LaBranche, to rebut the testimony of Maibe. LaBranche, it is admitted, could not say specifically that he had been with defendant on the evening of the robbery. Other witnesses who, it was claimed, could account for defendant\u2019s presence on the evening in question, were not produced. Though Kolinas testified that West was not involved, contradicting Maibe\u2019s testimony, the resolution of this credibility issue is appropriately left to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Kolinas\u2019 contradiction of Maibe\u2019s testimony does not amount to self-contradiction which gives cause in the proper case to reject the testimony of an alleged accomplice. In the absence of a showing of such contradiction and of any testimony accounting for the presence of defendant on the eve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ing in question, we cannot say Maibe\u2019s testimony placing him at the scene was so \u201cpreposterous\u201d as to be unworthy of belief by the trial court. Nor is there any evidence of \u201cbald perjury\u201d on Maibe\u2019s part unless we can say with certainty that Kolinas was credible and Maibe was not. On the evidence presented by the record, that conclusion is not compelled. Defendant\u2019s motions were properly denied. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>107 N.H. 490, 225 A.2d 617 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
