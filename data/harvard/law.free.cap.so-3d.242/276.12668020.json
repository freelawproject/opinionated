At fourteen, Rodgers reported that his mother had full sexual intercourse with him on multiple occasions, first getting him high on marijuana that was laced with formaldehyde. Although Child Protection Services was called about the abuse, Mason was unable to find any investigative report. Another report stated that Rodgers' father threatened to shoot him and put an unloaded gun to Rodgers' head. At school, Rodgers was placed in a class for severely emotionally disturbed children.

Dr. Deland stated that Rodgers' diagnoses were post-traumatic stress disorder, disassociative disorder, substance abuse in remission, and borderline personality disorder.

R. &amp; Withdrawal Req. for Protective Order at 12,\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. SC01-185 (Fla. July 12, 2004). Likewise,\n   the ACLU suggests that Rodgers may have waived the penalty phase in an effort to commit suicide by execution to escape the pain of the untreated condition. ACLU Br. at 2. Therefore, Rodgers' reported suicidality, self-mutilations, and severe depression are consistent with the severe symptoms of untreated gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While it appears that untreated gender dysphoria has been a factor in Rodgers' mental health issues, this Court has already considered and affirmed Rodgers' waivers of a penalty phase jury, as well as postconviction proceedings and counsel, with a record indicating severe mental illness. Thus, the recent specific diagnosis of gender dysphoria, not raised as a newly discovered evidence claim, does not invalidate Rodgers' waivers. Therefore, I agree with the majority that Rodgers is not entitled to have his waivers set aside.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    We review the summary denial of a postconviction motion de novo.\n    <em>\n     Barnes v.
