On August 25, 2015, Casey Woods was indicted on one count of first degree murder, stemming from the shooting of his girlfriend's estranged husband. Woods also was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts were severed and the case proceeded to trial solely on the murder charge on September 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. An Adams County jury found Woods guilty of second degree murder in violation of Mississippi Code Section 97-3-19(1)(b). The trial court sentenced Woods as a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-83 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Woods's trial counsel did not file any post-trial motions. Woods appeals, arguing that (1) the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to overcome the presumption afforded by the Castle Doctrine that he acted reasonably when he killed Pierre Tenner, and (2) he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Woods waived his insufficient evidence argument; however, we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to Woods's trial counsel's failure to file a post trial motion for a new trial challenging the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Doris Tenner and Pierre Tenner were married and lived at Fourteen Hampton Court in Natchez, Mississippi. Doris's and Pierre's marriage became volatile over time and eventually deteriorated. Some time after Doris and Pierre separated, Doris began dating Woods in April 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. On May 4, 2015, Pierre called Doris, but she did not answer the phone. Later, Pierre came home from work and saw Woods's truck parked in the yard. Angered, Pierre kicked in the locked door and went into the house with a twelve gauge shotgun. Pierre saw Doris with a man in the house. Doris retreated down the hallway and locked herself in a bedroom. Pierre fired the shotgun through the door, hitting the wall and a television in the bedroom. Doris came out of the bedroom and she and Pierre tussled for the shotgun. Pierre claimed the shotgun went off while he and Doris were tussling for the shotgun. After tussling for a while, Pierre left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. After the incident, Doris called the police and filed charges. Pierre was arrested and charged with domestic violence. Pierre was released on bond subject to certain conditions set by the municipal court. The municipal court ordered Pierre to have no contact with Doris, including telephone contact and physical contact, either at Doris's residence, place of employment, or any other place. The municipal court also ordered that Doris \"shall have\n   the exclusive use and possession of the residence ... to the exclusion of [Pierre].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Three weeks later, on the morning of May 24, 2015, Pierre called Doris. Doris could tell Pierre had been drinking. Pierre was at a nearby street, and Doris told Pierre not to come to her house. Doris left her house to get groceries. On her way home, Pierre called her again and they argued. Pierre told Doris that he was coming to her house, but Doris told him he did not need to be there. Doris arrived home and Woods was outside getting ready to wash his truck. While Doris was in the process of moving her vehicle so Woods could wash his truck, she saw Pierre's truck coming down the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Doris went inside and called 911 at 12:15 p.m. Doris requested that the police patrol Hampton Court because her husband was prohibited from being there. Doris told dispatch that she recently had filed charges against her husband Pierre for shooting in her house. Doris also told dispatch that Pierre had been drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Pierre pulled up and parked at Willie Thomas's house across the street from Doris's house. Thomas and Paul Armstead, who lived next door to Thomas, were outside Thomas's house socializing. Pierre got out of his truck and began talking with Thomas and Armstead. Meanwhile, Woods was outside Doris's house getting ready to wash his truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Armstead explained that Pierre was a friend and former neighbor before he and Doris had separated. Armstead did not believe it was odd for another man to be at Doris's house. Armstead also was a friend of Woods. After only a few minutes, Pierre and Woods began arguing from opposite sides of the street. Armstead testified that Woods was not enticing Pierre to say anything, but he could not say who started the argument. No evidence was presented as to the actual content of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. From inside, Doris heard Pierre and Woods arguing. Doris went outside and saw Pierre across the street and Woods in the yard by his truck. Doris told them to be quiet, and the argument subsided. Doris went back inside and again heard Woods and Pierre arguing. Doris called 911 at 12:20 p.m. Doris urged dispatch that the police needed to hurry to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. Doris went back outside and told the two men to be quiet, but they continued to argue. Doris told Woods that the police were coming. The argument escalated to the point that Pierre got frustrated and jumped out of his chair. Pierre took his leg brace off, threw it to the ground, and began to walk in the direction of Doris's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Before crossing the street, Doris saw Pierre stop at his truck and roll the window down. Pierre put his hand in the truck. Pierre said to Woods, \"I missed you the first time but I won't miss you this time.\" Pierre then put his hand behind his back and proceeded to cross the street toward Doris's yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14. Armstead did not see Pierre stop at his truck or see whether he had a gun. Armstead testified that Pierre did not act like he had a gun. Armstead also testified that Pierre did not have a weapon of any sort. Armstead could tell that Pierre was angry and assumed he went across the street to fight Woods. Armstead heard Doris tell Pierre not to come over to her house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15. Doris went to the edge of her yard to stop Pierre from coming over and began pushing him. Pierre grabbed Doris and threw her to the ground. Doris said she was going to call the police, to which Pierre responded, \"Go ahead and call\n   them.\" Doris went back inside to call the police. Doris provided a statement to the police saying that Woods had followed her in the house and had gotten the shotgun because Pierre was threatening Woods. Doris explained that there were two doors under the carport, a door to the laundry room and a separate door to go inside the house. Doris had clarified in another statement that when her first statement said Woods had followed her in the house, she meant that Woods had gone into the laundry room and she had gone inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16. While Pierre was approaching, Armstead saw Woods go inside the house or through a door under the carport, attached to the house. Woods came back out the door with a shotgun as Pierre was walking toward Doris's driveway. Doris did not know that there was a gun on her property, and she assumed Woods had gotten the shotgun from the laundry room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17. Woods remained under the carport. Initially, Armstead testified that when Woods came out with the shotgun, Pierre was not advancing toward Woods, but \"he was walking that way[.]\" Armstead then testified that when Woods came out with the shotgun, Pierre was advancing toward Woods. Woods, who was standing under the carport, shot Pierre, who was halfway up the driveway, in the leg. Armstead testified that Pierre got no closer than halfway up the driveway before Woods shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18. Doris heard a gunshot while she was in the house. She did not know if Woods had shot Pierre or Pierre had shot Woods. She went outside to find that Pierre had been shot and Woods was holding a shotgun. Pierre fell to the ground and Woods left the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19. Doris called 911 a third time at 12:33 p.m. Doris frantically told police that there had been a shooting. She urged police and an ambulance to hurry to the scene. Doris explained that her husband had come across the street, pulled a gun on a \"man\" and the \"man\" had shot him. Doris repeatedly said that she had told Pierre not to come over there. When dispatch asked Doris to explain again exactly what had happened, she responded that Pierre had been across the street and she told had him not to come over to her house. Doris said Pierre came over and \"fooled\" with \"this man\" and the \"man\" shot him. Doris said the \"man\" left, and her husband was lying wounded in the yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20. Armstead and another neighbor put Pierre in the back of a truck and took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. At trial, the parties stipulated that Pierre died as a result of the gunshot wound to his right thigh and that the manner of death was homicide. Pierre's blood alcohol content was .242, showing that he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21. Police responded to the scene and found no weapons at the residence. Investigator Joe Belling of the Natchez Police Department testified that the closest blood spot to the carport was found on the driveway just over seven and a half feet from the brick support of the carport. Belling did not know whether the blood was Pierre's. Belling repeatedly testified that he did not know where Pierre had been located when he was shot, however, Belling testified that it appeared he was shot somewhere around the carport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22. The trial court instructed the jury on first degree murder, second degree murder, and heat of passion manslaughter. The court also instructed the jury on self defense and the Castle Doctrine. The jury found Woods guilty of second degree murder. On September 28, 2016, the circuit\n   court sentenced Woods as a habitual offender to life without the possibility of parole. Woods's trial counsel failed to file any post-trial motions. Woods was appointed appellate counsel, who proceeded with the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23. At trial, Woods's defense theory was justifiable homicide, specifically, self defense and the statutory protections of the Castle Doctrine. The trial court instructed the jury on justifiable homicide under Section 97-3-15(e)-(f) and the specific provisions of the Castle Doctrine, codified at Mississippi Code Section 97-3-15(3) - (4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-15\">\n    Miss.

The Castle Doctrine creates a presumption of fear and abridges a duty to retreat in certain prescribed circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Newell v.

Woods argues that the State presented insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that he reasonably had feared imminent death or great bodily harm when he shot and killed Pierre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 24. \"A directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding a verdict and a request for peremptory instruction all challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Easter v.

Stated another way, \"[i]f a defendant puts on evidence in his own defense after the denial of his motion for directed verdict, he waives his challenge to the sufficiency of the State's evidence up to that point.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11497990\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/1054/#p1058\">\n    749 So.2d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058-59 (Miss. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 25. At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Woods moved for a directed verdict, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented in the State's case-in-chief. The trial court denied the motion, and Woods proceeded with his case-in-chief, in which he called witnesses and introduced evidence. Consequently, Woods waived his challenge to the sufficiency of the State's evidence presented during its case-in-chief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11497990\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/1054/#p1058\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 26. \"If a motion for directed verdict is denied and the defendant introduces evidence on his own behalf, the defendant must renew his motion for directed verdict at the close of all evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Page\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8361622\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/990/760/#p762\">\n    990 So.2d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 9). \"In the absence of a renewal of the directed verdict, a request for a peremptory instruction, or a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, [a defendant] has waived the sufficiency error on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7460531\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/656/1192/#p1197\">\n    656 So.2d at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 27. At the close of all evidence, Woods did not renew his motion for a directed verdict, request a peremptory instruction, or file a post-trial motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). Therefore, Woods's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal is waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Because Woods did not preserve his sufficiency of the evidence argument, the assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 28. However, Woods also contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective\n   because trial counsel (1) failed to request lesser included manslaughter jury instructions; and (2) failed to file any post-trial motion on his behalf. We address only Woods's trial counsel's failure to file any post-trial motion, as the claim is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 29. \"A defendant's right to the effective assistance of counsel in a criminal case is guaranteed by the United States and Mississippi Constitutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

Moreover, Woods does not point to any evidence in the record from which a jury reasonably could find him not guilty of murder and at the same time find him guilty of culpable negligence manslaughter. Indeed, no suggestion was made by either party at trial that Woods negligently had shot Pierre. Although the jury was instructed on heat of passion manslaughter, the jury chose to find Woods guilty of second degree murder. Trial counsel's decision not to request a culpable negligence manslaughter instruction did not prejudice Woods's defense because the evidence did not support a jury's finding on the theory, and the jury rejected a heat of passion manslaughter theory based on the evidence presented. The issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Imperfect Self Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 42. Woods argues that there was \"ample evidence\" for imperfect self defense manslaughter, which would have allowed the jury to find him guilty of manslaughter. \"[U]nder the theory of imperfect self-defense, an intentional killing may be considered manslaughter if done without malice but under a bona fide (but unfounded) belief that it was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12365389\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/302/#p307\">\n    222 So.3d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (Miss. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 43. Unlike Woods's failure to point to any evidence which would have supported a culpable negligence manslaughter instruction, Woods references the following evidence that would have supported an imperfect-self-defense manslaughter instruction: Woods asserted self-defense as his defense at trial; Doris testified that she saw Pierre get something out of his truck that she believed was a gun; Woods knew of Pierre's history of violence with Doris; Doris called 911 twice for help before the shooting; and an argument immediately preceded Pierre's unlawful entrance onto the property. Woods also points out that no gun was found on Pierre after the shooting, indicating that Woods had a bona fide but unfounded belief that it was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 44. While the evidence may have supported an imperfect self defense instruction, it is not apparent from the record that trial counsel's decision not to request the instruction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Certainly, it is conceivable that trial counsel decided to rely solely on the defense of justifiable homicide by way of true self defense and the Castle Doctrine. Trial counsel's strategy very well could have been not to request an imperfect self defense instruction in the hope of an acquittal rather than having the jury settle on the lesser included offense of imperfect self defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 45. It is uncertain whether Woods's trial counsel even considered an imperfect self defense theory, or what his and her reasons were for not requesting an instruction on the theory. Generally, we would deny Woods's claim without prejudice so that it might be pursued in post-conviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambrose v.

However, we proceed to address Woods's additional ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal based on the failure to file a post-trial motion for a new trial, because the record supports an ineffective assistance claim based on facts fully apparent from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808920\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/187/116/#p120\">\n    187 So.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Woods argues the evidence presented at trial weighed heavily in his favor and supported his defense of justifiable homicide. Specifically, the evidence showed that Doris informed Woods about the domestic violence incident, in which Pierre had kicked in the door and had fired a shotgun inside her house, just three weeks prior to the day of the subject shooting. After Doris informed Woods about the incident, Woods asked if she had called the police. On the day of the shooting, Woods was a guest of Doris at her home. Evidence showed that Woods was the aggressor, as Pierre came across the street onto Doris's property toward Woods. An eyewitness confirmed that Woods was not enticing Pierre, and it was not unusual for Woods to be at Doris's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 58. Pierre was warned several times not to come to Doris's residence. Undeterred, Pierre continued to violate the conditions of his bond. Pierre, who was heavily intoxicated, took off his leg brace to fight Woods, crossed the street, and threw Doris down to the ground at the edge of her yard and advanced toward Woods. Evidence showed that Doris saw Pierre retrieve\n   what she believed to be a gun before crossing the street. Doris testified that Pierre told Woods that \"I missed you the first time but I won't miss you this time.\" Woods retrieved a shotgun but remained under the carport of Doris's home, where he had a right to be, as Pierre approached. Woods shot Pierre in the leg as he approached him. Doris said in the last 911 call that Pierre had pulled a gun, and Woods had shot him. Doris testified that Woods was defending himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 59. Had the trial court been presented with a motion for a new trial, it would have evaluated the evidence and the applicability of the Castle Doctrine. Based on the evidence presented at trial, a reasonable probability exists that the trial court would have found that the overwhelming weight of the evidence showed that Woods was in a place where he had a right to be; Pierre was the immediate provoker and aggressor; and Woods was not engaged in unlawful activity. As a result, Woods had no duty to retreat under the Castle Doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-15\">\n    Miss.

The parties do not brief the issue of whether the presumption should not apply because Pierre may have been an \"owner of the dwelling.\" While evidence showed that Pierre once had resided at Fourteen Hampton Court, the evidence does not show whether he was an \"owner of the dwelling\" at the time of the shooting. Moreover, no evidence was presented at trial showing that Woods's possession of the shotgun constituted \"unlawful activity.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-99\">\n   CHAMBERLIN, JUSTICE, CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 65. Because I disagree with the majority's conclusion that \"there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted a motion for a new trial,\" I respectfully dissent. As Woods's conviction was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, his counsel's ineffective assistance did not prejudice him. The jury, after being properly instructed on the law-including Woods's defense of justifiable homicide and the application of the Castle-Doctrine presumption-weighed the evidence and found Woods guilty of murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flynt v.

Thus, the question before this Court is whether-with \"the evidence ... weighed in the light most favorable to the verdict\"-is this such an \"exceptional case[ ] in which the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict\" that there is a reasonable probability that a trial court\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   have granted the motion?\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

I would say no. As noted, this Court presumes that jurors follow the instructions provided to them.\n   <em>\n    Flynt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822770\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/1/#p10\">\n    183 So.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Woods in his appeal fails to offer any proof of prejudice that would foreclose this Court from relying on this bedrock principle. Here, the jury considered the evidence in the record, applied the governing law, and concluded that Woods murdered\n   Pierre. Therefore, as long as the evidence in the record is legally sufficient to support the conviction and the conviction is not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, there is no prejudice to Woods. This is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 72. The State offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Woods killed Pierre with the intent necessary to commit second-degree murder without the authority of law and not in necessary self-defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-19\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b) (Rev. 2014). The parties stipulated to the fact that the State Medical Examiner had determined that Pierre Tenner \"died as a result of a gunshot wound, and the manner of death was homicide.\" Doris also testified that she came back out of her house after hearing the shot and saw Woods with a shotgun. Further, Paul Armstead maintained that he saw Woods retrieve the shotgun and saw Pierre fall to the ground after being shot. Woods also shot Pierre after having entered the house twice during the argument with the knowledge that Doris had contacted law enforcement multiple times. The evidence further demonstrated that Pierre was intoxicated during the argument, with a blood alcohol count of .24. While none of these facts barred Woods's Castle-Doctrine defense and self-defense theory, the facts in this record do support the jury's conclusion that the Castle Doctrine did not apply, that Woods did not act in self-defense and that Woods did in fact murder Pierre. After review of the record, I would find that the evidence was legally sufficient to support Woods's conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 73. In light of this evidence, the verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Pierre was heavily intoxicated at the time and some distance from Woods when Woods shot him. Further, Woods had entered the house multiple times and voluntarily chose to come back outside during the encounter. Woods also knew that Doris had called law enforcement and had asked them to respond to Pierre. Moreover, Pierre\n   <em>\n    was unarmed\n   </em>\n   when Woods shot him and left him to die in the driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 74. Concerning the Castle Doctrine, the Majority assumes that Woods was entitled to the presumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at \u00b6 60. Under Mississippi law, though, whether Woods is entitled to the Castle-Doctrine presumption or not is a question to be resolved by a jury.\n   <em>\n    Newell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034450\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/49/66/#p74\">\n    49 So.3d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73-78 (Miss. 2010). \"In a homicide prosecution where the defendant asserts that the castle doctrine applies, and there are discrepancies in witness testimony, the issue is properly left to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

App. 2017),\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied\n   </em>\n   (Sept. 12, 2017) (citing\n   <em>\n    Flynt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822770\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/1/#p10\">\n    183 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   14 ). This principle was reflected in Jury Instruction D-19, which required the jury to determine that the necessary elements under Section 97-3-15(3) were satisfied by the evidence in the record before applying the presumption to Woods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 75. It is not a foregone conclusion that the circumstances described in Section 97-3-15(3) were supported by the evidence. \"[T]he jury is the judge of the weight and credibility of testimony and is free to accept or reject all or some of the testimony given by each witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    Meshell v.

Much of the evidence that the jury would have considered concerning the application of the presumption was testimony from Doris, a witness whose credibility was attacked a number of times at trial. During cross-examination, Doris admitted that her three written statements (two to law enforcement) each contradicted her testimony on direct examination. Also during cross-examination, Doris claimed that she had told Woods's defense attorney that Pierre had told Woods that he did not get him the other day but was going to get him this time. Doris conceded, though, that none of her prior written statements included Pierre's threat to Woods. From the record evidence, Doris recalls three different accounts of when and where she saw Pierre after he was shot. Further, her testimony and statements differ with one another over whether Woods followed her into the actual house or merely went into the attached laundry room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 77. Again, \"the jury is ... is free to accept or reject all or some of the testimony given by each witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Meshell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588543\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/506/989/#p992\">\n    506 So.2d at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the end of Doris's cross-examination, the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Q. Which one of these stories are we supposed to believe, Ms. Tenner?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   A. The story I told.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Q. Which time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   A. Today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Q. So the one that you said on the day that it happened, the day that it happened, you want us to believe that what you're telling us today is the truth and that's not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A. Today is the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Of course, the jury was not under any requirement to believe that Doris had testified to the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 78. In fact, beyond the contradiction in Doris's own testimony and statements, the jury could also have chosen to find Paul Armstead's testimony more credible. Armstead testified that it did not seem odd for Pierre to be across the street that day. According to Armstead, he did not see Doris intervene between Woods and Pierre. He also maintained that he had not been at 14 Hampton Court that day with Woods-contrary to Doris's claim that Armstead had been drinking with Woods in the carport. Further, Armstead stated that he did not see Pierre with a gun, that Pierre did not act as if he had a gun and that Pierre did not lean into his truck before crossing the street toward Woods. The jury is the ultimate fact-finder and properly weighed the conflicting evidence and arrived at a verdict which the evidence supports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 79. Because there is not a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted a motion for a new trial had one been made, I would affirm Woods's conviction. Sufficient evidence supports the verdict, and the verdict is not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beasley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6957997\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/393/#p403\">\n     136 So.3d at 401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The standard of review for a post-trial motion is abuse of discretion.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    This case differs from\n    <em>\n     Holland\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Giles\n    </em>\n    .
