The Jackson City Council passed an ordinance rezoning an approximately .3 acre parcel of property located at 530 South State Street, Jackson, Mississippi, 39201. Ben Allen, individually and in his capacity as President of Downtown Jackson Partners, Inc., filed a bill of exceptions in the Circuit Court of Hinds County, seeking reversal of the City Council's decision to rezone the property. The circuit court reversed the Jackson City Council's decision. The City appeals from the circuit court's order raising the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to overrule the City Council's decision because no signed bill of exceptions had been filed as required by Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   II. Whether the trial court erred by refusing to dismiss the case for Allen's lack of standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   III. Whether the owner and lessor of the property are necessary parties to the appeal on the basis of basic due process requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2. On July 2, 2015, Marcellus Hogan filed an application requesting that the subject property be rezoned from \"OCGD (Old Capital Green) Sub District 2 to C-3 (General) Commercial District\" for the purpose of allowing the operation of a used auto sales business on the premises. The application for rezoning was signed by Marcellus Hogan and the property owner, James L. Miles. The City refers to Marcellus Hogan as both the lessor and lessee of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maurice Hogan was listed on the application as an individual who\n   would be representing the applicant, Marcellus Hogan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3. On July 27, 2015, the City zoning administrator prepared a report to the City of Jackson Planning Board concerning the property. The zoning administrator recommended denying the rezoning request. On August 25, 2015, the Planning Board held a meeting and considered Marcellus Hogan's request to rezone the property. Marcellus Hogan, James Miles, and Maurice Hogan spoke in support of the rezoning request. The Planning Board denied the rezoning request in a vote of nine to two, with four members absent. The Planning Board found that the criteria for granting a rezoning had not been met. On September 4, 2015, James Miles submitted a written notice of appeal requesting that the City Council review the Planning Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4. On September 21, 2015, the City Council convened for a meeting and held a hearing to consider the rezoning request. The Planning Board staff appeared and presented facts and findings to the City Council. The Planning Board staff recommended that the City Council deny the rezoning request. No one appeared or spoke in favor of the request to rezone the property. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City granted the rezoning request, finding that the criteria for granting a rezoning had been met. Four of the seven City Council members were present at the hearing. The City Council voted to grant the rezoning request in a vote of two to one, with one member abstaining. The city councilman who voted to abstain due to a conflict of interest stated that he would remain in the meeting so that, in his opinion, there would be a quorum. The circuit court took judicial notice of the City Council hearing and minutes. There is no dispute about what transpired at the City Council meeting, namely, the number of City Council members who were present and voted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5. On October 1, 2015, Ben Allen appeared for the first time by filing a notice of appeal and a bill of exceptions under Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 in the circuit court. In Allen's bill of exceptions, he stated that he had standing to file a bill of exceptions as a resident of the City of Jackson and President of Downtown Jackson Partners. Allen stated that Downtown Jackson Partners is a Mississippi nonprofit corporation designated as the district management group for the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District under the district plan adopted by the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District property owners pursuant to the Business Improvement District Act, Mississippi Code Section 21-43-101 through 21-43-133. Allen also stated that the subject property is located in the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District and that Downtown Jackson Partners has been afforded certain responsibilities regarding the Old Capital Green Mixed Use District in which the property is situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6. Allen claimed that neither the applicant nor the property owner appeared at the hearing. Allen also claimed that no one appeared or spoke in favor of the application for rezoning at the hearing. Allen requested that the circuit court reverse the City Council's rezoning decision because there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the decision; the decision was arbitrary and capricious; an insufficient number of council members lawfully participated to constitute a quorum; the application was unlawful because it was not filed in the name of the landowner. Allen alleged the same assignments of error in his notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7. The bill of exceptions contained an unsigned certificate of the mayor. On December 11, 2015, Allen filed a motion to\n   stay implementation of the rezoning ordinance. Allen attached what constitutes a significant portion of the record on appeal to the motion, which includes the initial application for rezoning; zoning administrator's report; warranty deed; minutes of the Planning Board meeting; a notice of the Planning Board decision; James Miles's written appeal of the Planning Board's decision; and a notice of the City Council decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8. On January 23, 2016, Allen filed a motion to compel the City to sign an amended bill of exceptions and to compile the record due to an apparent disagreement regarding the substance of the bill of exceptions and the record. Alternatively, Allen argued that \"if the City [did] not agree with the facts set forth in the [a]mended [b]ill of [e]xceptions, [it should] point out needed corrections and either have the City Council President sign the bill as corrected, or tender the corrections to [Allen] for submission of another amended bill.\" Allen relied on the requirements set out in Section 11-51-75 and\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson County Board of Supervisors v. Quality Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230394\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/767/1007/\">\n    767 So.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2000), in support of his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. Allen claimed that \"[s]ince October 22, 2015, the undersigned attorney has communicated with the City Attorney's office seeking to cause the City to act on the bill of exceptions, either by signing it as is or correcting it, and to prepare the record.\" Allen attached a proposed amended bill of exceptions and proposed certificate of the President of the City Council to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. According to Allen's motion to compel, the City requested Allen to supply an outline of the proposed record to be compiled by the City to be used in the appeal. In response, Allen incorporated an \"outline of the proposed record\" (list of exhibits) in his amended bill of exceptions. The primary difference between the initial bill of exceptions and the amended bill of exceptions was the addition of the exhibit list. Also, the initial bill of exceptions identified the mayor as the official authorized to sign the bill of exceptions while the amended bill of exceptions identified the City Council president as the official authorized to sign. The amended bill of exceptions also contained an added request for the City to produce all documents, ordinances, resolutions, and transcripts related to the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11. For reasons not apparent in the record, the amended bill of exceptions was never signed by the City Council president. The City never responded to Allen's motion to compel. Instead, on January 29, 2016, the City filed a motion to dismiss Allen's appeal. The City argued that Allen lacked standing and the case should be dismissed for failure to join necessary and indispensable parties under Rule 19(a)(2) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. The City argued that the property owner and lessor were necessary and indispensable parties. The City also argued that Allen lacked standing to file a bill of exceptions as the Chief Executive Officer of Downtown Jackson Partners. The City argued that Downtown Jackson Partners was not a \"person aggrieved\" under Section 11-51-75 because it does not own, nor does it have a interest in, property which is or may be affected by the decision of the City Council to rezone the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12. On February 12, 2016, Allen filed a response to the City's motion to dismiss. Allen attached an affidavit in support of his position that he had standing to file a bill of exceptions. In the affidavit, Allen explained his role with Downtown Jackson Partners. Allen also explained Downtown Jackson Partners's role and interest related to the property at issue. On February\n   24, 2016, Allen filed a supplemental affidavit stating that he is a resident citizen of Jackson. Allen also stated that he owns property in Jackson. He further stated that he is a beneficiary of a trust that owns property in Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13. On February 16, 2016, Allen filed a notice of hearing on the motion to stay; motion to compel and to compile the record; and the City's motion to dismiss. The hearing was scheduled for April 20, 2016. The record on appeal contains no transcript of the scheduled hearing and no indication that a hearing actually was held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Circuit Court's Opinion and Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14. On April 26, 2016, the circuit court entered an opinion and order. The circuit court denied the City's motion to dismiss. The circuit court also found that Allen had standing to appeal as the President of Downtown Jackson Partners, representing the interests of the property owners in the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District. The circuit court recognized that Subsection 708.03.04 of the Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District section of the City's zoning ordinance provides a direct role for Downtown Jackson Partners in regulating the development of the district. The circuit court also found that successful applicants for rezoning the property were not necessary, indispensable or proper parties, to be aligned as co-appellees with the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15. The circuit court took judicial notice of the City Council's meeting on September 21, 2015, based on the minutes and video of the meeting available on the City's website. The circuit court found that the vote of two to one, with one abstaining from voting, did not constitute a majority of the quorum under Mississippi Code Section 21-8-11. As such, the circuit court reversed the decision of the City Council and found that the minutes of the council meeting should have reflected that the city councilman's motion to grant the rezoning request failed for lack of majority. The circuit court directed that its opinion and order be supplied to the City Council at the next regular meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16. On May 9, 2016, the City filed a notice of appeal. The City did not address whether the vote constituted a majority of a quorum. Although the circuit court based its order to reverse the City Council's decision on the lack of a majority vote of a quorum, the City limits its argument on appeal to (1) whether the circuit court had jurisdiction; (2) whether Allen has standing; and (3) whether the property owner and lessor are necessary and indispensable parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17.

Whether the circuit court had jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. It is undisputed that counsel for Allen filed an unsigned bill of exceptions in the circuit court. It also is undisputed that counsel for Allen presented a bill of exceptions and amended bill of exceptions to the City to have the president of the municipal authority sign them, but the City, for whatever reason, refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21. On appeal, the City argues for the first time that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because \"no proper and signed\" bill of exceptions was filed as required by Section 11-51-75. The City claims that Allen's failure to file a valid bill of exceptions deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction. Although the City did not raise the argument that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction due to an improper and unsigned bill of exceptions in the circuit court, \"[t]he question of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    B.A.D. v. Finnegan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021395\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/82/608/#p614\">\n    82 So.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 614 (\u00b6 23) (Miss. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22. During oral argument of the present matter, the parties argued the issue of whether certain requirements contained in Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 were jurisdictional or procedural. The Court ordered supplemental briefing addressing the constitutionality of Section 11-51-75. The Court directed the parties to address the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (1) Whether the requirements that follow Section 11-51-75's language, \"may appeal within ten (10) days from the date of adjournment at which session the board of supervisors or municipal authorities rendered such judgment or decision,\" are jurisdictional or procedural.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (2) Whether the signature of the president of the municipal authorities on the bill of exceptions as required by Section 11-51-75 is jurisdictional or procedural.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (3) If the Court determines that the statute or its requirements are procedural, how should the Court proceed in light of the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Newell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9607802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/308/71/\">\n    308 So.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1975), and its progeny?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23. The Court also notified and afforded the Attorney General of Mississippi an opportunity to file a brief addressing the issues because the constitutionality of Section 11-51-75 is at issue. The parties and the Attorney General submitted briefs addressing the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24. Because the three issues regarding the constitutionality of Section 11-51-75 are intertwined, we take the opportunity to address the three issues as a whole in single, comprehensive fashion, beginning with the origin of the bill of exceptions in our State. The need for a comprehensive analysis seems necessary in light of the uncertainty among practitioners who regularly use the bill of exceptions as part of their practice and due to the Court's less than clear precedent. Moreover, an identical issue relating to the signature requirement of bills of exceptions currently is pending before the Court in\n   <em>\n    Tunica Board of Supervisors v. HWCC-Tunica, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2015-CA-01645-SCT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25. The bill of exceptions is a vehicle for appeals that existed at the time Mississippi became a state. It was the means for appealing lower court decisions for more than half of Mississippi's 200-year history. It is time to revisit some of the decisions that have obscured what was once an oft-used and well-understood vehicle for appeals and give clarity to those whose practice\n   of law and work on the bench requires them to work with the bill of exceptions. In doing so, we take the opportunity to return to the straightforward process as it was used for much of our history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Three primary legal principles must be remembered in analyzing the signature requirement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26. Three primary legal principles must be remembered and emphasized throughout the instant analysis of the signature requirement. First, the Constitution of 1890 gives the Legislature authority to set the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Second, the question before the Court in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   is one of interpreting legislative intent. Third, before declaring a statute unconstitutional, we must be satisfied that it is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 27. Article 6, Section 156 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 establishes jurisdiction in the circuit courts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal in this state not vested by this Constitution in some other court, and\n   <em>\n    such appellate jurisdiction as shall be prescribed by law.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The last nine words of Section 156 authorize the Legislature to grant and define appellate jurisdiction to the circuit courts.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Sysco Food Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7010370\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/86/242/#p245\">\n    86 So.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245 (\u00b6 13) n.16 (Miss. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Knox v. L.N.

The Legislature conferred appellate jurisdiction upon the circuit court in Section 11-51-75 (and its statutory ancestors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28. Because the Legislature establishes circuit court appellate jurisdiction, and does so in Section 11-51-75 by authorizing appeal from a county or municipal board decision via a bill of exceptions, the question of whether the signature requirement is jurisdictional is one of statutory interpretation. Of course, our goal when interpreting statutes is to divine the \"true meaning of the Legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Scaggs v. GPCH-GP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8423271\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/931/1274/#p1276\">\n    931 So.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stockstill v.

The first two of the three primary principles that should guide the Court's holdings today lend themselves to a simple conclusion. Before we can declare the signature requirement found in Section 11-51-75 to be unconstitutional as a jurisdictional prerequisite, we must first determine whether the Legislature intended it to be a jurisdictional prerequisite at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 30.

As more fully discussed below, a bill of exceptions is, in and of itself, a jurisdictional requirement should an aggrieved party wish to appeal a decision of a county or municipal board. However,\n   the long history of our opinions in bill of exceptions cases convinces us that a perfect bill of exceptions is not a jurisdictional requirement and, more narrowly and pertinent in the case sub judice, the signature of the president of the board is not a jurisdictional requirement. Given that we must resolve doubts in favor of constitutionality, we hold that Section 11-51-75 does not establish the signature requirement as a jurisdictional prerequisite; accordingly, as it does not exist in the statute, it cannot be an unconstitutional infringement upon the procedural prerogative of the Court, because the statute neither mandates nor forbids that the courts do anything whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 32.

When the Mississippi Legislature adopted the bill of exceptions as a vehicle for appealing the decisions of county and municipal boards, the procedure for its use was clear because it had long been used to appeal lower court decisions, as discussed above. Of course, using the bill of exceptions\n   to appeal a decision of a governing body changed the dynamic in that, rather than being an appeal between two adversaries as to which a neutral judge would verify the record, the governing board was opposed to the party seeking the appeal. The resulting tension leads us to where we are today, with presidents of boards of supervisors and mayors of towns refusing, often on the advice of counsel, to sign the bill of exceptions. Nevertheless, the bill of exceptions was a workable, and really quite simple, mechanism for appeal-even in the county or municipal board context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 37. The first expansion of the bill of exceptions beyond courtroom appeals occurred when the Mississippi Legislature passed a statute that provided that \"it shall and may be lawful for all persons who feel themselves aggrieved by the judgment of the board of police of the county, to appeal by bills of exception or\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to the Circuit Court of his county.\"\n   <em>\n    Yalabusha Cty. v.

There is a dissonant ring in the Court's use of the word jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   . Appellate jurisdiction in the circuit court is, by operation of the Mississippi Constitution, a matter of legislative prerogative. Miss. Const. art. 6, \u00a7 156. While Section 11-51-75 by its plain language requires that an appeal from a county or municipal board be accomplished via a bill of exceptions and that the appeal be made within ten days, it contains very little else that sets forth jurisdictional requirements. Notably absent from the statute-unlike the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   upon which the\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   Court in part relied-are specific content requirements. Jurisdiction is defined as a \"court's power to decide a case or issue a decree.\"\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). When the\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   Courts wrote in terms of jurisdiction, they misused the term. It is clear that failing to embody a sufficient record in the bill of exceptions can be fatal to the attempted appeal-as shown above, such has been the case since the first days of our State. Yet, in other cases, we have allowed appeals made via the bill of exceptions to proceed despite flaws.\n   <em>\n    Yellow Cab Company of Biloxi v. City of Biloxi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9639659,9639749,9639558\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/372/1274/\">\n    372 So.2d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1979). However, we clarify\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   and make it clear that, fatal or not, an insufficient record does not rob the circuit court of jurisdiction as the term is properly understood. Such clarification harmonizes our bill of exceptions jurisprudence of the second half of the twentieth century and today with that of Mississippi's first 133 years. Further, it allows flexibility to the circuit courts to consider whether, imperfections aside, the record presented by the bill of exceptions does provide sufficient information for review as happened in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   and the possibility of which was recognized in\n   <em>\n    Yellow Cab\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    D. No good reason exists to believe the Legislature intended the signature of the president of the county or municipal board to confer jurisdiction on the circuit court.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 50. Moreover, the same conclusion applies to the signature requirement. As discussed above, nothing in the wording of the statute applies the signature requirement to the courts. By its plain language and as recognized in early cases, it sets a ministerial duty of the president of the underlying board. As demonstrated in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   , the court did not consider the absence of a signature to be a jurisdictional bar. Later, in\n   <em>\n    Gill v. Woods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9772545\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/912/\">\n    226 So.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1969), the Court once again held that the circuit court must consider a bill of exceptions unsigned by the president of the Marshall County Board of Supervisors. More strikingly than in\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   , in which the board agreed that the bill of exceptions was accurate, the\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   Court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of an unsigned bill of exceptions where the record failed to show that the board or its president objected to the form and content of the bill of exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9772545\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/226/912/\">\n    226 So.2d at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 51. Even a case often cited for the proposition that the absence of the signature constitutes a jurisdictional bar,\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

Certainly, the\n   <em>\n    Varia\n   </em>\n   Court held that the circuit court had no jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354129\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/241/705/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354129\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/241/705/\">\n    at 707, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1354129\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/241/705/\">\n    133 So.2d 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the failings of the aggrieved party were global, and the aggrieved party failed to comply \"in any manner\" with the bill of exceptions statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 52. It is one thing to conclude that a matter presented to a court is fatally defective, such as when a complaint fails to state a viable claim for relief and is dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure or, more aptly, when an appellate court refuses to consider an assignment of error because the appellant fails to present a sufficient record. It is quite another to conclude that a court has no power or jurisdiction to entertain a matter before it. In light of the foregoing authorities setting forth the history of the uses of the bill of exceptions as a vehicle for appeals first from trial courts and later, by legislative expansion, from county and municipal boards, we hold that the failure to present a bill of exceptions signed by the president of the board falls into the former category rather than the latter. If the absence of the signature were an absolute procedural bar, then the\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   court would not have allowed the matter before it to proceed in the absence of the signature, and the\n   <em>\n    Tillery\n   </em>\n   Court would not have bothered pointing out the disagreement of the board with Tillery regarding the accuracy of the bill of exceptions at issue there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 53. Because we are unconvinced the Legislature never intended the signature requirement to be a jurisdictional prerequisite, and given the three operating principles set forth at the beginning of the instant opinion, we decline to find that the pertinent part of Section 11-51-75 is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Court takes the present opportunity to realign bill of exceptions practice with the language of the statute and the correct, historical practice of appeals from county and municipal boards.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 54. Resolving doubts in favor of the constitutionality of Section 11-51-75 leads to the conclusion-backed by several cases-that the Legislature did not intend the signature requirement to be a constitutional prerequisite. Therefore, it cannot be unconstitutional as such. Further, we clarify that, although the bill of exceptions itself is a jurisdictional requirement for the circuit court to hear an appeal via Section 11-51-75, imperfections in it go to the adequacy of the record to decide the excepted issues rather than the authority of the court to hear the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 55. Finally, we overrule the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

In order to restore fairness and sensibility to the bill of exceptions process, we hold that, going forward, the ten-day deadline contained in the statute applies to the filing of the bill of exceptions with the clerk of the county or municipal board. In\n   <em>\n    Board of Supervisors of Marshall County v.

Accordingly, as long as the bill is filed for consideration with the board within ten days, the courts must consider it to be timely. As was the practice when bills of exception were more commonly used, nothing is filed with the circuit court until the clerk of the board fulfills the duty of submitting the signed bill of exceptions to the circuit court. Although in our later cases, such as\n   <em>\n    Lowndes County v. McClanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6883099\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/161/1052/#p1055\">\n    161 So.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2015), we wrote in passing that a bill of exceptions is filed in the circuit court, we have been unable to find a case in which we considered the issue and overruled the established practice of filing the bill with the clerk of the board first, leaving the clerk to follow the statutory directive of filing the bill with the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 57. If the aggrieved party and the board dispute the accuracy of the record and, for that reason or any other, the president of the board refuses to sign the bill of exceptions as required by the statute, then the aggrieved party can, as was the practice, file a petition for mandamus with the circuit court. The circuit court is best equipped to decide and create a record of such disputes. The circuit court likewise is equipped to consider whether other imperfections in the bill of exceptions render the record before it insufficient to consider the matters excepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 58. However, in order to return to the historical practice surrounding the bill of exceptions outlined above, some work must be done. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , the person aggrieved by the\n   <em>\n    DeSoto County Board of Supervisors'\n   </em>\n   decision did not file a proposed bill of exceptions with the board within ten days, as was the historical practice. Rather, the aggrieved party, John Bowen, filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court within the first ten days.\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098398\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/852/21/#p24\">\n    852 So.2d at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1).

Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   Court reached its holding without overruling or discussing the myriad earlier cases that recognized the mandatory nature of the bill of exceptions-including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Varia\n   </em>\n   . Indeed (and confusingly), after the Court handed down\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , the bill of exceptions was affirmed as a jurisdictional requirement in the later case of\n   <em>\n    McIntosh v.

Today we should take advantage of the opportunity to overrule\n   <em>\n    Bowen\n   </em>\n   , which allows clarification and simplification of the bill of exceptions process by returning to that which the statute actually provides, which is the filing of a bill of exceptions with the clerk of the appropriate county or municipal board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 59. In his separate opinion, Justice Chamberlin characterizes the bill of exceptions as an optional procedural vehicle. (Sp. Con. at \u00b6 88). However, the Legislature cannot set court procedure in statutes.\n   <em>\n    Newell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9607802\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/308/71/\">\n    308 So.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1975). In\n   <em>\n    Newell\n   </em>\n   , we held that, pursuant to the separation of powers in Mississippi's Constitution, we have the sole authority to control court procedures, but Section 11-51-75 provides nothing about the courts until it requires the clerk of the county or municipal board to forward the signed bill of exceptions to the clerk of the circuit court. The Section 11-51-75 directives that the clerk of the board accept the bill of exceptions and that the president of the board sign the bill of exceptions apply to actions that take place outside the courts, and therefore cannot be matters of court procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 60. The unique nature of Section 11-51-75 bills of exceptions, which allow the decisions of county and municipal legislative bodies to be appealed to the judicial branch of government, poses another problem for Justice Chamberlin's characterization of them as optional procedures. Pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a), notices of appeal are filed in the trial court. Our constitutional authority to establish court procedures does not give us the authority to require municipal and county boards to accept notices of appeal which are filed there. Similarly, it does not give us the authority to direct them to forward completed records to the courts. Only the Legislature may direct county governments to act, and it has in Section 11-51-75. If bills of exceptions are abandoned, then no constitutionally viable means of appeal from a county or municipal board remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

For the first time on appeal, the City criticizes Allen's bill of exceptions because it read like a complaint and did not contain any of the necessary parts of the record, such as the report of the zoning administrator and staff, the minutes and transcript of the Planning Board, or the minutes of the City Council. Indeed, the report of the zoning administrator, minutes of the Planning Board, and minutes of the City Council were not included or attached to Allen's bill of exceptions or amended bill of exceptions; rather Allen attached the documents to his motion to stay. The circuit court took judicial notice of the documents that Allen attached to his motion to stay, as well as the minutes and video recording of the City Council meeting under Mississippi Rule of Evidence 201(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ditto v.

The City does not dispute the content or accuracy of any of the documents judicially noticed by the circuit court, nor did the City argue to the circuit court that an insufficient record was before it. Instead, the City filed a motion to dismiss Allen's appeal to the circuit court based on standing and the failure to join necessary and indispensable parties. While insufficiency of the record may have been grounds for dismissal on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for the circuit court, the lack of the signature of the president of the City Council did not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction, as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1451741\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/109/872/\">\n    69 So. at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weathersby\n   </em>\n   , as clarified above, even an insufficient record does not rob the circuit court of jurisdiction. Indeed, the lack of a signature of the bill of exceptions goes to the adequacy of the record to decide the excepted issues rather than the authority of the court to hear the appeal. Here, without objection, the circuit court properly concluded, imperfections aside, the record presented by the bill of exceptions provided sufficient information for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 63. The circuit court stated in its order that it had reviewed documents pertaining to the rezoning matter that had been supplied to Allen by the City Planning Department and which were contained in the collective exhibit to Allen's motion to stay. The circuit court also reviewed the exhibits attached to Allen's motion to compel the City to sign the bill of exceptions and to compile the record. The circuit court took judicial notice of the City Council's meeting and the video recording. Accordingly, the circuit court, without objection from the City, concluded it had a sufficient record before it to find that the City Council had voted to rezone the subject property in a vote of two to one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 64. Section 21-8-11 provides, in relevant part: \"At any and all meetings of the council, a majority of the members thereof shall constitute a quorum and the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum at any meeting shall be necessary to adopt any motion, resolution or ordinance, or to pass any measure whatever unless otherwise provided in this chapter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2021-8-11\">\n    Miss.

Only four members of the City Council were in attendance at the subject September 21, 2015, meeting. One of the four members present abstained from voting due to a conflict of interest. Based on the record before it, the circuit court found that the City Council's vote did not constitute a majority of the quorum under Section 21-8-11, where only two of the four members present at the City Council meeting voted to adopt the rezoning ordinance on the property. As a result of the unlawful vote, the circuit court reversed the City Council's decision to rezone the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 66. The circuit court found that the minutes of the City Council meeting should have reflected that the motion failed for lack of a majority and directed the City to advise the members of the City Council of its findings and supply it with a copy of its order reversing the City Council's decision under Section 11-51-75, which provides in pertinent part: \"If the judgment be reversed, the circuit court shall render such judgment as the board or municipal authorities ought to have rendered, and certify the same to the board of supervisors or municipal authorities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-51-75\">\n    Miss.

The City argues that Allen as President of Downtown Jackson Partners lacked standing to bring an appeal because he is not a \"person aggrieved\" under Section 11-51-75. The City argues that Downtown Jackson Partners is not a \"person aggrieved\" by the City Council decision because it does not own, nor does it have an interest in, property which is or may be affected by the rezoning of the subject property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 68.

The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   It is well settled that Mississippi's standing requirements are quite liberal. This Court has explained that while federal courts adhere to a stringent definition of standing, limited by Art. 3, \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution to a review of actual cases and controversies, the Mississippi Constitution contains no such restrictive language. Therefore, this Court has been more permissive in granting standing to parties who seek review of governmental actions. In Mississippi, parties have standing to sue when they assert a colorable interest in the subject matter of the litigation or experience an adverse effect from the conduct of the defendant, or as otherwise provided by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433761\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/814/149/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and quotations omitted).

The documents shall be on file at the City of Jackson's City Clerk's Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 73. Allen claims that Downtown Jackson Partners will be negatively impacted by the rezoning decision because the subject property no longer will be classified as Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District. As a result, Downtown Jackson Partners no longer will be able to ensure that the property will adhere to the Old Capitol\n   Green Sustainable Design Guidelines and the Old Capitol Green Master Plan as provided in Subsection 708.03.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 74. The circuit court found that \"Allen has standing to bring this appeal as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Downtown Jackson Partners, which was created by the property owners [of the district] to manage the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District.\" Certainly, Downtown Jackson Partners has asserted a colorable interest in the subject matter of the litigation and has demonstrated that the City's action had an adverse effect on property in which it has an interest. The circuit court also found that \"[a]s president of the organization [Allen] represents the interests of the property owners of the district, who individually would also have standing to take an appeal as aggrieved parties to the rezoning decision.\" We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in making its factual findings as to Allen's standing in his capacity as President of Downtown Jackson Partners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 75. The interest of preventing the property being rezoned for the purpose of allowing the operation of a used car dealership in the Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District certainly is germane to the Downtown Jackson Partners' purpose of ensuring compliance with the Old Capitol Green Sustainable Design Guidelines and the Old Capitol Green Master Plan. Allen assured that property owners in the Downtown Jackson Business Improvement District will suffer negative impacts to their use, enjoyment and value of their respective properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 76. The relief sought by Allen on behalf of Downtown Jackson Partners does not require individual members. The Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Whether an association has standing to invoke the court's remedial powers on behalf of its members depends in substantial measure on the nature of the relief sought. If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supported that the remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Manufactured Hous. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9277774\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/870/1189/#p1192\">\n    870 So.2d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 77. Moreover, when an association seeks only prospective relief and raises only issues of law, it need not prove the individual circumstances of its members to obtain relief, and the third element of associational standing is met.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9277774\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/870/1189/#p1192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 21). The owner of the property at issue, located within the Old Capitol Green Mixed Use District, obviously does not share the same interest as Downtown Jackson Partners because he sought to have the property rezoned. Regardless, the relief sought by Allen on behalf of Downtown Jackson Partners will insure the benefit of the members of the association actually injured,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the remaining property owners in the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 78. Given the Court's liberal standing requirements, the Court cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in finding that Allen in his capacity as President of Downtown Jackson Partners has standing. Thus, the City's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Whether the owner and lessor of the property are necessary and indispensable parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 79. The City argues for the first time on appeal that the property owner and lessor have a basic, due process right to be joined or at least to have sufficient notice of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 80. In the City's motion to dismiss, the City limited its argument to the failure to join necessary and indispensable parties under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a)(2). However, the City did not mention Rule 19 in its appellant's brief on the issue and apparently has abandoned the theory on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magee v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7545324\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/542/228/#p234\">\n    542 So.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234 (Miss. 1989) (\"Th[e] Court has traditionally held that where an assignment of error is not discussed in the briefs it is considered abandoned or waived.\"). Even if the Court were to apply Rule 19(a)(2), the City's argument fails. Neither the property owner nor the lessor has appeared and sought to intervene to \"claim[ ] an interest relating to the subject matter of the action[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miss. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 81. Instead, the City argues for the first time that the property owner and lessor, who had requested the rezoning, were not given notice of Allen's appeal or any opportunity to respond to an action that would affect the value of the property. Because the City failed to raise the due process argument in the circuit court, it is barred from raising the argument for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weiner v. Meredith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8404466\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/943/692/#p696\">\n    943 So.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 696 (\u00b6 17) (Miss. 2006) (\"It is well established that this Court does not entertain arguments made for the first time on appeal as the case must be decided on the facts contained in the record and not on assertions in the briefs.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 82. Even assuming the City is able to advance the new due process argument for the first time on appeal, the argument fails. The record contains no evidence as to whether or not notice of Allen's appeal to the circuit court was provided to the property owner and lessor. The only information related to who received notice may be inferred from the certificates of service of Allen's pleadings filed in the circuit court and do not include Marcellus Hogan or James Miles. The record shows no effort on the City's behalf to ensure that the property owner and lessor received notice of Allen's appeal to the circuit court. Notably, the certificate of service to the City's motion to dismiss did not include the property owner and lessor. The City did not file a motion to join the property owner or lessor. The City's inaction regarding notice to the property owner and lessor makes its due process argument seem hollow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 83. The City simply argues that in\n   <em>\n    McKee v. City of Starkville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003432\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/97/#p102\">\n    97 So.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012), the Mississippi Court of Appeals held that due process requires notice and the opportunity to be heard at all critical stages of the process. However, in\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   , the applicant was not given notice or any opportunity to be heard before the meeting of the board of alderman at which his rezoning request was considered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003432\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/97/#p102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003432\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/97/#p102\">\n    at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 2). Unlike the applicant in\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   , the property owner and lessor filed a written notice of appeal of the Planning Board's decision and received notice of the City Council hearing, yet did not appear at the hearing. In\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   , the applicant himself appealed the decision of the board of aldermen to the circuit court and argued that his individual due process rights were violated because he did not have notice of the board of aldermen's meeting at which his rezoning request was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003432\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/97/#p102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 84. Here, the City lacks standing to assert the argument on behalf of the property owner and lessor. The City cites no authority that it may step into the shoes of the property owner and lessor and assert a due process violation on their behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Humphries v.

Following the City's refusal to comply with its ministerial duty to sign the bill of exceptions under Section 11-51-75, Allen proceeded by filing an unsigned bill of exceptions embodying the pertinent facts. Despite the lack of a signature, the circuit court properly exercised jurisdiction. The circuit court took judicial notice of the City Council minutes and video of the City Council meeting. The record presented by the bill of exceptions and materials judicially noticed were sufficient for the circuit court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 86. We affirm the circuit court's order reversing the City Council's decision because of a lack of a majority vote of a quorum under Section 21-8-11. We also affirm the circuit court's order finding Allen has standing to file a bill of exceptions in his capacity as President of Downtown Jackson Partners. Finally, we affirm the circuit court's finding that the property owner and lessor were not necessary and indispensable parties to the appeal. The City's due process argument was not preserved in the circuit court, and even if it had been preserved, the City's argument is without merit because it has no standing to assert the due process rights of the property owner and lessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 87.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., MAXWELL AND BEAM, JJ., CONCUR.

I agree with the result reached by the majority. I also applaud the excellent recitation of the history of the bill of exceptions in our state. However, I must specially concur because, as that same history shows, the law surrounding the bill of exceptions has become a convoluted, unworkable mess. It is a legal dinosaur that somehow avoided the fallout from the judicial meteors that became our procedural rules. It is, nevertheless, law and we should recognize the bill of exceptions for what it is, an optional procedural vehicle to compile the record of proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 89. Mississippi Code Section 11-51-75 contains, in my view, only one jurisdictional mandate, that any appeal be filed within ten days from the date of adjournment. The language regarding the bill of exceptions merely embodies the method of compiling the record. Further, it is optional, as denoted by the word \"may\" preceding the procedure. The majority treats this permissive language as both mandatory and jurisdictional. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 90. The majority opines that this special concurrence runs afoul of\n   <em>\n    Newell v.

That is incorrect. I make no comment on the constitutionality or enforceability of the bill of exceptions, only that it is not mandatory. While resorting to this procedure may be necessary, if constitutional and enforceable, in some appeals from lower authorities, it simply is not a mandatory jurisdictional requirement. I, therefore, specially concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   WALLER, C.J., KING, BEAM AND ISHEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.
