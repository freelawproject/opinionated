R.S. 40:969. For the following reasons, we affirm defendant's underlying convictions and sentences, as well as defendant's multiple offender adjudication and enhanced sentence, and remand for correction of the commitments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because defendant pled guilty, the facts were not fully developed at a trial. However, during the guilty plea colloquy, the State provided the following factual basis for the guilty pleas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Willie Thornton engaged in conduct to further the aims of an Enterprise by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity and conspiring with members of the Enterprise to distribute controlled dangerous substances, including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. This conduct, which occurred between 2006 and 2015, included participating in the operation of a narcotics distribution network on the Westbank of Jefferson Parish wherein a violent street gang, named by its members the \"Harvey Hustlers,\" obtained controlled dangerous substances from associates and Enterprise members who transported the drugs into the metropolitan New Orleans area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The ranking members of the Harvey Hustlers then directed the conversion of these drugs into a saleable form, such as converting powder cocaine to crack cocaine, and provided the drugs to rank and file Harvey Hustlers who sold the drug product on the street for the profit of Enterprise members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Members of the Enterprise who engaged in this activity on a daily basis included all of those folks-all those individuals who are named in the Bill of Indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Members of the Harvey Hustlers frequently identified themselves openly through items of jewelry and clothing containing a[n] \"HH\" logo, tattoos containing phrases identified with the gang, social media posts, and YouTube videos.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Enterprise members and their associates engaged in acts of violence to protect the perceived interests of the Enterprise's members, exact revenge upon enemies of Enterprise members, punish Enterprise members whose conduct displeased Enterprise leaders and to develop a reputation of the Harvey Hustlers as a group to be feared by members of the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Thornton, among other acts, on December 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2011, distributed cocaine to a confidential informant working with the FBI. Mr. Thornton also on November 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , 2013, along with Robert Williams, Alcus Smith, and Brandon Motton possessed cocaine having intent to distribute that cocaine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 26, 2015, the Jefferson Parish grand jury indicted defendant and twenty other co-defendants on thirty criminal counts for various acts of racketeering committed in furtherance of a narcotics distribution network in Jefferson Parish operated by a street gang known as the \"Harvey Hustlers.\" Specifically, defendant was charged with five counts: racketeering, in violation of La. R.S. 15:1352 ; conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of La. R.S. 40:979 and La. R.S. 40:967(A) ; conspiracy to distribute heroin and marijuana, in violation of La. R.S. 40:979 and La. R.S. 40:966(A) ; distribution of cocaine, in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A) ; and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A). At his arraignment\n   on March 9, 2015, defendant pled not guilty to the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 13, 2016, defendant withdrew his prior pleas of not guilty and pled guilty as charged. In accordance with the plea agreement, the court sentenced defendant as follows: for racketeering, twenty years imprisonment at hard labor; for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, fifteen years imprisonment at hard labor; for conspiracy to distribute heroin, twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; for distribution of cocaine, twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for the first two years; and for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for the first two years. The court further ordered that all of defendant's sentences be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also, on January 13, 2016, the State filed a multiple offender bill of information on the conspiracy to distribute cocaine count alleging defendant to be a second felony offender, to which defendant stipulated. The trial court vacated defendant's sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and resentenced defendant as a second felony offender under La. R.S. 15:529.1, to twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence to run concurrently with his other sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 5, 2017, defendant filed an application for post-conviction relief requesting an out-of-time appeal, which was granted by the trial court on June 12, 2017. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, defendant raises two assignments of error: first, defendant argues that the statutory prohibition on parole eligibility for conspiracy to distribute heroin is erroneous and violates the federal and state constitutional guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment, and, second, defendant argues that this Court should remand this matter for a hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim presented in his application for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his first assignment of error, defendant alleges that his guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute heroin was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant contends that, due to an error by the Louisiana Legislature, the penalty for conspiracy to distribute heroin found in La. R.S. 40:979\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is \"substantially more severe\" than the penalty for heroin distribution in La. R.S. 40:966\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   because parole eligibility is prohibited by the conspiracy statute. Consequently,\n   defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen\n   </em>\n   , 03-192 (La. App. 4 Cir. 5/28/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105573\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/849/82/#p85\">\n    849 So.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85-87,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   argues that the penalty for those who conspire to distribute heroin is cruel and unusual because they are not eligible for parole, while those offenders that actually distribute heroin are eligible for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its brief, the State responds that defendant, who failed to raise this issue in the lower court, is precluded from raising the constitutionality of a statute for the first time on appeal. The State further submits that, to the extent defendant may be challenging his sentence as being constitutionally excessive, he is precluded from raising this issue on appeal as his sentence was imposed in conformity with his plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Further, when the Louisiana Attorney General's Office was notified pursuant to La. R.S. 13:4448 that defendant challenged the constitutionality of a statute on appeal, the Attorney General filed its brief, arguing that defendant is procedurally barred from raising this error on appeal as he failed to raise the issue at the trial court and serve the Louisiana Attorney General's Office, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 1880. Moreover, the Attorney General contends that by entering into a plea agreement, defendant is prohibited from seeking review of his sentence on appeal, except for excessiveness, which he has not established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The record in this matter reflects that defendant pled guilty to various crimes, including conspiracy to distribute heroin, after being properly advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights. The trial judge advised defendant of the nature of the charges against him; the sentencing ranges for the offenses, including the restriction of parole for conspiracy to distribute heroin under La. R.S. 40:979(B) ; and the sentences that would be imposed upon acceptance of his guilty pleas. Defendant indicated that he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible penalties that could be imposed, including the denial of parole eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to the plea agreement set forth in the record, the trial judge sentenced defendant to twenty years at hard labor, without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for conspiracy to distribute heroin. Most importantly, defendant, at no point, objected to the sentence or raised the constitutionality of the penalty portion of La. R.S. 40:979(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A statute is presumed constitutional and the burden of proving a claim of unconstitutionality rests upon the party attacking the statute.\n   <em>\n    State v. Interiano\n   </em>\n   , 03-1760 (La. 2/13/04),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9266412,9266469\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/868/9/\">\n    868 So.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13. The constitutionality of a statute must first be presented in the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mickel\n   </em>\n   , 07-47 (La.

A party contesting the constitutionality of a statute has a three-tiered burden: 1) the presentation must be made in the trial court; 2) the claim of unconstitutionality must be specially pled; and 3) the grounds for the\n   claim must be particularized.\n   <em>\n    Mickel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, defendant did not raise the constitutionality of the restriction on parole set forth under La. R.S. 40:979 in the trial court. Accordingly, to the extent that defendant challenges the constitutionality of La. R.S. 40:979, that argument is procedurally barred as it cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Wise\n   </em>\n   , 14-378 (La.

La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of his sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement, which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This Court has consistently recognized that La.

Accordingly, we find that, pursuant to La.

Accordingly, this assignment was not considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his final assignment of error, defendant seeks remand of this matter to allow him to pursue his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He claims that he pled guilty under the advice of his attorney that he would be eligible for parole after serving eight to twelve years of his sentence. Defendant maintains his claim is supported by correspondence from his attorney, which was attached to his application for post-conviction relief.

According to\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we remand this matter and hereby order the district court to correct the noted discrepancies in the commitments and UCO/MO-UCOs.
