The trial court found Plaintiffs to be free of fault, and the minor to be 100% at fault. The judgment incorrectly cast him in judgment for damages and court costs, as he was a minor at the time of the accident and not a named defendant in the suit. Plaintiffs' attorney subsequently presented to the trial court an amended judgment and order with regard to the quantum and court costs assessed to the minor with no opposition filed by any party. However, that amended judgment and order never got filed into the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants now appeal the trial court's ruling. Their argument is that the trial court erred in rendering judgment against a minor, in its allocation of fault and in its award of general damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs, Brenda and Tobice Pritchard (\"Pritchards\"), filed suit against Defendants, Edwin and Carla Ratcliff (\"Ratcliffs\") and their insurer, GEICO Casualty Company (\"GEICO\"), for injuries they sustained as a result of an automobile collision that occurred on May 27, 2013, in Natchez, Mississippi. The accident occurred when the Pritchards' vehicle, driven by Tobice Pritchard, in which Brenda Pritchard was a passenger, struck the vehicle being driven by the Defendants' minor child as he attempted to make a left-hand turn across a four-lane intersection in front of the Pritchards' vehicle. Initially, the Pritchards filed separate lawsuits, but the suits were later consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants' insurer, GEICO, by stipulation has insurance coverage of $50,000.00 per person, $100,000.00 per accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a bench trial, the trial court awarded general damages in the amount of $26,000.00 to Brenda Pritchard and awarded general damages in the amount of $50,000.00 to Tobice Pritchard against the Defendants' minor child and GEICO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants timely filed a motion for suspensive appeal.

We find merit to this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the de novo standard of review, the appellate court assigns no special weight to the trial court and, instead, if possible, when it finds that the trial court made a reversible error of law, then conducts a de novo review and renders judgment on the record.\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

An amended judgment and order with regard to the quantum and court costs assessed to the minor was subsequently submitted to the court, with no opposition filed by any party. However, the amended judgment and order never got filed into the record. Therefore, we amend the judgment to correct the phraseology that incorrectly cast the minor in judgment, to instead cast Defendants, Edwin and Carla Ratcliff, in judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Changing the phraseology of the judgment does not affect the rights of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In their first assignment of error, Defendants' second contention is that the trial court committed manifest error in its allocation of fault.

Mr. Pritchard was seen by Dr. Edward Obrien, who ordered a CT scan of the thoracic spine, cervical spine, and brain, and an x-ray of the femur. The CT scan of the thoracic spine revealed a chronic fracture of the left L1 traverse process and a small hiatal hernia ; the CT scan of the cervical spine revealed no evidence of a fracture or subluxation; the CT scan of the brain revealed no acute intracranial abnormality; and the x-ray of the femur revealed no soft tissue or bony abnormalities. Upon discharge, Dr. Obrien prescribed Methocarbamol 750mg for muscle spasms/pain and Ketorolac 10mg for pain as needed, with instructions for Mr. Pritchard to follow up with his primary care physician as needed. Subsequently, Mr. Pritchard had a follow-up visits on June 10, 2013, at Riverpark Medical Center, in which he presented with continued pain in his neck, shoulder, and back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, Mr. Pritchard testified that he refilled his medications once, and although he continues to use over-the-counter medications for his pain, he continues to suffer from pain in his neck, lower back, and left leg. He also testified that since the accident he now wears a back brace and a brace around his chest that somehow helps with his neck pain, although it does not completely alleviate it. Mr. Pritchard also testified that he no longer goes fishing and hunting, activities he enjoyed prior to the accident, because he cannot sit due to the pain, and that his wife is always on him because he doesn't want to go anywhere because he doesn't want to drive. Mr. Pritchard further testified that as a result of the airbag deploying, he suffered bruises and abrasions which took two to three weeks to subside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Brenda Pritchard, who was a passenger in her husband's vehicle at the time of the accident, was also transported by ambulance from the accident scene to Natchez Regional Medical Center where she presented with head, belly, and neck pain. Mrs. Pritchard was also seen by Dr. Obrien, who ordered a CT scan of the neck, which revealed no acute cervical spine injury. Upon discharge, Dr. Obrien instructed Mrs. Pritchard to follow up with her primary care physician as needed. Subsequently, Mrs. Pritchard had a follow-up visit on June 10, 2013, at Riverpark Medical Center, where she presented with pain in her lower back and right arm. Moreover, Mrs. Pritchard testified at trial that upon impact the \"airbag went off and smoke was everywhere,\" and she was in a panic to get out of the vehicle because she \"thought it was on fire.\" Mrs. Pritchard\n   also testified that she was bruised and sore around her belly where the seatbelt was, and that it took approximately two to three weeks for the bruising's discoloration to subside. Mrs. Pritchard further testified that since the accident, her husband is more paranoid about her driving while he is in the vehicle with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the instant case, the parties stipulated that the GEICO policy insuring Defendants has insurance coverage of $50,000.00 per person, $100,000.00 per accident. The trial court concluded that Mr. Pritchard suffered $56,000.00 in general damages and (by stipulation of the parties) $14,166.70 in special damages (subject to a credit in the amount of $5,000.00 previously paid by State Farm Insurance Company), leaving a balance of $9,166.70, for a total of all damages owed of $65,166.70. The trial court reduced those damages to $50,000.00 subject to the stipulated cap. The trial court further concluded that Mrs. Pritchard had $26,000.00 in general damages and (by stipulation of the parties) $6,518.00 in special damages (subject to a credit in the amount of $5,000.00 previously paid by State Farm Insurance Company, leaving a balance due and owing in the amount of $1,518.00), for a total of all damages awarded to Mrs. Pritchard of $27,518.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the instant case, the trial court did not provide written reasons for its award of general damages; however, the award included both special and general damages. Both Plaintiffs testified that they continue to experience pain as a result of the injuries they sustained in the accident almost three years from the accident. Moreover, Mr. Pritchard testified that while he wore a brace while doing physical work prior to the accident, since the accident he now wears one when he \"gets out all day long\" to keep from hurting. Mrs. Pritchard testified that in addition to the physical pain she has experienced since the accident, both she and her husband are more anxious about driving since the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Considering the facts before us, and considering that the Plaintiffs' injuries include physical pain and suffering, disability, anxiety and despair, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in its award of general damages, which included special damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANCILLARY MATTER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs, who neither appealed nor answered the appeal, are presently before this court alleging two assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PLAINTIFFS' ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   1.
