Bagneris, Pro Tempore\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant, Richard Zimmer, appeals the dismissal of his Petition for Intervention in the interdiction proceedings concerning his 18-year old daughter, Mattie Zimmer. He also appeals the district court's denial of his motion to stay the interdiction proceedings pending resolution of this appeal. For the reasons that follow, we find that the judgment of the district court should be reversed, and this matter remanded to district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant, Richard Zimmer (\"Mr. Zimmer\"), is the father of 18-year old Mattie Zimmer (\"Mattie\"). His former wife, Jamie Landry-Zimmer (\"Ms. Landry-Zimmer\"), is Mattie's mother. Upon Mattie's turning 18 years of age, Ms. Landry-Zimmer filed a Petition for Interdiction seeking Mattie's interdiction due to medical issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Attorney David Gernhauser was appointed curator\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   to represent Mattie in the interdiction pursuant to La. C.C.P. article 4544, and Mr. Zimmer received notice of the proceedings pursuant to La. C.C.P. article 4543.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following receipt of that notice, Mr. Zimmer filed a Petition for Intervention objecting to the interdiction of Mattie, and alternatively praying that he be appointed as curator for Mattie, or in the further alternative, as undercurator. Ms. Landry-Zimmer filed peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action to the Intervention. Prior to the hearing on the exceptions, Ms. Landry-Zimmer voluntarily dismissed her exception of no right of action. After a hearing on the exception of no cause of action, the district court maintained that exception and dismissed Mr. Zimmer's Petition for Intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Zimmer filed a timely Motion for Devolutive Appeal, appealing the judgment dismissing his Petition for Intervention, and requesting a stay of the district court proceedings pending his appeal. The district court granted the devolutive appeal and denied the stay. The instant appeal was timely filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Zimmer asserts three assignments of error, namely:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1) The district court committed manifest legal error when it sustained Ms. Landry-Zimmer's exception of no cause of action and dismissed Mr. Zimmer's Petition for Intervention;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2) The district court abused its discretion and committed manifest error in refusing to allow the Appellant to amend his Petition for Intervention to remove the grounds for the exception of no cause of action; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3) The district court abused its discretion in refusing to stay the district court proceedings pending the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The district court erred when it sustained Ms. Landry-Zimmer's exception of no cause of action and dismissed Mr. Zimmer's Petition of Intervention.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his first assignment of error, Mr. Zimmer takes issue with the district court's ruling maintaining Ms. Landry-Zimmer's exception of no cause of action and dismissing his intervention. In maintaining the exception, the district judge stated: \"Mr. Zimmer does not have a justiciable interest in, and connexity to, the principal action, and the interest is not so related or connected to the facts or object of the principal action that a judgment under principal action will have a direct impact on his rights. Thus the Exception of No Cause of Action is granted.\" Rec. 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite the fact that the litigants and the district court have captioned and characterized the subject exception as one for no cause of action, in our view it is more properly designated as an exception of no right of action. Although the exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action are often confused or improperly combined, they are separate and distinct.\n   <em>\n    Badeaux v. Southwest Computer Bureau, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 05-0612, 05-719, p. 6 (La. 3/17/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429226\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/1211/#p1216\">\n    929 So.2d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216.

In contrast, the peremptory exception of no cause of action tests the legal sufficiency of the petition by determining whether the law affords a remedy to anyone based on the facts alleged in the pleading.\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.

We note that \"the proper procedural exception to challenge the appellant's 'justiciable right' ... is the exception of No Right of Action.\"\n   <em>\n    Atchley v.

App. 5 Cir. 1/14/98). Likewise, where an exception is based upon \"the lack of connexity between the intervention and the principal demand, the proper exception is one raising the objection of no right of action....\"\n   <em>\n    IberiaBank v. Live Oak Circle Dev., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   , 12-1636, p. 6 (La.

Thus, the exception at issue in this matter was mischaracterized and is properly\n   considered an exception of no right of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, \"[h]arsh rules of pleading are not favored in this state.\"\n   <em>\n    State, Dep't of Children &amp; Family Servs. ex rel.

Connexity is present if the intervenor's claim is \"so related or connected to the facts or object of the main action that a judgment on the main action will have a direct impact on the intervenor's rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7631026\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/455/1260/#p1263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the case at bar, Mr. Zimmer's intervention petition seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he be named curator or undercurator of his daughter. As a parent of the defendant, he ranks highest in statutory preference (co-equal with Ms. Landry-Zimmer) of the possible appointees for this role.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   His claim\n   is in direct opposition to the prayer of petitioner, Ms. Landry-Zimmer, that she be named curatrix and her mother undercuratrix. In addition, because the judgment in the interdiction determines which of these parties is named curator or undercurator, it has a direct impact on the intervenor's rights. Accordingly, we find that Mr. Zimmer's intervention has the requisite justiciability and connexity to the main demand to confer a right of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We also note that in a somewhat analogous case, this Court determined that the father of an adult proposed interdict has a legal interest in the interdiction proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ltd. Interdiction of Hester\n   </em>\n   , 96-1195, p. 2 (La.

The proposed interdict in\n   <em>\n    Hester\n   </em>\n   was a divorced couple's 19-year old daughter who suffered from a variety of conditions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.1, n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7425616\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/684/506/#p507\">\n    684 So.2d at 506, n. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

C.C.P. arts. 4541, 4543. It is further buttressed by the fact, as noted above, that parents are listed as preferential appointees as curator. La. C.C. P. art. 4561(C). For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court erred in sustaining Ms. Landry-Zimmer's exception and dismissing Mr. Zimmer's intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because we find that the intervention should have been allowed, we pretermit the issue of whether the district court erred in refusing to allow Mr. Zimmer to amend his Petition for Intervention to remove the grounds for the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to stay the trial court proceedings pending the appeal of the dismissal of his Petition for Intervention.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Zimmer also asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing\n   to stay the interdiction proceeding during the pendency of the instant appeal. We disagree. A trial court's denial of a motion for stay should not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hester v. Hester\n   </em>\n   , 98-0854, p. 4 (La.

Mr. Zimmer asked for and was granted leave to file a devolutive appeal, rather than a suspensive appeal. A devolutive appeal, by definition, \"does not suspend the effect or the execution of an appealable order or judgment.\" La. C.C. P. art. 2087. Moreover, our Code of Civil Procedure directs that interdiction proceedings shall be heard summarily and by preference in accordance with La.C.C.P. art. 4547. Given these facts and law, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed, and this matter remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Following the lodging of the record, Appellee moved to supplement the record with a transcript of the interdiction hearing which took place after the appealed judgment. \"An appellate court cannot review evidence that is not in the record on appeal and cannot receive new evidence.\"\n    <em>\n     Miccol Enterprises, Inc. v.

We note that the intervention seeks,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that Mr. Zimmer be named either curator or undercurator. The Code of Civil Procedure clearly contemplates an action for a parent to be named curator or undercurator for an adult child. La. C.C.P. art. 4561(C).
