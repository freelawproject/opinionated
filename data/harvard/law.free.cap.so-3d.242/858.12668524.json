This is an appeal from Warren County Circuit Court stemming from a jury verdict in an asbestos-related action in which Bennie Oakes was awarded $50,000. The jury found that Oakes had $250,000 of damages, with Illinois Central Railroad Company found to be twenty percent negligent and Oakes eighty percent negligent. Following the jury verdict, Illinois\n   Central moved for a setoff of Oakes's damages, asserting that his award should be reduced by the amounts received from asbestosis trust funds and other sources for the same injury. Because the complaint was filed under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) and that act seeks to fully compensate the employee for tortious conduct, we affirm the circuit court's denial of the setoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Clara Hagan, the daughter and representative of Oakes, filed suit against Illinois Central under the FELA seeking damages for the lung cancer and death sustained by Oakes as a result of Oakes's exposure to asbestos while working for Illinois Central. Prior to and during the pendency of the complaint, Oakes or his representatives sought recovery for Oakes's lung cancer and death from others, including several asbestos trusts. Illinois Central sought to determine the exact amounts recovered by Oakes through a lengthy and difficult discovery process. The amounts recovered by Oakes or his representatives from others totaled $74,056.89 according to Illinois Central.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. The case went to trial and, on February 15, 2013, Hagan obtained a jury verdict against Illinois Central, reduced by Oakes's comparative negligence, in the net amount of $50,000. Following the verdict, Illinois Central moved for entry of the judgment and setoff of the award based on the trust payments received by Oakes and Hagan that Illinois Central unearthed through its diligent discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 1, 2013, the circuit court denied Illinois Central's motion for setoff and entered the judgment of damages to Hagan of $50,000 with interest at an eight-percent rate from the date of the judgment of the jury. Illinois Central appealed the circuit court's denial of setoff to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4.

The Court does not have the necessary information to allocate damages in direct proportion to their percentages of fault.

The jury in this Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) case awarded the plaintiff (Hagan) damages for injuries that her decedent (Oakes) suffered as a result of his exposures to asbestos while he was employed by Illinois Central. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the judgment against Illinois Central should be offset (i.e., reduced) based on settlement payments that Hagan or Oakes previously received from the bankruptcy trusts of the manufacturers of the asbestos to which Oakes was exposed. The majority rule on this issue of federal law is that Illinois Central is entitled to such an offset, also known as a \"pro tanto credit.\" This rule is consistent with background common law, and it is not inconsistent with the FELA. The majority reaches the opposite conclusion, holding that payments Hagan or Oakes have already received for the exact same injury must be ignored-and that Hagan is entitled to recover more than once for the same injury. I disagree and respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. \"[A]lthough common-law principles are not necessarily dispositive of questions arising under [the] FELA, unless they are expressly rejected in the text of the statute, they are entitled to great weight in our analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Consol.

Addressing the same issue that is raised in this case, the Ohio Supreme Court recognized that \"it is well established at common law that apart from the collateral-source rule, a partial satisfaction received from one of two joint tortfeasors serves to diminish the liability of the nonsettling defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Hess v.

Accordingly, the Ohio Supreme Court held that as a matter of federal law a FELA defendant is entitled to a pro tanto (i.e., dollar-for-dollar) credit or offset for settlements paid to the plaintiff by non-FELA entities for the same injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20N.E.2d%20679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20N.E.2d%20679\">\n    at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 48). This is the correct approach, as nothing in the FELA's text expressly rejects a defendant's common law right to such credits.

First, the majority says that all but one of the above-cited cases \"are immediately distinguishable\" and \"inapposite\" simply because the setoff in those cases related to a settlement paid by another named defendant in the case. The majority does not explain why this makes a difference or cite any authority suggesting that a defendant's right to a credit turns on whether the plaintiff's settlement was obtained in the same lawsuit or in some other context. The distinction makes no legal difference; the relevant question is simply whether the defendant is entitled to a setoff for settlements paid to the employee by other parties who contributed to the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17. The majority next contends that\n   <em>\n    Norfolk &amp; Western Railway v. Ayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    538 U.S. 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), abrogates FELA defendants' right to a pro tanto credit. However,\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   only held that the FELA does not require \"an initial apportionment of damages among\n   potential tortfeasors\"-i.e., in a FELA case, the jury does not assign fault to non-railroad defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the FELA \"allow[s] the worker to recover his entire damages from a railroad whose negligence jointly caused an injury ..., thus placing on the railroad the burden of seeking contribution from other tortfeasors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18. The\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   Court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   address the distinct question whether a railroad is entitled to a setoff for a settlement that the employee has already received from a third party. In fact, the Court noted-without any suggestion of disapproval-that the trial court\n   <em>\n    in that very case\n   </em>\n   had granted such a setoff \"for settlements with non-FELA entities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, Justice O'Connor joined the\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   opinion in relevant part and later, sitting by designation, joined the Fourth Circuit's opinion holding that a FELA defendant is entitled to a pro tanto setoff for a settlement paid by another party who contributed to the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20Fed.%20Appx.%20273\">\n    274 Fed.Appx. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, Justice O'Connor saw no inconsistency between\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   and the allowance of such credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19. It is one thing to hold, as the\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   Court did, that an employee's recovery should not be reduced based on a jury's apportionment of fault to a nonparty. It is quite another thing to suggest that an employee should be able to recover the same damages over and over again from different parties, without any offset for compensation he has already received.\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   addresses the former issue, but nothing in the opinion precludes recognition of a pro tanto credit for settlements already paid for the same injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20. The majority also suggests that the common law collateral-source rule precludes pro tanto credits in this context. However, \"a joint tortfeasor is not a collateral source that can be ignored under the collateral-source rule.\" 22 Am. Jur. 2d\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 388 (2003) (\"This result is mandated by the rule that a plaintiff is entitled to only one recovery for a single injury ....\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hagan alleges that Oakes was injured when he was exposed to asbestos during his employment with Illinois Central. The manufacturers of the asbestos to which Oakes was exposed are not \"collateral sources.\" They are joint tortfeasors whose own tortious conduct rendered them directly liable to Oakes (or Hagan) for the same injury sued on here. The collateral-source rule is inapplicable to this situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21. The defendant's right to such credits-and the inapplicability of the collateral-source rule-is reflected in our own common law. \"It has long been the practice in Mississippi that, when there are multiple potential defendants liable on a claim and a settlement is reached with some, but not all, defendants, those defendants who proceed to trial and suffer a judgment against them are entitled to credit on that judgment for those amounts received in settlement from entities not party to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. N. Jackson Nissan Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9094443\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/692/#p697\">\n    856 So.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (\u00b6 20) (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"This practice has its origins in the notion that, though there may be multiple parties potentially liable\n   for the plaintiff's injuries, a plaintiff is entitled to only one recovery of his damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9094443\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/856/692/#p697\">\n    856 So.2d at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22. Nothing in the FELA entitles the plaintiff to more than one recovery for his damages. This case involves an injury caused by exposure to asbestos; the plaintiff has already been compensated for this same injury by the manufacturers of the asbestos; and there is no reason that her recovery against Illinois Central should not be reduced to account for those payments. The purpose of the FELA is to afford the employee a\n   <em>\n    full\n   </em>\n   recovery for his injury, reduced only by the employee's comparative fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    538 U.S. at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030532\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/135/#p161\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Schadel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199368\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/671/\">\n    381 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   678 ;\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   , 835 N.E.2d at 689 (\u00b6 46). Allowing the railroad a credit for settlement payments that the plaintiff has already received for the same injury does not frustrate the plaintiff's ability to obtain a full recovery. It only prevents double recovery for the same injury. I would follow the majority rule permitting such credits in FELA cases. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   GRIFFIS, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \"Where the independent tortious acts of two or more persons supplement one another and concur in contributing to and producing a single indivisible injury, such persons are in legal contemplation regarded as joint tortfeasors, notwithstanding the absence of concerted action.\"\n    <em>\n     D &amp; W Jones Inc. v.
