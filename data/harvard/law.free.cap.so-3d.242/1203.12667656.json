Taylor raises the following arguments: 1) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for unlawful use of a two-way communication device in furtherance of a felony; 2) the trial court erred by limiting the cross-examination of a witness; 3) the State made improper comments during closing argument that warrant reversal and a new trial; 4) the trial court erred in imposing costs of investigation; and 5) the judgment failed to state that Taylor was tried by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree that the trial court erred in imposing costs of investigation, as the State did not request them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foulkes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12375344,12375370,12375355\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/221/789/\">\n    221 So.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790 (Fla. 5th DCA 2017). We therefore remand for the trial court to strike these costs from the judgment, noting that the State should be given the opportunity to request the imposition of costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182104,9182126\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/893/689/\">\n    893 So.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We also remand for the trial court to correct the scrivener's error in the judgment, which failed to indicate that Taylor was tried by a jury and found guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harvey v.
