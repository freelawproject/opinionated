In October 2015, the parties entered into a settlement agreement wherein most of their claims against one another, including issues concerning amounts owed by the City of New Orleans to NOFF, were resolved. The settlement agreement specifically reserved the right of the parties to submit the \"Alternative Interpretation\" dispute-the dispute between the parties over the meaning and application of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) -to the district judge, but only as to the stated demand for injunctive relief. The settlement agreement further specified that \"[i]n the event the Alternative Interpretation is enjoined, application of any benefit recalculations affecting existing and future retirees will be prospective and not include clawbacks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In furtherance of the settlement agreement, the parties executed a Cooperative Endeavor Agreement (\"CEA\"), effective January 1, 2016. The CEA reiterated the parties' agreement to submit the Alternative Interpretation dispute to the district court for resolution, with the further agreement that there would be no clawbacks; that is, no \"retroactive recovery of any previously paid pension benefits to any Retiree or Fund participant as it applies to the Alternative Interpretation of benefits.\" The CEA also reserved the parties' rights to submit to the district court the issue of whether those receiving supplemental earnings benefits [\"SEBs\"], prior to January 1, 2016, may have their benefits offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, on August 12, 2016, NOFF filed a Motion and Order for Declaratory Judgment seeking to have the district court \"hear and determine the rights and obligations of the parties ... with respect to ... justiciable controversies stipulated to by the parties in the ... CEA ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   More particularly, the motion sought to determine the \"continued administration of the benefit formula established by La. R.S. 11:3384(B)\" and the \"application of the SEB Policy adopted by the Board of Trustees, as required by Section I(A)(19) of the CEA, to 'existing' retired Fund Participants (those who retired prior to January 1, 2016).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the motion for a declaratory judgment, the City filed an opposition, as well as a request for an injunction, seeking to prohibit the allegedly incorrect calculation and awarding of pension benefits under La. R.S.11:3384(B). The injunction also sought an order requiring NOFF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"to perform, for the period from January 1, 2016 onward, a dollar-for-dollar offset of (SEB's [sic] ) against retirement benefits payable from the Fund to the firefighters who have received and/or will receive SEB's [sic], including firefighters who were paid SEB's [sic] as of January 1, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court conducted a hearing on September 13, 2016, on the request for injunctive relief filed by NOFF and the motion for declaratory judgment filed by the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties consented to convert the matters to cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 27, 2016, the district court rendered a judgment which granted the City's motion for summary judgment in part, and denied it in part, and granted NOFF's motion for summary judgment in part, and denied it in part. The district court also entered an injunction which ordered NOFF as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Effective prospectively as of January 1, 2017, as to all New System firefighters who have retired and/or will retire, who have received and/or will receive any benefits from the Fund and who have served beyond 12 years and have attained 50 years of age, to apply a 3? compensation percentage\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to those members' service years served (1) beyond the twelfth service year,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (2) beyond age 50, and prospectively as of January 1, 2017, to recalculate any benefits to comply with the foregoing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Effective prospectively as of January 1, 2017, as to all New System firefighters who have retired and/or will retire, who have received and/or will receive any benefits from the Fund, and who have served beyond 30 years, to apply a 3? compensation percentage\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to those members' service years served beyond the twelfth service year, and prospectively as of January 1, 2017, to recalculate any benefits to comply with the foregoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (emphasis in original.) The judgment, likewise, denied the City's request for an injunction which sought to offset pension benefits for firefighters who retired and began receiving benefits before January 1, 2016, by the amount of SEBs being received under the Louisiana's Workers Compensation statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so ruling, the district court held that \"no offset rule was in place at the time that those retirees retired and their rights to their benefits without offsets have vested.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This appeal follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The standard of review of a grant of a motion for summary judgments is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Serpas v.

R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) and applies to those firefighters who have retired or will retire and were employed by the fire department on or before December 31, 2014. With these parameters in mind, we review NOFF's assigned errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) The district court erred when it found that the Fund had not correctly interpreted and applied La. R.S. 11:3384(B), considering the contemporaneous construction given the statute over many years; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) The district erred by failing to apply a three-year statute of limitations to any enjoined recalculation of pension benefits determined to have been unlawfully calculated in past years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 1: Interpretation and Application of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   NOFF asserts, as to the firefighter with thirty years or more of service, La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is unclear and ambiguous, writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The statute is ambiguous in that it provides that \"if a member continues service beyond 30 years, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twelve years of service shall be an amount equal to 3? percent of the average annual compensation of each year or portion of a year,\" and then adds that \"the retirement benefit shall not exceed a total of 3? percent each year.\" It finally states that the benefits of the firefighter \"shall not exceed 100% of his average compensation.\" Taking these sentences into consideration, the governing Board of Trustees has implemented this formula by awarding those with 30 years of service 3? percent for each year of service, not just 3? percent for each year beyond 12 years of service as the City promotes. Otherwise, the sentence\n   that states \"the retirement benefit shall not exceed a total of 3? percent each year\" coupled with the qualifier that \"benefits shall not exceed one hundred percent of average compensation\" would have no meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As to a member with less than thirty years of service, NOFF does not specify how subpart (B)(1) is unclear or ambiguous. However, NOFF contends there is no express prohibition \"recognizing a higher than 2\u00bd% multiplier for the critical initial 12 years of service required for vesting under R.S. 11:3386.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     History of La. R.S. 11:3384\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   La. R.S. 11:3384 has historically provided a retirement allowance for certain years of service with a higher multiplication factor (\"multipliers\") for other years, based upon an individual firefighter's age and the number of years of his/her service. As early as 1993, the Louisiana legislature authored legislation that used increased multipliers to reward firefighters with more years of service. The 1993 version of La. R.S. 11:3384 provided in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Firefighters employed after December 31, 1967; computation of benefits\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Notwithstanding R.S. 11:3381, any firefighter who enters the employ of the fire department after December 31, 1967, who has reached the age of fifty years and who has not less than twenty years of service in the fire department, and who is a contributing member of this system, may retire upon his written application to the board setting forth at what time he desires to be retired, provided that at the time so specified for his retirement he shall have met the requirements as provided in this Section. In such event, the applicant shall receive a retirement allowance equal to two and one-half percent of his average salary based on the highest four consecutive years multiplied by the number of years of creditable service, not to exceed seventy-five percent and further provided that in the case of those employees who remain in service beyond twenty years and who have reached the age of fifty-five years, the percentage shall be three percent for all years over twenty, with a maximum benefit of eighty percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 1995, the statute was amended to include subpart B, which specifically dealt with the computation of benefits. From that point until the statute was amended in 2014 (discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), the computation of benefits applied to firefighters who worked (one or more hours) after December 31, 1995. The 1995 amendment retained the same benefit calculation as the 1993 version of the statute, and provided if a firefighter remained a member of the system \"beyond twenty years\" and had attained \"the age of fifty-five, his retirement benefit shall be increased by three percent for each year of service over twenty.\" The maximum benefit was increased from eighty percent to \"one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during any three highest consecutive years of service preceding retirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The 1997 amendment added language to include \"portion[s] of years of service beyond twenty years\" in the calculation of benefits for those years \"beyond twenty years.\"\n   <strong>\n    The statute was also amended to add the following sentence: \"the retirement benefits shall not exceed a total of three percent each year.\"\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added.) Except for an increase to three and one-third percent in 2008, this sentence, along with the maximum service benefits which remained one hundred percent, have been carried over with each amendment to the statute. The 1999 amendment added the following language: \"[i]f the member continues service beyond thirty years, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twenty years\n   of service shall be an amount equal to three percent of the average annual compensation for each year or portion of a year.\" In 2007, the statute decreased the twenty year threshold to twelve years, which is reflected in the current version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2008, the statute was amended to decrease the age limit for the higher percentage rate of benefits from fifty-five to fifty years, to increase the rate from three percent to three and one-third percent, and to increase the maximum service benefit to three and one-third percent each year. In the 2013 amendment, the number of consecutive years to be counted in calculating retirement benefits was increased from four to five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 2014 (effective January 1, 2015), La. R.S. 11:3384(B) was amended to add subpart B(2) that provided \"a firefighter who entered the employ of the fire department on or after January 1, 2015, shall receive a retirement benefit equal to two and three quarters percent of his average compensation based on the five highest consecutive years of employment, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service.\" No cap was provided for subpart B(2),\n   <strong>\n    but\n   </strong>\n   subpart B(1) retained the three and one-third percent cap for those firefighters employed on or before December 31, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 2016 (effective August 15, 2016), La. R.S. 11:3384(B) was amended and added subpart B(3). It currently provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    If a firefighter employed by the fire department on or before December 31, 2014, has worked one or more hours of service after December 31, 1995\n   </strong>\n   , he shall receive a retirement benefit equal to two\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   and one-half percent of his average compensation based on the five highest consecutive years of employment, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. If the member continues to remain a member of the system beyond twelve years of service and such member attains the age of fifty, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twelve years of service and after age fifty shall be an amount equal to three and one-third percent of the average annual compensation for each year or portion of a year. If the member continues service beyond thirty years, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twelve years of service shall be an amount equal to three and one-third percent of the average annual compensation for each year or portion of a year.\n   <strong>\n    However, the retirement benefit shall not exceed a total of three and one-third percent each year.\n   </strong>\n   The service benefits of such firefighter shall not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during any five highest average consecutive years of service preceding retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) A firefighter who enters the employ of the fire department on or after January 1, 2015, shall receive a retirement benefit equal to two and three quarters percent of his average compensation based on his highest consecutive years of employment, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. The service benefits shall not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during any five average consecutive years of service preceding retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) A firefighter who enters the employ of the fire department on or after August 15, 2016, shall receive a retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent of his average compensation, based on the five highest consecutive years of employment, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. The service benefits of such firefighters shall not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during\n   any five highest average consecutive years of service preceding retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory Interpretation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is well settled that \"[w]hen a law is clear and unambiguous and its application does not lead to absurd consequences, it shall be applied as written and no further interpretation may be made in search of legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Succession of Boyter,\n   </em>\n   99-0761, p. 9 (La. 1/7/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11530988\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/756/1122/#p1128\">\n    756 So.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1128-29.

R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) sets forth three categories of retirement percentages based on years of service: (1) All members not qualified for a higher percentage-two and one-half percent; (2) Members with beyond twelve years of service and fifty years of age or older-three and one-third percent for all years after year twelve of service; (3) Members with thirty years or more of service-three and one-third percent for all years after year twelve of service. However, the statute further states that \"the retirement benefit shall not exceed a total of three and one-third percent each year.\" While the initial language sets forth precise and mandatory percentages based on qualifying conditions, the latter sentence limits or caps retirement benefits at a mandatory three and one-third percent\n   <strong>\n    for each year\n   </strong>\n   without setting forth the circumstances under which the cap applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There are at least two reasonable interpretations of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1), concerning the cap language. First, the one set forth by the district court, as previously discussed. Second, as urged by NOFF, the language concerning the mandatory percentages, when read in conjunction with the mandatory cap, can reasonably be construed to give NOFF discretion in setting the retirement benefit percentages between two and one-half percent and the three and one-third percent, provided it does not exceed the cap. In its written reasons for judgment, the district court, acknowledging the practice of the Board's calculation, set forth a possible reason for the cap:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [W]hen, under prior law, members age 55 with over 20 years of service received additional percentage points for each year of service over 20 years. Thus, absent the 3?% ceiling, the Board potentially could have added percentage points to a member's multiplier, and the 3?% ceiling prevented that result. The capping language makes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   certain that a maximum of three and one-half percent is applied overall to prevent the two and one-half percent benefit, applied for the first twelve years, from being added to the three and one-third percent benefit, applied after twelve years, allowing for a total of five and five-sixths percent benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Given that the cap cited in La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is unclear and susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation, we find La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is ambiguous and statutory construction is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In determining the manner by which La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is to be interpreted, we look to our established rules of statutory construction.

In enacting Title 11, the legislature set forth its purpose. La. R.S. 11:2 states that \"[t]he purpose of this title is to consolidate public retirement law in order to effectively comply with the mandate of Article X, Section 29(E) of the Constitution of Louisiana to maintain public retirement systems on a sound actuarial basis.\" La. R.S. 11:3363(A) gives the Board exclusive control and management of the fund. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The board of trustees shall have exclusive control and management of the fund and all money donated, paid, or assessed for the relief or pensioning of members with disabilities, members who are superannuated, and retired members of the fire department, their widows and minor children, or widowed mothers, and for the payment of death benefits. This board is created to administer the funds paid into this system and to invest these funds in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Subpart (F) of R.S. 11:3363 gives the Board the authority to \"make necessary rules and regulations for its government in the discharge of its duties.\" The basic duty of a fiduciary or trustee of the fund is to discharge his/her duties with respect to the system in the exclusive interest of the members and beneficiaries.

The Board's discretion was not prohibited as long as the retirement benefit percentage did not exceed the cap and compensation did not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during any five highest consecutive years of service preceding retirement. The Board's interpretation of subpart (B)(1) allows members to reach one hundred percent of their average compensation in less time.

Thirty Years of Service\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The record evidence indicates the Board has a longstanding practice of applying the three and one-third percent cap benefit (three percent cap before 2008) for each year to members with thirty years or more of service with an aggregate not to exceed one-hundred percent. After the cap was added to La. R.S. 11:3384 by the 1997 amendment, the Board requested information from their actuary in order to get cost estimates for proposed changes to the benefit structure. This included adding provisions to pay members with thirty years or more of service at a three percent accrual rate for all years of service. Based on the cost estimates provided by the actuary, the Board ultimately adopted the new regulation in August of 1999. The Board minutes and the Fund's actuary reports in the record reflect that the Board has consistently used its discretion and applied the adopted regulation since 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   NOFF's contemporaneous construction is supported by record evidence; notably, a letter to the Board from its attorney dated August 5, 2008, and the minutes of the Board's meeting from August 6, 2008. The August 5, 2008 letter from the Board's attorney was addressed to the Board; at that time, Mr. McConnell was a Board member. Included in the letter was a detailed discussion of the legislative history of La. R.S. 11:3384. It acknowledged the 2007 amendment setting forth a new benefit formula was confusing and \"seemingly surplusage.\" The attorney noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   In 2007, as noted, the twenty year threshold was amended to twelve, consonant with our minimum vesting standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Standing alone, this \"new\" benefit formula is confusing at best and seemingly surplusage. The preceding sentence provides in both the 1999 and the 2007 Acts a \"split\" on accruals: 20 or 12 years of service plus attainment of age 55. There was clearly a purpose in 1999 for inserting a 30-years of service accrual, regardless of age. Recall that as originally drafted the 30-years was linked to age 55. This was amended out. Further complication\n   comes in 2008 with the reduction of the age factor to 50, which is now coupled with the 12-year vesting standard. In both cases, the anti-stacking provision [the retirement benefit shall not exceed three percent (1999) or now three and one-third (2008) ] adds yet more ambiguity. While prior legislative digests characterize the prior 3% cap as a means of correcting the potential for 5 \u00bd % accruals, this surmising is not supported by the language.\n   <strong>\n    A reasonable interpretation is that the 3% (now 3?%) cap is to be applied across the board if the 30-year service requirement is met.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (emphasis added). The attorney continued and was of the opinion the Board's longstanding \"contemporaneous construction\" of the statute, since 1999, was a reasonable interpretation. The attorney noted the Board had balanced \"two distinct benefit formulas by liberally construing the 30-year standard to address all years of service ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Additionally, the minutes from the August 6, 2008 Board meeting reflect Mr. McConnell was present. At the meeting, the Board passed a regulation relative to new legislation concerning La. R.S. 11:3384 [effective date July 15, 2008]. The minutes specifically state the applicable benefit percentages, as well as the formula used for thirty-year members and provide, \"if members have completed 30 or more Years of Service ... their Service Retirement Benefit will be 3?% of their average salary based on their highest four consecutive Years of Service multiplied by their total Years of Service.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After the City discovered how the Board was calculating retirement benefits, the City and the Board worked together with the legislature on amending the statute. Act No. 813 of the 2014 Regular Legislative Session corrected the issue moving forward by authorizing a flat two and three-quarter percent benefit rate for all years for any fireman hired on or after January 1, 2015, and the cap was removed from this subpart- La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(2). However, the cap was not removed from (B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Before the passage of Act 813, the House Retirement Committee met to discuss the bill. Representatives of both the City and the Fund were present. At the committee meeting, Nicholas Felton, a longstanding board member of the Fund, discussed the effect of the 2014 amendment to La. R.S. 11:3384. He submitted that the new benefit percentage rate would only be applicable to new hires. He explained that current Fund members received two and one-half percent for all years until they reach thirty years, when the benefit was recalculated at three and one-third percent. He added that the new law would provide for the two and three-fourths rate throughout their entire career, eliminating the \"indicator.\" Again, the City did not voice any issue with Mr. Felton's recitation of the current application of the law, nor did it propose an amendment to the committee that would clarify the interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Since 1999, the Board, as the administrator of the Fund, has consistently applied the multiplier to each year for those with thirty years or more of service. There is an absence of a legislative amendment during that long period to correct NOFF's application of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Traigle\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that \"[i]n the absence of legislative\n   amendment during that long period, the administrative construction may reasonably be presumed to be in accord with the legislative intent; it also being a reasonable meaning of the legislative language in the light of the legislative purpose evidenced by the statute as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3254837,9844837\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/176/425/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9663990\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/332/777/#p782\">\n    332 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   782 ;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , 95-0048, p. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7431310\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/671/385/#p390\">\n    671 So.2d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the court in reviewing an ambiguous pension statute considered the lack of legislative intent, either express or implied;\n   <em>\n    Coastal Drilling Co. v.

NOFF does not clearly state which interpretation of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) it adopted, and the record is devoid of any indication that the Board had a longstanding practice applied to these members that differed from the reasons set forth by the district court. This is evidenced by the August 5, 2008 letter to the Board from the Board's attorney and the August 6, 2008 minutes of the Board's meeting. In the letter, the attorney explained the \"Actuarial Analysis\" of 2008 Amendment of La. R.S. 11:3384(B) stating in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) The higher accrual rate (three and one-third percent) applies only to each year after\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   attainment of age 50\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   completion of 12 years of service. A benefit accrual rate of 2.5% applies to each year before satisfaction of both requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (emphasis in original.) In discussing the contemporaneous construction given to the statute, the attorney wrote, \"[t]he 'higher accrual rate,' as the Legislative Actuary\n   summarized, applies\n   <em>\n    each year\n   </em>\n   after both attainment of age 50 and completion of 12 years of service. The rate of 2.5 % applies otherwise. (emphasis in original).\" Additionally, the minutes from the August 6, 2008 Board meeting reflect that the Board passed a regulation relative to new legislation concerning La. R.S. 11:3384 [effective date July 15, 2008]. The minutes specifically state the formula to be implemented as a result of the latest legislative act and note, \"[o]nce members have attained age 50 years of age, for every year after 12 years of service they will accrue 3?% ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Unlike the benefits applied to the members with thirty years of service, the record evidence reflects the Board interpreted the statute to apply the multiplier only after twelve years of service and reaching age fifty. Thus, the district court did not err in ordering the Board to administer the Fund to members with beyond twelve years of service and who had attained fifty years of age at a rate of three and one-third percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Vested Rights of Those Who Have Retired\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   NOFF asserts regardless of whether the Board's interpretation of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is correct, those members of the Fund who have retired relied on the Board's calculation, and have a vested right in those benefits. NOFF argues that the district court's granting in part of the City's motion for summary judgment as to existing retirees on a prospective basis violates the retirees vested rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The district court, in its written reasons, held that the retirees had no vested right to have benefits calculated incorrectly. The district court found that an \"[a]pplication on a prospective basis of the correct, statutorily-mandated benefit formula as to existing retires (including those who retired before the settlement) is both permitted and mandated.\" We agree, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   La.

The plaintiff, an elected judge (\"Judge Harrison\"), filed suit against the defendant, Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System (\"LASERS\"), seeking a declaratory judgment regarding his entitlement to certain retirement benefits. The dispute arose out of the proper retirement benefit percentage factor (\"benefit factor\") applicable to the transfer of the judge's eleven and one-half years of creditable service from the District Attorneys' Retirement System (\"DARS\") to LASERS.

A majority of the judges' voted to affirm the trial court as to the 12-year firemen. However, this is a result of the contradictory findings that La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) is both clear and unambiguous, while also finding that same the provision is capable of \"two reasonable interpretations,\" which necessitates statutory construction. Based on this plurality, one group of firefighters benefits from the Board's favorable benefit calculations, while the other does not. This plurality opinion confuses this Court's position on the interpretation and application of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1), while also lacking precedential value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The only issue before this Court is the interpretation of La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1), which pertains to the calculation of retirement benefits for firefighters. The Board of Trustees of Louisiana Firefighters' Pension and Relief Fund (Board) argues that the statute gives it discretion in setting benefit percentages up to a three and one-third cap, whereas the City of New Orleans (City) argues that precise percentages are plainly set forth in the statute. La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   If a firefighter employed by the fire department on or before December 31, 2014, has worked one or more hours of service after December 31, 1995, he shall receive a retirement benefit equal to two and one-half percent of his average compensation based on the five highest consecutive years of employment, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service. If the member continues to remain a member of the system beyond twelve years of service and such member attains the age of fifty, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twelve years of service\n   and after age fifty shall be an amount equal to three and one-third percent of the average annual compensation for each year or portion of a year. If the member continues service beyond thirty years, the retirement benefit for each year or portion of a year beyond twelve years of service shall be an amount equal to three and one-third percent of the average annual compensation for each year or portion of a year.\n   <strong>\n    However, the retirement benefit shall not exceed a total of three and one-third percent each year.\n   </strong>\n   The service benefits of such firefighter shall not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned during any five highest average consecutive years of service preceding retirement. (emphasis supplied).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   La. R.S. 11:3384(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The majority categorizes the firefighters into two categories: 1) firefighters with thirty years of service (thirty-year firefighters)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 2) those beyond twelve years of service and fifty years of age (twelve-year firefighters).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding the statute to be ambiguous,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the majority concludes that current and retired thirty-year firefighters are entitled to the Board's favorable benefit calculations, pursuant to its contemporaneous construction of the statute. Conversely, finding no evidence of the Board's contemporaneous construction concerning the twelve-year firefighters, the majority excluded this category from the Board's favorable benefit calculations. To the extent that the twelve-year firefighters, current and retired, were excluded from receiving the more favorable calculations, I dissent from the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    CONTEMPORANEOUS CONSTRUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The contemporaneous construction rule gives \"substantial and often decisive weight\" to an agency's long-standing interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal Drilling Co. v. Dufrene\n   </em>\n   , 15-1793 (La. 3/15/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6771969\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/108/#p116\">\n    198 So.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116,\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied\n   </em>\n   (5/2/2016) (citation omitted) (where the Louisiana Supreme Court upheld the department of revenue's 1987 administrative regulation liberally interpreting a tax statute, finding that such a \"time-endured\" construction \" 'may reasonably be presumed to be in accord with the legislative intent.' \" (internal citation omitted) ). Nevertheless, the fundamental rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed in the statute; contemporaneous construction is merely an aid in interpreting ambiguous language.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Bd. of Comm'rs, Port of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9530932\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/422/247/#p250\">\n    422 So.2d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   A review of the record demonstrates that the Board has awarded retirement benefits to firefighters up to the three and one-third percent cap for almost thirty years. In particular, the Board has retroactively applied the three and one-third multiplier to thirty-year firefighters-since 1999, and twelve-year firefighters-since 2011 at the latest. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest the Board construed the statute to limit its discretion\n   in setting the benefit percentage to thirty-year firefighters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Particularly as it relates to the twelve-year firefighters, the affidavit of Mr. Foster reflects that \"the Board awarded retirement benefits to firefighters at 3 1/3% of firefighters' average compensation, as to years of service beyond the twelfth service year, regardless of whether those years were beyond age 50.\" Mr. Foster's affidavit coupled with the 2011 Actuarial Valuation Report, submitted by the actuary, reveal that this interpretation was being used at least since 2011. Thus, the record contains ample evidence of the Board's longstanding contemporaneous construction, which is inclusive of twelve-year firefighters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Board's \"time-endured\" construction affords it discretion to depart from the mandatory minimum percentage rate, provided it does not exceed the cap. This interpretation allows members to reach one hundred percent of their average compensation in less time. It further resolves the ambiguity in favor of the all of the members of the system. Since the Board's construction resolves the ambiguity in favor of the beneficiaries, it must be adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Significantly, a review of the legislative history concerning this statute supports resolving the issue in favor of the Board's interpretation. After \"discovering\" the \"interpretation issue,\" and discussing it at the January 14, 2014, board meeting,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   remedial action was taken in 2014 that removed the ambiguity from the statute. The 2014 legislative history reflects that the City and the Board worked together to pass the legislation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Act No. 813 of the 2014 Regular\n   Legislative Session corrected the issue,\n   <strong>\n    prospectively only\n   </strong>\n   , by authorizing a flat two and three-quarter percent benefit rate for all years for any fireman hired on or after January 1, 2015. Significantly, the cap was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Before the passage of Act 813, the House Retirement Committee met to discuss the bill. Representatives of both the City and the Fund were present. Nicholas Felton, who is a longstanding board member of the Fund, discussed the effect of the 2014 amendment to La. R.S. 11:3384. He submitted that the new benefit percentage rate would only be applicable to new hires. He explained that current Fund members received two and one-half percent for all years until they reach thirty years, when it is recalculated at three and one-third percent. He added that the new law would provide for the two and three-fourths rate throughout their entire career, eliminating the \"indicator.\" Again, the City did not voice any issue with Mr. Felton's recitation of the current application of the law, nor did it propose an amendment to the committee that would clarify the \"interpretation issue.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   From these discussions, it is clear that the legislature was aware of the way the Board was interpreting and calculating La. R.S. 11:3384(B), yet it abstained from taking corrective action in 2014. As evidenced above, the broad legislative intent was to allow the Fund discretion in setting retirement benefit percentage rates between the mandatory two and one-half percent rate and the three and one-third cap rate. Nothing in the plain language of the statute restricts the reading only to thirty-year firefighters, as expressed by the majority. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority to the extent that it excluded twelve-year/age fifty firefighters from receiving the benefit of the Board's liberal application of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    RETIRED MEMBERS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Although the statutory interpretation weighs in favor of all of the members of the fund, I further find that retired members have a vested and accrued contractual right to their pension. La. Const. Art. 10, \u00a7 29 (B) provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   Membership in any retirement system of the state or of a political subdivision thereof shall be a contractual relationship between employee and employer, and the state shall guarantee benefits payable to a member of a state retirement system or retiree or to his lawful beneficiary upon his death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Section E(5) further provides: \"The accrued benefits of members of any state or statewide public retirement system shall not be diminished or impaired. Future benefit provisions of the state and statewide public retirement systems shall only be altered by legislative enactment. \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   [A] \"vested\" right \"must be absolute, complete and unconditional, independent of a contingency, and a mere expectancy of future benefit ... does not constitute a vested right.\"\n   <em>\n    Sawicki v.

The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   Court further noted that Louisiana jurisprudence generally provides that a public employee's right to retirement benefits does not become vested until eligibility for retirement is attained and that prior to the achievement of retirement eligibility, the details of a contributory retirement system may be modified by the legislature to the prejudice of the employee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The applicable law and the record reflect that when considering retirement, a prospective retiree would meet with the Fund office and calculate their retirement benefit based upon a prospective retirement date. The individual would then formally complete an application for retirement, which would be adjudicated before the Board. If the application was approved, the Fund would notify the individual in writing that their application was approved. The approval letter, signed by a member of the Board, would set forth the guaranteed monthly benefit amount to be paid upon retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Under these circumstances, those retirees, who have relied on the Board's ratification and guarantee of the specific monthly benefit amount, and retired based on such, have a vested and accrued contractual right in their agreed upon pension benefits. Those benefits shall not be diminished or impaired. La. Const. Art. 10, \u00a7 29 (B) and (E),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Compare:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , 02-2161, pp. 13-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104795\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/851/1100/#p1106\">\n    851 So.2d at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where the Louisiana Supreme Court held that La. Const. Art. 10, \u00a7 29 (B) creates a contractual relationship to expressly recognize the existence of a contract between the employee and the employer as to those retirement benefits that are vested; however, finding that the Plaintiffs' reemployment benefits had neither vested nor accrued).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Finally, the City argues that La. R.S. 11:192 requires the Fund to adjust any overpayment of benefits to retirees. However, no such overpayment exists. Nevertheless, assuming there was an overpayment, the constitutional provisions of La. Const. Art. 10, \u00a7 29 (B) and (E) supersedes this statute. Moreover, these statutes can be read together in that La. R.S. 11:192 appears to address administrative errors, whereby the retired member received more than the amount previously agreed upon and approved by the Board. Considering a retiree's vested and accrued contractual right, I would, at a minimum, reverse the trial court judgment, and find that retired members have a vested and accrued contractual right in their pension benefits as agreed upon and guaranteed by the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   For these reasons, I would reverse the trial court judgment on the statutory \"interpretation\" issue as to both categories of firefighters.

Unlike the majority, I do not believe that La. R.S. 11:3384 is so ambiguous that \"statutory construction\" is required. I agree with the trial court that \"[b]ecause the statute is free of ambiguity, no resort to legislative intent is appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The formulas set forth in Section B of La. R.S. 11:3384 plainly set forth certain calculations for determining retirement benefits. There is no dispute that, under the first portion of subpart B(1), a firefighter (who has worked at least one hour between December 31, 1995 and December 31, 2014) is to receive a retirement benefit of two and a half percent of his average compensation based on the five highest consecutive years of work, multiplied by the number of creditable service years, for the first twelve years of his service and upon reaching the age of fifty. The dispute in this matter concerns the latter part of subpart B(1) which sets forth the computation of benefits for those firefighters who are employed\n   <strong>\n    beyond twelve years and who have also\n   </strong>\n   attained the age of fifty. The NOFF admits that it has \"implemented [the] formula [set forth in La. R.S. 11:3384B] by awarding those with 30 years of service 3? percent for each year of service, not just 3? percent for each year beyond 12 years of service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In my view, the trial court correctly found that the NOFF \"violated the statute by applying that percentage to service years when it is not legally authorized\" insofar as \"[t]he statute clearly and unambiguously provides that the higher 3? percentage\n   only applies to particular years of service\" and that the\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   La. R.S. 11:3384B sets forth these specific parameters regarding retirement benefits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   -A firefighter who is a member of the retirement system for more than twelve service years and who has reached the age of 50 shall receive a retirement benefit of \"an amount equal to\" three and one third percent of the average annual compensation for each of the years (or portion of a year)\n   <em>\n    after the twelfth year of service\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   -A firefighter who is a member of the retirement system for more than thirty years is to receive a retirement benefit of an amount equal to three and one third percent of the average annual compensation\n   <em>\n    for each of year of service (or portion of a year) beyond the twelfth year\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   -No retirement benefit shall exceed a total of three and one third percent each year and the maximum service benefits allowable shall not exceed one hundred percent of the average compensation earned in any of the five highest consecutive years before retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   I do not find, as does the majority, that these provisions, when considered together, create a genuine ambiguity requiring interpretation. The majority interprets the third parameter as being ambiguous because \"the initial language sets forth precise and mandatory percentages based on qualifying conditions,\" while \"the latter [presumably, the third parameter] limits or caps retirement benefits at a mandatory three and one-third percent for\n   <strong>\n    each year\n   </strong>\n   without setting forth the circumstances under which the cap applies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In my view, the statute clearly and plainly states that the three and one-half percent multiplier only applies to those years of service (or partial years) beyond twelve years of service. While the cap may appear to be superfluous given that the statute does not authorize benefits in excess of three and one-third percent, this, alone, does not render this statute ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Under our well-settled jurisprudence, \"[i]t is presumed that every word and provision in a statute was intended to serve some useful purpose, that some effect is to be given to each provision, and that no words or provisions were used unnecessarily\" and that \"it is not presumed that the legislature inserted idle, meaningless or superfluous language in a statute or that it intended any part of the statute to be meaningless, redundant or useless.\n   <em>\n    Mallard Bay Drilling, Inc. v.

Similarly, the statute very clearly provides that, for the first twelve years, the retirement benefits are two and one-half percent.

If the Board has authority to create rules and regulations pertaining to the calculation of retirement benefits, there would simply be no need for the existence of La. R.S. 11:3384. To the contrary, \"[t]he Board's primary duty is to administer the law in accordance with the legislature's intent.\"\n   <em>\n    City of New Orleans v.

App. 4 Cir. 1978). And that duty is, as the\n   <em>\n    City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   case held, to \"administer [ La. R.S. 11:3384 ] in accordance with the legislature's intent,\" as set forth unambiguously in the statute. There can be no doubt that the legislative intent in enacting La. R.S. 11:3384B was to reward firefighters who continue in that hazardous occupation with greater retirement benefits for greater years of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Finally, in my view, the majority is misplaced in its finding that retirees' vested rights are violated by the trial court's ruling. I agree with the trial court in this respect as well. The trial court rejected this argument, finding that \"existing retirees have no vested right to have benefits calculated contrary to the statute.\" The trial court likewise found that the \"[a]pplication on a prospective basis of the correct, statutorily-mandated benefit formula as to existing retirees (including those who retired before the settlement) is both permitted and mandated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   At the outset, I would note, as did the trial court, that the City is not seeking to be reimbursed for any amounts erroneously paid into the Fund over the years, as it\n   agreed to waive its rights under La. R.S. 11:192 in the settlement agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the funds (improperly) already paid to retirees remains in their retirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   More importantly, there is no jurisprudence even suggesting that an interest in the implementation of an erroneous interpretation of a statute is a vested right. The cases on which the majority relies certainly do not support such a finding. In\n   <em>\n    Knecht v. Bd. of Trustees for State Colleges &amp; Universities &amp; Nw.

The Court ultimately found that \"plaintiffs had a valid and enforceable contract with the Board under which they were entitled to receive paid leave as remuneration for overtime worked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7511608\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/591/690/#p695\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7511608\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/591/690/#p695\">\n    591 So.2d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor did the case involve the interpretation of a mandatory statute governing the manner by which benefits (or accumulated leave) are calculated. The\n   <em>\n    Knecht\n   </em>\n   case is, thus, inapplicable to this matter. Here, again, there is no retroactive application of La.

In\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , a former district attorney who became a state judge, sought to determine whether he was entitled to retirement benefits of 3% or 2.5%, as the retirement system (Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System, \"LASERS\") contended. When he became a judge, he elected to transfer his creditable service years from his former retirement system (District Attorneys' Retirement System (\"DARS\") ) to LASERS.

The City claims that the Board's method for calculating retirement benefits was not disclosed to its trustees (Norman Foster, Director of Finance for the City and former Chief Timothy McConnell) until 2014 when it then made objections. However, a letter to the Board from its attorney dated August 5, 2008, and the minute meetings from August 6, 2008, suggest that this contention is somewhat inaccurate. In particular, the August 5\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    letter includes a detailed discussion of the legislative history of La. R.S. 11:3384. It also acknowledges the Board's longstanding \"contemporaneous construction\" of the statute. Additionally, the minutes from the August 6\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    board meeting reflect that the Board passed a regulation relative to new legislation concerning La. R.S. 11:3384. The minutes specifically lay out the applicable benefit percentages, as well as the formula used for thirty-year members. Interestingly, Mr. McConnell was serving on the board at that time; was present at the August 6\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    meeting, yet he voiced no objection to the Board's interpretation of the statute or adopting the regulation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    This board meeting is the first time the City, through trustee Norman Foster, indicated an issue with the board's interpretation of La. R.S. 11:3384(B). Mr. Foster cited his (the City's) interpretation of the statute, which afforded no meaning to the cap. Despite significant evidence to the contrary, the January, 2014, minutes reflect that Mr. McConnell, now sided with the City as its new Fire Superintendent, opportunely indicated he did not know the Board was approving benefits in a manner different from Mr. Foster's interpretation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    Notably, in 2013, there was much disagreement over who should be in control of the Fund. The City urged that it had to fund the system, yet it did not have control over the Fund, which, they argued, was being mismanaged. The Board responded that the City lost control of the Old Fund because it did not adequately fund it, causing it to be defunct; therefore, it should not regain control of the new system, which was healthy until the real estate market crash in 2008. Ultimately, the City and the Board worked toward passing new legislation that was mutually agreeable, Act No. 234 of the 2013 Louisiana Legislative Session. In particular, it raised the contribution rates of the members on a graduated scale, which the Board argued was essentially requiring the fireman to reimburse themselves for the money the City owed them and failed to contribute into the system, it also reduced the number of fireman members of the board, added another City appointee, and changed the calculation of the average compensation from four to five years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    La.
