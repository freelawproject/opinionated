Teresa Vermilyea and her daughter, Julie Vermilyea Kasby, filed suit against Singing River Health System, Jennifer Thomas-Taylor, M.D.; Alva Britt, R.N.; Benjamin W. Hudson, M.D.; and Emergency Room Group, Ltd., pursuant to the Mississippi Tort Claims Act for the wrongful death of Randy Vermilyea, the husband of Teresa Vermilyea and father of Julie Vermilyea Kasby (collectively, \"Vermilyea\"). Vermilyea alleged that Randy Vermilyea had been admitted to the Singing River Hospital following a suicide attempt and that the defendants had breached the standard of care by failing to assess his mental condition properly and prematurely discharging him, proximately causing his suicide minutes after his discharge. Julie Vermilyea Kasby, who had witnessed her father's suicide, asserted a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The appellants timely sought, and we granted, an interlocutory appeal. Finding that Vermilyea did state viable legal claims based upon Randy Vermilyea's death, we affirm and remand the case to the Circuit Court of Jackson County for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. Vermilyea filed a complaint on October 8, 2015, and an amended complaint on November 13, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the\n   amended complaint, on October 12, 2014, a severely depressed and suicidal Randy Vermilyea was standing on the ledge of the Pascagoula River Bridge, threatening to jump to his death. The amended complaint alleged that officers of the Jackson County Sheriff's Department arrived and spent ninety minutes pleading with him to leave the bridge. The amended complaint further alleged that, when Randy Vermilyea finally agreed to step off the bridge, the officers took him into custody and had him transported by ambulance to the emergency room at Singing River Hospital, where he was evaluated and released a few hours later. According to the allegations of the amended complaint, Randy Vermilyea was evaluated by defendants Jennifer Thomas-Taylor, M.D.; Benjamin W. Hudson, M.D.; and Alva Britt, R.N.; and then he was released from the hospital on his own, without shoes, and without hospital employees' having contacted any of his family members to inform them of his suicide attempt. The amended complaint alleged that, upon his discharge, Randy Vermilyea telephoned his daughter, Julie Vermilyea Kasby, for transportation, and the defendants never informed her of his suicide attempt. Finally, the amended complaint alleged that, within minutes of his discharge, Randy Vermilyea jumped to his death from a bridge in Moss Point on Highway 613.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In the amended complaint, Vermilyea alleged that the defendant medical providers had a duty to their patient, Randy Vermilyea, to exercise such reasonable care and attention as his mental and emotional condition required. Vermilyea claimed that the defendants had breached the standard of care by failing to conduct an adequate suicide assessment because, if one had been conducted, Randy Vermilyea would not have been discharged from the hospital prematurely. Vermilyea claimed that the failure to take adequate measures to assess Randy Vermilyea's mental state and keep him hospitalized proximately had caused his suicide immediately after his discharge. The amended complaint charged that the defendants had failed to assess and treat Randy Vermilyea's psychiatric condition, failed to hospitalize him, negligently and prematurely released him from the hospital, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent him from harming himself, failed to follow the standard of care applicable to a depressed and suicidal patient, and failed to inform Theresa Vermilyea or Julie Vermilyea Kasby of his attempted suicide and need for follow-up care. The amended complaint also alleged that the physicians and nurse had failed to recognize the definitive signs and symptoms of Randy Vermilyea's medical condition. Vermilyea claimed that Singing River Health System and Emergency Room Group, Ltd., were vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of their employees. Additionally, Julie Vermilyea Kasby asserted a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on her having witnessed her father's suicide after the defendants had omitted informing her that he had attempted suicide earlier in the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Singing River Health System and Jennifer Thomas-Taylor, M.D., answered and filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Dr. Benjamin Hudson and Emergency Room Group, Ltd., filed an answer and a joinder in Singing River's and Dr. Thomas-Taylor's motion to dismiss. Alva Britt, R.N., filed an answer and affirmative defenses in which she moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The defendants asserted that Vermilyea had failed to state a claim because, under\n   <em>\n    Truddle v. Baptist Memorial Hospital-DeSoto, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2014), recovery against a third party for a suicide is permitted only upon proof that the decedent had acted under an irresistible impulse, proximately caused by the defendant's intentional conduct, that had rendered him unable to discern the nature or consequences of suicide. Because Vermilyea's amended complaint alleged negligence, not that the defendants had committed an intentional act that had proximately caused an irresistible impulse in Randy Vermilyea to commit suicide, the defendants argued that the amended complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, finding the case to be distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   . The defendants jointly filed a petition for an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion to dismiss. This Court granted the petition and stayed the proceedings in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6.

The Court of Appeals also held that, under\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , claims of medical negligence were not cognizable because the decedent was not under the custody or control of a physician or facility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201164219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, because a motion for rehearing has been filed in\n   <em>\n    Irby\n   </em>\n   , and the decision is subject to modification on rehearing, the case, at this point, has no precedential value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.A.P. 40(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23. Having discussed the pertinent case law, we turn to its application to this case. The defendants argue that, because Vermilyea's amended complaint is grounded in medical negligence and does not allege that Randy Vermilyea committed suicide either (1) while in the defendants' custody, or (2) under an irresistible\n   impulse, proximately caused by the defendant's intentional conduct, that rendered him unable to discern the nature and consequences of suicide, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 24. The plaintiffs agree with the contention of the defendants that they have not framed their claims under the irresistible impulse doctrine. Instead, Vermilyea argues that, as in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lyle\n   </em>\n   , the amended complaint stated a claim for medical negligence. We agree. While\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   held that the principle that suicide is an intervening, superseding cause that breaks the causal connection between the wrongful act and the death applies in medical negligence cases, the case also recognized precedent holding that liability exists if the plaintiff shows that the defendant owed the decedent a certain duty of care and breached that duty. Specifically,\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   recognized that, if the decedent was under the custody and control of a facility, then the facility and treating medical care providers can be held liable for a breach of the duty of care that proximately caused or contributed to the decedent's suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 25. This case is analogous to the medical negligence cases cited in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   . As in those cases, the defendants were on notice that Randy Vermilyea was suicidal. They specifically accepted him for treatment for being suicidal and depressed. In fact, they accepted Randy Vermilyea for treatment after he had been transported to the hospital by sheriff's deputies who had thwarted his attempt to jump to his death from the Pascagoula River Bridge. Therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , they assumed a duty toward Randy Vermilyea to exercise reasonable care to safeguard him from the known danger he presented to himself, and to exercise such reasonable care for his safety as his mental condition required.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8481174\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/936/917/\">\n    936 So.2d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was foreseeable that, if the hospital and its staff failed in their duty by releasing Randy Vermilyea without adequate treatment and care, he would resume his attempt to take his own life. Had the hospital and its staff properly performed an adequate suicide risk assessment, and thereby discovered Randy Vermilyea's true state of mind, they could have initiated civil commitment proceedings in the event that Randy Vermilyea refused treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041-21-65\">\n    Miss.

Taking the allegations of the amended complaint as true, the defendants negligently failed to perform an adequate suicide risk assessment and then negligently discharged Randy Vermilyea from the hospital on his own, without shoes, and without notifying any of his relatives of his suicide attempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26. The defendants argue that the fact that Randy Vermilyea's suicide occurred when he was outside the hospital's custody is fatal to his claim. They contend that\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that the decedent must have been under the custody and control of the facility at the time of the death or there can be no liability for a suicide allegedly caused by medical negligence. The dissent takes this position as well. Considering the specific facts alleged in the amended complaint, we disagree. Just as in\n   <em>\n    Lyle\n   </em>\n   , in which the decedent escaped from the facility and then killed herself, Vermilyea's complaint is that the decedent was in the facility's custody and control, but the defendants negligently discharged him from the facility, proximately causing his immediate suicide. Here, suicide was the very thing that his hospitalization was supposed to prevent. The hospital and its staff, by undertaking\n   treatment of the acutely suicidal Randy Vermilyea, assumed a duty of care toward him and it was foreseeable that a breach of that duty could result in his swift death from suicide. Negligently discharging a suicidal patient and leaving him to his own devices is not materially different from failing to provide a safe environment inside the facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27. This case is distinguishable from the medical negligence alleged in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , in which the suicide occurred days after the patient's discharge, Randy Vermilyea committed suicide \"minutes\" after he was turned out of the hospital. And, also unlike\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , because Randy Vermilyea was admitted to the hospital and treated for being suicidal, the facility and its staff were very much on notice of his mental condition. Finally, and also unlike\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff's claim was that the physician should not have prescribed a drug that the decedent had complained was \"making him crazy,\" here the plaintiffs' claim rests upon the negligent discharge of an acutely suicidal patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 28. For these reasons, we hold that the plaintiffs did present a claim of medical negligence regarding the death of Randy Vermilyea. Regarding Julie Vermilyea Kasby's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the defendants admit that the amended complaint actually described this claim as one of negligent, not intentional, infliction of emotional distress. But they argue that the claim fails because it is wholly dependent upon Vermilyea's claim of medical negligence, which they contend must be dismissed. As discussed above, the medical negligence claim was not subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). And, although the amended complaint mislabeled the claim as one of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the amended complaint indeed stated a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanderson Farms, Inc. v.

There is no dispute that what happened to the Vermilyea family was tragic-that\n   much is without question. But our duty as an appellate court, reviewing the dismissal of their related lawsuit, is to specifically answer whether it is\n   <em>\n    actionable\n   </em>\n   under our current law. And after review, I find that it simply is not. This court made very clear in\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   that in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi\n   </em>\n   allegations of medical negligence are \"not sufficient to sustain a cause of action for suicide.\"\n   <em>\n    Truddle v. Baptist Mem'l Hospital-DeSoto, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (Miss. 2014). Instead-as Chief Justice Waller explained when authoring the\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   majority-\"[i]n such a case, the plaintiff must show that the defendant committed an intentional act that led to an irresistible impulse to commit suicide in order to prevail\"-something the Vermilyeas have not alleged occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 32. Despite this, the majority holds\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   does not apply. Instead, the majority imposes the same duty as in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Department of Mental Health v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8481174\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/936/917/\">\n    936 So.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2006). I find this approach problematic. The first problem with the majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   is that\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   was not a suicide case. And the second and more important difference is that, unlike this case,\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   involved a patient civilly committed to a state psychiatric hospital. So the duty that hospital owed that patient was one \"statutorily mandated\" under Mississippi Code Section 41-21-102.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8481174\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/936/917/\">\n    936 So.2d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the standard adopted in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   was aimed directly at defining the scope of those particular statutory duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8481174\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/936/917/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 33. The same is true for\n   <em>\n    Carrington v. Methodist Medical Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11578594\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/740/827/#p828\">\n    740 So.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1999), and\n   <em>\n    Mississippi State Hospital v.

But, as in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   , the patients' self-harming acts occurred\n   <em>\n    while they were civilly committed\n   </em>\n   .

But this Court recognized her reliance on this line of cases was misplaced, because \"the cases [she] cited involve[d] patients committing suicide or injuring themselves\n   <em>\n    in the custody and control of the facility\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d at 697-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36. The majority here concedes that Randy was not in the custody and control\n   of the hospital when he committed suicide. And yet it still insists\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   does not apply. While the majority likens this case to\n   <em>\n    Lyle\n   </em>\n   , unlike the sanitarium patient in that case, there is no allegation Randy \"escaped\" from the hospital and committed suicide. Instead, the complaint alleges Randy committed suicide after being released following treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 37. I do sympathize with what the majority is doing. In the face of such tragedy, speculation easily arises about what might have been prevented had the hospital assumed custody and control of Randy and forcefully kept him in its care. But wishing the hospital had assumed custody and control, in light of what happened after his discharge, does not give rise to a duty on the hospital's behalf. Nor is it a sound legal reason to create a new duty to assume custody and control-which is essentially what the majority does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 38. Based on the facts as alleged in the complaint, Randy was not under the custody and control of the hospital when he committed suicide. So\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   applies. And\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   emphasizes that, even if the hospital was negligent in its treatment of Randy, \"this failure alone is not sufficient to sustain a cause of action for a suicide.\"\n   <em>\n    Truddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6903109\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/692/\">\n    150 So.3d at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 39.
