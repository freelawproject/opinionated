The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of George C. McKee and Brownsville Station, LLC, dismissing Monty Y. Brown's claims against them. Brown appeals, arguing the judge wrongly\n   granted summary judgment without first allowing discovery. We disagree. Had summary judgment been granted on the merits-or lack thereof-of Brown's case, we would agree Brown should have been afforded an opportunity to conduct discovery under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). But the judge did not grant summary judgment on the merits. He granted it based on the clear running of the statute of limitations. And, as the trial judge rightly found, none of Brown's discovery requests were aimed at establishing his claims were timely. Instead, they were zeroed in on proving his untimely claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Brown's Rule 56(f) motion for a continuance. We affirm the judgment dismissing Brown's untimely claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Brown's Divestment of Brownsville Station\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. Brown and McKee are former business partners. At one time they each owned a fifty-percent interest in Brownsville Station, which owned and operated an apartment complex in Starkville, Mississippi. But beginning in 2003, Brown began selling his interest to McKee. From July 2003 to January 2006, through a series of four agreements, Brown transferred all his interest units to McKee in exchange for $150,000 and title to the company tractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As part of the final agreement, both parties agreed to a full and final release of any and all claims against each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Brown's Complaint Against McKee and Brownsville Station\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4. For six years, Brown had no dealings with McKee or Brownsville Station. Then, in September 2012, Brown received notice from the Secretary of State that McKee had filed articles of reinstatement for Brownsville Station and its subsidiary, BrownE, LLC. According to Brown, the September 2012 notice prompted him to tell his boss about his former business relationship with McKee. And his boss, who was also an attorney, suggested McKee had engaged in wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5. So on April 13, 2013-almost ten years after the first transfer and seven years after the final transfer-Brown sued McKee and Brownsville Station in the Circuit Court of Oktibbeha County. Brown's complaint alleged that McKee had been Brown's personal attorney before they became business partners. Brown is a licensed general contractor, who had built several apartment buildings before going into business with McKee. Based on Brown's experience, McKee proposed that he and Brown enter a joint venture to build and operate an upscale apartment complex in Starkville. Brown would be responsible for the construction side, and McKee would handle the legal and financial\n   aspects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6. To carry out this venture, McKee formed a limited liability company, BrownE, which McKee and Brown owned and controlled fifty/fifty. When the initial phase of the apartment complex was almost complete, however, the City of Starkville adopted an ordinance prohibiting development of new, unplatted apartments. According to Brown, this ordinance \"had the effect of stopping further growth\" of Brown and McKee's project. It also was the impetus for McKee's plot to get rid of Brown, whose construction services were no longer needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7. Brown's complaint alleged that McKee formed Brownsville Station, which became the sole owner of BrownE. Though Brown owned a fifty-percent interest in Brownsville Station, he asserted McKee formed the new LLC \"solely to provide a vehicle to take secret or uniformed [sic] advantage of [Brown] by enabling [McKee], among other things, to change provisions of Brownsville LLC's Operating Agreement without [Brown's] informed consent.\" Brown further alleged that, during the 2003-2006 transactions, McKee hid important financial information and documentation about Brownsville Station and its true value, violating the fiduciary duties McKee owed as both Brown's attorney and fellow LLC member. Brown claimed McKee's action led to Brown's financial detriment. Brown had trusted McKee to provide all relevant information about the company. Instead, McKee fraudulently induced Brown to sell his interests below market value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. Brown's eight-count complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   sought a constructive trust over fifty percent of Brownsville Station and the disgorgement of any fees and revenue Brown would have received had he remained a fifty-percent owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. McKee's and Brownsville Station's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9. On July 15, 2013, through separate responses, both defendants denied the allegations in Brown's complaint. Both also moved to transfer the complaint to chancery court and to dismiss the action based on the statute of limitations. On April 24, 2014, while the motions to transfer and dismiss were still pending, the defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment, asserting the same statute-of-limitations argument. They also pointed to the full and final release from the January 2006 final agreement, as well as the testimony of attorney Dolton McAlpin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. At this point, the only discovery not opposed by the defendants was Brown's deposition of McAlpin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to McAlpin's sworn affidavit and deposition, Brown had sought out and received McAlpin's independent legal advice about the January 2006 final agreement, which Brown signed and notarized in McAlpin's office. In McAlpin's view, McKee had done nothing to improperly influence the advice McAlpin gave. Nor did McKee ask McAlpin to conceal any information. According to McAlpin, there had been no reason to\n   believe the circumstances surrounding the transfer were anything but fully discoverable by Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Brown's Rule 56(f) Motion to Postpone\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11. Brown opposed the motion for summary judgment with his own motion. He requested the summary-judgment ruling be postponed under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f). According to Brown, this rule entitled him to the discovery he had requested through pending motions to compel before the trial court ruled on the summary-judgment motion. Specifically, Brown wanted to see documents related to the value of Brownsville Station at the time Brown transferred his interest and to depose McKee on the circumstances surrounding the transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12. Brown also argued the statute of limitations had been tolled for three reasons: (1) because McKee had acted as Brown's attorney, it was reasonable for Brown not to discover McKee's wrongful actions; (2) McKee had fraudulently concealed Brown's cause of action; and (3) McKee was equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Trial Court's Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13. After denying the pending motion to transfer, the trial judge denied Brown's motion to postpone and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge agreed with McKee and Brownsville Station that Brown had filed his action at least four years too late. Brown's claims accrued, and thus the three-year statute of limitations began to run, by January 2006-the time of his alleged injury. And none of Brown's tolling arguments applied. Specifically, the trial judge found the \"discovery rule\" did not apply, because Brown's alleged injury\n   <em>\n    was not\n   </em>\n   latent. Instead, the true value of the company was discoverable at the time of the transfer. And Mississippi Code Section 15-1-67's fraudulent-concealment provision was inapplicable because Brown could not demonstrate McKee engaged in some affirmative act to prevent Brown from discovering his claims. Finally, the extraordinary remedy of equitable estoppel did not apply because Brown could point to no action or misrepresentation by McKee to justify tolling the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14. The trial judge also found Brown had failed to demonstrate additional discovery was warranted, because the discovery Brown sought \"would not answer the necessary predicate question of when Brown's claim accrued, whether he had a latent injury, and when he knew or should have known of his claims.\" Instead, the information Brown sought \"would only advance a potential finding regarding the extent of Brown's alleged damages.\" And\n   \"discovery related to the degree of harm ... is of no consequence to the defendants' motion.\" Moreover, the trial court noted Brown should have in\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   possession the information necessary to prove when he reasonably discovered his injury and thus did not need discovery from McKee. Because summary judgment had been granted and Brown's Rule 56(f) motion had been denied, the trial court dismissed Brown's pending motions to compel as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. After the trial court entered its final judgment, Brown appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16. \" Rule 56(b) permits a defendant to move for summary judgment 'at any time.' \"\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

With this standard in mind, after de novo review, we agree there are no genuine issues of material fact concerning the running of the statute of limitations. Brown's claims are indisputably time-barred. Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Brown's motion for postponement to conduct discovery, as none of Brown's discovery requests were aimed at proving his untimely claims were not barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Brown's claims accrued by January 2006.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19.

Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012). Brown sued McKee and the LLC they jointly owned, Brownsville Station, for actions McKee allegedly took from 1997 to 2006, which culminated in Brown selling the remainder of his interest in the apartment complex to McKee in January 2006. So Brown's cause of action against McKee accrued in January 2006, when \"it [came] into existence as an enforceable claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. LaVere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958071\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/404/#p411\">\n    136 So.3d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (Miss. 2014). Under Section 15-1-49(1), Brown had to file suit within three years from the completion of the sale \"and not after.\" But Brown did not file his complaint until April 2013-years after Section 15-1-49's time bar. Thus, clearly, McKee and Brownsville Station are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20. Brown seeks refuge in Section 15-1-49(2)'s tolling provision. But this provision\n   applies only to actions \"involv[ing] latent injury or disease.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-49\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (Rev. 2012). Here, Brown's alleged injury-underselling his interest in the company-was not latent. The true value of the apartment complex at the time of sale was reasonably discoverable-especially to someone like Brown, who according to his own pleading had experience building apartments in Starkville. That Brown\n   <em>\n    chose\n   </em>\n   to trust McKee and not question the numbers, documents, or McKee's motives does not make this information \"inherently undiscoverable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21. Moreover, Section 15-1-49(2) delays a claim from accruing only until \"the plaintiff has discovered,\n   <em>\n    or by reasonable diligence\n   </em>\n   should have discovered, the injury.\" (Emphasis added.) And, here, reasonable diligence should have led to the discovery of Brown's alleged injuries well before April 2010-three years before he filed his complaint. But, by his own admission, Brown did not exercise reasonable diligence. Instead, he did nothing for six years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22. Sending this issue back for discovery under Rule 56(f) will not lead to a different result. Why would Brown need discovery from McKee to show when\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   (Brown) reasonably learned of his injury? What efforts Brown took to discover his claims is information within Brown's knowledge-and not in McKee's and Brownsville Station's exclusive possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11568737\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/740/301/#p308\">\n    740 So.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring \"the party invoking Rule 56(f)... [to] show what steps have been taken to obtain access to the information allegedly within the exclusive possession of the other party\"). Because Brown produced no such information but instead asserted the opposite-that he did nothing for six years-the trial judge correctly found there was no genuine issue of material fact that Brown's claims accrued in January 2006, when Brown signed the final agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discovery would not enable Brown to establish a fraudulent-concealment claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23. Importantly,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Brown's claims accrued by January 2006-including those based on McKee's alleged fraud. \"A fraud claim 'accrues upon the completion of the sale induced by such false representation, or upon the consummation of the fraud.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sanderson Farms Inc. v.

Brown asserts he is saved from this time-bar because of \"fraudulent concealment.\" But fraudulent concealment is a statutory tolling provision\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that requires \"the party purporting that there was fraudulent concealment\" to show two things-\"(1) some affirmative act or conduct was done and prevented discovery of a claim, and (2) and due diligence was performed on their part to discover it.\"\n   <em>\n    Channel v.

Brown has not alleged-let alone tried to prove-McKee took any affirmative act after Brown cashed out in January 2006 to prevent Brown from discovering his claim.

But here we do not have the same facts. The type of silence that equated to fraudulent concealment in\n   <em>\n    Van Zandt\n   </em>\n   -the concealed sale of cotenants' land and the failure to turn over the pro rata share of the proceeds-is not present here. Brown's sale to McKee was by no means concealed from Brown, who was a party to the sale and accepted his agreed-upon proceeds for the interest transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27. Moreover, this Court has held that \"an act cannot be both an act of fraud in the inducement and an act of fraudulent concealment.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker v.

This is the fatal flaw with Brown's discovery request. By his own admission, Brown is not seeking discovery to prove what happened\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he transferred his interest in January 2006. He is seeking discovery on what happened\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   -as proof he was fraudulently induced into the transfer. As the trial judge rightly noted, \"discovery of this type ... is of no consequence\" to the issue of whether Brown's claim was fraudulently concealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29. A party asserting Rule 56(f) as a means to postpone a summary-judgment ruling \"must present specific facts why he cannot oppose the motion and must specifically demonstrate 'how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11568737\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/740/301/#p308\">\n    740 So.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Brown cannot do this, because his discovery requests are not aimed at showing a genuine issue of fact on whether McKee, through\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   dealings with Brown, fraudulently concealed Brown's cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n    32 So.3d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30.

The majority affirms the trial court's judgment that Brown was not entitled to discovery on his claims that the statute of limitations was tolled under the discovery rule or the doctrines of equitable tolling and fraudulent concealment. But, because Brown alleges that he was defrauded by a person who had a duty to disclose material information but omitted to do so, I would find that he has stated claims sufficient to warrant discovery. Therefore, I would hold that the trial court's grant of summary judgment was premature. The case should be reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    A. Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 39. Brown filed his complaint on April 23, 2013. He alleged that McKee was an attorney who had provided legal services to him in various matters for more than a decade. He alleged that McKee had approached Brown, who was a general contractor, and presented to him a proposal that they jointly acquire real estate and develop and operate an apartment complex. After Brown had agreed, McKee prepared the certificate of formation for BrownE, LLC, in which Brown and McKee each owned a fifty percent economic and governing interest. Brown alleged that McKee was a manager of BrownE, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 40. According to the complaint, after construction of the apartment complex was underway, the City of Starkville enacted an ordinance that prohibited the development of new apartments and consequently prevented further growth of the business. Brown alleged that this change in the law meant that his skills no longer were required, prompting McKee to seek to divest Brown of his interest in BrownE, LLC. He alleged that, to this end, McKee convinced Brown that a second, successor, limited liability company was necessary, leading to the formation of Brownsville Station, LLC, in 2000. Brown alleged that McKee was the manager of Brownsville Station, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 41. The crux of Brown's claims was his allegation that, after the formation of Brownsville Station, LLC, McKee persuaded him to enter into a series of option contracts, detailed in the majority opinion, whereby McKee purchased Brown's entire interest for $150,000, an amount far less than half the appraised value of the LLC. Brown contended that McKee fraudulently had concealed the true value from him. Brown alleged that he first had discovered his business partner's deception in 2012 when Brownsville Station, LLC, filed with the Secretary of State articles of reinstatement that named Brown as the manager and registered agent for the company. At that point, Brown sought the advice of an\n   attorney, who advised that he obtain legal representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 42. McKee moved to dismiss Brown's complaint on the ground that it had been filed outside the three-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   McKee also asserted that Brown had signed a \"Conveyance, Full and Final Release and Hold Harmless Agreement\" by which he voluntarily had relinquished any causes of action against McKee concerning the conveyance of his shares, and that Brown had entered into this agreement after consultation with independent counsel of his own choosing, Dolton McAlpin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 43. Following the motion to dismiss, Brown vigorously sought discovery, which McKee vigorously resisted. McKee sought protective orders, asserting that, because the action was untimely, he faced an undue burden in responding to Brown's discovery requests. On April 14, 2014, McKee filed a motion for summary judgment in which he pled the statute of limitations. Brown filed a response, arguing that genuine issues of material fact existed concerning the statute of limitations due to the discovery rule, as well as the doctrines of equitable estoppel and fraudulent concealment. He further alleged that, due to the fiduciary relationship, he could not have discovered McKee's misconduct until he had happened to consult an attorney in 2012. He asked that, because of the lack of discovery, the trial court enter a Rule 56(f) order continuing the summary judgment issue and also requiring that the defendants cooperate in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 44. Brown submitted his deposition and later, a supplemental affidavit averring that McKee had denied him access to documents in McKee's sole possession that were related to the value of Brownsville Station, LLC, including refinancing of the $2.25 million mortgage signed solely by McKee, emails, letters, appraisals, loan documents, and closing statements. Brown claimed that he had not known of the existence of an appraisal showing the true value of the company property until shortly before he filed his lawsuit. He contended that McKee was the only person in possession of the documents and he had been unable to obtain them from the lender, which no longer was in business. Brown also submitted the full deposition of the attorney, Dolton McAlpin. McAlpin did not recall having spoken to Brown without McKee's being present. He testified that he reviewed the terms of the agreement with Brown for about thirty or forty minutes, but gave Brown no advice about the amount he was receiving for his interest or whether it was a \"good deal\" for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 45. Before any rulings on the pending motions, all the judges of the Sixteenth Circuit Court District recused themselves, and on June 28, 2016, this Court appointed a special judge. The special judge set all pending motions for hearing on July 8, 2016. However, the special judge never ruled on McKee's motion to dismiss. Instead, he denied Brown's motions to compel discovery and for a continuance, granted McKee's motions for a protective order, and granted summary judgment to McKee on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the statute of limitations barred Brown's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    B. The trial court abused its discretion by denying Brown's motion for a continuance for additional discovery and granting summary judgment to McKee.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 46. The record in this case reflects an almost complete lack of discovery prior to the grant of summary judgment.

In his Rule 56(f) motion, Brown requested discovery of loan documents, bank account statements, and financial statements for Brownsville Station, LLC. Additionally, he requested appraisals of property owned by BrownE, LLC, and Brownsville Station, LLC, and the operating agreements of the two companies. He argued that these documents would show the value of the property and the roles and responsibilities that McKee and Brown had with respect to the operation of the companies. He also requested the opportunity to depose McKee, which deposition, he argued, would address matters including whether McKee had withheld the financial documents from Brown. Brown argued that this information was relevant to the statute of limitations issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 50. The record reflects that, not only did Brown specify in his Rule 56(f) motion what discovery could show, he was diligent in pursuing the requested discovery\n   by timely propounding discovery requests, filing motions to compel, and requesting hearings on the motions. The trial court erred by finding that discovery would not have aided Brown. The trial court had no basis for its finding that Brown possessed the documents he requested and which Brown alleged were not in his possession. Because this was a fact finding on a genuinely disputed issue, it was inappropriate on summary judgment. The essence of Brown's claims was that McKee, a fiduciary, had concealed the documents from him and his requests for discovery of the documents and the deposition of McKee reasonably were calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence relevant to the discovery rule, fraudulent concealment, and equitable estoppel, notwithstanding the trial court's conclusion that such information pertained only to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 51. Ordinarily, if a party's claims survive a motion to dismiss, discovery proceeds before that party faces a motion for summary judgment. This case is in a unique procedural posture because the trial court never ruled on McKee's motion to dismiss. Instead, the trial court proceeded to rule on the motion for summary judgment, concluding that, because Brown could not prove that any tolling provision applied to the statute of limitations, no discovery was necessary. I would find that, because Brown stated claims that the statute of limitations was tolled, he was entitled to discovery so he could attempt to meet his burden to prove that genuine issues of material fact existed on such claims. I turn now to a review of the requirements for the discovery rule, equitable estoppel, and fraudulent concealment, then to a discussion of their application to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 52.

Regarding the discovery rule, McKee argued and the trial court found that, because Brown had access to all relevant documents and financial records, he cannot show the injury was latent. The majority relies on this reasoning. However, not only does Brown dispute McKee's contention that he had access to the relevant documents during the transactions at issue, he alleges that McKee, in violation of his duty of disclosure, concealed these documents from him and actively misled him about the value of his interest. Brown was entitled to discovery to attempt to uncover facts with which to rebut McKee's allegation that the discovery rule does not apply. Further, Brown was entitled to discovery on the issue of equitable estoppel to attempt to show that McKee's conduct induced him not to file his complaint sooner and that McKee knew or had reason to know that legal action by Brown eventually could be found to be time barred due to such inducement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 59. Concerning fraudulent concealment, discovery could lead to evidence that McKee, through his silence or otherwise, concealed relevant documents from Brown despite Brown's exercise of the amount of diligence that was due, considering the fiduciary relationship.

Rather, it is Brown's position that, when McKee purchased Brown's interest, McKee concealed from Brown material facts pertinent to the sale, particularly, the value of company property, in violation of his fiduciary duty to disclose such material facts to his fellow LLC member, Brown, before buying him out for far less than the true value of Brown's interest.

Critically, because no fiduciary relationship was implicated in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were required to prove an affirmative act of concealment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n    at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Court's discussion of what is required to show an affirmative act of concealment, we rightly said that \"an act cannot be both an act of fraud in the inducement and an act of fraudulent concealment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n    at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court found that the plaintiffs' claims survived because they had alleged subsequent dealings and communication between the parties that amounted to fraudulent concealment of the earlier acts of fraudulent inducement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n      .\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045049\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/32/429/#p438\">\n    at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 61. While\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   is applicable to cases in which an affirmative act of concealment is required, it is inapposite to this case, in which Brown has articulated a claim that McKee failed to disclose material facts that he was under a fiduciary duty to disclose. Under\n   <em>\n    Van Zandt\n   </em>\n   , a fiduciary's silence when he ought to speak can amount to fraudulent concealment that tolls the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Van Zandt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1851697\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/227/528/\">\n    227 Miss. at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1851697\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/227/528/\">\n    86 So.2d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Brown was entitled to discovery on the issue of whether a reasonable person in Brown's situation, entitled to rely, as he was, on McKee's fulfillment of his duty to disclose material facts, would have discovered his claims in the exercise of due diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 62. I would agree with the majority's disposition of this case if Brown's claims had involved arm's-length transactions. But because McKee owed Brown a fiduciary duty of disclosure, Brown's allegation that the statute of limitations was tolled because McKee withheld material facts demands that Brown be allowed the opportunity to discover evidence to prove his tolling arguments. Certainly, Brown's statute of limitations arguments ultimately may prove to be without merit, and summary judgment thus may become appropriate. But discovery must take place before such a determination can be made. Due to the lack of discovery on the issue of the running of the statute of limitations, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was\n   premature. I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   KING AND ISHEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-49\">\n     Miss.
