For the reasons fully discussed herein, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences and remand this matter to the district court for corrections of errors patent on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a bill of information filed on January 30, 20167, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney charged that, on November 29, 2016 while in Jefferson Parish, Mr. Garcie: (1) violated La. R.S. 14:30 and La. R.S. 14:27, in that he attempted to commit first-degree murder of Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (\"JPSO\") Deputies Jason Loerwald,\n   Jerome Green, Todd Bordelon and Michael Jones; (2) violated La. R.S. 14:108.1(C), in that Mr. Garcie intentionally refused to bring a vehicle to a stop, under circumstances wherein human life was endangered, knowing he had been given a visual warning and an audible signal to stop by Deputy Bordelon when the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had committed an offense; and (3) violated La. R.S. 14:94(E), in that Mr. Garcie intentionally, or in a criminally negligent manner, discharged a firearm from a motor vehicle located upon a public highway, with the intent to injure, harm, or frighten another human being. At his arraignment on February 3, 2017, Mr. Garcie pled not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to all charges. No motion to appoint a sanity commission or for mental examination was filed, and no sanity hearing was held to determine Mr. Garcie's mental capacity to stand trial or to assist counsel in his defense. On August 4, 2017, the State filed a notice of intent to admit evidence of other acts as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   under La. C.E. art. 404(B), to which Mr. Garcie responded by filing a written objection. Following a hearing on August 28, 2017, the trial judge ruled that other evidence leading up to the police chase would be admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 19, 2017, pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, the State amended the attempted first-degree murder charges to four counts of attempted second-degree murder, in violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1 and La. R.S. 14:27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same date, Mr. Garcie entered pleas of guilty under\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   to the amended charges of attempted second-degree murder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   withdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and pleaded guilty as charged to aggravated flight from an officer and illegal use of a firearm, and reserved his right to appeal the granting of the State's notice of intent to admit evidence of other acts as\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the trial court advised Mr. Garcie of his rights and Mr. Garcie waived these rights to the court's satisfaction, the trial court accepted Mr. Garcie's guilty pleas. Mr. Garcie then waived sentencing delays and, accordingly, the trial court sentenced him to serve concurrent sentences of imprisonment at hard labor for fifteen years on the four counts of attempted second-degree murder, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; imprisonment at hard labor for five years on the one count of aggravated flight from an officer; and, imprisonment at hard labor for ten years for the one count of an illegal use of a firearm, without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, with credit for time served. The trial court also imposed various fines and fees. Defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because Mr. Garcie pled guilty, the underlying facts were not fully developed in the record and are largely gleaned from the police report upon which the State relied in seeking admission of other crimes evidence. According to the police report, the charged offenses committed by Mr. Garcie in Jefferson Parish were committed on November 29, 2016, after Mr. Garcie engaged in the following criminal activity in St. Tammany Parish:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On Tuesday, November 29, 2016, at approximately 2130 hours, Deputies Troy White and Walter Eason were dispatched\n   to Rouses Food Market, located at 3461 East Causeway Boulevard, in Mandeville, Louisiana, in reference to an aggravated kidnapping. Deputies arrived at approximately 2139 hours, coming into contact with Mandeville Police Officer Derek Dondeville. Officer Dondeville reported, under his case number 1611-1084, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A white female subject... made contact with Rouses employees and requested they dial 911. [The female subject]\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated she had been kidnapped and escaped in the rear parking lot of the business. The suspects [sic] vehicle had been BOLO'd\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was currently being pursued by the Mandeville Police Department, southbound, on the Causeway Bridge. The victim... was secured in the rear of Officer Dondevilles [sic] patrol unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Deputy Eason relocated to Officer Dondevilles [sic] patrol unit where he came into contact with [the female subject]. Deputy Eason observed a zip tie strap on her left wrist and small cuts on her wrists and feet. [The subject] reported the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [The female subject] met with a man, identified as Christopher Garcie, on the website www.backpage.com. A bargain was made to meet Mr. Garcie at [an address] in Lacombe, Louisiana, for the price of $400.00. Mr. Garcie approached [the female subject's] vehicle upon\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   her arrival at the location in Lacombe. He brandished a firearm and ordered her to exit the vehicle. Mr. Garcie identified himself as a Federal Agent and forced [the female subject] inside the residence. While inside he struck her in the back of the head, with the firearm, and bound her hands with zip ties behind her back. Mr. Garcie proceeded to force [the female subject] into the front passenger seat of his vehicle where they traveled west towards Mandeville, Louisiana. While traveling [the female subject] was able to free her hands and wait for an opportunity to escape. Mr. Garcie entered the Rouses rear parking lot where he slowed the vehicle's speed. [The female subject] jumped from the moving vehicle and ran towards other citizens screaming, \"help, I've been kidnapped.\" [The female subject] was escorted into the store, by an unidentified white male subject, where she was able to dia1 911. [The female subject] described the vehicle as a white colored pickup truck pulling a box shaped trailer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Emergency medical services were dispatched to the scene. Fire district # 4 later arrived and [the female subject] refused treatment. Deputy Eason relocated to the rear parking lot of Rouses, and located a black colored bag along with a face mask. [The female subject] alleged that the face mask was utilized as a blind fold and that the bag had fallen out of the vehicle during her escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * * * * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Mr. Garcie's brief on appeal, following the BOLO alert that had been issued for him in St. Tammany Parish, law enforcement officers from multiple jurisdictions located his vehicle traveling southbound toward Jefferson Parish. Mr. Garcie's brief further avers that, based on the BOLO, the officers attempted to conduct a stop of his vehicle, but he refused and, instead, led the law enforcement officers on a high speed chase into Jefferson Parish, during which he allegedly fired\n   several shots from his vehicle towards the pursuing police units. Mr. Garcie was ultimately apprehended and charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his sole assignment of error on appeal, Mr. Garcie challenges the trial court's ruling granting the State's motion to admit other crimes evidence under La. C.E. art. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In support of his contention that the trial court erred, Mr. Garcie argues that none of the other crimes leading up to the high speed chase (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , crimes related to the escort, including setting up a date with the female subject in order to kidnap her, impersonating a federal agent, striking her with a firearm, tying her up with zip ties, and kidnapping her), are part of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   of his fleeing from law enforcement officers on the Causeway bridge. Specifically, Mr. Garcie claims that the escort was out of his vehicle when he fled and failed to stop for police, and that the discharge of his firearm occurred in a completely different parish. Mr. Garcie claims that the jury did not need to know the specific facts of the prior crimes for which the BOLO was issued in order to understand the police chase and Mr. Garcie's shooting of his firearm at the police. Mr. Garcie contends that even if the other crimes are found to be necessary for the State to cohesively present its case, the State could have presented the fact that he was suspected of committing an aggravated kidnapping and impersonating an officer, as opposed to presenting all of the disturbing details of the alleged crime, which invariably would inflame and prejudice the jury. According to Mr. Garcie, even if the other acts are determined to be part of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   , the probative value of the admission of the other crimes is outweighed by the unfair prejudice. Consequently, Mr. Garcie contends that the admission of the other crimes evidence would impede his ability to receive a fair trial and, because the evidence should have been excluded, his guilty pleas should be set aside and the convictions and sentences reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Generally, evidence of other crimes or bad acts committed by a criminal defendant is not admissible at trial. La. C.E. art. 404(B)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Prieur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9734982\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/277/126/#p128\">\n    277 So.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (La. 1973). However, when evidence of other crimes tends to prove a material issue and has independent relevance other than to show that the defendant is of bad character, it may be admitted by certain statutory and jurisprudential exceptions to this rule.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 10-51, p. 15 (La. App. 5 Cir. 7/27/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038547\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/467/\">\n    47 So.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20So.%202d%20467\">\n    47 So.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474. Evidence of other crimes is admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or when it relates to conduct that constitutes an integral part of the act or transaction that is the subject of the present proceeding to such an extent that the State could not accurately present its case without reference to the prior bad acts. La. C.E. art. 404(B)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Lawson\n   </em>\n   , 08-123, p. 18 (La.

C.E. art. 404(B)(1), one of the factors enumerated in the article must be at issue, have some independent relevance, or be an element of the crime charged.\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   , 08-123, p. 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8178735\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/1/516/#p525\">\n    1 So.3d at 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the probative value of the extraneous evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect. La. C.E. art. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Evidence that constitutes an integral part of the crime, formerly known as \"\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   ,\" is admissible without any prior notice to the defense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A close connexity between the charged and uncharged\n   conduct is required to ensure that \"the purpose served by admission of the other crimes evidence is not to depict the defendant as a bad man, but rather to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context of happenings near in time and place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084866\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/790/705/#p708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Clearly, evidence of other crimes or bad acts is prejudicial since all evidence that tends to make it more probable than not that an individual committed a criminal offense is necessarily prejudicial. The underlying policy is not to prevent prejudice, since evidence of other crimes is always prejudicial, but to protect against unfair prejudice when the evidence is only marginally relevant to the determination of guilt of the charged crime.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The initial criminal acts Mr. Garcie committed against the victim in St. Tammany Parish formed part of a continuous chain of events culminating in the commission of the crimes for which he was being tried in Jefferson Parish. The kidnapping victim's explanation to law enforcement officers of the harrowing events of the evening, and the description she provided of her attacker and his vehicle, resulted in the officers being on the lookout for the perpetrator. Further, because of the other crimes, law enforcement was able to focus on Mr. Garcie and conduct a traffic stop of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rhea\n   </em>\n   , we find that the trial court properly admitted evidence of the preceding crimes committed by Mr. Garcie, as presentation of the\n   <em>\n    res gestae\n   </em>\n   evidence was necessary in order for the State to logically present its case, to explain why the officers focused on Mr. Garcie's vehicle, and to place the actions of law enforcement in the proper context. A close connexity existed between the preceding crimes and the charged conduct ensuring that the purpose served by admission of the other crimes evidence was to complete the story of the crimes on trial by proving the immediate context of happenings in time and place, rather than to depict Mr. Garcie as a bad man.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   , 00-1586, p. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084866\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/790/705/#p708\">\n    790 So.2d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As an element of the offense of attempted first-degree murder, the State had to prove that Mr. Garcie had the specific intent to kill the law enforcement officers during their pursuit of him in order to evade the consequences of his earlier criminal actions. Additionally, the other crimes evidence was admissible to prove, as an element of the offense of aggravated flight from an officer, that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Garcie had committed an illegal offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , 15-99, p. 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867898\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/1265/\">\n    171 So.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, despite Mr. Garcie's contentions to the contrary, the fact that the integral acts occurred in St. Tammany Parish, and not in Jefferson Parish where the charged offenses were committed, does not preclude the admission of the other crimes evidence pursuant to La. C.E. 404(B)(1).\n   <em>\n    See Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rhea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Lastly, based on the foregoing, although the evidence of the other crimes committed by Mr. Garcie is prejudicial, as\n   evidence of other crimes is always prejudicial, we find the probative value of the challenged evidence is high and that its relevance is not substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we do not find that the trial court erred by granting the State's notice of intent and deeming the evidence of other crimes admissible. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As is our routine practice, we have reviewed the record for errors patent, according to La.

App. 5th Cir. 1990). We found several patent errors, not all of which require correction. Nonetheless, we discuss each patent error separately for the sake of completeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ambiguity in the Imposition of Sentence for Counts One through Four\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Pursuant to the transcript, once Mr. Garcie waived all sentencing delays, the trial judge commenced sentencing him as follows: \"As to each of the first four counts, you will be sentenced to 15 years at hard labor in the Department of Corrections.\" The trial judge also sentenced Mr. Garcie on counts five and six, with all of those sentences to \"run concurrently with each other.\" Following a brief bench conference, the trial judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   All right. Let me start over again. In accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure Article 894.1 as to Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4, the sentence will be 15 years at hard labor in the Department of Corrections. That will be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, although the trial judge initially sentenced Mr. Garcie on each of the first four counts, he did not specifically do so when he \"start[ed] over again.\" At that time, the transcript suggests that the trial judge sentenced Mr. Garcie to one fifteen-year sentence for all four counts of attempted second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court must impose a separate sentence for each count on which a defendant is convicted.\n   <em>\n    State v.

While the trial court's failure to impose a sentence for each count is considered a patent sentencing error, an exception exists to the general rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   When the sentences for a conviction on each count would more appropriately be concurrent rather than consecutive,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   and the term for the imprisonment is reasonable under the circumstances, the single sentence will not affect the substantial rights of the defendant, and remand for clarification or resentencing is not necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Hebert\n   </em>\n   , 02-1252, pp. 13-14 (La.

Article 883 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure provides that sentences for two or more convictions based on the same transaction, or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, are to be served concurrently, unless the trial court expressly directs that some or all be served consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the present case, all of Mr. Garcie's convictions were based on a single, though lengthy, incident. Moreover, the sentencing transcript reflects that the trial judge apparently intended to sentence Mr. Garcie to fifteen years at hard labor on each count, since he initially did so. Additionally, the trial judge ordered that all of Mr. Garcie's convictions were to be served concurrently in accordance with the plea agreement. Further, the Uniform Commitment Order (\"UCO\") indicates that, as to counts one through four, Mr. Garcie was sentenced to fifteen years on each count, \"concurrent.\" Accordingly, we find no need to remand the matter for\n   clarification or resentencing on counts one through four.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Inconsistency/Commitment and UCO\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In our review for errors patent, we have found inconsistencies between the transcript and the commitment and UCO. The commitment reflects that the five-year sentence on count five was imposed without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, but the transcript does not reflect that the sentence on count five was imposed without benefits. Moreover, the waiver of rights form does not indicate that count five was to be imposed without benefits. Similarly, while the transcript reflects that the ten-year sentence on count six was imposed without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, the commitment does not reflect that the sentence on count six was imposed without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Also, the waiver of rights form indicates that the sentence on count six was to be imposed without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. To the extent that the minute entry or commitment is inconsistent with the transcript, the transcript prevails.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ford\n   </em>\n   , 11-91, p. 6 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/13/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7021658\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/81/841/#p844\">\n    81 So.3d 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844, citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, in the transcript, when providing the factual basis, the State said that the offenses occurred more generally\n   on or about November 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously noted, the transcript prevails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, we remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to correct the commitment and the UCO as noted in order that they conform to the transcript. Further, we direct the 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court Clerk of Court to transmit the corrected UCO to the appropriate authorities in accordance with La.

C.Cr.P. art. 930.8, the transcript indicates the trial judge gave conflicting information. Specifically, the transcript reveals that, initially, the trial court advised Mr. Garcie that \"any post-conviction relief applications must be filed within two years of the date that the sentence becomes final.\" However, later on during the colloquy, the trial judge correctly advised Mr. Garcie that he had \"two years after the judgment of conviction and sentence become final in which to seek post-conviction relief.\" Additionally, the waiver of rights form reflects that Mr. Garcie was incompletely advised that any post-conviction relief applications must be filed within two years of the date the sentence becomes final. It is well-settled that if a trial court fails to advise, or provides an incomplete advisal, pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 930.8, the appellate court may correct this error by informing the defendant of the applicable prescriptive period for post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It was also error for the trial court not to query defense counsel as to whether, given his interactions with Mr. Garcie, he discerned any mental incapacity or deficiency that would render Mr. Garcie either incompetent at the time of the offense or unable to understand the nature of the proceedings and assist counsel in his defense. A thorough review of the record, however, including the interaction between the trial judge and Mr. Garcie during the plea colloquy, and extensive research of the applicable law, convinces us that the error was harmless. A defendant in a criminal case is presumed sane and responsible for his actions and the defendant bears the burden of proving otherwise. The standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence and the defendant must show that it was more probable than not that he lacked mental capacity to enter the guilty plea.\n    <em>\n     State v. Tranchant\n    </em>\n    , 10-459, p. 10 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/23/10),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7037713\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/54/730/#p734\">\n     54 So.3d 730\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 734. Here, Mr. Garcie never requested that a sanity commission be appointed or moved for a mental examination to be conducted. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record from which we can discern that either the trial court or defense counsel had evidence, however insubstantial, which would have incited the need for investigation into whether Mr. Garcie was either unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to assist defense counsel in his defense. Also, during the plea colloquy, Mr. Garcie gave no indication or reason to believe that he was incompetent to proceed. Both the transcript and the colloquy, as well as the waiver of rights form executed by Mr. Garcie, show that he was fully advised of his constitutional rights, the nature of the crimes charged, and the consequences of his guilty plea. Further, his responses during the colloquy, and his apparent behavior throughout the proceedings, indicate that he fully understood his rights and the consequences of entering a guilty plea. For these reasons, we are satisfied and able to conclude that Mr. Garcie understood the nature of the proceedings, including the consequences attendant to changing his plea to guilty, and was able to assist counsel. Accordingly, the trial court's error in failing to question Mr. Garcie during the plea colloquy regarding his original plea of not guilty by reason of insanity prior to accepting his guilty plea was harmless.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
