After a two-day trial, Dezjon Daniels was convicted of sexual battery in the Circuit Court of Pike County. Daniels was sentenced to thirty-five years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with twenty-five years to serve, ten years suspended, and five years of postrelease supervision (PRS). Daniels was also ordered to pay $5000 in restitution to the Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. After the verdict, the trial court denied Daniels's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial. On direct appeal, Daniels raises three issues. After review of the record, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On or about July 23, 2014, Pamela Ard reported an incident of sexual battery to Detective Todd Dillon, an investigator with the Pike County Sheriff's Department. Ard reported her son, H.A.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   had been sexually molested or raped by Daniels or \"Nookie.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Daniels and H.A. are cousins, and Ard regularly took her children, H.A. and P.A., to stay with Daniels and his mother, Linda Stalling. At the time of this incident, H.A. was either nine or ten years old, and Daniels was at least twenty-four months older than H.A. Daniels was nineteen years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. H.A. was interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center by forensic interviewer Jade Douglas. H.A. informed Douglas that Daniels's \"front went inside of his back.\" H.A. and Daniels were left alone one day while Stalling, P.A., and other cousins went to the store. H.A. asked Daniels if he could play the video game that\n   Daniels was playing. H.A. stated Daniels told him that in order to play the game, H.A. had to give him \"some booty\" or have sex. H.A. stated he went into the bathroom, pulled down his pants, put his hands on the toilet, then Daniels \"put his thing in his thing.\" It was during the interview that Douglas learned H.A. was referring to Daniels's penis entering H.A.'s anus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At trial, Ard testified she frequently dropped off her children at Stalling's house, because Stalling babysat. Ard stated H.A. had been trying to tell her something, but she kept ignoring him. Finally, H.A. told her of the abuse that occurred at Stalling's house. Ard testified she called Stalling and threatened to tell police if Stalling and Daniels did not meet her at her house to discuss the incident in person. Upon arrival, Ard confronted Daniels. Ard further testified she asked Daniels if he had sex with H.A., and Daniels replied, \"If he said I did it, then I did it.\" Ard notified police shortly after the exchange with Stalling and Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Detective Dillon, Douglas, P.A., and H.A. testified at trial for the State. Daniels testified at trial and vehemently denied abusing H.A. Following a two-day trial, Daniels was found guilty of sexual battery and later sentenced to thirty-five years in the custody of the MDOC, with ten years suspended and five years of PRS. Daniels filed a motion for a JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial. After a hearing, the trial court denied Daniels's motion. Daniels now timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Daniels asserts Douglas's opinion was based on speculation, not reliable scientific principles and methods applied to the facts of the case. However, we disagree. This is an excerpt of Douglas's testimony on direct examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Can you tell us what your opinion is as to whether or not-can you tell us what your opinion is as to his consistency with regard to children that have suffered sexual abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. The consistency comes with being able to provide the details, the sensory details of how it felt, the position in which his body was at the time of the alleged incident, knowing that it was inside or outside of his, what he calls, back. And being able to know that your pants were up or down and how they got down. All of those play into consistent statements of a child who has been sexually abused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9. Daniels's trial counsel objected to Douglas being proffered as an expert witness. Douglas has a master's degree in social work. She trained for the ChildFirst forensic interviewing protocol through the National Child Protection Training Center. She has interviewed over 900 children regarding alleged sexual abuse, alleged physical abuse, and witnesses to violent crime. Douglas relied on her training in gathering as much information as possible from H.A. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision accepting Douglas as an expert witness in forensic interviewing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10. Further, Daniels argues Douglas's testimony impermissibly passed judgment on whether he was the specific perpetrator of the alleged abuse. The following is an excerpt from Douglas's testimony at trial during direct examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Did you form an opinion about [H.A.'s] statements to you with regard to its consistency in your interview?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Can you tell us what your opinion is as to whether or not-can you tell us what your opinion is as to his consistency with regard to children that have suffered sexual abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. The consistency comes with being able to provide the details, the sensory details of how if felt, the position in which his body was at the time of the alleged incident, knowing that it was inside or outside of his, what he calls, his back. And being able to know that your pants were up or down and how they got down. All of those play into consistent statements of a child who has been sexually abused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. And did you form an opinion in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. And what was that opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. It was consistent with the allegations of sexual abuse by Dezjon Daniels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 11. The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that \"the expert should not be permitted to pass judgment on whether the defendant was the specific perpetrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n    925 So.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838 (\u00b6 31) (Miss. 2006). However, we find that Douglas's testimony did not conclude that Daniels was the perpetrator. Douglas's testimony pertains to H.A.'s credibility rather than H.A.'s veracity. The Supreme Court has previously held that \"any opinions as to a witness's veracity should generally be excluded, unless otherwise admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n    at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 33). However, \"[e]vidence that\n   [an] interview[ ] w[as] credible, i.e.[,] capable of being believed, [i]s properly admitted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n    at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 12. Furthermore, Douglas found that H.A.'s characteristics were consistent with children who had been abused. \"While an expert may not opine that an alleged child-sexual-abuse victim has been truthful, the scope of permissible expert testimony under Rule 702 includes an expert's opinion that the alleged victim's characteristics are consistent with those of children who have been sexually abused.\"\n   <em>\n    Lattimer v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8315953\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/952/206/#p221\">\n    952 So.2d 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (\u00b6 38) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 13. Additionally, the jury examined the videotaped interview between Douglas and H.A. The jury also heard the testimony of Daniels and were able to draw their own conclusions regarding other witness testimony. \"As always, the jury has the prerogative to accept or reject, in whole or part, the testimony of any witness, expert or lay.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442609\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/825/#p838\">\n    925 So.2d at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 33). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision to overrule the objection allowing Douglas's expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether admission of H.A.'s forensic medical records violated Daniels's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and whether trial counsel's stipulation of the records constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. H.A.'s Forensic Medical Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 14. Daniels asserts H.A.'s forensic medical records are testimonial in nature and violate his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. \"A document is testimonial when it is created for the sole purpose of the State's use as evidence against the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Vanwey v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6915347\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/147/367/#p370\">\n    147 So.3d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 370 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014) (citation omitted). Daniels asserts H.A.'s medical records are testimonial, because the police referred H.A. for forensic evaluations and numerous officers were present for the interview. As a result, Daniels asserts the forensic records are inadmissible hearsay. \"However, a general hearsay objection is insufficient to preserve an alleged Confrontation Clause violation for appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    Anthony v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7051842\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/23/611/#p620\">\n    23 So.3d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (\u00b6 41) (Miss. Ct. App. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Briggs v.

In\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   , \"[the defendant] made no Sixth-Amendment objection to the admission of the abuse record at trial or in [the] posttrial motion, [and] her arguments on this issue [were] procedurally barred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059775\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/16/696/#p698\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 15. Daniels's trial counsel did not object to the introduction of the records into evidence. In fact, Daniels's trial counsel stipulated to the forensic records being submitted into evidence. Notwithstanding the procedural bar, this Court finds no abuse of discretion by the trial judge allowing H.A.'s forensic report and medical records into evidence. The record reflects that Daniels's trial counsel relied on the results of the forensic records to develop a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 16. \"To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, [one] must show that: (1) his counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) this deficiency prejudiced his defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Furthermore, the merits of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel brought on direct appeal should be addressed only when \"(1) the record affirmatively show[s] ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, or (2) the parties stipulate that the\n   record is adequate to allow the appellate court to make the finding without consideration of the findings of fact of the trial judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1181 (\u00b6 20) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colenburg v.

However, Daniels contends his counsel provided deficient representation because of counsel's decision to stipulate to the admission of the forensic report. However, we disagree with Daniels's assertion. The stipulation of the medical records into evidence is a part of trial counsel's defense strategy. Daniels submits there is no reasonable trial strategy in stipulating the records that violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. However, the forensic records did not document any signs of physical trauma. Furthermore, a strong presumption exists \"that the attorney's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Hancock v.

Accordingly, we find no merit in Daniels's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, this Court has held that \"when a party raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, the proper resolution is to deny relief without prejudice to the defendant's right to assert the same claim in a postconviction relief proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Lattimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8315953\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/952/206/#p221\">\n    952 So.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 42) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
