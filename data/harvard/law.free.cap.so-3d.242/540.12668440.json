(dissenting from the denial of the motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Noel Pozos seeks damages for injuries he sustained as a result of being shot by an unidentified assailant while at a teenager's birthday party at Benito Juarez Park (\"the Park\") in Homestead, Florida. The one-count complaint alleges that Miami-Dade County (\"the County\") owned, controlled, maintained, and operated the park; Pozos was an invitee on the premises when he was shot; the County assumed the duty to provide reasonable safety to Pozos; and the County breached that duty by failing to provide reasonable safety measures and security personnel to control, patrol, and guard against dangerous activity and/or to warn Pozos and others of the potential danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The County filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that: (1) the County did not have a duty to prevent the misconduct of third persons or to enforce the law for the benefit of specific individuals; and (2) sovereign immunity bars this action. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the County's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The majority concludes that this Court lacks jurisdiction under rule 9.130(a)(3)(C)(xi) to review the trial court's order in the instant case because the trial court \"did not declare, make a finding, or otherwise determine that, as a matter of law, the County was not entitled to sovereign immunity or immunity under section 768.29(9).\" I agree with the majority that, unless the trial court has determined as a matter of law that the County is not entitled to sovereign immunity, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the trial court's order denying the County's motion for summary judgment. However: (1) I disagree with the majority's interpretation of rule 9.130(a)(3)(C)(xi); (2) the case law does not support the majority's position; (3) the majority's interpretation of the rule will lead to an absurd result; and (4) the record clearly establishes that sovereign immunity bars this action as a matter of law. Because the trial court's order denying the County's motion for summary judgment constituted a legal determination that the County was not entitled to sovereign immunity, we have jurisdiction to review and to reverse the trial court's order denying the County's motion for summary judgment. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from the majority opinion dismissing the trial court's order for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I am additionally writing to address the issuance of orders by some trial judges on motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment based on sovereign immunity arguments which do not specify the basis for the denial, thereby frustrating the actual purpose behind the amendment to rule 9.130, which was to provide for interlocutory review of non-final orders that determine whether a party is sovereignly immune from suit as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction under rule 9.130(a)(3)(C)(xi)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I begin with the Florida Supreme Court's direction for interpreting procedural rules.

Because the trial court did not rule on Citizens' sovereign immunity claim in\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   , the majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sosa\n   </em>\n   in support of its conclusion is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Florida Supreme Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     Beach Community Bank\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The majority's interpretation of rule 9.130(a)(3)(C)(xi) is also in conflict with the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the rule.

The City of Freeport moved to dismiss the complaint based on its sovereign immunity from suit. The trial court issued an order denying the City's motion to dismiss. A review of the record before the First District and the Florida Supreme Court reflects that the order in question merely stated that the City's \"\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice is denied and Defendant shall file a responsive pleading within 20 days of the date of this Order\n   </strong>\n   .\" (emphasis added). Importantly, the order denying the motion to dismiss did not state that the trial court had determined, as a matter of law, that the City was not entitled to sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The City filed a petition for writ of certiorari to review the non-final order on the basis that the City was entitled to sovereign immunity as a matter of law and thus the trial court departed from the essential requirements of law by denying its motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    City of Freeport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005281\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/108/684/\">\n    108 So.3d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, because the Florida Bar Appellate Court Rules Committee's proposed amendment to rule 9.130 was pending before the Florida Supreme Court and the Court concluded that \"this case falls squarely within the new rule amendment,\" the Court determined \"that the City should be entitled to the benefit of the new rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907630\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/1111/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907630\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/1111/\">\n    at 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the First District's decision to the extent that it resolved the issue based on certiorari review, but approved the decision based on the amendment to rule 9.130 and issued its opinion on the very same day that it approved the amendment to rule 9.130.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907630\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/1111/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907630\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/150/1111/\">\n    at 1114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     Keck\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Keck v.

It also makes no sense to treat orders that deny an individual's immunity any differently than orders that deny an entity's immunity.

On August 24, 2012, Eli Salgado purchased a Miami-Dade County Park Foundation membership for $149. This membership included a coupon book containing several promotional items, including two tickets to the zoo, a 50% discount coupon for golf, and a coupon for the use of a park shelter without payment of the requisite rental fee. Along with Salgado's membership and the coupon booklet, Salgado was given a copy of the Park's rules and regulations to be followed when renting a facility at the Park. These rules contained a section regarding when permits and off-duty officers are required, and provided notice to Salgado that it was his responsibility to obtain the correct permit(s) and to hire off-duty police officers under certain circumstances. For example, these rules provided that when a D.J., live music, or speakers are going to be used, the person renting the facility or hosting the event at the Park must obtain a broadcast permit and hire and pay for off-duty police officers. Depending on the type or size of the party or event, other permits are required, and again, Salgado must hire off-duty police officers to provide security for the event. Specifically, the rules and regulations provided that if Salgado was expecting over a certain number of guests, then he would be required to hire two off-duty police officers and obtain a special events permit. The rules and regulations additionally stated that the Park's employees would not be responsible for providing any of these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   When Salgado rented a shelter at the Park for his September 22, 2012 birthday party, he simply asked to rent the shelter and used the free rental coupon contained in his membership coupon booklet. He did not advise anyone that he was going to hire a D.J., and he did not obtain any permits or hire any off-duty police officers. Instead, he procured two private security officers to provide security at the party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The only Park employee present for this after-hours private party was Diogenes Martin, a part-time Park Service Aide, whose responsibilities were to clean the restrooms and the Park before and after an event, to keep the area clean, and change the trash bags during the event. Also present was a teenage volunteer who\n   was helping Martin that night. Victor Jenkins, the Goulds South Dade Zone Manager, who is responsible for managing seventeen parks for Miami-Dade County Parks and Recreation, testified in his deposition that the County has only budgeted for twenty-seven park security officers to service all of the recreational facilities throughout the County. These officers are directed to mainly patrol the beaches and marinas on the weekends. Because the County does not provide security at these private parties and events, it requires the patron renting a park facility to contact the police department and hire off-duty officers for certain events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Martin testified in his deposition that he performed his duties as required on the night of the party. He made sure the restrooms and area were clean, the trash was properly disposed of, and the trash bags were changed when the trash cans became full. He explained that Salgado was celebrating his eighteenth birthday, and the party consisted of mostly sixteen-to-eighteen-year-olds who were eating, dancing, and just having a good time. Salgado's parents were present, and there were also two large men wearing \"Security\" T-shirts present who appeared to be patrolling the area and providing security for the party. He did not see anyone using drugs, fighting, or having a confrontation with anyone. Everything was calm and everyone seemed to be having a good time when all of a sudden, at around 10:00 or 10:30 p.m., he heard shots fired. As soon as he realized that some of the kids had been shot, he called 911 and then his supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Inga Portilla, a Park Manager, confirmed that Park Service Aides are only responsible for maintenance within the Park. They do not provide security, do not check to see if the renter has obtained the required permits, are not trained in crime prevention, and are not authorized to \"police\" the area. She also confirmed that after Salgado paid his membership fee, a booklet was sent to his house containing the rental coupon and a copy of the Park's rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are also posted at the Park. Portilla explained that \"once we rent the facility ... we don't have anything to do with direct involvement of the parties,\" and that it was Salgado's responsibility to follow the rules, obtain the necessary permits, and hire off-duty police officers if he was having a party that required off-duty police officers, as \"[w]e are not responsible for the party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Pozos presented no evidence to refute any of the above referenced evidence. The affidavit/statement provided by Salgado, the renter and host of the party, does not refute the testimony of the park employees or the physical evidence. Salgado did not dispute that he had received a copy of the Park's rules and regulations related to rentals of the Park's facilities. He merely stated that\n   <strong>\n    when he rented the pavilion,\n   </strong>\n   he was not advised that he needed to hire off-duty officers and that he\n   <strong>\n    did not recall\n   </strong>\n   if anyone had asked him how many people he expected would be attending the party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Therefore, the unrefuted evidence supports the legal conclusion that the County made a discretionary policy/planning decision to allow patrons of its parks to rent its facilities for private parties or events. Relying on its legislative/permitting\n   <strong>\n    /\n   </strong>\n   licensing authority, the County enacted certain rules and regulations governing the rental and use of its parks and the park's facilities. Based on the County's limited resources, it exercised its discretion to assign only twenty-seven officers to the Parks and Recreation Department to service all of the parks, beaches, and County-owned recreational areas located throughout the county and to direct those officers to primarily patrol the public beaches and marinas on\n   the weekends, rather than directing them to patrol and monitor private parties being held in public parks. The County, therefore, included certain restrictions and requirements within its enacted rules and regulations and rental agreements, which the party or event host was required to follow. Among other things, these rules and regulations required the renter to go to the police department and (1) obtain a broadcast permit if using a D.J., live music, or sound equipment; (2) obtain a special event permit if over 200 guests were expected to attend; and (3) hire off-duty police officers under each of these scenarios. The rules and regulations and the rental agreement specified that the County's park employees would not be responsible for the failure to meet any of these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   When Salgado purchased his Park membership, he was sent a copy of these rules and regulations. Salgado, however, did not abide by these rules and regulations when he used his free coupon to rent a pavilion for his birthday party. Although he had a D.J. and sound equipment at the party, he did not obtain a broadcast permit or hire off-duty police officers from a police department. Whether he was additionally required to obtain a special event permit and hire off-duty police officers based on the number of guests he expected to attend is unclear because the evidence does not reflect whether Salgado expected so many people to attend and whether there were more than 200 guests at the party. Nevertheless, this issue is irrelevant because, based on Salgado's use of a D.J. and sound equipment, he was required to hire two off-duty police officers anyway. However, instead of obtaining the necessary permit(s) and hiring off-duty police officers, Salgado hired two private-duty security officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Whether Salgado's failure to follow the County's rules and regulations was the proximate cause of the shooting during his party is, however, not the issue before us. Setting aside the question of whether the County even had the duty to protect Salgado's invitees against the unlawful conduct of a third party during Salgado's party at the Park, the County was sovereignly immune from tort liability as a matter of law. As stated earlier, that is because if the County demonstrated that\n   <strong>\n    either\n   </strong>\n   it did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   the County's decision, omission, or conduct was as a result of its quasi-legislative discretionary policy or planning decision, then the County would be sovereignly immune from tort liability.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177683\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/3/1035/#p1044\">\n    3 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1044 ;\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11540362\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/737/532/#p535\">\n    737 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   535 ;\n   <em>\n    Kaisner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7561399\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/543/732/#p734\">\n    543 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   734 ;\n   <em>\n    Trianon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626453\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/468/912/\">\n    468 So.2d at 917-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Because the County's decisions were quasi-legislative discretionary policy or planning decisions it is sovereignly immune and thus, it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.

Delgado was injured when someone in the crowd ignited fireworks that struck and burned Delgado's leg while he was attending a concert and a fireworks display sponsored by the City of Miami Beach. Delgado claimed that the City of Miami Beach, which had sponsored the event, breached its duty by failing to prohibit the attendees from possessing and detonating their own\n   fireworks. This Court, however, concluded that the City of Miami Beach's \"actions fell within the planning-level, discretionary function of government, for which no liability attaches.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7577227\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/518/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7577227\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/518/968/\">\n    at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was a governmental decision made in the exercise of its discretionary authority regarding the manner in which compliance and enforcement of the law and the protection of the public would be effectuated. The manner in which the County notified those who rented its park facilities of their obligations and responsibilities was also a planning/policy discretionary governmental decision. Because parks such as Benito Juarez Park were \"un-manned\" parks with only part-time maintenance employees in attendance, the County, in the exercise of its discretion, put into place a policy requiring the County to notify each individual who purchased a Park membership or rented a Park facility by providing him/her with a copy of the Park's rules and regulations. The unrefuted evidence in this case is that these rules and regulations were sent to the Salgado's home along with his coupon book after he purchased his Park membership. Because these decisions fell squarely within the County's power to govern, they are protected as a matter of law under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The decisions of the County regarding where and how to deploy its available manpower (sworn police officers) is a discretionary or planning function. And, as the Florida Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Trianon\n   </em>\n   , \"under the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the judicial branch must not interfere with the discretionary functions of the legislative or executive branches of government absent a violation of constitutional or statutory rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Trianon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7626453\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/468/912/\">\n    468 So.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"While sovereign immunity is a silent issue here, we ought not lose sight of the fact that inherent in the right to exercise police powers is the right to determine strategy and tactics for the deployment of those powers.\"\n   <em>\n    Wong v.

Thus, the County is sovereignly immune from suit, and therefore, it was entitled to summary judgment as a matter\n   of law. By denying the County's motion for summary judgment and rejecting the County's sovereign immunity argument, the trial court determined as a matter of law, that the County is not entitled to sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The determination of whether a governmental entity is immune from liability involves a two-prong analysis: (1) whether the governmental entity owed the plaintiff a duty of care; and (2) whether sovereign immunity bars the actions based on an alleged breach of that duty. If the governmental entity establishes\n   <strong>\n    either\n   </strong>\n   that it owed no duty to the plaintiff\n   <strong>\n    or\n   </strong>\n   it was entitled to sovereign immunity, it is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Although the trial court's order merely denies the County's motion for summary judgment, the failure to specify the basis for that denial is not fatal because, even if the County owed the plaintiff a duty of care or there was a material factual dispute as to the issue of duty, the County is sovereignly immune from suit as a matter of law because it established the second prong of the analysis-that the County's decisions in this case were discretionary, quasi-legislative, planning, or policy decisions. Because the facts relating to sovereign immunity are not in dispute, the denial of the County's motion for summary judgment on the basis of sovereign immunity was\n   <strong>\n    determined\n   </strong>\n   by the trial court as a matter of law. We, therefore, have jurisdiction to review that\n   <strong>\n    determination\n   </strong>\n   . Because the record establishes that the County is sovereignly immune from suit as a matter of law, the trial court erred by denying the County's motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, I would reverse the order on appeal and remand for entry of an order granting summary judgment in favor of the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Recommendation to the trial courts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The protection from suit is a valuable protection. If a defendant who is entitled to immunity from suit is erroneously required to litigate the case and to stand trial, that individual or entity has lost the right bestowed by statute to be protected from even being named as a defendant, thereby rendering the statutory protection meaningless.\n   <em>\n    Keck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004055\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/104/359/\">\n    104 So.3d at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This problem can be easily remedied if the trial courts simply issue orders that clarify the trial court's ruling when ruling on a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment where the issue of immunity is raised and litigated. The order should state whether the motion for dismissal or for summary judgment on the claim of immunity is being denied as a matter of law, and, if not, why not. Appellate review should not be thwarted by the issuance of an unelaborated order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
