In 2005, Joey Montrell Chandler was convicted for the murder of his cousin Emmitt Chandler and sentenced to life in prison under Mississippi Code Section 97-3-21 (2005). The Court affirmed his conviction and sentence on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Chandler v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8337850\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/946/355/#p356\">\n    946 So.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 356, 366 (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 54) (Miss. 2006). In 2015, Chandler received a new sentencing hearing for his murder conviction in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). Following the hearing, the circuit court sentenced Chandler to life in prison. Chandler appeals, requesting that he be resentenced because the trial court failed to analyze all the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and adopted in our subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Parker v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003462\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/987/\">\n    119 So.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In 2014, Chandler filed a petition with the Court claiming that he was entitled to resentencing in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . We granted Chandler permission to file a motion to set aside his sentence in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . On January 8, 2015, the trial court held a hearing on the matter in which it allowed Chandler to present evidence in support of his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On October 9, 2015, the trial court entered a detailed, six-page order. The trial court recounted what the evidence showed at Chandler's trial. Chandler had been selling because his girlfriend was pregnant and he needed to earn money to help pay for expenses. Chandler observed his cousin Emmitt exiting Chandler's vehicle with Chandler's marijuana. The next day, Chandler armed himself and confronted Emmitt. Chandler shot Emmitt two times with a pistol and the wounds were lethal. Chandler disposed of the murder weapon by throwing it in a pond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At the time of the murder, Chandler was seventeen years, six months, and thirteen days old. Upon resentencing, the trial court found that Chandler's actions on the day of the murder showed premeditation, planning, and an attempt to dispose of the murder weapon. Noting that the victim was not armed, the trial court described the murder as \"heinous\" under the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The trial court's order included a discussion of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and our subsequent cases applying\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , including\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6999698\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/122/698/\">\n    122 So.3d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 2013). The trial court's order verified that it had reviewed the transcripts of the case, the court file, and Chandler's presentence investigation report. After carefully reviewing the evidence in the case and the matters presented in the resentencing hearing, the trial court found that Chandler should be sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his cousin Emmitt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. The Court has yet to review a trial court's sentencing decision under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Chandler argues that the Court should review the trial court's decision with the same \"heightened scrutiny\" that applies in death-penalty cases, because a sentence of life without parole is the harshest punishment\n   that can be imposed on a juvenile offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8358945\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/990/155/#p158\">\n    990 So.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (Miss. 2008) (\"The standard of review of convictions for capital murder and sentences of death is 'heightened scrutiny.' \"). Accordingly, Chandler contends that all doubts as to the appropriateness of the trial court's decision must be resolved in his favor. In contrast, the State argues that the trial court's imposition of a criminal sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hampton v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922399\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/992/#p999\">\n    148 So.3d 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 999 (Miss. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. Heightened scrutiny is reserved for death-penalty cases due to the unique and irreversible nature of that punishment. The Court has no reasonable basis to raise its standard of review for a sentence in a noncapital case simply because it involves a juvenile offender. Accordingly, we hold that there are two applicable standards of review in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   case. First, whether the trial court applied the correct legal standard is a question of law subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Smothers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11568045\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/741/205/#p206\">\n    741 So.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 (Miss. 1999). If the trial court applied the proper legal standard, its sentencing decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6922399\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/148/992/#p999\">\n    148 So.3d at 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8. Chandler argues that the trial court failed to address all of the sentencing considerations mandated by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the issue on appeal is whether the trial court comported with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   when resentencing Chandler to life in prison for a murder which he had committed when he was seventeen years old. In short, we hold that the trial court comported by applying the correct legal standard because it afforded Chandler a hearing and sentenced Chandler after considering and taking into account each factor identified in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and adopted in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, we cannot say that the trial court's decision to sentence Chandler to life was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   require the trial court to \"take into account\" and \"consider\" the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   before sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003462\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/987/\">\n    119 So.3d at 995, 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 19, 26). Contrary to Chandler's assertions, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   requires trial courts to issue findings on each factor or limits trial courts to considerations strictly personal to the juvenile offender. As evidenced by the trial court's order, it took into account and considered every factor, comporting with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   . The trial court recognized in its order that \"before a life sentence may be imposed for a homicide, a sentencing hearing must be held and the [trial c]ourt must consider certain factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10. In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that mandatory life sentences without parole for juvenile homicide offenders violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. at 469-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   Court held \"that a juvenile convicted of a homicide offense could not be sentenced to life in prison without parole absent consideration of the juvenile's special circumstances in light of the principles and purposes of juvenile sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p725\">\n    136 S.Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p725\">\n    193 L.Ed.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11. The\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   Court stopped short of establishing a specific procedure for lower courts to follow when sentencing juvenile homicide offenders; rather, the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   Court observed several important features of youth that would be relevant to the sentencing decision. In\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , we held\n   that the factors identified by the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   Court must be considered by the sentencing authority.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/119/987/\">\n    119 So.3d at 995-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).

More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court underscored the importance of considering a juvenile's capacity for rehabilitation when it recognized that \"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did bar life without parole ... for all but the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect\n   <em>\n    permanent\n   </em>\n   incorrigibility.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p725\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Here, the record included substantial evidence of Chandler's rehabilitation in prison following his conviction, including the testimony of Chandler's wife, father, and two family friends, as well as numerous letters\n   submitted on his behalf by other family members, friends, and members of the community. Chandler presented evidence that he would have a job and a place to live waiting for him if he was released from prison. Likewise, Chandler showed that his decade of imprisonment was virtually without disciplinary blemish and that he excelled in job training programs offered at the prison.
