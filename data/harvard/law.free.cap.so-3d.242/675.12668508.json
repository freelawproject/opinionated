Lewis held the position of Office Assistant I for the Youth Study Center (\"YSC\"), a secure, pre-trial detention facility for youths accused of delinquent offenses in Orleans Parish, under the direction of the defendant/appellee, Department of Human Services (\"DHS\" or the \"appointing authority\"). DHS placed Lewis on emergency suspension, and subsequently terminated Lewis' employment, for violating internal employee rules of conduct prohibiting threatening other employees, after Lewis made comments regarding her desire to \"hit\" her supervisor, Assistant Superintendent Stephanie Mills (\"Mills\"). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the CSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts leading up to Lewis' discipline are as follows. On the morning of September 1, 2015, Lewis met with Assistant Superintendent Leroy Crawford (\"Crawford\"), to inform him she was feeling ill and wanted to leave work to seek medical care. Lewis also expressed to Crawford\n   various frustrations with her work assignments and Lewis' feelings that Mills treated her with disrespect. Lewis stated that she would \"get so mad\" with Mills that she \"want[ed] to hit her in the face.\" Crawford brought Lewis to the office of Superintendent Glenn Holt (\"Holt\"), where Crawford informed Holt of Lewis' statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On the same date, September 1, 2015, Holt sent Lewis a disciplinary letter on behalf of DHS, notifying Lewis that she had been placed on emergency suspension effective September 2, 2015. The letter stated that the appointing authority had determined that Lewis' comments directed toward Mills were in violation of YSC internal rules relative to (a) treating coworkers professionally and with respect; and (b) prohibiting violent acts or threatening other employees. Following a pre-termination hearing on September 21, 2015, Lewis was terminated on September 24, 2015 for violation of the rule prohibiting threatening other employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lewis appealed her suspension and termination to the CSC. Lewis' CSC appeal proceeded to hearing on March 17, 2016. On January 23, 2017, the hearing examiner issued his report in which he concluded that the appointing authority met its burden of proof and established by a preponderance of the evidence that Lewis was disciplined for cause, that Lewis' conduct impaired the public service, and that the discipline imposed was commensurate with the offense. On March 27, 2017, the CSC denied Lewis' appeal, upholding her suspension and termination. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The CSC \"has authority to 'hear and decide' disciplinary cases, which includes the authority to modify (reduce) as well as to reverse or affirm a penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Pope v.

DHS correctly points out that Lewis' claims of defamation and financial and mental strain are not properly before this Court, as the record reveals that Lewis did\n   not raise either of the issues in the court below. Lewis has made no showing that the interest of justice requires that her defamation and mental and financial strain claims be considered for the first time on appeal. Therefore, these claims are not properly before us and will not be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We next address Lewis' claim that twenty-one exhibits, which she introduced into evidence before the CSC, were not included in the record on appeal. Lewis attached a copy of these materials to her brief and supplemental petition. Our review of the record reveals that Lewis is mistaken. The materials attached to Lewis' appellate filings are indeed a part of the record on appeal, and this evidence was before the CSC. Therefore, this argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We now consider the primary argument set forth in Lewis' brief: that the CSC \"failed to find/state that [Lewis] was already eligible to be transferred back to her former place of employment and instead chose to suspend me while not being present at work, 2 days later alleging that I posed a threat to an employee.\" As discussed herein, DHS had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the complained-of infraction occurred, and that the infraction \"bore a real and substantial relationship to the efficient operation of the appointing authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Cure\n   </em>\n   , 2007-0166 at p. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357405\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/964/1093/#p1094\">\n    964 So.2d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Essentially, Lewis disputes two of the CSC's findings: (1) that the infraction occurred and (2) that the discipline was commensurate with the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to the issue of whether the complained-of infraction occurred, the record supports the CSC's finding that Lewis violated DHS workplace rules when she made statements expressing a desire to hit Mills. In its disciplinary letters to Lewis, notifying her in writing of her suspension and termination, DHS cited to the following workplace rules:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Principles of Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Treat coworkers professionally and with respect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Employee Rules of Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

I mean I feel like I want to hit her in the face.\" The CSC also cited the testimony of Holt, who testified that Lewis repeated to him her earlier statement regarding her desire to strike Mills, and recounted a subsequent telephone conversation in which Lewis attempted to clarify to Holt that she did not \"want to hit Mills in the face\" but that she \"felt like she needed to hit\" Mills. Holt testified that YSC has a zero tolerance policy for workplace violence and that threats of violence against another employee raise serious concerns regarding safety and the overall functioning of the facility. Further, Lewis, in her own testimony to the CSC, admitted that \"I said that it made me feel like I wanted to hit her, because ... it made me feel like I was violated.\" Lewis went on to testify that in making this statement, she had not intended to make a threat to Mills; she was stating the way that Mills' perceived disrespect made her feel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[A]s in other civil matters, deference must be given to the [CSC's] factual findings, which should not be disturbed on appeal unless manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Lewis asserted, however, that her remarks were not intended as threatening. As the trier of fact, the CSC determined that Crawford's and Holt's testimony was more credible than that of Lewis, and found that Lewis' statements were expressions of workplace violence, which \"rightfully contributed to DHS personnel believing that returning [Lewis] to work would create an unsafe environment for Ms. Mills, other staff, and the youths served by the YSC.\" Accordingly, we cannot say that CSC's factual finding that the complained-of infraction occurred was manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Considering Lewis' argument that the discipline against her was overly harsh, the record supports the finding that suspension and termination were commensurate with the offense.

She argues that DHS should have permitted the transfer, rather than suspending or terminating her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In determining whether the disciplinary action is commensurate with the infraction, this Court should not modify the discipline imposed by the CSC unless it was \"arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by an abuse of discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Cure\n   </em>\n   , 2007-0166 at p. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8357405\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/964/1093/#p1094\">\n    964 So.2d at 1094-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In upholding both the suspension and discipline, the CSC found that Lewis was undaunted by admonitions from both Crawford and Holt and expressed on multiple occasions a desire to hit Mills. Moreover, Lewis continued to make such statements when she testified before the CSC that Mill's actions \"made [Lewis] feel like [she] wanted to hit [Mills].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As such, the CSC stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The DHS has an obligation to its employees to foster a safe and professional work environment. It must deter any misconduct that compromises its ability to meet this obligation. The degree of [Lewis'] misconduct warranted substantial discipline because it adversely impacted the Superintendent's ability to provide a safe and professional workplace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In reviewing whether punishment is commensurate with the infraction, this Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Neither the CSC nor a reviewing court should \"second-guess\" an appointing authority's decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lange v. Orleans Levee District\n   </em>\n   , 10-0140, p. 17 (La. 11/30/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038998\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/925/#p936\">\n    56 So.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936. The CSC and a reviewing court may intervene only when the appointing authority's decisions are arbitrary and capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038998\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/925/#p936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, neither the CSC nor the reviewing court may serve as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   pardon board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038998\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/925/#p936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[S]ympathy is not a legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038998\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/56/925/#p936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   , 2012-1040, at p. 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015816\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/109/973/#p980\">\n    109 So.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Considering the record before us in light of these principles, we decline to disturb the CSC's conclusion that that an emergency suspension and termination represent an appropriate level of discipline given Lewis' actions. On the facts before this Court, we cannot say that the CSC acted arbitrarily or capriciously in upholding the decision of DHS. Lewis' argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, for these reasons, we affirm the decision of the CSC to deny Lewis' appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
