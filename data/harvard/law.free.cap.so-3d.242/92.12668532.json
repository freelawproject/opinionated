This Court adheres to the widely recognized standards providing for a trial court's amendment of an arbitration award under limited conditions. Importantly, those standards provide that a court may modify an arbitrator's award to correct an evident miscalculation of figures before entering its judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-15-135\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-15-135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2004). However, this Court has yet to determine what qualifies as an\n   <em>\n    evident miscalculation\n   </em>\n   and to what extent a judge may inquire to determine whether such a miscalculation exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Through the analysis below, we find first that the miscalculations alleged in this matter are not evident from the award itself, nor are they apparent from the agreed-upon record. Additionally, we find that the judge erred when he allowed the parties to present witness testimony regarding the extent of any alleged miscalculations, rather than relying on the award and the arbitration record as the relevant law suggests. Finding error, we reverse the circuit court's decision and remand this case to the circuit court with directions to confirm the December 8, 2015, arbitration award. Furthermore, because the subcontract between the parties provides that each contractor will be responsible for his own fees and costs, the Court declines to assess costs to one party over the other, and instead, enforces their bargained-for agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Yates Construction, LLC, and D.W. Caldwell, Inc., entered into a construction subcontract for the roof installation on a residential dormitory at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Caldwell-the\n   roofing subcontractor-began work on the roof in October 2012. Early on, Caldwell employees identified structural issues with the building, preventing the company from moving forward with the roof installation. Caldwell notified Yates of the issues, and after some discussion about the repairs needed, Caldwell agreed to repair the building prior to installing the roof. Rather than amending the existing subcontract or creating a new contract for the repair expenses, Yates urged Caldwell to bill against \"unperformed work\" for those costs related to the extra work completed. Although the arrangement was unconventional, Caldwell orally agreed to the billing scheme, requiring that it be paid weekly, on a \"cost plus overhead and profit basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. When Caldwell completed both the repairs and the roof installation, it had yet to receive total payment for the structural repairs. The companies disputed the scope and expense of these repairs and quickly negotiated their way to an impasse. Thereafter, Caldwell filed a claim against Yates for causing delay and increased costs by failing to pay for work performed, which was in breach of the agreements between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The parties proceeded to arbitration. Although the arbitration record was neither recorded nor transcribed, the parties concede that the arbitrator considered arguments, reviewed evidence, and heard witness testimony over the course of three days. He then reopened the proceedings for additional documentation, before issuing his thirteen-page award on December 8, 2015. Shortly thereafter, Yates timely filed its motion for clarification and/or correction of the arbitration award, which was summarily dismissed by the arbitrator. Noting that the award included no clerical, typographical, technical, or computational errors, the arbitrator determined he lacked the authority to re-evaluate the merits of any claim already decided, under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Within two weeks of the arbitrator's decision to deny Yates's motion, Caldwell requested that the circuit court confirm the award under Mississippi Code Section 11-15-125. One month later, Yates moved the trial court to alter, amend, or vacate the award under Mississippi Code Section 11-15-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the understanding that Yates would provide oral argument on its motion at the award confirmation hearing, Caldwell filed a request to limit the presentation of proof before the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The hearing on all three motions was held on December 1, 2016. The circuit court judge began by requesting arguments on Caldwell's motion to limit proof. Throughout the presentations, the court asked questions of the parties' representatives and heard arguments on several issues under discussion. Believing that an evident miscalculation was present as it related to the retainage amounts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   included in both the subcontract and the final award, the court overruled Caldwell's request to limit proof and permitted the parties to proceed on Yates's motion to alter, amend, or vacate the arbitration award. During this second phase of the hearing, the trial court allowed the parties\n   to introduce evidence and witness testimony. Though Caldwell's attorneys objected on the basis of whether such evidence was on the record during the arbitration and whether such testimony was considered by the arbitrator in his ultimate decision, the court allowed counsel for Yates to continue with his witness examination and evidence presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Ultimately, the trial court reviewed fourteen exhibits and the testimony of one witness in making its decision. Based on this evidence, the court issued its order modifying the arbitrator's award on January 10, 2017. Under Mississippi Code Section 11-15-135 and the Federal Arbitration Act, the court determined that the award contained a \"facially evident miscalculation which permitted ... Caldwell to receive double payment.\" Finding that the arbitrator had duplicated the labor costs for shingle installation in its award-once under the original subcontract and once under the oral agreement to repair the structural damage (referred to as the Repair Agreement)-it amended the award, reducing the total by $104,507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. On appeal, Caldwell argues that the trial court erred when it denied the motion to limit proof and allowed Yates to present evidence and witness testimony. Caldwell also contends that the trial court erred in finding that the arbitrator's award contained a facially evident miscalculation. We agree. Based on the analysis below, this Court finds that the arbitrator's award contained no evident miscalculations which would merit modification. Moreover, the circuit court erred by allowing Yates to present witnesses before the court. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Neshoba County Circuit Court and remand for the court to confirm the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. This matter involves a contract's choice-of-law provision and the applicability of federal and state statutes, as well as trade-association regulations. Caldwell (a Georgia-based company) and Yates (a Mississippi corporation) entered into a subcontract in Mississippi to be performed in Alabama. It is undisputed that, between the two companies, their employees, and their distributors, both labor and materials crossed state lines. Unquestionably, these facts affect interstate commerce, creating the need to continue under the mandate of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2.

The laws\n   of the state of Mississippi govern this Subcontract ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the FAA applies directly to the matter, the parties knowingly and willingly contracted for the laws of this state to govern any disputes related to their agreement. Furthermore, neither party objected to the role of Mississippi law in the contract, nor did either insist on adherence to the FAA prior to the arbitration award's disclosure. Because this Court previously has provided that parties may limit contractually the issues which they will arbitrate (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Hallmark Partners, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12383250\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/227/1052/#p1055\">\n    227 So.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1055 (Miss. 2017) ), this Court will not hesitate to extend that provision-as the United States Supreme Court has-to allow parties to specify by contract the laws and rules under which that arbitration will be conducted. After all, \"[a]rbitration under the Act is a matter of consent, not coercion, and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.\"\n   <em>\n    Volt Info.

Based on their agreement, the parties' intent to proceed under Mississippi law is clear, and this Court therefore will apply the same. As a result, we continue our analysis under the provisions in Mississippi Code Sections 11-15-101 through 143. Titled \"Arbitration of Controversies Arising from Construction Contracts and Related Agreements,\" this section of Mississippi's Arbitration Act applies \"to any agreement for the ... engineering, construction, erection, repair or alteration of any building, structure, fixture, ... or any part thereof ... \".\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-15-101\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-15-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2004).

A defining characteristic of arbitration is its finality and the binding disposition of a controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schaefer v. Allstate Ins.

Parties to an arbitration enter the process knowing that the arbitrator's award will signal the factual end of their dispute, rather than leaving open the door to the possibility of future appeals. With this in mind, courts asked to review, confirm, or modify an arbitrator's award do so through an extremely limited lens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Accordingly, a circuit court has no authority to modify a construction-related arbitration award unless the exceptions outlined under Mississippi Code Section 11-15-135(1)(a) and (2), or its nearly identical, sister provision, found in United States Code Chapter 9, Section 11(a), are met.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Margerum v.

Caldwell's appeal tasks this Court with the same question: Can Yates identify evidence from which a different, but correct, calculation could be made and if not, can it identify an evident miscalculation of figures?

What the Court may not consider is the witness testimony garnered during the trial court's hearing: such consideration allowed the trial court to enter into a fact-finding position, not appropriate under such circumstances. Our statutes concerning the modification and vacation of awards by \"an arbitral tribunal are precisely and narrowly drawn to prohibit such complete de novo review of the substance of the award, as distinguished from gross calculation errors or inadequacies in the makeup of the tribunal itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Legion Ins.

Importantly, relevant Mississippi law supports the trial court's review of the arbitrator's award when determining whether an evident miscalculation exists. This same law provides for the presentation of party arguments through motions and court hearings. While written arguments and those orally presented during a hearing may not have been identical to the arguments before the arbitrator, precedent indicates that attorney-delivered arguments are permissible during the confirmation process of an arbitrator's award.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Hattiesburg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805416\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/192/1089/#p1096\">\n    192 So.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reviewing the circuit court's decision to confirm an arbitration award without a transcript or a record, after conducting an evidentiary hearing on the parties' arguments).

Following guidelines established by the Court of Appeals and various other courts across the country, we begin\n   our narrow analysis by looking to the thirteen-page award for any facially evident miscalculations or computational errors. In doing so, we find that no such errors are present. Looking next to the attorney-written arguments, oral arguments, and agreed-upon record evidence, we likewise fail to find such errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 27. In addressing the alleged errors, we specifically highlight Yates's claim regarding the arbitrator's approach to the retainage amounts. Yates argues that the arbitrator erroneously dismissed the retainage claim without prejudice, asserting that the arbitration award and disposition can either be final or not final, but that it cannot be both. The company alleges that Caldwell's ability to submit the retainage portion of its award to another arbitration single-handedly warrants modification of the award, either vacating the claim entirely or entering the award, with prejudice. We disagree and find that this claim does not amount to an evident miscalculation. Rather, we find that the arbitrator clearly defined the retainage amounts and subtracted them from the overall award as monies \"unpaid yet remaining under dispute.\" Contrary to the explanation provided by Yates, the retainage amounts were not included as recoverable in the award and then left open for determination at a later date. Instead, such amounts were completely removed from the award as not ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 28. While we have yet to address whether arbitration awards may be partial, final, and binding all at once, the general understanding of retainage and the information provided through the party arguments indicate that the retainage was not yet payable. Consequently, it was not yet clear what amounts the arbitrator should or should not award. Recognizing this limitation, the arbitrator's award contemplates retainage based on the original subcontract and reserves its resolution for when the specific amounts become due. We find no error in this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 29. Reviewing the award, the parties' arguments, and the agreed-upon record, we fail to find that the arbitrator erroneously duplicated costs of labor and relied on such a duplication in making his award. Nor can we ascertain that the arbitrator erred by excluding the retainage totals. As a result, the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by assuming the role of factfinder and reviewing witness testimony outside the arbitration record to determine where and to what extent a miscalculation existed. Instead, the court should have considered only the parties' initial arguments, along with any agreed-upon-arbitration-record evidence presented to supplement the written award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    C.

Much like Sections 10 and 11 of the FAA, the Mississippi construction arbitration statutes significantly limit the grounds for vacation and modification under Mississippi Code Sections 11-15-133 and 11-15-135 respectively.

The\n   <em>\n    evident\n   </em>\n   nature of an award's calculation error along with the arguments and record evidence presented by the parties would have been enough for the trial court to make its decision. While the trial judge determined that an evident miscalculation existed in the award prior to hearing the witness testimony, the judge erred by later permitting the testimony and using it to make his ultimate decision on where and to what extent the miscalculation existed. Such an error transformed the trial court's role in the confirmation and modification hearing, expanding the very narrow and limited purpose of its review, and imbuing it with the responsibility of the factfinder. Because arbitration is meant to supplant litigation, not supplement it, the court abused its discretion by allowing witness testimony during the award-confirmation hearing, resulting in plain error by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 32. This Court holds that in such a situation, courts requested to confirm, modify and/or vacate arbitration awards are not at liberty to permit the examination of witnesses.
