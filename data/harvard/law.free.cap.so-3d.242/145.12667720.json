Meekco also appeals his additional conviction of Count IV, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The circuit court sentenced Trevontae, Meekco, and Isaac to separate consecutive terms of twenty-five years for burglary, thirty-eight years for armed robbery, and thirty years for kidnapping. Meekco was also sentenced to an additional consecutive term of ten years for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. All sentences for each Appellant were ordered to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Matthew Moore and Keagan Latham were indicted along with the Appellants, and Moore was tried with them. However, the jury found him not guilty of all counts. Latham was not tried with the Appellants, although he testified during\n   their trial while charges against him were still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, Trevontae maintains that the trial court erred in refusing to allow a police investigative report into evidence for the purpose of impeaching one of the State's witnesses. He also contends that the jury's verdict is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Meekco asserts that the trial court erred in denying a motion to suppress evidence and in placing limitations upon his right to present a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Isaac asserts that the traffic stop of the motor vehicle in which he and Meekco were riding was illegal;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the exclusion of his rebuttal witness destroyed his right to a defense; that the jury was not properly instructed regarding a key sentencing enhancement; and that the trial was inherently unfair due to the prosecutor's comments allegedly vouching for the truthfulness of one of the State's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. We find no reversible error; therefore, we affirm the judgments of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. During the early part of the night on April 8, 2013, police officers responded to a call from Wayne Barrett's residence in Greenville, Mississippi. Barrett, whose face was bruised and swollen, informed the police that his home had been burglarized and that he had been assaulted by three men. The incident began when a young man-whom Barrett recognized as a friend or relative of his former neighbors and later identified as fifteen-year-old Keagan Latham-knocked on Barrett's door and asked to use the phone. Barrett acquiesced; Latham briefly used the phone and left. A few minutes later, Barrett heard another knock on the door. When he went to answer, three different male individuals, who were armed and whom Barrett did not recognize, forced their way into his residence. The men assaulted Barrett and forced him to accompany them from room to room as they stole two laptop computers, several guns, a bag of change, Barrett's wallet, and an iPhone. The men carried the items out of Barrett's home using a blue comforter, which they had removed from Barrett's bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Barrett identified Latham to police, but was unable to identify the other three men involved in the burglary. The following morning, on April 9, 2013, police took Latham's statement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which he implicated Trevontae, Meekco, Isaac, and Moore in the burglary and described their appearances. Latham also informed police that most of the stolen items had been taken to a certain residence on Ada Drive in Greenville. The police subsequently began preparing to obtain a search warrant for the Ada Drive residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Later that day, while the police were in the process of obtaining the search warrant, Sergeant Kenneth Redfield of the Greenville Police Department began conducting surveillance of the Ada Drive residence, with two fellow officers-Officer Andy Osbun and Officer Chris Surf-positioned nearby in their patrol cars. Sergeant Redfield testified at trial that he, along with the other officers involved in the matter, had been previously made aware of the suspects' names and general descriptions and that on the morning of April 9, 2013, he had received photos of the suspects from a group-text-message thread between members of the police department who were involved in this particular matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around noon, Sergeant Redfield noticed two individuals, matching the description and photographs of two of the suspects, leaving the Ada Drive residence in a blue Chevrolet Impala. Officer Redfield transmitted this information to Officers Osbun and Surf and informed them as to the direction that the Impala was traveling. Shortly after, Officer Osbun spotted the Impala and conducted a traffic stop. Officer Osbun later testified that he did not observe the men in the Impala breaking any laws prior to the stop; rather, the reason for the stop was \"to just identify the people\" in the Impala. Officer Osbun also testified that he did not see photographs of the suspects until after the traffic stop was conducted. Officer Surf arrived shortly thereafter to assist Officer Osbun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. Officer Osbun asked the driver for identification. The driver handed an identification card, not a driver's license, to Officer Osbun, identifying himself as Isaac Johnson. The passenger verbally identified himself as DeWayne Jordan, but Officer Osbun later learned that the passenger was Meekco Johnson. Officer Osbun instructed the two men to exit the vehicle, then asked for permission to search it. Officers Osbun and Surf both contended that Isaac consented to Officer Osbun's request to search. Officer Osbun searched the Impala and found two laptop computers in the trunk, which matched the description of those that had previously been stolen from Barrett's residence. As Officer Osbun was taking the computers to his patrol car, Isaac and Meekco jumped back into the Impala and drove away. Officers Osbun and Surf briefly pursued the Impala before losing sight of it. They reported the incident to Sergeant Redfield, who shortly thereafter saw the Impala pull behind some nearby apartments. Sergeant Redfield exited his vehicle and was walking behind the apartments, when suddenly he came upon Meekco and Isaac, standing by the Impala. Meekco and Isaac began running.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Shortly after this incident, the search warrant for the Ada Drive residence was finally obtained. Police went to the house, saw someone peeking through the blinds, commanded the person to exit the home, and then forcefully broke the door. Inside was a female and several children. The police searched the house and found multiple guns, all of which had been reported stolen from Barrett's home. The police also found a blue comforter matching the one that was stolen from Barrett's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Later that day, Barrett came to the police station and identified the recovered guns as his own. However, he was unable to identify the suspects in the photo lineups presented to him. Meekco, Trevontae, and Isaac were ultimately brought into police custody and charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Police submitted the guns obtained from the Ada Drive residence to the Mississippi Crime Laboratory for fingerprint analysis. Forensic scientist Mike Hood testified as an expert in latent fingerprint examination. Through Hood, the State introduced a forensic report indicating that a latent palm print was recovered from two of the guns obtained from the Ada Drive residence. The police submitted known fingerprints of Meekco, Isaac, Trevontae, Moore, and Latham. Through another forensic scientist, Jamie Bush, the State introduced a forensic report indicating that Isaac's known right palm print matched a latent print on one of the guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. Meekco filed a pretrial motion to suppress the identification and evidence obtained by Officer Osbun during the stop on the basis that the stop was illegally conducted because the officers had no reasonable suspicion to conduct it. The trial court held a hearing and denied the motion, finding that the stop was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12. At trial, Barrett acknowledged that he was unable to identify Meekco, Isaac, and Trevontae in photo lineups the day after the incident. However, Barrett identified the three defendants at trial. Latham also testified at trial and identified Trevontae, Isaac, and Meekco as those who were involved in the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13. Trevontae, Isaac, and Meekco were convicted of the burglary, armed robbery, and kidnapping of Barrett. They each filed post-trial motions, which the circuit denied, leading to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether the Trial Court Erred in Refusing to Allow into Evidence a Police Report for the Purpose of Impeaching Latham\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14. Trevontae argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow a police report into evidence for the purpose of impeaching Latham, one of the State's witnesses in this case. Similarly, Meekco argues that \"[t]he trial court violated his constitutional right to present a defense and to a fair trial by precluding the defense from cross-examining Latham about, and impeaching his testimony with, prior inconsistent statements in [Investigator Steven] O'Neal's report or Latham's recorded statement to Officer Arendale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15. \"The standard of review for the admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

At trial, Matthew Moore's defense counsel sought to impeach Latham using a police report that was prepared by Investigator O'Neal during the course of his investigation. The report, which included a synopsis, prepared by Investigator O'Neal, of the audio-recorded interview between Officer Arendale and Latham, \"provides a general summary[,] not a word for word transcription,\" of what Latham told Officer Arendale shortly after the alleged crime took place. After much back and forth at trial, the final disposition of the issue was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [THE COURT]: [Latham] is a party, so his statements are admissible; however, you would have to-as far as this testimony is concerned, I don't think you can cross-examine him with the report of the investigator. If you have something that he said that's in this statement, you can cross-examine him about that. To put his statement in you would have to authenticate,\n   so you would have to call a witness to do that. And you can call this witness back in your case, if you want to do all that, but that's where we are right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... [Y]ou said I can't cross-examine him with the statements of the police-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [THE COURT]: I mean, you can't characterize it that he said what that other guy said he said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But I can ask him[, \"D]id you say[\"]-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [THE COURT]: Yeah, you can ask him if he said it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [STATE]: Your Honor, so I understand as well .... The defense is allowed to say ... [\"D]id you say whatever off of this sheet, or did you say-tell that to the police[,\"] even though he can't possibly know what Investigator O'Neal, who prepared this document actually transcribed it as, because [Latham] has not seen this summary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [THE COURT]: I think that's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [STATE]: [Latham] hasn't seen the summary, so he can't possibly know how Investigator O'Neal put his words down. So-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [THE COURT]: I think that's correct. The lawyer can ask him, [\"D]id you say this[?\"] If he says no, then he just says no. He can ask him what did he say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [STATE]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 17. Trevontae maintains that the trial court's refusal to admit Investigator O'Neal's report left him \"without a vital resource necessary to impeach Mr. Latham,\" resulting in irreversible harm to him. The trial judge was correct in his determination that Trevontae could cross-examine Latham about what Latham told Officer Arendale. The trial judge was also correct in ruling that Investigator O'Neal's synopsis of the interview between Latham and Officer Arendale could not be used to impeach Latham, because Latham was not interviewed by Investigator O'Neal. Further, the record shows that Latham was cross-examined extensively by four different lawyers, during which time he was questioned regarding the statements he made to Officer Arendale. We do not find any error in the trial judge's refusal to admit Investigator O'Neal's report, including the synopsis of Latham's interview with Officer Arendale. We also point out that Investigator O'Neal also testified, so he was subject to cross-examination about the contents of his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 18. Similarly, Meekco maintains that the trial court's refusal to admit Investigator O'Neal's report limited his constitutional right to a defense, in that it \"effectively insulated Latham from actual impeachment,\" and \"prevented the defense from impeaching Latham after he denied making [an] inconsistent statement.\" Like a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence, \"[l]imitations placed on cross-examination are reviewed using an abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Ervin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965172\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/136/1053/#p1058\">\n    136 So.3d 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1058 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 2014) (citation omitted). \"[O]ne accused of a crime has the right to broad and extensive cross-examination of the witnesses against him, and especially is this so with respect to the principal prosecution witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Suan v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7550769\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/511/144/#p148\">\n    511 So.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (Miss. 1987) (citations omitted). However, there was no basis for admitting the full investigatory report. As stated, Investigator O'Neal testified at trial, and defense counsel was given the opportunity to engage in extensive cross-examination of both Investigator O'Neal and Latham as to what Latham said during the interrogation, which was later summarized in Investigator O'Neal's report. Thus, we\n   find that the circuit judge did not err in excluding the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    2. Whether the Jury's Verdict Was Against the Overwhelming Weight of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19. In Trevontae's motion for a new trial, he argued that the verdict in this case was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. He makes the same argument here. An appellate court reviews the trial court's denial of a post-trial motion for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7499139\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/601/828/#p833\">\n    601 So.2d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 833 (Miss. 1992) (citations omitted). \"A motion for a new trial is discretionary with the trial judge and [an appellate court] will not order a new trial unless it is convinced that the verdict is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7499139\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/601/828/#p833\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 20. Trevontae maintains that there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime of which he was convicted. However, \"the absence of physical evidence does not negate a conviction where there is testimonial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435748\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/812/1150/#p1153\">\n    812 So.2d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1153 (\u00b6 9) (Miss. Ct. App. 2002). \"[T]he jury is the judge of the weight and credibility of testimony and is free to accept or reject all or some of the testimony given by each witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Meshell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7588543\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/506/989/#p992\">\n    506 So.2d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992 (Miss. 1987). Here, Latham-an accomplice to the crime-testified that Trevontae was also involved in its commission. Barrett corroborated this testimony, also identifying Trevontae as one of the crime's perpetrators. The jury apparently believed both Latham's and Barrett's testimony. As the jury is free to reject or accept each witness's testimony, we will not now disturb its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 21. Trevontae contends that Barrett and Latham-who both identified Trevontae as one of the perpetrators of the burglary-presented unreliable testimony because Barrett could not previously identify Trevontae in a pretrial photo lineup or for up to six months after the crime took place. He also argues that Latham had an interest in the outcome of Trevontae's trial, which influenced his testimony. \"[P]ersons may be found guilty on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Doby v.

Here, both Isaac-the driver-and Meekco-the passenger-have standing to challenge the stop of the blue Impala under the Fourth Amendment. Meekco and Isaac first assert that the stop was illegal because the police had no reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop; thus, it could not fall under the investigatory-stop exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. Second, Meekco and Isaac assert that Isaac's consent was invalid\n   because it was obtained during the course of an illegal stop; therefore, it could not fall under the consent exception pursuant to the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   .

First, Meekco and Isaac maintain that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop at the time that Officer Osbun stopped the blue Impala. Meekco and Isaac argue that the stop was improper because the officers only had vague descriptions of the suspects, which did not amount to reasonable suspicion to stop the car and ascertain the identities of those in the car. Further, neither Latham, Barrett, nor any other officer testified to having any knowledge of a blue Impala in connection with the burglary of Barrett's residence. The first time a blue Impala was referenced in connection with this crime was when Sergeant Redfield saw the car in the driveway at the Ada Drive residence. Meekco and Isaac maintain that these facts do not indicate that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 29. In contrast, the State maintains that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct the stop based not only on the descriptions of the subjects provided by Latham, but also on the photographs of the suspects that they had received prior to conducting surveillance on the Ada Drive residence. At the hearing on Meekco's motion to suppress the evidence, Sergeant Redfield testified to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [STATE]: [You and Officers Osbun and Surf] were briefed about what you were asked to do and kind of given a summary of what had happened, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [SERGEANT REDFIELD]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [STATE]: And I believe that y'all were told from other investigators on the case that a robbery had taken place the night before and that some firearms and computers and items of that nature had been taken from the home, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [REDFIELD]: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [STATE]: And that a defendant in that case had given a statement saying they had taken these items to that home on Ada Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [REDFIELD]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [STATE]: And that's why you were asked to watch that house in anticipation of the search warrant to see if anybody took anything, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [REDFIELD]: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [STATE]: And y'all were given general descriptions of the suspects; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [REDFIELD]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [STATE]: These two black males, they fit the description that you saw leaving that [sic] and getting into that Impala, they fit the general description that you had been given, correct?-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [REDFIELD]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [STATE]: -by criminal investigations, and at that point you notified the other officers, correct?

It wasn't a traffic stop. It was just-you know, if it could-any Impala I believe I-it was a blue, something like that, any Impala I would have stopped just for investigative\n   purposes. And he said it was two black males. Two black males were in this Impala, and I did the stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The State argues that, given the descriptions of the suspects and the fact that Sergeant Redfield-who observed the men leaving the house-had seen photographs of the suspects, the police officers were confronted with an ambiguous situation and the investigatory stop was therefore proper to dispel that ambiguity. Additionally, the State argues that even if the officers' initial reasons for the stop were improper, the doctrine of inevitable discovery would have come into play because Isaac-the driver of the blue Impala-presented an identification card, not a driver's license, to police. The State argues that Isaac's failure to produce a driver's license after operating a vehicle in Mississippi is a crime for which he could have been arrested. The vehicle could have subsequently been impounded, and an inventory search could have been conducted. The laptops which were discovered in the trunk would have been found pursuant to such an inventory search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6 30. Officer Osbun stopped Isaac and Meekco based on information that he received from Sergeant Redfield. Sergeant Redfield, while conducting surveillance of the Ada Drive residence, saw two men exit the house and get into the blue Impala. The two men's appearances fit the description of two of the suspects that Latham had previously provided to police. As personal observation may be transmitted from officer to officer, we fail to see how this does not constitute reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop. Further, Sergeant Redfield testified that images of the suspects had been circulated through a group text message among those involved in the investigation of this particular matter. Thus, the stop was not illegal, and the trial court did not err in denying Meekco's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 31. Meekco and Isaac also maintain that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was not obtained under the consent exception to the Fourth Amendment: because the initial traffic stop constituted an illegal detainment, the search of the car was not justified on the basis of Isaac's subsequently obtained consent. In support of this argument, Meekco cites\n   <em>\n    Royer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p507\">\n    460 U.S. at 507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195479\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/491/#p507\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Supreme Court found that where a defendant had given consent to the search of his luggage while he was being illegally detained, \"the consent was tainted by the illegality and was ineffective to justify the search.\" In response, the State contends that even if the stop was illegal and Isaac's consent was, as a result, illegally obtained, the circuit judge's failure to suppress the evidence found in the trunk of the car was harmless error because the evidence ultimately collected from the Ada Drive residence-out of which Isaac and Meekco exited-combined with the damning information provided by Latham to the police overwhelmingly indicated their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   \u00b6 32.

This evidence, combined with the testimony from Latham indicating Meekco's and Isaac's involvement, along with the fact that police officers witnessed Isaac and Meekco exiting the house in which the guns were found, is overwhelmingly indicative of their guilt, such that any error derived from an illegal stop or illegally obtained consent is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Rule 615 governs witness sequestration in Mississippi, and provides that, \"[a]t a party's request, the court must order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear other witnesses' testimony.\" \"The rule applies to rebuttal witnesses as well as witnesses who have testified, or could have testified, on the case-in-chief.\"\n   <em>\n    Finley v.

At trial, the State elicited testimony from Investigator O'Neal, Officer Joseph Horn, and Barrett, who all testified that the three men who robbed Barrett stated that they were in \"Chicago Gang.\" Latham, during his testimony, denied being in a gang. After Latham's testimony, the defense sought to call Alex to testify. Alex told the trial judge-out of the presence of the jury-that he would testify that Latham had personally told Alex of his involvement in a gang. Further, Alex sought to testify that he was familiar with gang signs and symbols, and that Latham had displayed such signs and symbols through pictures on social media. The trial court denied the defense's request, maintaining that the State had invoked Rule 615, and Alex was therefore precluded from testifying because he had been present in the courtroom during Latham's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 38.

We agree with Isaac and Meekco that the circuit judge erred in refusing to allow Alex's testimony that Latham had previously told Alex of Latham's involvement in the \"Chicago Gang,\" as there is no evidence to suggest that probable prejudice would have resulted to the State in allowing Alex to testify as to that matter only. Therefore, even though Alex violated Rule 615, the circuit court should have allowed the defense to impeach Latham's testimony that Latham was not a member of the \"Chicago Gang.\" However, Isaac and Meekco have failed to show that they suffered sufficient prejudice to compel a finding that the trial court's ruling amounts to an abuse of discretion.

We can say without a doubt that Alex's testimony would have had only a negligible impact on the final result of the trial had he been allowed to give the impeaching testimony. At the time Isaac and Meekco sought to call Alex to the witness stand, Latham had already testified that he lied to his mother and the bus driver about his plans on the evening of the robbery, thus putting his credibility squarely before the jury. In spite of Latham's admissions that he had lied, the jury chose to believe his testimony regarding all three defendants' involvement in the burglary. Allowing Alex's testimony to impeach Latham's testimony regarding the peripheral \"Chicago Gang\" issue would not have dismantled his credibility to the extent that the outcome of the trial would have been different, as neither Isaac's nor Meekco's guilt turned on whether Latham was a member of the \"Chicago Gang.\" Therefore, this issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <em>\n    6.
