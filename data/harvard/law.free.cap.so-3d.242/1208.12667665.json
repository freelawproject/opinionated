Upon reconsideration, we affirm the final judgment awarding attorney's fees, including the trial court's application of a multiplier to the attorney's fees award. Based upon Appellees' prior concession of error, we reverse the award of $26,918.43 in court costs regarding the services provided by two of Appellees' expert witnesses, Nettles &amp; Associates and Reliable Field Services of Central Florida, Inc. On remand, the trial court is directed to strike this amount from the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part; and REMANDED, with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   COHEN, C.J., LAMBERT, J., and LEMONIDIS, R.C., Associate Judge, concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
