John Cole was adjudged guilty by a jury in the Lincoln County Circuit Court for the unlawful possession of less than thirty grams of marijuana with the intent to distribute, and the illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He was sentenced as a habitual offender. As a result, Cole was sentenced to serve three years for the marijuana-related charge, and ten years for the possession of the firearm; the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Cole filed posttrial motions, all of which were denied. This direct appeal followed, wherein Cole attacks the admission of certain evidence. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On August 6, 2015, Agent Hunter Huff of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics (MBN) received information from an anonymous tipster\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that several unidentified individuals were outside a private residence selling drugs. The tipster conveyed to Huff that the house was located on, or around, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, and had a chiminea (or fire pit) out front. In response, Huff, along with Captain Billy Ray Warner, Agent Jesse Leggett, and other officers arrived simultaneously at the location approximately described by the tipster to investigate the claim. They parked along the public roadway and found six men sitting near the street. Cole was one of the six, seated to the far right. The scene aligned roughly with that described by the tipster, according to Huff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. At that time, the agents immediately observed one of the individuals hide something under his shirt. Huff, Leggett, and the other agents then approached the men while Huff began explaining why they were present. When asked to produce the hidden object, the individual revealed a marijuana joint. The same individual had his foot on top of a CD case located on the ground, which was found to contain additional marijuana. A second individual produced from his pocket a bottle housing marijuana. The agents then found marijuana and a pistol on another individual, Lattrick Williams. Having found narcotics on at least three of the individuals present, as well as a gun, the agents continued the investigation and chose to frisk Cole for weapons. But when the agents either attempted, or initially began, to frisk Cole, he stood, then fled along the roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Agents on the scene testified that Cole discarded what appeared to be a white hand towel while running. While pursuing Cole, Officer Barlow of the Brookhaven Police Department stated that he heard what sounded like metallic clinking along the pavement-when he looked down, he observed a revolver and alerted the other agents to its presence. When inspected by Leggett, the towel was found near a firearm. In close proximity to the pistol was marijuana. Cole subsequently was restrained by the agents, placed under arrest, and searched. Additional marijuana was found on his person. He was then taken to jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Once at jail, Cole was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mirandized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   waived his rights, and spoke with Huff and Leggett. According to Huff's and Leggett's\n   testimony, Cole provided a statement, in which he allegedly admitted selling the bags of marijuana for $10 each, and that he recently had purchased the pistol found at the scene for $120. Huff stated on cross-examination, however, that Cole's statement was not recorded in any fashion, and that no written report was constructed by either himself or Leggett detailing Cole's statement. But Huff also stated that, as a general practice, MBN does not record every statement of a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. During pretrial proceedings, Cole moved to suppress evidence related to the marijuana and pistol, claiming that the search and seizure were unlawful and, therefore, those items were \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" Cole also sought to have any alleged statements by him suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. During the suppression hearing, Cole chose to testify. Cole admitted that he had waived his\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   rights and that he had \"talked with\" the agents, but he denied making any statements regarding the sale of marijuana. As a result, his testimony varied in some respects from that to which Huff and Leggett had testified. Even so, Cole admitted that he had fled because he did not want to go to jail, and that he was in possession of the marijuana and the pistol before he fled. Following the suppression hearing, the circuit court denied Cole's motion to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. As a result, Cole proceeded to trial on September 22, 2016. Upon conclusion of trial, the jury found Cole guilty of both counts charged, and he was sentenced as a habitual offender. As such, he received a three-year sentence for his possession of less than thirty grams of marijuana with the intent to distribute, and ten years for being a felon in possession of a firearm; the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, the entirety of which was to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Displeased, Cole moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial-neither motion, however, specifically attacked the circuit court's admission of the firearm or marijuana. The circuit court ultimately denied all of Cole's posttrial motions. Aggrieved, Cole timely filed this direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10. \"This Court applies a mixed standard of review when considering Fourth-Amendment issues.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cook v.

The same individual was concealing additional marijuana located on the ground. The discovery of marijuana on the first individual was treated by the agents as an initial verification of the information received in the tip (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , possible distribution of narcotics).

The agents then found marijuana and a pistol on the third individual, Williams. Having found narcotics on at least three of the individuals present, as well as a gun, the agents continued their investigation and determined that Cole needed to be frisked for weapons as well.

Instead, testimony from the agents reveals that Cole did nothing but remain sitting until it was determined that he needed to be frisked for weapons.

And so, though not placed under arrest at the moment the agents began questioning the first individual, we nonetheless agree with Cole that he was temporarily detained once that initial questioning began. Even so, we still hold that both the inception of the stop-and its accompanying detention-were lawful under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . This is because the anonymous tip implicated a group of individuals possibly distributing narcotics. The agents, when approaching the group of interest, then personally observed an individual within the group of interest acting suspicious. When investigated further, the agents discovered marijuana on at least three individuals. Treating those discoveries as verification of the information received in the tip, and coupled with their independent observations, we hold that the agents were justified in their temporary detention of the remaining individuals comprising the group \"for purposes of investigating possibl[e] criminal behavior[.]\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 392 U.S. at 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 31. That said, we know that Cole definitively was detained after the discovery of the weapon because Warner articulated to the other agents, and in Cole's presence, that Cole then needed to be frisked for weapons. In light of what the agents had discovered up to that point in their investigation (narcotics\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a firearm), we also find that the agents were justified in their decision to frisk Cole. This is because \"[t]he officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 392 U.S at 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And so, this Court holds that the agents' investigatory stop was lawful under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , both at its inception, and in its scope.

The fact, standing alone, that Carr fled rather than voluntarily submit to the officer's verbal command to stop justified further investigatory work by the officer, but it did not give rise to reasonable cause to arrest.

Therefore, the Court of Appeals held that Carr's motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175764\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/770/1025/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 36. In applying\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to his case, Cole argues that \"[t]he [agents] inquiring with the individuals outside of a house on Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive and finding marijuana on one person [did] not give the [agents] reasonable cause to search or arrest [him].\" Comparing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to Cole's case, however, we find the present matter is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37. First, Cole seemingly ignores all the events that transpired between the moment that marijuana was discovered on the first individual and the ultimate decision that he needed to be frisked. Thus, Cole's contention that marijuana being found on \"one person [did] not give the\n   [agents] reasonable cause to search or arrest [him]\" is inaccurate-the record reveals that at least three individuals were found to be in possession of marijuana prior to the decision to frisk him. Secondly, having discovered contraband\n   <em>\n    and a weapon\n   </em>\n   on other individuals in the group of interest, reasonable suspicion was further established by the agents to lawfully detain Cole, in accord with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Terry\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , 392 U.S. at 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And lastly, unlike\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Cole temporarily was detained\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to fleeing from the agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Carr\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175764\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/770/1025/\">\n    770 So.2d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38. As such, we hold that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is not analogous to Cole's case, as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   did not involve an anonymous tip, implicate a group rather than an individual, or involve independent police investigation before a suspect was placed into custody.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Carr\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175764\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/770/1025/\">\n    770 So.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   involved an arrest and search without independent investigation or probable cause, such is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39. Therefore, we cannot hold here that the scope of the investigatory stop was exceeded by the agents' conduct. The agents were there to investigate possible narcotics activity. Through their investigation, they discovered marijuana and a firearm. Having discovered a firearm, the agents were justified in their decision to conduct a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   frisk of Cole's person in order to determine whether he possessed a weapon that could be used to assault the agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Terry\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , 392 U.S. at 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, again, we find that the agents' stop was lawful both at its inception and in its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Unprovoked Flight\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 40. Cole further maintains that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   affirms that the agents' conduct here exceeded the permissible scope of the stop, notwithstanding his \"alleged flight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 41. To begin, we acknowledge that the record testimony is unclear as to whether Cole actually was frisked prior to his flight, but whether a frisk occurred is not dispositive to our analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That said, from all of the agents' testimony in the record, it appears that as the agents-or at the least, Huff-attempted to approach Cole to frisk him, Cole, who was acting nervously at that time, stood and then fled. It is also unclear from the record whether Cole was instructed to stand, or if he did so under his own volition-regardless, Cole stated that as he stood, Huff instructed him to place his hands behind his back. Cole then testified that Huff grabbed one of his hands and placed his other hand on Cole's waist. According to Cole, that is \"when the pistol fell down [his] leg.\" The Court can only presume that after the pistol \"fell down [Cole's] leg,\" he chose to flee. When asked why he fled, Cole stated that he felt like he was \"about to be placed under arrest,\" and that he \"didn't want to [go] to jail.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 42. To this end, Cole asserts that his \"refusal to cooperate, without more, [did] not furnish the minimum level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Illinois v.

The Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wardlow\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   went further, however, and articulated the\n   differences between a suspect's refusal to cooperate and his unprovoked flight.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wardlow\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    528 U.S. at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Headlong flight-wherever it occurs-is the consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such ....\n   <em>\n    But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate. Flight, by its very nature, is not \"going about one's business[;]\" in fact, it is just the opposite.\n   </em>\n   Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent with the individual's right to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police questioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, whether Cole had been frisked prior to his flight, he was up to that point lawfully detained under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and temporarily not free to leave.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Terry\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His unprovoked flight, however, was without question a \"consummate act of evasion,\" designed to prevent his further detention and carried out by his desire to avoid jail.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Wardlow\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    528 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 43. Therefore, we find that Cole's flight-having been lawfully detained on grounds of reasonable suspicion-provided the agents with further justification to pursue him for purposes of completing their\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Cooper\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6929309\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/1164/#p1168\">\n    145 So.3d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Probable Cause to Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 44. Despite compounding the circumstances of the investigatory stop with Cole's flight, Cole still maintains that the agents lacked probable cause to arrest him, and then search for, and later seize, the marijuana and firearm. In Cole's view, he had \"the right to resist an unlawful arrest.\" We can only assume that Cole's reference to an \"unlawful arrest\" is based upon his belief that he was \"about to be placed under arrest\" following the determination that he needed to be frisked. For a variety of reasons, however, we find this argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 45. First, as noted above, Cole admitted that he had not been placed in handcuffs, and that no one had told him that he was under arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Jackson\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9651313\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/335/116/#p118\">\n    335 So.2d at 118-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, up to the point that he fled, the agents merely were trying to conduct a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   frisk of Cole's person, which we have held was justified under the circumstances. Second, this Court has found that where a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   stop has not been completed due to a suspect's flight, the officers are provided with further reasonable suspicion to justify pursuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Cooper\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6929309\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/1164/#p1168\">\n    145 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1173 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Carr\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11175764\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/770/1025/\">\n    770 So.2d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But third-and most important, however-is that this Court ultimately has held \"that if a suspect flees from the police\n   <em>\n    when he has been detained on reasonable suspicion, the officers acquire probable cause to effectuate an arrest\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442934\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/910/#p917\">\n    926 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   920 (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mitchell v.

Therefore, based upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the stop, we find that the agents' decision to conduct a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   frisk of Cole's person was justified. And so, Cole's subsequent, unprovoked flight from his lawful, temporary detention provided the agents with further reasonable suspicion to pursue him-and ultimately-the probable cause necessary to effectuate an arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Dies\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442934\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/910/#p917\">\n    926 So.2d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Abandoned Contraband\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 47.

We reiterate, however, that at the moment Cole fled, he was temporarily detained-that is, he was being frisked, or about to be frisked.

While pursuing Cole, Barlow stated that he heard what sounded like metallic clinking along the pavement, and that when he looked down, he observed a revolver and alerted the other agents to its presence. When inspected by Leggett, the towel was found near a firearm. In close proximity to the pistol was said to be marijuana.

We base this conclusion upon the information contained in the anonymous tip\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the agents' independent observation and investigation. Therefore, it follows that Cole was lawfully and temporarily detained for the purpose of the agents to complete their\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   stop. That being so, we also hold that the agents acquired the probable cause necessary to arrest Cole when he fled. And because Cole abandoned the contested contraband in a public street, Cole had no reasonable expectation of privacy in those items. Moreover, once Cole was captured and placed into custody, the additional marijuana found on his person was lawfully seized. Therefore, evidence of the seized contraband was admissible against Cole, and not the fruit of an illegal search or seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 55.
