The punishment is within the limits fixed by the Legislature for this character of offense, and is, therefore, not excessive. It appears that Bosa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Lee Finch is certainly under the age of fifteen years, and she swears positively to an act of intercourse. Appellant is a grown man, and under such circumstances, if the jury believed the testimony offered in behalf of the State, as they evidently did, we are not surprised at the punishment inflicted.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b660-7\">[Rehearing denied May 27, 1914.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
