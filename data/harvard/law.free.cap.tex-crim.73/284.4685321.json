It is considered and ordered by the court that sentence of the judgment of conviction herein be and the same is hereby suspended during the good behavior of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Ho sentence has ever been pronounced, but appellant filed a motion for a new trial, and when it was overruled gave notice of appeal, and undertakes to prosecute an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The question arises: has a person adjudged guilty, and who at his request and instance has had the sentence suspended, the right of appeal before sentence is pronounced. The right of appeal is given in this State upon such conditions and restrictions as the Legislature may adopt, and we think it clear from reading the suspended sentence Act it was not the intention of the Legislature to give the right of appeal in this character of case until sentence has been pronounced. Article 856 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that in all eases of felony (except where the death penalty is assessed) <em>sentence shall he pronounced before an appeal is taken, </em>and where the person on trial secures the suspension of pronouncing of sentence, his right of appeal does not arise until sentence is pronounced. If the court should hereafter for any reason call him before the court and pronounce sentence, his right of appeal would then accrue, and he could then prosecute an appeal to this court, but not until then. Ho sentence having been pronounced, and it being at his instance and request that sentence was suspended, this appeal must be dismissed, but without prejudice to his right to appeal if sentence should hereafter be pronounced on the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">March 18, 1914.</p>\n<author id=\"b311-11\">HAEPBE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-lq\">Appellant has filed a motion for rehearing in which he earnestly insists we were in error in dismissing his appeal; that the judgment entered was a final judgment, although no sentence was pronounced. To so hold would be in. direct conflict with the provisions of the suspended sentence law. Section 2 reads: \u201cThe court shall permit testimony and submit the question as to the general reputation of defendant to enable the jury to determine whether to recommend the suspension of sentence, and as to whether the defendant has ever been convicted; such testimony shall be heard and such question submitted only upon the request in writing by the defendant; provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>that in all cases sentence shall be suspended if the jury recommends it in their verdict. Provided further, that in such cases, neither the verdict of conviction nor the judgment entered thereon shall become final, except under the conditions and in the manner and at the time provided for by section 4 of this Act.\u201d It is thus seen that by law it is now specifically provided that this shall not be a final judgment. Section 4 reads: \u201cUpon the final conviction of the defendant of any other felony, pending the suspension of sentence, the court granting such suspension shall cause a capias to issue for the arrest of the defendant, if he is not then in the custody of such court, and upon the execution of a capias, and during a term of the court shall pronounce sentence upon the original judgment of conviction, and shall cumulate the punishment of the first with the punishment of any subsequent conviction or convictions, and in such cases no new trial shall be granted in the first conviction.\u201d As said in the original opinion, that should circumstances in the future arise whereby under the provisions of this latter section the court should pronounce sentence, then- and not until then does his right of appeal lie under our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
