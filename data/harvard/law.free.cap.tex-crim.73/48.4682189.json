No stock law being in force, he turned them out on the range. Appellant also owned cattle, which he turned out on the range. His cattle were Herefords, and he objected to Elliott permitting his J ersey bull to run at large, and after driving the bull from off his leased but unfenced land several times, he finally drove him off and put him in a pasture where the Jersey bull was castrated. Appellant does not deny driving the bull off and putting it in a pasture, but says he did so to protect his cattle\u2014to keep the bull from serving his Hereford cows. He offered to prove by several witnesses the difference in . value of calves from Hereford cows from a Hereford sire and from a Jersey sire. There was no error in excluding this testimony, as it was not an issue in the case. As the stock law was not in force each man had a right to turn his cattle out on the commons to graze, and if appellant objected to his cattle running with Elliott\u2019s \u25a0 cattle, he should have put his cattle in a pasture, and not driven Elliott\u2019s cattle off and put them in a pasture. Elliott was using his cattle in a lawful way, and so long as he was doing so, appellant had no right to interfere with them. The issue of protecting his property does not arise under such state of facts. Elliott was not seeking to injure appellant\u2019s cattle, nor did he do any legal wrong in turning them out on the commons to pasture. Appellant could have fenced his land, \u25a0 and then if Elliott\u2019s male had gotten in his enclosure, he would have had the right to eject him from such enclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">All the questions presented hinge around this proposition: that as he wanted his cattle to run at large, and did not want them served by a J ersey male, he claims the right to drive off Elliott\u2019s bull and put him in a pasture. He had no such right, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
