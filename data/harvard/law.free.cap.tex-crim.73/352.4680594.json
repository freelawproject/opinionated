Appellant asked the court to charge that if the jury \u00a1believed from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant \u2022did have a pistol, as charged, but \"you further believe that the pistol \"was not in shooting condition, or, if you have a reasonable doubt\u201d of it find him not guilty. He also complains of this paragraph of the court\u2019s charge: \u201cIf the defendant carried a pistol, it would not make any difference whether the pistol was an old one or a new one, or was loaded or unloaded. The law merely says that it is unlawful to carry \u00a1a pistol and makes no difference whether it was a good pistol or an inferior one, but it must be a pistol.\u201d The court qualified appellant\u2019s hill complaining of this charge by stating: \u201cThat the witness, Andrew Arriola, testified in speaking of the gun: \u2018I felt something in his pocket \u2022\u25a0and pulled it out and it was a pistol, was a common looking blue pistol. It all seemed to be there and as far as I know it was a whole pistol. It had hammer and all.\u2019 Tom Collins testified: \u2018Roy Steele and Cal Eddings\u2019 boy caught up with us,\u2014directly Andrew came up to the \"wagon and said: \u201cLook here what I got,\u201d and showed us a pistol. It was loaded and the cartridges looked like they had been snapped on. It-was loaded next morning when I looked at it. It was a pistol and was an old looking pistol and had a hammer and trigger.\u2019 The defendant \"testified: \u2018I brought it to town with me and hid it in my slicker, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>left it in my slicker until I started out and then took it out and put it in my pocket.\u2019 The attempts to shoot the pistol were on the next morning after the pistol had been thrown in the wagon the night before.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b379-7\">[Rehearing denied May 6, 1914.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We tbi-nk the court properly refused to give appellant\u2019s said special charge and there was no error in giving the paragraph of his charge quoted and excepted to above. We do not regard Blackburn v. State, 58 Crim. Rep., 48, 124 S. W. Rep., 666, cited and relied on by appellant, as in point. The statute is \u201cif any person shall carry on or about his person <em>any </em>pistol, he shall be punished by fine,\u201d etc. We think there is no error shown in the judgment of the court below and it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
