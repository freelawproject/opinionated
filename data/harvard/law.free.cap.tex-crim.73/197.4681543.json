It was essential that this fact be proven, otherwise a conviction could not be sustained, and while there was no motion made to quash the information before trial, yet it is a defect of substance and not of form, and may be raised at any time, for without this allegation being in the information it charges no offense against the laws of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">There are a number of'other questions raised, and we have considered each of them. Hone of them present error, and the evidence would amply support a conviction for a violation of this provision of the Code, but because the information does not charge an offense under this provision of the law, we must necessarily quash the information and complaint and reverse and dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The judgment is reversed and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
