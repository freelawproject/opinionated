Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-7\">The facts as adduced at the hearing on the suppression motion are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">The Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco during July 1984. On July 19, presidential candidate Senator Gary Hart was staying in the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. Special Agent Poggi of the United States Secret Service was assigned as the \u201clead advance agent\u201d for the detail assigned to protect Hart. Hart planned to walk from his hotel to the Meridien Hotel to meet Vice President Mondale. This event was public, but the fact that Hart was going to walk, and shake hands along the way, was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">The chief witness at the suppression hearing was Special Agent Poggi, who was assigned to guard presidential candidate Senator Gary Hart on July 19, 1984, in San Francisco. Agent Poggi had nine years experience in the Secret Service at the time of this incident. He had a standard operating procedure he was trained to use when assigned to protect a public figure who would be shaking hands on a \u201crope line.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This procedure involved conducting searches of persons in the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">The search was a light patdown search, and the persons to be searched were chosen in two ways. A general search was done on all persons two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 12\">*Supp. 12</page-number>three people deep into the crowd. A target search was done on persons anywhere in the crowd who seemed \u201csuspicious\u201d to the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">\n<em>The General Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">Poggi testified that when his protectee was about to shake hands on a rope line, Poggi would go behind the barricade, or line, and search the first two or three people-deep in the crowd for weapons around the waist. He has done thousands of these types of searches. \u201c[Ujsually it\u2019s just a general frisk wherein the people don\u2019t even actually know they are being searched for weapons.\u201d \u201cThe public would be between myself and the protectee. I would be behind the public, moving up. And just basically moving them by putting my hands on their waist and saying \u2018Excuse me\u2019 and as I move them I would sweep around their waist and go on to the next person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">At the request of respondent\u2019s counsel, this search was demonstrated to the court by Poggi. The court gave the following description of the search: \u201cIt appears that the agent walked up behind [respondent\u2019s attorney], put both hands one on each side at approximately around the waist area, and moved her to the side when he was saying \u2018Excuse me\u2019 ... I think he said \u2018Excuse me, step aside,\u2019 words to that effect. And at the same time it appears that\u2014and she was moved to his left. And at the same time the agent apparently, from my observation, put your left hand behind the back.\u201d Counsel for respondent noted, in addition, that the left hand continued a sweeping movement around the entire waist which moved her jacket aside slightly as it happened. The agent\u2019s body made contact with her right shoulder as he passed by.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">Poggi testified that he has had reactions to this search, but not violent ones; in his opinion the search was not offensive to most people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-9\">\n<em>The Target Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-10\">The target search was the identical waistband search, again usually done without the subject\u2019s awareness of the search, but performed on a person targeted by the Secret Service agent as a suspicious person in the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-11\">At 10:30 a.m. on July 19, Agent Poggi left the St. Francis Hotel by the Post Street exit. Post Street was blocked off to the public, but 50 to 75 people were gathered behind metal police barricades on Powell. Senator Hart was five minutes behind Poggi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-12\">As Poggi looked toward the crowd of people on Powell Street, he saw respondent, who was about 50 to 75 feet away. Poggi\u2019s attention was at first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 13\">*Supp. 13</page-number>drawn to respondent because of a physical similarity between respondent and Arthur Bremmer, a man Poggi knew was in jail as a result of his conviction of shooting Governor Wallace in 1972. Respondent\u2019s hair was extremely short, almost shaved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">Poggi approached the crowd on Powell Street with another agent right behind him. He was able to communicate with other agents via an earphone radio system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">As he came closer to where respondent was standing, Poggi noticed that respondent was dressed much more casually than the rest of the crowd, who were wearing slacks or sport coats. Respondent was fidgeting and seemed nervous. He was playing with his hands. Poggi was obviously a Secret Service agent, and in a secured area, but respondent avoided all eye contact with Poggi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">At this point, Agent Poggi made the decision to do a targeted search of respondent for weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">Poggi went behind the barricade, alone, to be able to come up behind respondent and search him. He had to move five or six people to get to respondent from the rear. \u201cI did a general search on those people also. Saying \u2018Excuse me\u2019 and I put my hand and actually physically moved them and searched them at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">As he approached respondent, he saw that respondent had a fanny pack on. As Poggi approached respondent, he put his hands lightly on his side and said \u201cExcuse me\u201d as if he was going to move him like everyone else. Poggi\u2019s hands were on what he called respondent\u2019s \u201clove rolls,\u201d and he was touching respondent \u201cvery, very lightly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">Respondent spun right into Poggi\u2019s face; because of the quickness of the spin, Poggi characterized it as violent, although there was no violence in the sense that respondent tried to hit Poggi or snarled. Since Poggi was right up behind respondent, respondent turned into Poggi\u2019s face; respondent did not step forward to get closer to Poggi\u2019s face.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">Poggi said \u201cPolice Officer. Don\u2019t move. I am going to check you for weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-12\">Poggi at that point squeezed the fanny pack and immediately felt a hard object. After he felt the hard object, he commanded respondent not to move. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 14\">*Supp. 14</page-number>Respondent was not free to leave. Poggi unzipped the fanny pack and saw the handle of a gun. He threw respondent to the ground and covered him with his body. Respondent was subsequently arrested without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Respondent subsequently filed a pretrial motion to suppress the gun pursuant to California Penal Code section 1538.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-5\">The court below found that Agent Poggi had subjective cause to search respondent, but did not find objectively reasonable probable cause. Accordingly, the court below granted respondent\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1438-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-8\">The California Supreme Court explained in detail the scope of review on appeal from a section 1538.5 motion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-9\">[\u201cIn the first step the trial court must \u2018find the facts\u2019 relating to the challenged search or seizure: e.g., it must decide what the officer actually perceived, or knew, or believed, and what action he took in response. These are traditional questions of fact .... \u2018On appeal all presumptions favor the exercise of that power, and the trial court\u2019s findings on such matters, whether express or implied, must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-10\">\u201cNo less important, however, is the second step of the process. As we observed in <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Lawler </em>[(1973) 9 Cal.3d 156 (107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621)], \u2018The trial court also has the duty to decide whether, on the facts found, the search was unreasonable within the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 15\">*Supp. 15</page-number>Constitution.\u2019 . . . Because \u2018that issue is a question of law,\u2019 the appellate court is not bound by the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision thereon. . . . On that issue, in short, the appellate court exercises its independent judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-5\">\u201cThis general rule governs the particular instance of evidence obtained as a result of an investigative stop. It is now settled that \u2018in order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him to do so; the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position drawing when appropriate on his training and experience [citation], to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-6\">\u201cApplying the <em>Lawler </em>rule to the foregoing analysis, we observe that the first issue to be decided, i.e., whether the officer subjectively entertained a suspicion that there was criminal activity afoot and the person he intended to stop was involved in it, is a question of fact: the officer either did or did not have that suspicion at the time he acted. Under <em>Lawler, </em>therefore, review of a trial court\u2019s finding on that issue is limited by the substantial evidence test.  But the next step in the inquiry, i.e., whether it was objectively reasonable for the officer to entertain that suspicion, is a question of law: it implicates the constitutional standard of reasonableness\u2014a standard, as <em>Lawler </em>recognizes, that the appellate courts have the \u2018ultimate responsibility\u2019 to administer. It follows that the substantial evidence test does not limit review of this issue, and the appellate court must make an independent determination whether the officer\u2019s suspicion was constitutionally reasonable in the circumstances of the case.\u201d] <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 596-597 [fns. omitted].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">The facts bearing on the legality of the search in this case are undisputed. The trial judge implicitly found on the undisputed facts that Agent Poggi had subjective cause to search respondent. Accordingly, there is no factual issue entitled to a substantial evidence standard of review. This court need only determine whether the facts fit within constitutional restrictions on searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">The issue to be determined by this court is whether there was in fact an intrusion upon a reasonable expectation of privacy which would trigger a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 16\">*Supp. 16</page-number>Fourth Amendment analysis, and, if there was such an intrusion, whether Agent Poggi had objectively reasonable constitutionally required cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">\n<em>Is a Fourth Amendment Analysis Appropriate?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">The threshold question for this court is whether respondent had a Fourth Amendment right which was violated when the agent initially touched his waist area with the intent to conduct an around the waist pat search. If that question is answered in the negative, the problem becomes whether the subsequent continuation of that search, which included touching the fanny pack, was in violation of respondent\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">The cornerstone of Fourth Amendment rights is a reasonable expectation of privacy, since the Fourth Amendment protects only those expectations of privacy that society finds legitimate. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 S.Ct. 507], holding that the Fourth Amendment does not protect the merely subjective expectation of privacy, but only \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 361 [19 L.Ed.2d at p. 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">Is the expectation of privacy asserted by respondent in the area around his waist one that society recognizes as reasonable? \u201cNo single factor determines whether an individual legitimately may claim under the Fourth Amendment that a place should be free of government intrusion not authorized by warrant.\u201d <em>(Oliver </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 170, 177-178 [80 L.Ed.2d 214, 223, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">It could be argued that respondent did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy since he chose to place himself in close proximity to a presidential candidate under tight security, and he should have known that he would be subject to strict scrutiny by Secret Service agents. The strong governmental and individual interest in a voting public that has access to its representatives, however, weighs against accepting this argument. Respondent has a right to gather with other members of the public to see and hear his representatives or political candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">This court believes that the fact that respondent was in a public place close to Gary Hart is not relevant under the circumstances of this case to the issue of whether respondent had a legitimate expectation of privacy. \u201cAn individual who enters a place defined to be \u2018public\u2019 for Fourth Amendment analysis does not lose all claims to privacy or personal security. [Citations.] For example, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections against. . . unreasonable seizure of effects upon the person remain[s] fully applicable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 179 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 225].) \u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 17\">*Supp. 17</page-number>people\u2014and not simply \u2018areas\u2019\u2014against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>(Katz </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>389 U.S. at p. 353 [19 L.Ed.2d at p. 583].) \u201cUnquestionably petitioner was entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment as he walked down the street in Cleveland.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 9 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 899, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">And accordingly, this court finds that respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy which was intruded upon when Agent Poggi touched his waist area.  This initial \u201cvery light\u201d touch was sufficient to trigger respondent\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">\n<em>The Balancing Test: Given the Government\u2019s Interests and the Amount of Intrusion, What \u201cCause\u201d is Constitutionally Required?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">Where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by federal law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This restriction is applicable not only to police officers, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 18\">*Supp. 18</page-number>also to governmental activity in general. <em>(New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O. </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 325, 335 [83 L.Ed.2d 720, 730, 105 S.Ct. 733, 740].) \u201cThe basic purpose of this Amendment ... is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d <em>(Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523, 528 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 935, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1732].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">If a legitimate privacy interest is intruded upon by the government, then the Fourth Amendment requires a balancing of interests: given the totality of the circumstances, was the search justified? \u201cJustification\u201d is not a constant, but rather is a variable; depending on the weight of the government\u2019s interests, the weight of the individual\u2019s privacy interests, and the extent, or nature and scope, of the intrusion, varying amounts of justification are necessary. This balancing test has been set out many times by the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201c[I]n determining whether the seizure and search were \u2018unreasonable\u2019 our inquiry is a dual one\u2014whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at pp. 19-20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905].) There is \u201cno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\u201d <em>(Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>387 U.S. at p. 523, 536-537 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 940].) Whether a search is reasonable \u201cdepends on the context within which a search takes place. The determination of the standard of reasonableness . . . requires \u2018balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\u2019\u201d <em>(New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 337 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 731], citing <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>387 U.S. 523.) Frequently, the result of this balancing analysis has been the finding that a suspicion meeting the level of probable cause is required in order to justify the search or seizure.  In certain instances, probable cause is not required, and a reasonable suspicion will suffice. <em>(New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., supra, </em>469 U.S. at p. 340 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 734], citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1 and other federal cases.) \u201cWhere a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 19\">*Supp. 19</page-number>served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard.\u201d <em>(Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See also <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 491 [75 L.Ed.2d 229, 103 S.Ct. 1319].) \u201cThe predicate permitting seizures on suspicion short of probable cause is that law enforcement interests warrant a limited intrusion on the personal security of the suspect. The scope of the intrusion permitted will vary to some extent with the particular facts and circumstances of each case. This much, however, is clear: an investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Similarly, the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion in a short period of time. [Citations.] It is the State\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the seizure it seeks to justify was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.\u201d <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. at p. 500 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">Accordingly, even if the search in question is an exception to the rule that probable cause and a warrant are required, then in addition to at least reasonable suspicion, the scope of the search must be strictly limited in scope \u201cto that which is justified by the particular purposes served by the exception.\u201d <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. at p. 500 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">\n<em>The Government Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">\u201cApplying these principles to this case, we consider first the nature and extent of the governmental interests involved.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 22 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 906].) In <em>Terry, </em>the governmental interests were those of crime prevention and detection and the \u201cmore immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 23 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 907].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-8\">The government\u2019s interest in the present case likewise was a safety interest. Agent Poggi\u2019s job was to protect Senator Hart. Senator Hart, as a presidential candidate, was in a position of special risk. This country has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 20\">*Supp. 20</page-number>witnessed, particularly in recent years, many assassinations and attempted assassinations both of presidential candidates and Presidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">Prior to the Civil War, none of 15 Presidents was assassinated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since that time, 4 of 24 presidents have been assassinated. If successful and unsuccessful attempts made on the lives of presidential candidates and presidents are included, the pattern becomes more alarming.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">In 1963, John F. Kennedy was shot and killed with a rifle in Dallas, Texas, by Lee Harvey Oswald. On June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed with a pistol in Los Angeles, California, by Sirhan Sirhan. On May 15,1972, George Wallace, giving a campaign speech in a shopping center in Laurel, Maryland, was shot and paralyzed from the waist down by Arthur Bremmer. On September 5, 1975, there was an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in Sacramento by Lynette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme. On September 22, 1975, another attempt on President Ford\u2019s life was made by Sara Jane Moore in San Francisco. On March 30, 1981, an attempt was made on President Reagan\u2019s life by John Hinckley in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">In light of this history we cannot blind ourselves, any more than the <em>Terry </em>court could, to the need of law enforcement officers to protect office seekers from violence in situations where they lack probable cause to arrest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 21\">*Supp. 21</page-number>\u201cThe wide attention the President receives makes him a logical target\u2014 if anything about an assassination act can be said to be logical\u2014for those wishing to punish a nation, to strike out at a symbolically powerful figure whom they project as the source of their grievances, to drastically alter governmental policy, or to draw attention to themselves as the author of a memorable event. In addition, the current methods [personal appearances on the campaign trail] by which presidential candidates seek nomination and election provide many opportunities for assassins.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The presidency is the focus of public attention, and those who seek that high office symbolize that office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">The election process, and every adult citizen\u2019s right to vote for one\u2019s representatives must be preserved and protected. The free election process is protected when its participants are kept safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">Here, not only was there a general government interest in crime prevention and detection, but there was also a more immediate interest in preserving the election process and in the safety of Senator Hart and the general public in the crowd. This constitutes a substantial government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">\n<em>The Private Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">Since there exists a substantial governmental interest which justified the initiation of some kind of search, this court must ask whether the least intrusive means available was used to safeguard this interest. \u201cThe scope of the search must be \u2018strictly tied to and justified by\u2019 the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.\u201d <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 19 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 904] citing <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 294, 310 [18 L.Ed.2d 782,794, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 1652].) Thus, an individual\u2019s interest is directly proportional to the scope and intrusiveness of the search. The smaller the intrusion, the less weight the individual\u2019s interest is given in Fourth Amendment balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-9\">When the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Terry </em>.v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, it rejected the idea that the Terry-type stop and frisk was a minimal intrusion: \u201c[I]t is simply fantastic to urge that [a careful exploration of the outer surfaces of a person\u2019s clothing all over his or her body in an attempt to find weapons] performed in public by a policeman while the citizen stands helpless, perhaps facing a wall with his hands raised, is a \u2018petty indignity.\u2019 It is a serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 22\">*Supp. 22</page-number>which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong resentment, and it is not to be undertaken lightly.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 16-17 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 903],)1 **********<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">In the present case, the intrusion amounted to a very light touch around the waist, similar to a touch any person in the crowd might have inflicted on respondent. While this is irrelevant to the issue of whether respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy, it is crucial to the question of intrusiveness. The touch was minimal. The agent testified that he had never had adverse responses to the around-the-waist search he used, and that it was especially planned so that it would not bother the people who received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">\n<em>The Standard for Constitutionally Required Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">This court\u2019s conclusion, and evaluation of the proper balance, is that in these circumstances the governmental interest is of sufficient magnitude, and the intrusion on respondent\u2019s privacy is sufficiently minimal, so that only a reasonable belief, not rising to the level of probable cause, would justify the initial pat-search.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-7\">\n<em>Did Agent Poggi Articulate Sufficient Factors to Support an Objectively Reasonable Belief That Respondent Was Armed?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">Courts have long wrestled with the amorphous concept of constitutional cause, whether it takes the form of probable cause or reasonable belief. Out of a constantly evolving line of cases have arisen a few standards which guide us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">To begin with, it is the totality of the circumstances which must be considered. <em>(Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 213, 230-231 [76 L.Ed.2d 527, 543-544, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 23\">*Supp. 23</page-number>The agent listed several factors which produced his decision to do this target search: the agent\u2019s nine years of experience in this type of situation, respondent\u2019s refusal to make eye contact, casual dress and extremely short haircut, and fidgeting and nervousness. Agent Poggi also testified that he knew Senator Hart was approximately five minutes behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">Experience of the officer is an appropriate consideration in many cases. \u201cCircumstances and conduct which would not excite the suspicion of the man on the street might be highly significant to an officer who had had extensive training and experience.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Kiefer) </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 807, 827 [91 Cal.Rptr. 729, 742, 478 P.2d 449]. See also <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 372, 582 P.2d 957]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 165.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">Agent Poggi worked for the Secret Service, a federal agency whose clearly enumerated, specific duties have included the protection of United States Presidents since 1901. In 1968, the agency\u2019s duties were expanded to include protection of presidential candidates. Agent Poggi also testified that he had worked over 16,000 hours in the role of an agent protecting designated protectees, and that his formal training included 16 weeks in Secret Service schools in addition to on-the-job training. He testified that in Secret Service school most of the training was for protection, and that in-service training included assassination-prevention training. Agent Poggi had reviewed this assassination-prevention training immediately prior to the 1984 campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">Given Agent Poggi\u2019s extensive training for this type of situation, were the factors he enumerated as the basis for his suspicion sufficient to render the suspicion reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 24\">*Supp. 24</page-number>In many cases, refusal to make eye contact, has been expressly rejected as a \u201cprobable cause\u201d factor. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Loewen, supra, </em>the court said: \u201cAnother factor Deputy Cozart relied on to justify the detention was that the occupants of the truck looked away when they approached. Cozart testified that their failure to continue looking at him was suspicious because \u2018[mjost people have a habit of looking at a patrol car when they pass it.\u2019 However, he admitted that neither man attempted to hide his face or otherwise conceal his identity as the truck passed.\u201d (35 Cal.3d 117, 126.) The facts of the case at bar are distinguishable, however. Here, Special Agent Poggi was not merely in a car on the freeway; he looked directly at respondent, got as close as two feet from respondent, and was obviously a Secret Service agent. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d 159 [215 Cal.Rptr. 101], refusal to look the officer in the eye was, in combination with other criteria, a valid consideration in the formation of objectively reasonable probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">Likewise, nervousness, or fidgeting, have met with skepticism on the part of courts when proposed as elements of probable cause. Taken in conjunction with other articulable factors, however, these factors can be important. \u201cWhile it is true that, <em>taken in isolation, </em>running down the street or the manifestation of nervousness in the presence of a police officer would not constitute adequate grounds to detain a citizen on the street, the combination of circumstances here amounts to considerably more.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 164, italics added.) In that case, manifestation of the defendant\u2019s nervousness included staring at the officer as opposed to avoiding eye contact; his hands were shaking, and he was pale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">Under the combined circumstances of this case, respondent\u2019s refusal to make eye contact with Agent Poggi and his fidgeting were a legitimate part of the formation of a reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Here, we find that in the circumstances of this particular case, the suspicion initially entertained by Agent Poggi was reasonable and articulable, sufficient to support the initial, minimally intrusive, waist-pat search commenced by Poggi, although it did not rise to the level of suspicion necessary for a Terry-type frisk-and-detain, or to the level of probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">\n<em>Was There Cause to Search the Fanny Pack and Arrest?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-8\">Since the initial search of respondent\u2019s waistband area was justified in the opinion of this court, the issue of whether the search of the fanny pack and subsequent arrest of respondent were justified arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">Respondent\u2019s spinning around would not be a legitimate basis on which to ground the finding of probable cause if there was no justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 25\">*Supp. 25</page-number>to initially touch respondent. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Loewen, </em>the court pointed out that there is no duty to cooperate with the police: \u201c[A]n \u2018individual, unless he or she is properly detained and so notified, is as free to avoid [an] officer as to avoid any other person.\u2019 . . . \u2018[A]n <em>outright refusal to cooperate with police </em>officers <em>cannot create adequate grounds for an intrusion which </em>would <em>otherwise be unjustifiable. </em>... If the right to be free from unjustified detentions is lost merely by seeking to avoid such encounters, then the right is meaningless; . . .\u2019\u201d (35 Cal.3d at p. 128, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">In the instant case, this court is of the opinion that the initial intrusion was, in fact, otherwise justifiable, rendering the rule enunciated in <em>Loewen </em>inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">Once respondent violently spun around, Agent Poggi\u2019s objectively reasonable suspicion was heightened, not dissipated. At this point, he continued his around-the-waist pat search for weapons, which had been interrupted by respondent\u2019s spin, telling respondent not to move. Respondent was not free to leave. At this stage, Agent Poggi had reasonable cause to detain and frisk for weapons under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1: there was a safety risk, and the initial suspicion had increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-7\">When the agent felt the hard object in the fanny pack around respondent\u2019s waist, he clearly had full probable cause to unzip the fanny pack. The ensuing unveiling of the gun in respondent\u2019s fanny pack gave rise to probable cause to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-9\">The setting in which the search and arrest of respondent took place was unquestionably one of very high risk. A nationally known candidate for president of the United States was following less than five minutes behind Agent Poggi. Respondent contends that no man\u2019s life is more precious than any other, and that the Constitution takes priority over the safety of any one person. We agree with that contention. But the magnitude of the risk to the Senator\u2019s life is the issue here. The decision in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, was not a declaration that policemen\u2019s lives are any more valuable than any one else\u2019s, but a recognition that in some circumstances, a policeman may be in a position of magnified risk. Likewise, this court believes that Senator Hart was in a position of magnified risk at the time Agent Poggi undertook the pat search of respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-10\">In the absence of precedent for this particular set of circumstances, this court must return to the balancing test analysis set forth in the Fourth Amendment cases cited above. The governmental interest in preventing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 26\">*Supp. 26</page-number>assassinations, or attempted assassinations, was sufficient in light of all the circumstances of this case to justify the pat search of respondent. This limited intrusion is justified by a reasonable suspicion not rising to the level of probable cause,  The factors articulated by Agent Poggi\u2014respondent\u2019s nervousness, fidgeting, refusal to make eye contact, and unusual haircut and dress\u2014considered in conjunction with the high crime situation<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which existed\u2014were sufficient to justify the patdown and search of the fanny pack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">The order granting respondent\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">Dossee, J., and Grant, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1435-11\">All code references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated. The original complaint charged the violation of section 12025, subdivision (b) as a felony in reliance on the theory that respondent had previously been convicted of a crime against property, specifically, a trespass. Respondent filed a demurrer to the complaint, contending that a trespass was not a crime against property within the meaning of section 12025, subdivision (b). This demurrer, along with a common law motion to suppress the gun, was denied. When respondent\u2019s section 995 motion was heard in superior court, he successfully challenged the previous municipal court ruling that a trespass was a crime against property within the meaning of section 12025, subdivision (b). The case was then remanded to municipal court, and the amended complaint was filed. Respondent moved to suppress the gun under section 1538.5; the municipal court judge refused to hear the motion on the ground that a common law motion to suppress the gun had been heard and denied by a municipal court judge at the time that respondent\u2019s demurrer to the complaint was overruled. Respondent secured a writ of mandate from the superior court, the 1538.5 motion was heard, and this appeal followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1435-12\">A \u201crope line\u201d was described by Agent Poggi as any sort of barricade separating the protectee, here Senator Hart, from the public. The barricades used in this case were metal police barricades.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1437-13\">This spin, or turn, was demonstrated for the trial court at the suppression hearing by Agent Poggi and Agent Dale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">The ruling of the court below was as follows: \u201c(The Court): Well, let me tell you this: This case causes me a lot of concern because I was very impressed by the agent. ... I don\u2019t know how to say this with a straight face, but he should be commended for his action and at the same time\u2014I think he performed a valuable service\u2014at the same time ... he said that was in fact a search. There was no articulable facts to say he knew at the time he searched Mr. Carlson that any crime had been committed or was about to be committed .... For my reasoning, so you can have it reviewed, that\u2019s basically the way I perceive it: The fact that he was nervous and wouldn\u2019t look at the agent and he was fidgety, I think it was, and the fact that he didn\u2019t wear the same kind of clothes, that was\u2014I don\u2019t think that was enough actually objectively from my perspective to justify the search. Maybe a stop and detention or something of that nature as in Tony C., but he actually conducted a search. And so my perception of it is that based upon the overall context of the matter I don\u2019t think there was enough to justify the search. I don\u2019t know how to say that . . . from an individual perspective and from the Constitutional perspective, I don\u2019t think there was enough to justify the search.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">This court has also considered the notion that respondent\u2019s waist area was, after a fashion, in plain view; that is, that it could be said that since any member of that crowd could have felt respondent\u2019s waist area, and it was arguably foreseeable that someone in the crowd would bump up against respondent and feel the area around his waist, then Agent Poggi\u2019s touch was limited to areas in \u201cplain view,\u201d accessible by members of the public. The plain view doctrine has a requirement of inadvertence, however, which was not met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">Additionally, the People argue, inter alia, that no search was involved here until after respondent spun around. In other words, the touching of respondent\u2019s waist area was not a \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cdetention\u201d but was a mere \u201ccontact,\u201d which did not implicate Fourth Amendment rights. Here, had all gone according to Poggi\u2019s usual routine, there would have been no detention, since the Secret Service\u2019s practice in this \u201crope line\u201d situation was to touch without detaining. The People argue that what Poggi did in touching respondent\u2019s \u201clove rolls\u201d was something that any citizen in the crowd might have done. The California Supreme Court has been explicit as to the rule on this, however. \u201cIf the individual is stopped or detained because the officer suspects he may be personally involved in some criminal activity, his Fourth Amendment rights are implicated and he is entitled to the safeguards of the rules set forth above. But similar safeguards are not required if the officer acts for other proper reasons .... such as giving aid to persons in distress, mediating domestic quarrels, assisting the elderly or the disabled, [etc.]\u201d <em>(In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 895 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 370, 582 P.2d 957].) The prosecution has the burden of proof if it contends that a stop or detention was for a purpose other than to investigate the defendant as a suspect in criminal activity. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 896.) This burden was not met. Here, the testimony of Agent Poggi shows that respondent was the target; he was approached because he was suspicious looking. He was not approached for some kind of pleasantry. The fact that Agent Poggi did not intend that respondent be aware of the search does not alter this. The contact in this instance, although slight, was sufficient to trigger respondent\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights under the test set forth in <em>Tony C.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1441-10\">In <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cIf this case involved police conduct subject to the Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, we would have to ascertain whether \u2018probable cause\u2019 existed to justify the search and seizure which took place. However, that is not the case. We do not retreat from our holdings that the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure, see, <em>e.g., Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347 [19 L.Ed.2d 576, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 18\">*Supp. 18</page-number>S.Ct. 507] (1967); <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 96 [13 L.Ed.2d 142, 147-148, 85 S.Ct. 223] (1964); <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U.S. 610 [5 L.Ed.2d 828, 81 S.Ct. 776] (1961), or that in most instances failure to comply with the warrant requirement can only be excused by exigent circumstances, see, <em>e.g., Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U.S. 294 [18 L.Ed.2d 782, 87 S.Ct. 1642] (1967) (hot pursuit); cf. <em>Preston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U.S. 364, 367-368 [11 L.Ed.2d <em>777, </em>780-781, 84 S.Ct. 881] (1964). But we deal here with an entire rubric of police conduct\u2014necessarily swift action predicated upon on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat\u2014which historically has not been, and as a practical matter could not be, subjected to the warrant procedure. Instead, the conduct involved in this case must be tested by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 20 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 905] [fn. omitted].)
