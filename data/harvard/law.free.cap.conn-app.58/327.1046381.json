The sole question on appeal is whether the trial court improperly failed to calculate the support order to determine the presumptive support amount pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215a. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">On July 19, 1999, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to modify the amount of child support that he was required to pay to the defendant and ordered a temporary modification. In response to the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration, the court, on August 18, 1999, ordered a farther modification. The record contains neither a written memorandum of decision nor a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the court, regarding the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 64-1. \u201cThe duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. See Practice Book \u00a7 4007 [now \u00a7 61-10] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 607, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). We have frequently declined to review claims where the appellant has failed to provide the court with an adequate record for review. See id., 609; <em>Emigrant Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Erickson, </em>46 Conn. App. 51, 53-54, 696 A.2d 1057, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 921, 701 A.2d 341 (1997). We have, on occasion, reviewed claims of impropriety in the absence of a written memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of an oral decision as long as the transcript contains a sufficiently detailed and concise statement of the court\u2019s findings. See <em>Mikolinski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>55 Conn. App. 691, 699, 740 A.2d 885 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 922, 747 A.2d 518 (2000); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Browder, </em>30 Conn. App. 776, 778-79, 622 A.2d 588 (1993); <em>Banthin </em>v. <em>Shoreline Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp., </em>30 Conn. App. 637, 640, 621 A.2d 769 (1993); cf. <em>Centerbank </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>31 Conn. App. 38, 39-40, 622 A.2d 1066 (1993) (no review because unsigned transcript did not reveal basis of court\u2019s factual conclusions).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Here, the unsigned transcript fails to provide this court with the necessary foundation to determine the propriety of the court\u2019s conclusions without resorting to conjecture and speculation. <em>Alix </em>v. <em>Leech, </em>45 Conn. App. 1, 5, 692 A.2d 1309 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
