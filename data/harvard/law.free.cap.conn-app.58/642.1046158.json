On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that the department had jurisdiction to hear the complaint, (2) concluded that her due process rights were not violated, (3) concluded that the department relied on credible testimony, (4) interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 20-102cc (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as not requiring an element of intent and (5) abused its discretion in denying her motion to present additional evidence. In addition, the plaintiff and the department claim that the court improperly remanded th\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>case to the department. We disagree with both parties and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The following facts found by the department\u2019s hearing officer are necessary to the resolution of this appeal. In August, 1993, the plaintiff was employed as a registered nurse\u2019s aide<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at Shelton Lakes Residence and Health Care Center (Shelton Lakes) in Shelton. On August 18,1993, Shelton Lakes terminated the plaintiffs employment on the basis of allegations of patient abuse and reported the accusations to the department. On April 27, 1994, the department brought formal charges against the plaintiff, alleging that she had violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00cd-3 (c) (1) (A) (ii) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00cd-3 (g) (1) (C) (Sup. V 1993) in that she had abused Vivian Tschauder, a nursing home resident, \u201cby using vulgar and inappropriate language and intimidating the resident [while] rendering incontinent care\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The department notified the plaintiff by letter (dismissal letter) dated May 9,1994, that the charges against her had been dismissed for insufficient evidence. On May 16,1994, Mary C. Crowley, a Shelton Lakes administrator, wrote a letter to Donna Buntaine Brewer, chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>hearing officer at the department, stating, inter alia, that it was Crowley\u2019s understanding \u201cfrom our telephone conversation today, that at no time was the complaining resident interviewed by your department and, therefore, you are reopening the case as of today.\u201d On May 20, 1994, the department notified the plaintiff that it had sent the dismissal letter in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On August 16,1994, the department served the plaintiff with notice of the hearing and the statement of the charges, which the plaintiff, through her attorney, answered on September 4, 1994. A hearing before a department hearing officer was held on December 16, 1994. At the hearing, Tschauder testified, \u201cI was all naked there, and she\u2019s wiping me and she said, \u2018That\u2019s pussy.\u2019 She kept wiping me, wiping me, saying, \u2018Pussy, pussy, pussy,\u2019 all the time I\u2019m\u2014away from it all. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Tschauder testified that she was not afraid of the plaintiff after that incident, but that the plaintiff had frightened her that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In her defense, the plaintiff denied ever physically or verbally abusing Tschauder. The plaintiff testified that on the night before Tschauder made the accusation, the plaintiff had a dispute over an unrelated bath incident with coworker Diane Thorpe, the nurse\u2019s aide who reported the Tschauder allegation to the head nurse. The plaintiff further testified that Thorpe allegedly told her that night that she would \u201cget\u201d the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff also called Crowley and the Shelton Lakes director of nursing, Mary Frances Wolf, to testify. Crowley gave testimony regarding her investigation of the alleged incident with Tschauder and the termination of the plaintiffs employment. Wolf testified regarding Tschauder\u2019s physical condition and mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On January 20, 1995, the hearing officer issued a proposed final decision in which he determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Tschauder\u2019s testimony was more credible than the plaintiffs and that Tschauder \u201chad nothing to gain by fabricating a stoiy, as [the plaintiff s] attorney suggested she was doing. She was consistent in the main points of her testimony on both direct and cross-examinations. She not only told Diane Thorpe, but also Mary Crowley and Mary Frances Wolf what had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On February 15, 1995, the commissioner of public health and addiction services (commissioner) adopted the proposed decision as the final decision in the case. In that decision, the commissioner found that the plaintiff had abused the patient through intimidation, and by using vulgar and inappropriate language. The commissioner, however, sent a letter to the plaintiffs attorney notifying him that the February 15, 1995 final decision had been sent in error because the department had not been notified that the plaintiff had timely requested an opportunity to file exceptions to the proposed final decision of January 20, 1995, and to present oral argument prior to the February 15, 1995 final decision. After both parties filed briefs and oral argument was heard on March 24, 1995, another final decision was issued on April 25, 1995. That decision adopted and incorporated the January 20, 1995 proposed final decision in which the healing officer determined that patient abuse had occurred solely on the basis of the use of vulgar and inappropriate language. Furthermore, the commissioner\u2019s decision stated that \u201ca finding of resident abuse [shall] be listed on the Connecticut Nurse Aide Registry [registry], and that this final decision [shall] be filed in the registry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The plaintiff thereafter appealed from the department\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., claiming that the department (1) lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint, (2) violated her due process rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(3) relied on testimony that lacked credibility and (4) exceeded its statutory authority by finding that vulgar and inappropriate language constituted abuse. The court sustained the plaintiffs appeal on the sole ground that the plaintiffs substantial rights were prejudiced by the department\u2019s determination of resident abuse without the requisite finding that the plaintiffs use of vulgar and inappropriate language had an adverse affect on the patient. The court remanded the case to the department for further proceedings on the existing record to state its findings as to whether the language at issue had an adverse impact on Tschauder. From that judgment, the present appeal and cross appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly concluded that the department had jurisdiction to proceed against her on the alleged violations of federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. . . . A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. . . . It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\u201cThis concept, however, is not limited to courts. Administrative agencies [such as the department] are tribunals of limited jurisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. . . . We have recognized that [i]t is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. ... It cannot modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions, under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\u201c[0]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, [it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented . . . and the court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction, unlike jurisdiction of the person, cannot be created through consent or waiver.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4-5, 675 A.2d 845 (1996). \u201cWe . . . note that, because [a] determination regarding . . . subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. </em>v. <em>Branford, </em>247 Conn. 407, 410, 722 A.2d 271 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the department attempted to grant itself jurisdiction to prosecute her for alleged violations of federal law since the statement of charges<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against her alleged only violations of federal law. The plaintiff argues that neither \u00a7 20-102cc (a) nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>any of the state statutes and regulations cited in the statement of charges provided the department with authorization to prosecute alleged violations of federal law. Furthermore, the plaintiff argues that although the department theoretically could have relied on \u00a7 20-102cc (a), it committed itself to seeking enforcement of only federal law and therefore is now precluded from asserting \u00a7 20-102cc (a) to supply jurisdiction. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The statement of charges that the department issued against the plaintiff expressly stated that the department was acting pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 \u201c19a-9, 19a-14, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00cd-3 (g) (1) (C) (Sup. V 1993).\u201d The provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 19a-14 (c), as amended by Public Acts 93-121, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> incorporate by reference the provisions of chapter 378a of our General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 20-102aa through 20-102ff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff is correct in pointing out that the department cited to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\u00cd-3 (g) (1) (C) (Sup. V 1993),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that reference did not destroy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>jurisdiction of the department over this case. In actuality, that provision sets forth the states\u2019 responsibility for assuring quality of care at skilled nursing facilities, including the investigation of allegations of resident neglect and abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">In addition, the plaintiff relies on <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988), and <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Medical Examining Board, </em>208 Conn. 492, 545 A.2d 1080 (1988), for the proposition that the legislature did not grant the department authority to prosecute violations of federal law. Although those cases analyzed whether an administrative agency lacked subject matter jurisdiction, both are factually distinguishable. In <em>Castro, </em>our Supreme Court held that the existence of an employee-employer relationship is a jurisdictional fact that must be shown before the workers\u2019 compensation commission can proceed with a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-297. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 427-35. Likewise, in <em>Stem, </em>our Supreme Court stated, \u201cIn the administrative context, a proper claim for relief serves the equally vital function of establishing the jurisdictional authority of the tribunal. . . . Just recently, we held that the existence of an employee-employer relationship is a jurisdictional fact that must be shown in order to proceed with a claim for workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>compensation benefits. [Id.], 427-35. Similarly, the death of a decedent is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the administration of an estate in probate proceedings. <em>Ruick </em>v. <em>Twarkins, </em>171 Conn. 149, 153, 367 A.2d 1380 (1976). These cases stand for the principle that certain jurisdictional facts are essential to establish the statutory jurisdiction of tribunals of limited authority. The existence of these facts is fundamental to the power to entertain and adjudicate a proceeding on the merits. In short, such facts condition the power to act. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>supra, 434.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Medical Examining Board, </em>supra, 501-502.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Unlike the situations in <em>Castro </em>and <em>Stern, </em>there is no missing jurisdictional fact in this case that would subvert the department\u2019s jurisdiction. There is no question that the plaintiff was a registered nurse\u2019s aide subject to the authority of the department at the time the statement of charges and notice of hearing were issued. Section 20-102cc (a) clearly gave the department jurisdiction in the present matter. The plaintiff mischaracterizes the statement of charges to indicate that the department was acting under federal law. We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>with the trial court, however, that the department incorporated by reference \u00a7 20-102cc (a) and, therefore, had jurisdiction under a valid state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Finally, we disagree with the plaintiff that although the department theoretically could have relied on \u00a7 20-102cc (a), it committed itself to seeking enforcement only of federal law and is now, therefore, precluded from asserting \u00a7 20-102cc (a) to supply jurisdiction. As stated previously, because the department incorporated by reference \u00a7 20-102cc (a) in its original statement of charges, we conclude that the department was acting strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the department\u2019s failure to promulgate regulations defining abuse by nurse\u2019s aides resulted in ad hoc decision making that violated her state and federal constitutional rights to due process. Furthermore, the plaintiff argues that the department\u2019s reliance on three of its unpublished decisions to find that verbal abuse constituted \u201cresident abuse\u201d was invalid rule making. Essentially, the plaintiff contends that (1) her procedural due process rights were violated and (2) that the term \u201cresident abuse\u201d in \u00a7 20-102cc (a) is too vague to give notice of what type of conduct constitutes abuse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">\u201cThe fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits any state from depriving any person of \u2018life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u2019 Article one, section eight of our state constitution contains the same prohibition and is given the same effect as the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>173 Conn. 506, 516, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Ct. 1226, 55 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978).\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 71-72, 434 A.2d 333 (1980), on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>231 Conn. 308, 649 A.2d 534 (1994). Our analysis of the plaintiffs claim therefore encompasses both of these provisions, as well as the provisions of the UAPA. \u201c[T]his court has held repeatedly that the procedures required by the UAPA exceed the minimal procedural safeguards mandated by the due process clause. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 356-57, 542 A.2d 672 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cAdministrative due process requires, in its essence, that a party be given notice of the case against him and an opportunity to be heard by a fair and impartial body. The procedure must be tailored, in light of the decision to be made, to the circumstances of those who are to be heard to insure that the hearing is, in fact, meaningful. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 349, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); <em>Pagano </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>4 Conn. App. 1, 6-7, 492 A.2d 197 (1985).\u201d <em>Altholtz </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>4 Conn. App. 307, 313, 493 A.2d 917 (1985). \u201cThe \u2018root requirement\u2019 of the due process clause is that the state actor afford individuals notice and an opportunity for a hearing before depriving them of their property interests.\u201d <em>Connecticut Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 298, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989), citing <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The record discloses that the board scrupulously adhered to the requirements of the statute, including notice and a fall hearing. Accordingly, the court properly concluded that the procedure used in this case protected the plaintiffs constitutional due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The plaintiff argues that the term \u201cresident abuse\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 20-102cc (a) fails to inform her of the type of conduct that could result in the commissioner entering a finding in the nurse aide registry. The crux of the plaintiffs argument is that the department\u2019s failure to adopt regulations defining and interpreting resident abuse, accompanied by its reliance on several unpublished decisions, resulted in a violation of her due process rights because she could not know that her alleged actions constituted resident abuse within the meaning of \u00a7 20-102cc (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\u201cThe terms of a statute which is penal in nature; see <em>Brazo </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>177 Conn. 515, 526, 418 A.2d 883 (1979); \u2018must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties.\u2019 <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 297, 106 A.2d 152, appeal dismissed, 348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 125, 99 L. Ed. 693 (1954). In applying this test, we look at the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>183 Conn. 17, 19, 438 A.2d 1165 (1981). Generally, if a practical or sensible effect may be given to such a statute, it will be sustained. <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>supra [297].\u201d <em>Altholtz </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>supra, 4 Conn. App. 314. \u201cA statute is not void for vagueness unless it clearly and unequivocally is unconstitutional, making every presumption in favor of its validity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 322, 732 A.2d 144 (1999). To demonstrate that \u00a7 20-102cc (a) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to her, the plaintiff therefore \u201cmust . . . demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that [she] had inadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [she] was the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 591, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\u201cBecause perfect precision is neither possible nor required . . . the [vagueness] doctrine does not mandate the invalidation of all imprecisely drafted statutes. . . . While some ambiguous statutes are the result of poor draftsmanship, it is apparent that in many instances the uncertainty is merely attributable to a desire not to nullify the purpose of the legislation by the use of specific terms which would afford loopholes through which many could escape.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Our Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[c]ivil statutes must be definite in their meaning and application, but may survive a vagueness challenge by a lesser degree of specificity than in criminal statutes. . . . Due process requires that a statute afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 60, 444 A.2d 225 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In the present case, the language of \u00a7 20-102cc (a) is sufficiently explicit to inform registered nurse\u2019s aides what conduct on their part will render them subject to its penalties. Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121, \u00a7 4, which went into effect on June 14, 1993, and subsequently was codified as \u00a7 20-102cc (a), provides in relevant part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that \u201c[t]he department of health services shall receive, investigate, and prosecute complaints against individuals who are providing or have provided services as a nurse\u2019s aide in a chronic and convalescent nursing home or rest home with nursing supervision. The grounds for complaint shall include resident abuse, resident neglect, misappropriation of resident property, and fraud or deceit in obtaining or attempting to obtain a registration as a nurse\u2019s aide. ...\u201d Furthermore, \u00a7 20-102cc (a) provides that \u201c [t]he commissioner shall have the authority to render a finding and enter such finding on the registry against\u201d a nurse\u2019s aide.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\u201cTerms associated with the trade or business with which a given statute is concerned should be accorded the meaning which they would convey to an informed person in that trade or business. <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 357, 422 A.2d 268 (1979). We presume that members of [the department of public health] are competent to decide on the basis of such terms whether certain conduct is in derogation of professional standards. See <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 349, 64 A.2d 330 (1949).\u201d <em>Altholtz </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>supra, 4 Conn. App. 314. It is our view that what constitutes \u201cresident abuse\u201d and what findings should be placed on the registry to support such abuse are to be determined \u201cby those standards which are commonly accepted by those practicing the same profession in the same territory.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 88-89, 411 A.2d 42 (1979), quoting <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>289 N.Y. 148, 158, 44 N.E.2d 405 (1942). \u201cThese standards are part of the ethics of the profession, and every member of the profession should be regarded as an expert with regard to the determination of their meaning. <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>supra, 89.\u201d <em>Altholtz </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>supra, 315. The plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that she had inadequate notice of what was prohibited. This court is therefore of the opinion that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cresident abuse\u201d afforded the plaintiff, a person of ordinary intelligence, a reasonable opportunity to know that it encompassed all types of abuse, including verbal abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">To decide whether the plaintiff was the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, we must turn to the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 20-102cc (a) and 20-102ee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cwe may add interpretive gloss to a challenged statute in order to render it constitutional. ...

In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 115, 717 A.2d 117 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The legislative history in the present case lends support to our conclusion that the department, not the legislature, should determine and apply the professional standards in the nursing aide profession in determining if a registered nurse\u2019s aide committed an infraction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The legislative history surrounding \u00a7\u00a7 20-102cc (a) and 20-102ee indicates that the legislature contemplated having mandatory regulations requiring the department to specifically delineate, inter alia, what constitutes resident abuse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, the legislature, by enacting Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121, drafted legislation that not only allowed the department to promulgate regulations if it deemed them necessary, but also vested it with the authority to determine abuse on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Because we conclude that the legislature vested the department with the authority to determine cases on a case-by-case basis, we conclude that the plaintiff was not the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. For this reason, we disagree with the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>contention that the department improperly relied on three of its unpublished decisions in determining that the plaintiff committed resident abuse. The department\u2019s reliance on those decisions did not amount to what the plaintiff claims to be invalid rule making.

In addition, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly applied the correct standard of review, the substantial evidence standard, in upholding the department\u2019s decision on this issue. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">\u201cWe begin our analysis by noting that our review of an agency\u2019s factual determination is constrained by the [UAPA]. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) mandates that a court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are . . . clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record .... We have interpreted the standard of review set forth in the act as limiting our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>such that [w]ith regard to questions of fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 57, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991); see <em>DiBlasi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 823, 829-30, 624 A. 2d 372 (1993).

App. 466, 470, 704 A.2d 827 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The plaintiff has failed to point to anything in the record from which we can conclude that Tschauder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>testimony was not credible. The hearing officer made numerous findings concerning Tschauder\u2019s testimony. Among those findings were that Tschauder was not fabricating her side of the incident, that she had no motive to make trouble for the plaintiff, and that she was consistent with her statements on both direct and cross-examinations. Most importantly, the hearing officer specifically found that Tschauder\u2019s testimony was more credible than the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiff introduced evidence that Tschauder suffered from numerous medical ailments, the hearing officer found Tschauder\u2019s testimony to be credible. Thus, we conclude that the court properly determined that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the department\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In addition, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly applied the substantial evidence standard of review in upholding the department\u2019s decision. In addressing the plaintiffs claim that the record lacked substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s finding that Tschauder was a credible witness, the court concluded that there was nothing in the record to show that the hearing officer\u2019s assessment of her reliability as a witness was clearly erroneous. The court was therefore correct in applying the substantial evidence standard of review to the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In her next claim, the plaintiff contends that the court improperly interpreted \u00a7 20-102cc (a) as not requiring an element of intent.

The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is devoid of any reference to this claim. Although the plaintiff argued to the trial court that resident abuse \u201chas to involve an element of specific harm or injury,\u201d she did not specifically address the issue of whether \u00a7 20-102cc (a) requires the element of intent. We decline, therefore, to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the court abused its discretion in denying her motion to present additional evidence pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (h).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cAn appeal from an administrative tribunal should ordinarily be determined upon the record of that tribunal, and only when that record fails to present the hearing in a manner sufficient for the determination of the merits of the appeal, or when some extraordinary reason requires it, should the court hear evidence. . . . The question whether additional testimony should be taken by the court calls for an exercise of the court\u2019s legal discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Tarasovic </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>147 Conn. 65, 69-70, 157 A.2d 103 (1959); <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>40 Conn.

[E]very reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . .

In the present case, the plaintiff sought the court\u2019s permission to present evidence that Tschauder testified falsely, that the testimony of the witnesses from Shelton Lakes was unreliable, and evidence that Tschauder\u2019s medical and mental condition made her testimony unreliable. In her motion to present additional evidence, the plaintiff contended that she had failed to present the evidence at the hearing before the department because it was newly discovered and because of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Although the court found that most of this evidence was material, it concluded that there was no good reason for the plaintiff not to have presented it at the prior hearing. The court found that there was nothing in the plaintiffs motion to show that the evidence could not have been presented to the department at the prior proceeding. Furthermore, the court stated that although the plaintiff \u201cclaims that her lawyer is to blame for not presenting this evidence, the court cannot find that as a matter of law ineffective assistance of counsel before an administrative agency constitutes a good reason under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (h).\u201d On the basis of the record, we are unable to conclude that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Both the plaintiff and the department claim, for different reasons, that the court improperly remanded the case to the department. The plaintiff argues that the court improperly remanded the case to the department to state its finding whether, on the existing record, the vulgar and inappropriate language used by the plaintiff had some adverse impact on or harmed the victim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that because the allegation of intimidation was specifically rejected by the commissioner, the court, as a matter of law, should have concluded that there was no adverse impact and, thus, no resident abuse. The department argues that the court should not have remanded the case to the department on the issue of whether the victim was adversely impacted by the plaintiffs vulgar language. In essence, the department claims the court improperly applied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>subjective test in assessing whether there was an adverse impact on the victim. The department contends that the court should have applied an objective test, and concluded that any reasonable person would be adversely impacted by the words and actions of the plaintiff. We disagree with the claims made by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\u201cThe standard of review of an agency decision is well established. Ordinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference. . . . [I]t is for the courts, and not administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642-43, 708 A.2d 202 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 389, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998). Because our courts have not yet had occasion to construe the language of \u00a7 20-102cc (a), our standard of review is plenary.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument that the use of vulgar and inappropriate language could not have an adverse impact on the victim because the department rejected a finding of intimidation has no merit. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>confuses the findings made by the department and the conclusions reached by the court on appeal. Although the court sustained the plaintiffs appeal, it concluded that vulgar and inappropriate language could constitute resident abuse. The court, however, read the term \u201cresident abuse\u201d in \u00a7 20-102cc (a) to require some type of adverse impact on the affected patient. Since the department failed to make such a finding, the court remanded the case to the department to state its finding on that issue. Whether the department and the commissioner previously rejected a finding that the plaintiff intimidated the victim is, therefore, irrelevant to the issue of whether the victim suffered some type of harm from the plaintiffs vulgar and inappropriate statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On its cross appeal, the department argues that the court improperly remanded the case on the issue of whether the victim suffered some \u201cphysical, mental or emotional\u201d adverse impact. In essence, the department argues that this type of \u201csubjective test\u201d is improper. In addition, the department contends that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the department\u2019s finding of resident abuse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">One of the main goals of our legislature in enacting Public Acts 93-121 was to protect the \u201cfrail elderly who are receiving services in nursing homes where abusive aides are engaging in some type of inappropriate behavior or misconduct.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1993 Sess., p. 3039, remarks of Representative Joseph D. Courtney. As stated in part II B of this opinion, it was the intent of the legislature that the department should make case-by-case determinations on the issue of whether a nurse\u2019s aide has abused a resident patient. It is the opinion of the court that this type of a case-by-case determination should be conducted with the personal and individual sensitivities of the particular patient kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>in mind. The department argues that a subjective test fails to protect patients lacking cognitive abilities because they are unable to recognize that potential abuse is being committed against them. It may be the case, in some situations, that an objective test would be more effective than a subjective test. For example, a factual scenario may be envisioned in which a comatose, unconscious or mentally disabled patient is verbally abused in the same manner as was the victim in this case. In such a situation, an objective test may be more appropriate.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">As we have explained, we are not presented with such a situation in this case. Because we believe that in most situations, including the present one, a subjective test would be most effective in determining whether an abused resident suffered some type of \u201cadverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>impact,\u201d we reject the department\u2019s claim that the court improperly remanded the case for additional proceedings. We further conclude that the remand was proper because although there was substantial evidence in the record suggesting that the plaintiff verbally abused the victim, there were insufficient findings as to whether the victim suffered some type of harm or adverse impact as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In this opinion O\u2019CONNELL, C. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-5\"> On July 1, 1995, the department of public health and addiction services became known as the department of public health.

In short, we conclude that the narrowly drawn prayer for relief rendered the case subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Medical Examining Board, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> The plaintiff claims that the department was entitled to adopt regulations pursuant to Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121, \u00a7 6, which went into effect on June 14, 1993, and provides: \u201cThe commissioner of health services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 of the general statutes, concerning the regulation of nurse\u2019s aides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Subsection 6 of Public Acts 93-121 subsequently was codified as General Statutes \u00a7 20-102ee.

Peck, the director of the division of medical quality assurance in the department of health services, testified regarding Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121. In an exchange between Representative Lenny T. Winkler and Peck, Winkler questioned Peck on why it was not mandatory for the department to promulgate regulations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c[Stanley K. Peck]: Well, we didn\u2019t make it shall because we didn\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t anticipate anything specific at this point in time that we really need to address in regulations, but by providing the authority to do it down the road, you know, we would\u2014in the event, for example, federal mandates may change, then we\u2019d have the authority. We wouldn\u2019t have to come back to the legislature, but right now there isn\u2019t anything that we are aware of above and beyond that we need to put into the law in order to make it work. So we\u2019ve just left it open-ended for the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201c[Representative Winkler]: But yet if somebody is supposed to adhere to a certain set of rules, shouldn\u2019t they be spelled out so they know what they are\u2014?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201c[Peck]: Well, the rules\u2014the standard that people are supposed to adhere to is spelled out in the federal law and reiterated here in the state law, and that is that in terms of this statute, we can take action for abuse, neglect, theft of patient property or presentation of fraudulent credentials in the course of getting on the registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">\u201cThose things are consistent with what the grounds are that are set forth in the federal law and we\u2019re not going any further than that, and <em>what constitutes abuse or neglect in any given situation is really a matter that\u2019s decided on a case-by-case basis and given definition by the hearing officer who is charged with hearing the case and adjudicating it.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health, Pt. 5,1993 Sess., pp. 1710-11.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b684-8\"> The plaintiff also contends that the hearing officer should not have considered the victim\u2019s testimony without first requiring medical evidence of her competency and that the hearing officer\u2019s failure to do so was an abuse of discretion. We find no merit to this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (h) provides: \u201cIf, before the date set for hearing on the merits of an appeal, application is made to the court for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken before the agency upon conditions determined by the court. The agency may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\"> The plaintiff alternatively argues that the court improperly remanded the case to the department on the existing record. We disagree. Almost seven years have passed since the incident occurred. Because both the plaintiff and the department already have had an opportunity at the previous hearing to present evidence and call witnesses, it is unlikely that any additional relevant evidence could be produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> The dissent argues that an \u201cobjective test would better serve all parties in this and other such cases.\u201d As we have already acknowledged, an objective test, in some cases, would be more effective. In the present case and in most situations, however, a subjective test is best suited to determine whether a patient has been the victim of resident abuse. Our legislature enacted legislation designed to protect the frail elderly in nursing homes. With that in mind, we cannot ignore the fact that a subjective test is superior to an objective test in ascertaining whether a <em>competent </em>resident suffered some type of harm or adverse impact because the subjective test focuses directly on the victim. Justice would not be served if we ignored the legislative intent of \u00a7 20-102cc by moving the focus of our analysis away from the victim and establishing a test that is predicated on the assumption that most residents in nursing homes are not competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The dissent quotes <em>Kentucky Board of Nursing </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>890 S.W.2d 641, 644 (Ky. App. 1994), for the proposition that a nursing home is a place \u201cwhere the vast majority of patients are infirm due to advance age.\u201d We disagree that such a generalization can be the basis for crafting a rule of law. It is true that at some point in time, most of us will experience the effects of the aging process. Those of us who turn to nursing homes to alleviate the burden of this process, however, are not always incompetent. In this very case, the plaintiff gave competent testimony at the hearing regarding the night in question and how she was affected by the plaintiff\u2019s conduct. Applying an objective test to the present facts not only diminishes the focus on the specific harm the victim testified she felt, but also creates the insurmountable task of having others, i.e. reasonable people, try to evaluate something only the victim could have felt, self-degradation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b693-7\">SCHALLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARC\">dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion on the issue concerning the remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both parties claim on appeal that a remand is improper, although for different reasons. As the majority notes, the plaintiff contends that the trial court, applying a subjective test, should have concluded as a matter of law that no adverse impact was established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>because the department of public health and addiction services (department)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rejected the only allegation of harm, namely, intimidation of the patient. The department argues that the court should have applied an objective test to assess whether there was an adverse impact on the victim and that, under that test, the record establishes an adverse impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court determined that an element of whether resident abuse occurred is an explicit finding as to \u201chow or if such language affected the patient.\u201d The court stated that its \u201cinterpretation of resident abuse under [General Statutes \u00a7 20-102cc (a)]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> includes some form of adverse impact, whether physical, mental or emotional, upon the resident. This accords with the policy behind [\u00a7 20-102cc (a)]: To protect the frail and elderly [who] reside in long-term facilities from mental and physical mistreatment by the staff.\u201d Neither the plaintiff nor the department takes issue with this determination. After concluding that a specific finding of adverse impact was required, the court ruled that such adverse impact should be determined on the basis of the subjective perceptions and reactions of the resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The majority identifies the key issue here as whether a subjective test or an objective test is appropriate to determine whether resident abuse has caused adverse impact on a particular resident. The majority agrees with the trial court\u2019s determination that a subjective test is appropriate for this purpose and that a remand is necessary so that the department can engage in further fact-finding on the basis of the existing record on the issue of adverse impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>This is an issue of first impression, and no Connecticut precedent has been furnished or found to guide us in our determination of whether a subjective test or an objective test should be applied. While I understand the reasons supporting the majority\u2019s choice of a subjective test, I respectfully submit that an objective test would better serve all parties in this and other such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The department recites numerous reasons why an objective test is preferable to a subjective test. I believe those reasons are well founded in experience and common wisdom. A subjective test would mean that comatose or unconscious residents, or patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other diseases causing loss of cognitive functioning would be unable to express subjective responses to claimed abuse. If a victim had diminished capacity to hear or comprehend particular conduct, no abuse could be established because no harm in the subjective sense could be established. The department argues that \u201can objective test is required in identifying abusive conduct regardless of the resident\u2019s ability to perceive because of the patently deleterious impact such conduct would have on other residents and staff. In other words, unchecked abusive conduct directed at residents who cannot perceive it nevertheless would inevitably result in the creation of a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 within any given nursing facility.\u201d Finally, an objective test eliminates the difficulties of proof when the victims have mental deficits or have died before the hearing process is completed. On the other hand, as the Kentucky Court of Appeals pointed out in a similar case, \u201cMany times, the aging process reduces otherwise active, alert, and oriented patients to varying degrees or states of confusion or dementia. It is no secret that many people experience a reversion to childlike behavior in their later years. This is a condition commonly witnessed in a nursing home setting where the vast majority of patients are infirm due to advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>age. It is also no secret, as undesirable as it may be, that oftentimes a stem tone of voice becomes necessary to get a patient\u2019s attention or to impress upon him the need to follow instructions or exercise caution, much the way as is often necessary in dealing with young children.\u201d <em>Kentucky Board of Nursing </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>890 S.W.2d 641, 644 (Ky. App. 1994). If a subjective test is in place, nurses and nurse\u2019s aides would be vulnerable to liability on the basis of claims of adverse impact by complainants whose reactions and responses might well be unduly affected or altered by their particular mental or emotional condition and which might, as a result, be unpredictable or arbitrary, resulting in a disproportionate penalty for the conduct of the caregiver in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">For these reasons, an objective test for adverse impact would provide greater fairness and consistency for all parties involved in the process, residents and nurse\u2019s aides alike. Accordingly, I would adopt the standard of an objective test that is consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose of \u00a7 20-102cc (a), that is, whether an alert and rational person in the resident\u2019s position, taking into account all the circumstances existing, would have experienced physical harm, pain or mental anguish as a result of the specific conduct of the nurse\u2019s aide.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In this case, the parties should have an opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning whether any adverse impact was produced by the conduct of the plaintiff on the basis of the application of an objective test. The department hearing officer should be directed to give full and reasoned consideration to all material facts and issues in determining whether any adverse impact could reasonably be determined to result from the plaintiffs conduct, which consisted of the use on one occasion of vulgar and inappropriate language, under all the circumstances surrounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>incident. See <em>Hearns </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Dept. of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs, </em>704 A.2d 1181 (D.C. App. 1997); <em>Kentucky Board of Nursing </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>supra, 890 S.W.2d 643 (\u201c[w]hat must be questioned is whether, given <em>all </em>the facts . . . reasonable men would have been induced to convict [the nurse] of verbal abuse based on her comment to [the resident], a consideration of all the facts, and application of the pertinent statutes\u201d [emphasis in original]). As one judge has noted, \u201c[T]he issue before us is a difficult one, and . . . too much is at stake here for this court to permit [the plaintiffs] livelihood to be destroyed or impaired without a . . . reasoned application by the agency of the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Hearns </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Dept. of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs, </em>supra, 1186 (Schwelb, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion as to the remand to the trial court. I would order the trial court to remand this case to the department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-8\"> The plaintiff raises numerous troubling issues in her appeal. In particular, the issue of intent or wilfulness, discussed in part IV of the majority opinion, would deserve consideration had it been properly preserved in the trial court proceedings. See <em>Hearns </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Dept. of Consumer &amp; Regulatory Affairs, </em>704 A.2d 1181, 1182-83 (D.C. App. 1997) (discussing petitioner\u2019s claim that government failed to establish she either wilfully or intentionally abused resident).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Furthermore, although I agree with the majority that the language of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121, \u00a7 4, which went into effect on June 14, 1993, and subsequently was codified as General Statutes \u00a7 20-102cc (a), was adequate to inform the plaintiff of the type of conduct that could result in the commissioner of public health making a finding of resident abuse, the plaintiffs argument does not go unheard. The Connecticut legislature gave the commissioner the authority pursuant to Public Acts 1993, No. 93-121, \u00a7 6, subsequently codified as General Statutes \u00a7 20-102ee, to adopt regulations concerning the regulation of nurse\u2019s aides. Other states have specifically adopted measures identifying the behavior that constitutes resident abuse. See, e.g., <em>Gogebic Medical Care Facility </em>v. <em>AFSCME Local 992, AFL-CIO, </em>209 Mich. App. 693, 695, 531 N.W.2d 728, appeal denied, 450 Mich. 951, 549 N.W.2d 560 (1995). Because the issue of what constitutes resident abuse is a difficult, one, I believe that the commissioner should consider adopting regulations to give nurse\u2019s aides, such as the plaintiff, more precise notice of the type of conduct that is inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The department of public health and addiction services is now known as the department of public health.
