We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In early 1995, while employed as a graphics arts teacher at a vocational school in Hamden operated by the defendant Area Cooperative Educational Services (school), the plaintiff sustained injuries when he tried to stop a fight between students. The plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and was granted temporary total disability benefits for an injury to his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Approximately seven months later, on September 7, 1995, the defendants submitted a form 36 to the commissioner, stating that the plaintiff no longer was entitled to benefits for his neck injury. The form 36 was approved by a commissioner on September 27, 1995, thereby allowing the defendants to discontinue payments to the plaintiff. The plaintiff never sought a formal hearing to dispute this discontinuation of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In July, 1997, the defendants asked the plaintiff to sign a voluntary agreement. The voluntary agreement form lists the plaintiffs neck as the injured part of his body, but goes on to note that \u201c[d]isc, teeth, heart, hip and upper leg are additional injuries still in dispute.\u201d The plaintiff signed the voluntary agreement on July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>11, 1997, and it was approved by a commissioner on July 18, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">On May 1, 1998, more than two and one-half years after the approval of the form 36, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court a pleading titled, \u201cMotion That Execution be Ordered in Compliance With an Approved Workers\u2019 Compensation Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants thereafter filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss and Objection to Plaintiffs Motion for Order of Execution.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>after a hearing, denied the plaintiffs motion in a memorandum of decision, stating, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he matter continues to be the subject of contested proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation commission, which has not rendered any final decision in the matter. . . . This court declines to operate as a kind of court of interlocutory appeals for workers\u2019 compensation matters.\u201d* ** 4 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">At the outset, the plaintiff claims that the court, in denying his motion for an order of execution, improperly concluded that \u201cit had no power to consider it.\u201d The defendants, however, contend that the court\u2019s decision was \u201cstatutorily left\u201d to the court\u2019s discretion and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>its exercise of that discretion should not be disturbed unless that discretion was abused. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In making his argument on this threshold issue, the plaintiff maintains that the court had \u201cnot only the right, but also the duty, to exercise its jurisdiction and render a decision on the merits of [his] application to enforce the final and binding voluntary agreement,\u201d as it had sole jurisdiction over the matter and its jurisdiction had been invoked properly. He also argues that the court\u2019s authority to hear and determine the merits of his motion is derived from two provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., i.e., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-296<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>31-300.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He contends further that \u201c[t]aken together, these statutes allow a claimant to enforce accrued but unpaid benefits that are due under an approved voluntary agreement, either by an action at law or by execution, in the same manner as a Superior Court judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We begin by noting that the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the issuance of executions on a judgment of the Superior Court. For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>under General Statutes \u00a7 52-350\u00cd authority is given for the enforcement of a money judgment as applied to the act. Section 31-296, titled, \u201cVoluntary Agreements,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c[The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner] shall retain the original [voluntary] agreement, with his approval thereof, in his office and, if an application is made to the superior court for an execution, he shall, upon the request of said court, file in the court a certified copy of the agreement and his statement of approval thereof. . . .\u201d In relevant part, \u00a7 31-300 provides that in the event that either party does not appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision within ten days after the decision has been made, \u201csuch award shall be final and <em>may </em>be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the Superior Court. The [Superior] court <em>may </em>issue execution upon any uncontested or final award of a commissioner in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the Superior Court; and, upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the commissioner in whose office the award is on file <em>shall, </em>upon the request of the clerk of said court, send to him a certified copy of such findings and award. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is no question, therefore, that the Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction in this matter and may issue an order of execution as provided for in \u00a7 31-300. The Superior Court \u201chas \u2018general subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>227 Conn. 175, 195, 629 A.2d 1116 (1993).\u2019 \u201d <em>Second Injury Fund </em>v. <em>Lupachino, </em>45 Conn. App. 324, 345, 695 A.2d 1072 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u201cThe construction of a judgment is a question of law for the court. See 49 C.J.S., Judgments \u00a7 436; see also <em>Grasso </em>v. <em>Frattolillo, </em>111 Conn. 209, 212, 149 A. 838 (1930); see generally <em>Jordan, Marsh &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>67 Conn. 473, 479, 35 A. 521 (1896).

The determinative factor is the intention of the court as gathered from all parts of the judgment. <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Scoville, </em>supra; 3 Stephenson, supra.

Effect must be given to that which is clearly implied as well as to that which is expressed. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>158 N.W.2d 712, 713 (Iowa 1968), quoting <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>237 Iowa 655, 663, 23 N.W.2d 435 (1946). The judgment should admit of a consistent construction as a whole. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>153 Conn. 242, 245, 215 A.2d 402 (1965).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>197 Conn. 189, 196-97, 496 A.2d 491 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">It is evident that the court was aware that the agreement stated, in prominent print, \u201cTHIS IS NOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT,\u201d and that the matter continued to be pending before the commissioner, who, as the court stated in its memorandum of decision, \u201c[had] not rendered any final decision in the matter.\u201d This being so, the court further stated that \u201cthis court declines to operate as a kind of court of interlocutory appeals for workers\u2019 compensation matters.\u201d The \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT\u201d language is that of a \u201cdisclaimer,\u201d which has been defined as a \u201c \u2018refusal to recognize the existence of an obligation. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>(3d Ed. 1969).\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattegat </em>v. <em>Klopfenstein, </em>50 Conn. App. 97, 103, 717 A.2d 276, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 922, 722 A.2d 810 (1998). Significantly, this language was on the very document that the plaintiff claims embodies the \u201cdefendants\u2019 admitted liability\u201d for his neck injury, \u201cwhich had been conclusively established by execution and approval by the voluntary agreement.\u201d The plaintiff, however, has not demonstrated the impact of this \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Our standard for review of the court\u2019s action is whether it abused its discretion in denying the issuance of the requested execution. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East </em>Haven, 208 Conn. 576, 588, 546 A.2d 243 (1988); <em>Goodlatte </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>27 Conn. Sup. 382, 385, 239 A.2d 546 (1967). It is true that the Superior Court was the appropriate entity to grant or deny the execution, and in being the appropriate entity to do so it had discretion. This is because the procedural vehicle for allowing the Superior Court to grant or deny an order of execution is found in \u00a7 31-300 of the act. Not only does \u00a7 31-300 use the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d interchangeably in a number of places, but those words also appear in the very portion of \u00a7 31-300 that states that the Superior Court \u201cmay\u201d issue an order of execution in an appropriate case. \u201c[The] use of \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may\u2019 in the same statute, which is commonly mandatory and directory in connotation, is a factor that evidences affirmative selectivity of terms with specific intent to be distinctive in meaning. The words \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may\u2019 must then be assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978); <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 (1967).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Builders Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 304-305, 545 A.2d 530 (1988). Our Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in an appeal involving an application for an order of execution under \u00a7 31-300, stated that a trial judge has the authority to deny an application for an order of execution. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>East Haven, </em>supra, 588.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The deferential \u201cmay\u201d employed by the legislature in the relevant portion of \u00a7 31-300 referred to recognizes the legislative intent to permit the Superior Court the discretion to grant or deny such an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The court in this case did exercise its discretion. In recognizing that this matter continues to be the subject of contested proceedings before the commissioner, the court stated in its memorandum of decision that it \u201cdeclines to operate as a kind of court of interlocutory appeals.\u201d We note the significance of that statement when taken in context. First, in stating that it \u201cdeclines to operate as a kind of court of interlocutory appeals,\u201d the court indicated that it had affirmatively acted in the matter before it and demonstrated that it exercised the discretion that it has. The court then used that discretion to deny the motion for execution. Next, the court refused to act in an \u201cinterlocutory\u201d fashion. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) defines \u201cinterlocutory\u201d to mean \u201cnot constituting a final resolution of the whole controversy.\u201d The court was asked by the plaintiff to act favorably in a matter in which it was patently declared on the face of the document that the agreement was \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cJudges are presumed to know the law . . . and to apply it correctly.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colonial Carpets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carpet Fair, Inc., </em>36 Md. App. 583, 591-92, 374 A.2d 419 (1977). We can, therefore, presume that the court knew that the act provided the opportunity for further proceedings with potential relief for the plaintiff. Such potential appropriately may be considered in the matter before us when we remember that the construction of a judgment not only involves the consideration of \u201ccircumstances surrounding the making of the judgment,\u201d but also that \u201c[e]ffect must be given to that which is clearly implied as well as to that which is expressed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 196-97. It can, therefore, be said that in adverting to the interlocutory or nonfinal nature of the voluntary agreement for which the plaintiff sought an order of execution, the court implied, and we believe correctly, that the act itself provided the relief the plaintiff sought, which first needed to be exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Turning first to General Statutes \u00a7 31-278 of the act, which is titled, \u201cPower and duties of commissioners,\u201d it provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he Superior Court, on application of a commissioner or the chairman . . . <em>may enforce, by appropriate decree or process, </em>any provision of the chapter or any proper order of a commissioner or this chairman rendered pursuant to any such provision. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The legislative choice to include the word \u201cprocess\u201d is instructive when accepted definitions of that term are considered. Its use in \u00a7 31-278 is strongly suggestive of another avenue by which a plaintiff may utilize the act in the first instance in an enforcement context. General Statutes \u00a7 31-323 of the act provides that under certain circumstances a \u201ccommissioner may issue a writ of attachment [against employers who have not paid benefits due under the act] in the manner and form of writs of attachment in civil actions and shall be vested with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the same jurisdiction as authorities authorized to issue writs of attachment in civil actions. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The plaintiff claims that the legislature has provided the remedy in \u00a7 31-300, which permits him to go directly into the Superior Court to seek an order of execution on the voluntary agreement without any necessity that he consider doing anything further under the act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">If we assume for the moment that the voluntary agreement is of the quality and kind that the Superior Court could properly consider to be the subject of an execution, the plaintiff could have addressed the commissioner under \u00a7 31-278 and asked that the commissioner make an \u201capplication\u201d to the Superior Court to enforce his order. It is no answer for the plaintiff to claim, as he does, that the legislature provided the route he sought to take. Rather, it should be pointed out that there are good reasons for exhausting available administrative remedies under the act before seeking judicial review. \u201cForemost among those reasons is the policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the [workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s] findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>19 Conn. App. 360, 366, 562 A.2d 562, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 812, 565 A.2d 537 (1989). \u201cWe have recognized that a party aggrieved by a decision of an administrative agency may be excused from exhaustion of administrative remedies if: recourse to the administrative remedy would be futile or inadequate . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>248 Conn. 87, 103, 726 A.2d 1154 (1999). The plaintiff\u2019s remedy offered by \u00a7 31-278 was adequate; invoking it would have put him in the position to get the relief he wanted, i.e., money.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>After all, \u201cIt is not the [plaintiffs] preference for a particular remedy that determines whether the remedy . . . is adequate . . . and an administrative remedy, in order to be \u2018adequate,\u2019 need not comport with the [plaintiff\u2019s] opinion of what a perfect remedy would be.\u201d <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc. </em>178 Conn. 586, 590, 424 A.2d 285 (1979); see <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>236 Conn. 421, 434, 673 A.2d 514 (1996); <em>Savoy Laundry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>32 Conn. App. 636, 642, 630 A.2d 159, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 931, 632 A.2d 704 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The plaintiff also asserts that the court \u201cdid not understand the role it was being asked to assume.\u201d He claims that the court was not being asked to engage in \u201cappellate\u201d review of the voluntary agreement, but rather, the plaintiff sought enforcement only of what was \u201ca final and binding agreement between the parties . . . which under <em>[McIntyre </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, Inc., </em>126 Conn. 491, 12 A.2d 544 (1940)] was enforceable as to payments that had already accrued but had not yet been paid.\u201d The premise of his claim, the plaintiff argues, \u201cwas that the voluntary agreement represented a final, binding contract between the parties, for which he sought an execution on amounts that had already become due, but had not yet been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On the other hand, the defendants claim that (1) the voluntary agreement is not an enforceable final judgment and is not subject to an order of execution, as was the case in <em>McIntyre, </em>and (2) even if a voluntary agreement may create a right to payment in some circumstances, they have no obligation to pay here because the form 36 already had been approved by the commissioner and remained legally viable and, thus, rendered the voluntary agreement ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Certain additional circumstances should be set out. In addition to the language in the voluntary agreement, approved by the commissioner on July 18, 1997, and which prominently states in boldface print the caveat, \u201cTHIS IS NOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT,\u201d other language in the document is significant. The voluntary agreement also contains a section conspicuously titled, \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which plainly is in \u201ccondition precedent\u201d language. There also is a space in the document for the specific, basic weekly compensation rate depending on the type of incapacity or injury, which clearly is subject to and conditioned on the \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES\u201d language. On this printed form the amount $631.35 is printed in box 17 as the weekly \u201cbasic compensation.\u201d Box 17, in printed form, also contains after \u201c$631.35 per week\u201d the following: \u201cEmployer pays to employee (Section 31-307). . . .\u201d We note that \u00a7 31-307 (a), titled, \u201cCompensation for total incapacity,\u201d contains this prefatory language: <em>\u201cIf any injury </em>for which compensation is provided under the provisions of this chapter <em>results in total incapacity to work, </em>the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>employee shall be paid a weekly compensation equal to . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language from \u00a7 31-307 underscores the caveat of the \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES\u201d section of the voluntary agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The voluntary agreement was signed on July 7, 1997, and approved by the commissioner on July 18, 1997. The voluntary agreement includes no provision for the payment of any fixed sum, but rather, sets out the applicable weekly benefit rate, i.e., $631.75 \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES\u201d total incapacity. Causation still remains to be proven by the plaintiff as to his neck injury. On September 27, 1995, the commissioner approved the defendants\u2019 previously filed form 36, in which they had sought to discontinue payment of benefits to the plaintiff. In the form 36, the defendants alleged that the plaintiff had been released to return to light duty work on July 10, 1995, and was, therefore, no longer entitled to receive temporary total benefits. There is nothing in the record before the court to indicate that the form 36 has been revoked, withdrawn, amended or changed in any fashion by a commissioner. The plaintiff, although he was entitled to do so under \u00a7 31-296, never requested a hearing on the defendants\u2019 discontinuance of payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In <em>McIntyre, </em>the employee entered into a \u201cvoluntary compensation agreement\u201d with the employer for $6800, which was agreed to be \u201can advance commuted payment of compensation into a single lump sum.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 492-93. The commissioner approved the agreement. Id., 493. Subsequently, the employee complained to the commissioner that the employer had not paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Id. Still later, the employer discharged the employee and paid him certain moneys pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>a \u201cvoluntary special allowance,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which the employer claimed was in place of the $6800 due under the earlier compensation agreement. Id., 493-94. The employee then brought an action against the employer, alleging that the earlier compensation agreement and the voluntary allowance that the employer itself decided to award him were two separate transactions and that he was entitled to receive the compensation award as well as the voluntary special allowance. Id., 494. Our Supreme Court affirmed the employee\u2019s entitlement to both. In so doing, the court stated that under the statutes, the $6800 compensation agreement was a commutation of the employee\u2019s compensation for the entire period involved and that immediate payment of the commuted lump sum was contemplated. Id., 496. The <em>McIntyre </em>court then went on to state: \u201cAn obvious purpose of commutation into a single lump sum is in effect an immediate determination of the rights of the employee and the liability of the employer as to the entire compensation by fixing the amount to be paid and accepted, with a single payment thereof instead of the usual weekly instalments or other periodical payments extending over the compensation period, due allowance, as by discount, being made for the advantages accruing thereby to the employee. When, as here, the award is so commuted and made presently payable, it thereupon becomes a final judgment. <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Elmer Automobile Co., </em>[112 Conn. 370, 379, 152 A. 280 (1930)]. As such it is enforceable as provided in \u00a7 5251 of the General Statutes, at least in the absence of motion to reopen it.\u201d <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 496; see also <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Milford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>26 Conn. App. 494, 498, 600 A.2d 5 (1991), appeal dismissed, 224 Conn. 441, 619 A.2d 450 (1993) (following <em>McIntyre). McIntyre </em>thereby concluded that the compensation agreement was a final judgment entitled to be enforced under \u00a7 5251 as a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">That is not the situation in this case. Here, the plaintiff received neither a commuted and currently payable monetary award nor a lump sum award. McIntyre, therefore, does not control. What the plaintiff and the defendants agreed to was that the plaintiff had a neck injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment, and a setting of the weekly rate of his compensation \u201cif injury causes total incapacity\u201d of his neck. That is what the commissioner ordered on a form that not only was marked, \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT,\u201d but which also, not once, but twice, stated the caveat, \u201cIf injury causes total disability.\u201d By signing the agreement, the defendants were not agreeing to be liable for any total incapacity of the plaintiffs neck, as causation remained to be proven by the plaintiff. Rather, the defendants claim that they sought the execution of the \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT\u201d agreement for the purpose of avoiding any waiver or threatening of their right to transfer liability for the neck injury to the second injury fund, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendants claim further that the document involved no agreement \u201cwhatsoever . . . that the plaintiff was presently incapacitated because of his neck injury and certainly not that plaintiff would receive payment for such an alleged incapacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The plaintiff, on the other hand, maintains that on July 7, 1997, nearly two years after the discontinuation of his benefits,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the defendants, through counsel, \u201crevived\u201d his entitlement to benefits by proposing the voluntary agreement to compensate him for his neck injuries. Under this agreement, the plaintiff argues, the defendant employer agreed to pay him $631.35 per week. Despite approval of the voluntary agreement on July 18,1997, by the commissioner, according to statute, the defendants, notwithstanding repeated demands<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> by the plaintiff, made no payments. Accordingly, the plaintiff sought an order of execution in the Superior Court, the denial of which is before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">This case does not present, as the plaintiff claims, a voluntary agreement that is a final and enforceable judgment. Moreover, it does not, as the plaintiff claims, fit within the rationale of <em>McIntyre </em>to be the subject of consideration for an order of execution. In <em>McIntyre, </em>it expressly appeared from the voluntary agreement that there was a commutation of compensation into a single lump sum and that immediate payment was contemplated such that there was a final judgment. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. of New York, Inc., </em>supra, 126 Conn. 496. That is not so in this case. The plaintiff, quite apart from his not properly explaining the \u201cNOT A FINAL SETTLEMENT\u201d language in the context of the entire voluntary agreement, also has not persuasively demonstrated the impact of the \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES\u201d language, which appears not once, but twice in the voluntary agreement. In addition, the plaintiff has not demonstrated by analysis that the \u201cIF INJURY CAUSES\u201d language does not mean exactly what it says, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that is, that the causation element of the injury still remains to be proven. The word \u201cif\u201d is \u201c[a] word implying a condition; showing that the expectation of a fulfillment is uncertain, and presupposing that it may not occur.\u201d Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969); see 17A Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 466 (1991). The word \u201cif,\u201d as used in this context, unambiguously resonates in the sense of that which is precedent to the right and duty to immediate performance; it is that which is not at all final. The plaintiff suggests that he is entitled to have an order of execution issue so that he may obtain the payments that have \u201caccrued\u201d and constitute the amount of his final judgment. This is not persuasive because that which is \u201caccrued\u201d is that which \u201c[comes] into existence as an enforceable claim or right\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999); and the plaintiff, at this juncture, has not proven any enforceable claim or right.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Next, the plaintiff dismisses the significance of the form 36, which the commissioner approved <em>before </em>the execution of the voluntary agreement. He does this by simply stating, without analysis or authority, that the defendants \u201crevived [his] entitlement to benefits by proposing a voluntary agreement to compensate him for his neck injuries.\u201d Relying on \u00a7 31-296-1 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, the plaintiff argues that \u201c[a]s a matter of contract law\u2014based on the specific terms of the agreement\u2014the voluntary agreement in this case <em>conclusively established </em>the defendants\u2019 acceptance of liability for payments based on [the plaintiffs] neck injuries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-296-1.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00a7 31-296-1 as does the plaintiff. Rather, we read it to mean that the \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d mentioned in the regulation is to be prepared in cases where there is no dispute that the employee has \u201csuffered an accident and injury arising out of and in the course of his employment causing either temporary partial or temporary total disability beyond the three-day waiting period.\u201d Id. In this case, the execution of the voluntary agreement means that the defendants conceded that the plaintiff injured his neck during the \u201caccident\u201d involved and that it caused some disability in the past beyond the three-day waiting period. It does not conclusively establish the defendants\u2019 acceptance of liability for the plaintiffs neck injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Furthermore, the plaintiff has not demonstrated how the execution of the voluntary agreement has \u201crevived\u201d his claimed entitlement to benefits. He has not demonstrated that the commissioner\u2019s order approving the form 36 prior to the voluntary agreement has been somehow revoked, amended, set aside or in any way diminished in its legal viability from that which it possessed when originally entered. In recognizing the con-clusivity that it was according to the approval of a discontinuance of or a reduction in benefits by means of an approved form 36, the legislature in \u00a7 31-296 imposed strict requirements of notification on the employer, the opportunity for the employee to request a hearing on the proposed discontinuance or reduction within ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>days after receiving notice and mandated that any such request for a hearing \u201cbe given priority over requests for hearings on other matters. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-296. The plaintiff did not request a hearing before the commissioner. The plaintiff cannot bypass the effect of the duly ordered approval of the form 36, which operates to discontinue his benefits. This effect of the form 36 supports the defendants\u2019 claim that the execution of and later approval by the commissioner of the 1997 voluntary agreement were for the purpose of preserving their ability to transfer their potential liability to the second injury fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"> The defendants are the Area Cooperative Educational Services, which operated the vocational school at which the plaintiff was employed, and the Connecticut Hospital Association Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust, the school\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-5\"> The plaintiffs motion stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThe undersigned respectfully represents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">\u201c1.
