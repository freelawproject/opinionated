On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) allowed one of the victims to hold a large, stuffed toy animal while testifying, (2) admitted into evidence testimony about certain acts of uncharged misconduct, (3) excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>from evidence a physician\u2019s handwritten notes that allegedly were taken for the purpose or in furtherance of treatment or diagnosis and (4) failed to instruct the jury on the offense of cruelty to persons. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Between 1993 and 1995, the defendant lived in Bristol with his wife and their child, S, and his wife\u2019s three children from a previous marriage, M, C and D. During this time, the defendant subjected M and C to sexual contact by playing what was called \u201cthe ice game.\u201d The ice game was played one or more times each month, and began when M was seven years old and continued until she was nine years old. The defendant would ask one of the children to retrieve a tray of ice from the freezer, and then would take a piece of ice and put it in their underwear. The defendant would rub the ice around M\u2019s vagina and then place it inside her vagina until the ice melted. After the ice melted, the defendant would place his finger inside her vagina. The defendant also would place a piece of ice in C\u2019s underwear and rub it around his penis until the ice melted, at which time he would fondle C while pretending to be trying to find the ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The defendant played the ice game with all four children while their mother was in the same room or an adjacent room. M and C did not like the ice game and hated the defendant. The defendant also would hug and kiss M good night and touch his tongue to her lips when he did so. The children did not complain to anyone about the ice game during the three years that the defendant subjected them to it because they were afraid of reprisal. M mentioned the behavior to a cousin who in turn told her mother, M\u2019s aunt. The aunt spoke privately with M about the ice game and subsequently reported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>conduct to the department of children and families (department). Other facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The defendant claims first that he was deprived of a fair trial because M was allowed to testify while holding a large stuffed toy gorilla. He claims that the court\u2019s failure to remove the stuffed animal deprived him of his constitutional rights to confrontation and to a fair trial in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. Prior to M\u2019s testimony, defense counsel observed that she had brought a large stuffed animal to court. The defendant objected to the idea of allowing her to testify while holding the stuffed animal because it might elicit sympathy from the jury and it made viewing the witness difficult. The court overruled the objection, and M was allowed to hold the stuffed animal during her testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> M, who was twelve years old at the time of trial, testified that she purchased the stuffed animal with her money and that it was her idea to bring it to court to help her testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The defendant raises two issues regarding the court\u2019s ruling allowing the witness to hold the stuffed animal. First, the defendant raises a confrontation issue as it relates to his claimed inability to see the witness during her testimony because the stuffed animal blocked his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>view. Second, the defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s allowing M to hold the stuffed animal while testifying. We will address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The defendant claims that because the court allowed M to hold the stuffed animal during her testimony, his right to confrontation guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions; U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; was abrogated in that his view of the witness was obstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">This claim is without merit. The record reveals that the court addressed the defendant\u2019s concern and adequately accommodated him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because M was allowed to hold the stuffed animal while testifying. The defendant asks us to apply the standard set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 704-705, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988), in which our Supreme Court held that in criminal prosecutions involving alleged sexual abuse of children of tender years, \u201ca trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d Id., 704. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant also points to <em>State </em>v. Menzies, 26 Conn. App. 674, 690-91, 603 A.2d 419, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 924, 608 A.2d 690 (1992), in which a hearing was held on the state\u2019s motion, filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to place a guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ad litem by the alleged victim\u2019s side during her testimony. The defendant claims, on the basis of the rationales of <em>Jarzbek </em>and <em>Menzies, </em>that the state should have been required to prove by clear and convincing evidence a compelling need to allow M to hold the stuffed animal while testifying. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Jarzbek </em>and <em>Menzies </em>is misplaced. We first note that the situation in the present case is not, as was the case in <em>Menzies, </em>one specifically enumerated under \u00a7 54-86g (b). Therefore, the requirement that the state \u201cprove, by clear and convincing evidence, a compelling need to have [the special procedure]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 690-91; does not apply to this case. Furthermore, the situation in <em>Jarzbek </em>is far from analogous to the present case. In <em>Jarzbek, </em>the defendant was excluded from the witness room during the videotaping of the minor victim\u2019s testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 684. Our Supreme Court held that this departure from strict compliance with confrontation requirements was appropriate only where a case-by-case analysis is performed to \u201cbalance the individual defendant\u2019s right of confrontation against the interest of the state in obtaining reliable testimony from the particular minor victim in question.\u201d Id., 704. In <em>Jarzbek, </em>the claimed harm was that the special procedure denied the defendant his right to confrontation. Id., 689. In the present case, however, the defendant claims that he was harmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>because the jury\u2019s sympathy was aroused. We see no reason to extend the rationale of <em>Jarzbek </em>to this case. The only similarity between the two situations is that the special accommodations were made so that the child witnesses could be more comfortable, thus allowing them to testify more reliably.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Our Supreme Court recently decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>249 Conn. 735, 738 A.2d 117 (1999), in which a similar situation arose in the context of prosecutorial misconduct. In <em>Aponte, </em>the victim, a child, was allowed to testify while holding a Barney doll<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> given to her by the state\u2019s attorney. The court held that this was improper because the conduct of giving the doll to the victim might impact her suggestibility. Id., 745. It also is noteworthy that the court commented on the victim\u2019s possession of the doll, stating that \u201chad the victim simply brought a favorite object from home, there would have been no basis for objection.\u201d Id. For these reasons, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights when it allowed the witness to hold the stuffed animal during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence testimony about the defendant\u2019s prior acts of hitting the children with a belt. The defendant claims that (1) the act of striking the children was not uncharged misconduct because it is lawful to discipline children in this manner, (2) if it was uncharged misconduct, the state failed to prove that the evidence fell within one of the recognized exceptions for the admission of uncharged misconduct and (3) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. Before trial, the state provided notice of its intent to offer evidence of uncharged misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected and sought to have the evidence excluded under the general rule prohibiting prior misconduct evidence. The court heard testimony outside the presence of the jury and then ruled that it would allow the state to present evidence that the defendant had hit the children on their buttocks with a belt because it was related to their fear of retribution if they resisted or complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The court heard testimony from M that she did not like to play the ice game, but did so because she feared the defendant would hit her with his belt. M testified that D was hit with a belt because he had refused to play the ice game. C testified about the use of a belt as punishment and testified that he participated in the ice game because he feared he would be hit with a belt. C also corroborated M\u2019s testimony regarding the incident in which D was hit with a belt for refusing to play the ice game. M and C testified that they did not tell the police the truth when they were first interviewed for fear of being hit with a belt. The court also allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the state to present evidence about the defendant\u2019s hitting the children through the testimony of M and C\u2019s aunt<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Officer Jerome Davis of the Bristol police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior crimes or misconduct is not admissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>43 Conn. App. 830, 835, 687 A.2d 544 (1996). \u201cThe rationale of [the rule preventing evidence of guilt of other crimes] is to guard against its use merely to show an evil disposition of an accused, and especially the predisposition to commit the crime with which he is now charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>48 Conn. App. 178, 189, 709 A.2d 28 (1998). \u201cWe have, however, recognized exceptions to the general rule if the purpose for which the evidence is offered is to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime. . . . [Prior misconduct] evidence may also be used to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u201cOur analysis of whether evidence of prior misconduct is admissible is two-pronged. First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crimes evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 162, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 676, 469 A.2d 760 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cWhen relevant evidence of other crimes is offered, the trial court must still consider whether its prejudicial tendency outweighs its probative value before ruling upon its admissibility. . . . Because of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling on the admission of uncharged misconduct evidence unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion or an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Here, the court allowed the introduction of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s striking the male and female victims on the buttocks with a belt or strap.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exclusion of evidence of the defendant\u2019s other acts of uncharged misconduct reveals that the court carefully considered and weighed the prejudicial tendency against the probative value before ruling on the admissibility of evidence that the defendant used a belt to discipline the children.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We conclude that the court properly ruled that the testimony was relevant to the exception allowing evidence of an element of the crime, in this case, creating the fear of retribution for not participating in the ice game. Because the defendant was charged with the crime of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1), the state was required to prove that he compelled the victims by force or threat of force to submit to sexual contact. Under the circumstances, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion by admitting the challenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly excluded from evidence handwritten notes by the victims\u2019 physician concerning an ongoing custody battle between the victims\u2019 biological father and their mother. The defendant claims that this evidence was admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule; General Statutes \u00a7 52-180;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the refusal to allow its admission was harmful error and a denial of his right to present a defense. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; U.S. Const., amend. XIV. The defendant claims that this evidence was relevant to show that the victims lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to address this claim. During the testimony of a defense witness, .Hertzler Knox, a physician, the defendant sought to introduce certain of Knox\u2019s medical records that contained notes he made while conducting physical examinations of the victims. The state objected on hearsay and relevance grounds. The defendant made an offer of proof and argued that the records were admissible under the medical records hearsay exception as statements made for the purpose of treatment and diagnosis. The court sustained the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u201c \u2018On appeal, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence are accorded great deference. . . . Rulings on such matters will be disturbed only upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>a showing of clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jurgensen, </em>42 Conn. App. 751, 754, 681 A.2d 981, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 931, 683 A.2d 398 (1996). Although the defendant claims that the medical records should have been admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, he failed to argue to the trial court the relevance of the information he sought to introduce. The court indicated that the requested information was not relevant and denied the request on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201cThe proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless a proper foundation is established, the evidence is irrelevant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>[232 Conn. 740, 747, 657 A.2d 611 (1995)]; <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>[232 Conn. 559, 571, 657 A.2d 212 <em>(1995)]; Hall v. Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 452, 569 A.2d 10 (1990). Relevance may be established in one of three ways. First, the proffering party can make an offer of proof. . . . Second, the record can itself be adequate to establish the relevance of the proffered testimony. . . . Third, the proffering party can establish a proper foundation for the testimony by stating a good faith belief that there is an adequate factual basis for his or her inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>237 Conn. 576, 586, 678 A.2d 924 (1996). The defendant has failed to persuade us that he established at trial, through any of these methods, the relevance of the proposed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Our review of the record reveals that the defendant sought to introduce the evidence by claiming that it was allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule for statements made for the purpose of treatment and diagnosis. The defendant failed to explain at trial, however, why the information was relevant in the first place. Because the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was not sufficient to establish the relevance of the proffered evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>dence, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by precluding its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly denied his written request to instruct the jury on the offense of cruelty to persons; General Statutes \u00a7 53-20;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because, as the charges were alleged in the infor-mations, the defendant could not have committed sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the third degree or risk of injury to a child without first committing the offense of cruelty to persons. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u201cThere is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 583, 427 A.2d 414 (1980); rather, the right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law. A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser [included] offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of then-proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser. Id., 588.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 260, 681 A.2d 922 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 22-23, 592 A.2d 149 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 106, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 260-61. \u201cOn appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Under the first prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>we must determine if the defendant\u2019s request to charge was an appropriate instruction. \u201cA proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>if it complies with Practice Book \u00a7 854 [now \u00a7 42-18], <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 591, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>[201 Conn. 534, 556-58, 518 A.2d 915 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>[199 Conn. 155, 158-61, 506 A.2d 104 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 261. Practice Book \u00a7 42-18 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, and the evidence to which the proposition would apply. . . .\u201d The defendant, in his request to charge, failed to meet the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>In his request to charge, the defendant merely stated the facts as alleged in the informations and then equated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>those facts to the behavior of torturing, tormenting or cruelly or unlawfully punishing as proscribed by \u00a7 53-20. Furthermore, the defendant did not, as required under Practice Book \u00a7 42-18, provide any authority for his requested charge. The only reference he provided to support his position was \u00a7 53-20, the statute under which he sought the jury instruction. The defendant\u2019s request to charge, in our view, is \u201c[a] mere general statement of the entire incident at issue [which] does not comply with our rules of practice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 591-92; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 263. Because we conclude that the defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>we need not consider the remaining conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> The court ruled on the defendant\u2019s objection, stating: \u201cAll right. Under the circumstances, I\u2019m going to overrule the objection. I just don\u2019t see the problem with it. It makes her more comfortable; it makes her more at ease; and being a courtroom setting, I think it\u2019s, generally speaking, very difficult for a child to be in a setting like this, and anything that would make her more comfortable and more at ease I think is appropriate. So, for those reasons, I\u2019m going to deny your request.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\"> The following colloquy took place before M was allowed to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: May I ask, Your Honor, I note [that] as [M] <em>has been </em>holding [the stuffed animal], it\u2019s very close to her face and part of her face is covered by it.
