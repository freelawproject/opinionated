Burns, </em>467 Fed.Appx. 265 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 214-15 (5th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">After our opinion was issued, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), that the more lenient penalties of the FSA apply to offenders who committed offenses before the effective date of the FSA, but who were sentenced after that date. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in the light of <em>Dorsey. Burns v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 331, 184 L.Ed.2d 4, 2012 WL 3018574 (U.S. Oct. 1, 2012). We therefore VACATE Burns\u2019s sentence and REMAND this case for resentencing consistent with <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
