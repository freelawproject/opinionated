Barefield contends that: (1) the social security benefits he received are not taxable income; (2) the tax court should not have granted the IRS\u2019s motion for summary judgment without allowing him to argue his case in person; and (3) the IRS improperly assessed interest on his tax deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the tax court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Roberts v. Comm\u2019r, </em>329 F.3d 1224, 1227 (11th Cir.2003). The tax court granted summary judgment to the IRS because it concluded that social security income is taxable regardless of whether that income is for disability benefits or old-age insurance benefits. Barefield contends that because the social security benefits he received were disability benefits they are not taxable income. We disagree. The Internal Revenue Code states, \u201c[Gjross income ... includes social security benefits.... \u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 86(a)(1). It defines a \u201csocial security benefit\u201d as \u201cany amount received by the taxpayer by reason of entitlement to\u2014 (A) a monthly benefit under title II of the Social Security Act, or (B) a tier 1 railroad retirement benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 86(d)(1). Title II of the Social Security Act expressly includes disability benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Under that plain statutory language, social security disability benefits are taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Barefield also contends that the tax court should have allowed him to argue his case in person before granting the IRS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Barefield cites no authority in support of that contention, and the tax court\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure specifically contemplate a ruling on a motion for summary judgment without a hearing. <em>See </em>Tax Ct. R. 121(b). Based on that rule, Barefield\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">Finally, Barefield contends that the IRS improperly assessed interest on his tax deficiency because the tax court\u2019s judgment did not expressly state that interest would accrue on the amount of the deficiency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Interest on a tax deficiency is mandatory by statute. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601. The Supreme Court has instructed that when a taxpayer wants to challenge the validity of that interest, \u201c[t]he proper procedure [i]s for [the taxpayer] to pay the interest ... and sue for then-refund in an appropriate federal district court or in the Claims Court.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. McCoy, </em>484 U.S. 3, 7, 108 S.Ct. 217, 219, 98 L.Ed.2d 2 (1987). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to address the assessment of interest in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 6, 108 S.Ct. at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. Barefield\u2019s brief to this Court refers to \"penalties] and interest,\u201d but the record does not show that any penalties were assessed against him. The final tax bill that Barefield received from the IRS shows only a deficiency of $769.78 and interest of $135.38.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
