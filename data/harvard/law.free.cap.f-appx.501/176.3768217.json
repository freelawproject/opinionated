Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Because we primarily write for the parties, we need only recite the facts necessary for our discussion. In submissions to the District Court, Nixon alleges that on February 17, 2012, he received an \u201cunacceptable correspondence\u201d form from the mail room at SCI Mahanoy, notifying him that incoming mail sent to him had been confiscated because inmates could not receive copies of Facebook pages. Nixon timely filed an administrative grievance and asserts that the mail confiscation policy provides that \u201call mail and property that is the subject of a grievance should be held until the exhaustion of grievance or the time has expired to exhaust grievance.\u201d <em>(Nixon v. Wetzel, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 1: 12-cv-01154, Docket # 1 at 3.) According to Nixon, the piece of mail at issue was destroyed prior to completion of administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">On June 18, 2012, Nixon filed this civil rights action in the District Court and was granted permission to proceed in forma pauperis. On July 3, 2012, the District Court entered a Memorandum and Order dismissing Nixon\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Nixon then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). The legal standard for dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is the same as that for dismissing a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See id. </em>To survive dismissal, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). This Court affirms a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim \u201conly if, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>accepting all factual allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we determine that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any reasonable reading of the complaint.\u201d <em>McGovern v. City of Philadelphia, </em>554 F.3d 114, 115 (3d Cir.2009). We may affirm the District Court on any basis supported by the record. <em>Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The District Court properly dismissed Nixon\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[P]risoners, by virtue of their incarceration, do not forfeit their First Amendment right to use of the mails.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Brown, </em>461 F.3d 353, 358 (3d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Bieregu v. Reno, </em>59 F.3d 1445, 1452 (3d Cir.1995)). However, inmates\u2019 right to receive and send mail can be restricted for legitimate penological interests. <em>See Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 407, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989); <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Here, the District Court correctly determined that Nixon\u2019s claim alleging a single, isolated interference with his personal mail was insufficient to constitute a First Amendment violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Bieregu, </em>59 F.3d at 1452, <em>abrogated on other grounds by Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\u201cWe decline to hold that a single instance of damaged mail rises to the level of constitutionally impermissible censorship.\u201d); <em>see also Davis v. Goord, </em>320 F.3d 346, 351 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]n isolated incident of mail tampering is usually insufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d); <em>Washington v. James, </em>782 F.2d 1134, 1139 (2d Cir.1986) (a single isolated incident of interference with an inmate\u2019s mail is insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Nixon\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\">. The District Court did not provide Nixon leave to amend his complaint because \u201d[g]iv-en the facts alleged by plaintiff, allowing him to amend would be futile.\u201d <em>(Nixon v. Wetzel, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ No. 1: 12-cv-01 154, Docket # 9 at 6); <em>see Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that courts should not dismiss pro se complaints without granting leave to amend unless \"amendment would be inequitable or futile\u201d). We conclude that the District Court did not err in declining to allow Nixon an opportunity to amend his complaint because, as discussed below, Nixon\u2019s underlying claim lacks merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">. In his argument supporting his appeal, Nixon claims that he was deprived of access to the courts because he suffered an \"actual injury\u201d when the piece of mail was destroyed before his administrative remedies were exhausted. However, such a claim must relate to either a direct or collateral challenge to the prisoner\u2019s sentence or conditions of confinement. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\"Impairment of any <em>other </em>litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental ... consequences of conviction and incarceration.\u201d). Here, Nixon\u2019s claim does not even relate to his ability to access the courts to challenge his sentence or conditions of confinement; instead, he challenges his inability to receive copies of another individual\u2019s Facebook page in the mail. Therefore, his reliance on <em>Lewis </em>is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
