Pursuant to the anti-retaliation provision of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791(g), 793(d), and 794(d), Simpson alleged that the defendants, some of whom he sued in 2006 pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act, later retaliated against him for that suit by not interviewing or hiring him for social worker positions. <em>(Id. </em>at 3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The previous lawsuit <em>(\u201cSimpson </em>/\u201d) was filed in November 2006, against, among others, the Alabama DHR as well as Marshall and Jefferson Counties\u2019 DHR.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Simpson first argues on appeal that it was error for the district court to grant the defendants\u2019 joint summary judgment motion because he made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Johnson v. Governor of Fla., </em>405 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, \u201c[w]e review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes of limitations <em>de novo.\u201d Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton, </em>453 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201c[Gjenuine disputes of facts are those in which the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant.\u201d <em>Mann v. Taser Intern., Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">The applicable limitations period begins to run from the time the plaintiff knows or should have known (1) that he has suffered the injury that forms the basis of his complaint, and (2) who has inflicted the injury. <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003). For Rehabilitation Act claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>originating in Alabama, that state\u2019s two-year period for personal injury actions, found in Ala.Code \u00a7 6 \u2014 2\u201438(i), supplies the applicable statute of limitations. <em>See Jones v. Preuit &amp; Mauldin, </em>876 F.2d 1480, 1488 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits retaliation against an employee who has opposed disability discrimination. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(g); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12208(a). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) he suffered a materially adverse action; and (3) there was some causal relationship between the two events. <em>See Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1566 (11th Cir.1997); <em>Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2414, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). Where a plaintiff offers no direct evidence of employment discrimination, his case can be analyzed using the burden-shifting paradigm of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1307-08 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">For retaliation purposes, filing a charge of discrimination is a statutorily protected activity. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a); <em>see Wright v. Southland Corp., </em>187 F.3d 1287, 1305-06 (11th Cir.1999). A materially adverse action is one that has a materially adverse effect on the plaintiff, irrespective of whether it is employment or workplace-related. <em>Crawford v. Carroll, </em>529 F.3d 961, 973 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">\u201cThe causal link element is construed broadly so that a plaintiff merely has to prove that the protected activity and the negative employment action are not completely unrelated.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, close temporal proximity between the employee\u2019s protected conduct and the materially adverse action is sufficient circumstantial evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact about a causal connection. <em>Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000). However, a lapse in time beyond three or four months, in the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, is insufficient to show close temporal proximity. <em>See Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIf there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action in the absence of other evidence tending to show causation, the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Where the protected activity at issue is the filing of a discrimination lawsuit, the relevant date in determining temporal proximity of the protected activity and any materially adverse action is the <em>filing </em>of the lawsuit, not the entry of dispositive orders in the case by the district court. <em>See Donnellon v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>794 F.2d 598, 601 (11th Cir.1986) (commenting that the filing of a discrimination complaint constitutes a \u201cprotected activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Once the employee establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reason for its treatment of the employee. <em>Pennington, </em>261 F.3d at 1266. If the employer presents a legitimate explanation for its actions, the burden then returns to the employee to show that the explanation is pretextual. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Here, as an initial matter, we conclude from the record that it was not error for the district court to determine that some of Simpson\u2019s claims against Jefferson County DHR were time-barred. As noted above, Simpson filed the instant complaint on November 15, 2010, therefore making the applicable limitations period run from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>November 15, 2008, to that date. He was notified of the materially adverse actions, the failures to hire, by non-selection notices sent to him by either the Alabama Personnel Department or by Jefferson County DHR itself. Although Simpson attached 14 such non-selection letters as evidence (and two more that are unreadable), only six of those notices form the basis of timely claims: notices sent on February 1, 2010; November 17, 2009; August 15, 2009; June 17, 2009; April 21, 2009; and November 14, 2008. All others were sent and received outside of the applicable limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">We also conclude that it was not error for the district court to find that Simpson did not prove causation on any of his claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an initial matter and relevant to all defendants, Simpson\u2019s argument that depositions taken in late 2007 of both him and Costa, as part of <em>Simpson I, </em>constituted protected activity in the present suit is misplaced. The filing of <em>Simpson I </em>was the protected activity, and the date of that filing in 2006 was the relevant date in determining causation. Since the filing of <em>Simpson I </em>occurred in 2006 and, given that under the applicable statute of limitations, Simpson could only challenge materially adverse actions from November 15, 2008, forward, Simpson could not prove causation through temporal proximity against any defendant. The period between the date of the protected activity until the earliest date that Simpson could challenge any materially adverse action was two years, far beyond the three or four months which we have held is the outer limit for the test of close temporal proximity. <em>Higdon, </em>393 F.3d at 1220. Because Simpson relied exclusively on temporal proximity to show causation, he failed to show causation as to any defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Moreover, we conclude that the district court was correct in finding, in an abundance of caution, that Simpson\u2019s claims would fail even if he made out a <em>prima facie </em>claim of retaliation against all defendants. Marshall County DHR had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to hire Simpson: Simpson had previously worked as a social worker there, and a supervisor forced him to resign after the supervisor discovered that Simpson was in an improper relationship with a client. Jefferson County DHR had interviewed Simpson before and found him to be nervous, unprofessional, and an unsuitable candidate for the job; hence, it also had a legitimate reason in refusing to hire him. Costa could not hire Simpson because, as Simpson concedes, he was not on the local employment register at the time, which was a prerequisite to being hired. Simpson failed to rebut these legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for refusals to hire him, thereby failing to prove pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that it was not error for the district court to grant the defendants\u2019 joint summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">Simpson next challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his out-of-time discovery motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">We review district court rulings on discovery motions for abuse of discretion. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). Although <em>pro se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>pleadings are to be construed liberally, \u201cprocedural rules in ordinary civil litigation\u201d should not be interpreted \u201cso as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 118 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21(1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). However, the scope of discovery in employment discrimination cases is not without limits. <em>Washington v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>959 F.2d 1566, 1570 (11th Cir.1992). \u201cThe information sought must be relevant and not overly burdensome to the responding party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 16(b) gives the district court the authority to set a scheduling order limiting the time to complete discovery. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). A schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In the instant case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Simpson\u2019s out-of-time discovery motions. The court issued its scheduling order in May 2011, but Simpson moved the court for leave to depose certain individuals on October 26, 2011, a mere five days before the time for discovery was set to expire. He offered no compelling reason why his motions were delayed, nor any reason explaining why the court should effectively extend its discovery deadline. As such, we conclude that it was not error for the district court to deny the motions solely on the grounds that Simpson failed to comply with its order and that his motions would cause undue delay and expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Finally, Simpson challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his post-notice of appeal motion to compel a transcript of a motions hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">The record demonstrates that Simpson filed the motion to compel, and the district court entered its order after he filed his notice of appeal as to the district court\u2019s order granting defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. As such, the notice of appeal cannot constitute an appeal from the order denying the motion to compel production, and we do not have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See McDougald v. Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir.1986) (stating that if a party files a notice of appeal before the district court enters an order on a specific motion, not indicated in the notice of appeal, the party\u2019s notice of appeal does not constitute an appeal from that specific order).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the other appealed orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-10\">. Simpson named numerous other persons and entities as defendants, and also brought claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the district court dismissed these defendants and claims pursuant to the defendants\u2019 joint motions to dismiss the original and amended complaints. Because Simpson does not challenge that ruling on appeal, any issue in that respect is abandoned. <em>(See </em>Blue Brief at 1, 8-30); <em>see Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (while this Court reads briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-17\">. In granting summary judgment for the defendants, the court found that Simpson offered no direct evidence, and that his claims should be analyzed under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct: 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Simpson does not explicitly challenge that finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b979-6\">. The defendants concede that Simpson met the first two elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case\u2014 that the filing of <em>Simpson I </em>constituted a protected activity under the Rehabilitation Act, and that Simpson suffered materially adverse actions, the failure by the defendants to interview or hire him. Therefore, only causation is disputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
