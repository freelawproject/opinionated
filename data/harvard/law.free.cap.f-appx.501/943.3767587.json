In 2008, Crawford entered an agreement to plead guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana and 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), 841(b)(l)(A)(vii), 846, and to waive his right to appeal or challenge collaterally his sentence, subject to four exceptions. The district court sentenced Crawford as a career offender based in part on his conviction in a Florida court in 2002 of battery on a law enforcement officer. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1. Crawford moved to vacate his sentence after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 138, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). Crawford argued that the district court miscalculated his sentence by counting his prior conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Because Crawford\u2019s postconviction challenge to his sentence is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">As part of his plea agreement, Crawford agreed to waive his right to challenge his sentence. In his written agreement, Crawford \u201cexpressly waive[d] the right to appeal [his] sentence or to challenge it collaterally on any ground, including the ground that the Court erred in determining the applicable guidelines range pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines[,]\u201d subject to four exceptions: (1) \u201cthe sentence exceeds the applicable guidelines range <em>as determined by the Court\u201d; </em>(2) \u201cthe sentence exceeds the statutory maximum penalty\u201d; (3) the sentence \u201cviolates the Constitution\u201d; or (4) the government appealed Crawford\u2019s sentence. Crawford also \u201cagreed that [the district court] ha[d] jurisdiction and authority to impose any sentence up to the statutory maximum.\u201d During his change of plea hearing before a magistrate judge, Crawford said that he understood the waiver provision; he understood he could not appeal or later challenge \u201cthe way the Court calculate^] the sentencing guidelines\u201d; and he agreed \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d to the waiver \u201cas part of the plea agreement.\u201d The district court later accepted Crawford\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">During his sentencing hearing in 2008, Crawford stated that he did not object to the factual accuracy of his presentence investigation report or his classification as a career offender, and the district court adopted the findings and calculations in the report. And Crawford, through counsel, acknowledged that his prior convictions in Florida for three felony drug offenses and two offenses involving the battery of a law enforcement officer in 2002 and 2005 resulted in a total offense level of 34, a criminal history category of VI, and a maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment. At the request of the government, the district court reduced Crawford\u2019s offense level by three points for his substantial assistance, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, which reduced his offense level from 34 to 31 and resulted in a revised guideline range between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment. The district court considered the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>and sentenced Crawford at the low end of the revised guideline range. Crawford did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In August 2011, Crawford moved to vacate his sentence and argued that he was \u201cactually innocent of his career offender offense in light of <em>Johnson\u201d </em>and the district court had miscalculated his sentence by counting his conviction for battery of a law officer as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d but the district court denied the motion <em>sua sponte. </em>The district court ruled that the decision of the Court in <em>Johnson </em>did not apply retroactively; Crawford\u2019s motion to vacate was untimely; and Crawford could not use the actual innocence exception to \u201covercome the procedural bar caused by [his] untimely filing\u201d because his classification as a career offender was not a \u201csubstantive offense for which [he] stands convicted.\u201d In the alternative, the district court assumed that <em>Johnson </em>applied retroactively and ruled that Crawford was not entitled to relief because his challenge to the \u201capplication of the Sentencing Guidelines! ] [was] a non-constitutional issue that provides no basis for collateral relief\u2019 and he had otherwise waived his right to challenge his sentence collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The government concedes, and we assume for purposes of this appeal, that the decision in <em>Johnson </em>is retroactively applicable, which leaves only one issue for us to decide: whether Crawford\u2019s motion to vacate is barred by the collateral appeal waiver in his plea agreement. Ordinarily, our review requires a two-fold inquiry into whether Crawford\u2019s waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily and, if so, whether Crawford waived the particular challenge to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>131 F.3d 1005, 1008-09 (11th Cir.1997). But we can proceed directly to the second inquiry because Crawford concedes that the appeal waiver provision in his plea agreement is valid. Crawford \u201cask[s] [this] Court to enforce [the] stipulation as agreed upon by all parties\u201d in his plea agreement that he can appeal \u201chis illegal sentence\u201d and the imposition of a sentence \u201cabove the applicable guidelines range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Crawford\u2019s postconviction challenge to his sentence is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. Crawford acknowledged during his change of plea hearing that the waiver would bar him from challenging the miscalculation of his advisory guideline range. And Crawford cannot obtain relief under any of the exceptions to the waiver. The district court imposed a sentence within Crawford\u2019s advisory guideline range <em>\u201cas determined by the Court </em>\u201d; his sentence of 188 months of imprisonment is well below the maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment; and the miscalculation of his sentence does not \u201cviolate the Constitution,\u201d <em>see Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1321 (11th Cir.2011). Furthermore, Crawford is procedurally barred from challenging the miscalculation of his sentence for the first time in a motion to vacate, and he cannot excuse his default based on the exception for actual innocence. <em>See McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196-99 (11th Cir.2011). The actual innocence exception applies only to an issue of \u201c\u2018factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197 (quoting <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">We AFFIRM the denial of Crawford\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
