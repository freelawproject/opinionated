He was then sentenced to concurrent prison sentences: 360 months on Counts One and Two and 60 months on Count Three. In October 2011, Williams moved the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) to reduce his sentence on Counts One and Two based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court denied his motion. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">In sentencing Williams, the District Court, in determining the applicable sentence range on Counts One and Two, found him responsible for 10 kilograms of crack cocaine. He asks that we disregard the finding in reviewing the court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion, because it was the jury\u2019s, not the court\u2019s, province to determine the amount of drugs involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>his offenses, and the jury made no finding. We should accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion due to such absence of a jury finding on the drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">A court may modify a term of imprisonment only in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, if the amendment \u201cwould not result in a lower base offense level and guidelines range,\u201d the defendant is not entitled to be resen-tenced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Even if the defendant is entitled to be resentenced, he does not receive a <em>de novo </em>resentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, a district court may only substitute the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 780. \u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cthe district court was bound by its previous determination with respect to the number of marijuana plants that were relevant to [the defendant\u2019s] sentence\u201d). Accordingly, the district court must \u201cleave all of its previous factual decisions intact when deciding whether to apply a guideline retroactively.\u201d <em>Cothran, </em>106 F.3d at 1563 (quotation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750 (2011). Amendment 750 was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. <em>See id., </em>Amend. 759 (2011). Amendment 750 is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). A defendant\u2019s base offense level remains unchanged at level 38 if he was sentenced based on a quantity of 8.4 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986 (applying Amendment 706); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">The District Court properly concluded that Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline sentence range applicable in Williams\u2019s case. At sentencing, the court explicitly found that Williams was responsible for 10 kilograms of crack cocaine. Because his offense involved more than 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 750 did not lower the guideline sentence range because his base offense level increased from 36 to 38. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Accordingly, the court properly determined that Williams was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c) relief. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Williams\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s finding at sentencing that his offenses involved 10 kilograms of crack cocaine fails because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. To the extent that Williams argues that the court erred under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the drug quantity was not found by a jury, his argument is unavailing because <em>Apprendi </em>did not involve a retroactively applicable guideline amendment and it did not provide an independent jurisdictional basis to reduce Williams\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that, because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not provide a basis for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>de novo </em>resentencing, Supreme Court decisions by themselves do not provide \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because they are not retroactively applicable guidelines amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-16\">. Williams argues that the District Court should have granted him \u00a7 3582(c) relief because his sentences on Counts One and Two could not exceed 10 ten years. He raised this argument for the first time in his reply brief; thus, it has been waived. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
