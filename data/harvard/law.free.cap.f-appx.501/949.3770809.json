The presentence investigation report concluded that DeG-lace was responsible for 4.1 kilograms of crack cocaine, which made his base offense level 38. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Nov.1997). He received a 2-level enhancement for his role as an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor, resulting in a total offense level of 40. DeGlace\u2019s criminal history category was II, which resulted in a guidelines range of 324 to 405 months imprisonment. DeGlace objected to being held responsible for 4.1 kilograms of crack cocaine, and at his sentence hearing in 1998 the district court found that DeGlace\u2019s offense involved 3.54 kilograms of crack cocaine, which still resulted in a base offense level of 38. The district court sentenced DeG-lace to 364 months imprisonment on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In 2008 the district court, on its own 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, reduced DeG-lace\u2019s sentence based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines. That amendment reduced DeGlace\u2019s base offense level from 38 to 36, and after the 2-level enhancement for his leadership role, DeG-lace\u2019s amended offense level was 38, resulting in an amended guidelines range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment. The district court reduced DeGlace\u2019s sentence to 294 months imprisonment for each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">In 2011 DeGlace filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that Amendment 750 had reduced his guidelines range. The district court denied that motion, concluding that Amendment 750 did not result in a change to DeGlace\u2019s guidelines range. This is DeGlace\u2019s appeal of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">DeGlace argues that Amendment 750 lowered his guidelines range because his original base offense level (under the 1997 sentencing guidelines) was 38, while his base offense level after Amendment 750 would be 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(2) (Nov.2011) (assigning a base offense level of 36 to offenses involving at least 2.8 kilograms, but less than 8.4 kilograms of crack cocaine). Amendment 706, however, had already reduced DeGlace\u2019s base offense level to 36, which made his guidelines range 262 to 327 months imprisonment, and in 2008 the district court reduced his sentence to 294 months based on that new guidelines range. After Amendment 750, DeGlace\u2019s base offense level is still 36, and his guidelines range is still 262 to 327 months imprisonment. Because Amendment 750 does \u201cnot result in a lower base offense level and guidelines range,\u201d the district court did not err in denying DeGlace\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfE2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>DeGlace also contends that the district court had the authority to revisit its drug quantity determination when it considered his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000), and the district court may not revisit the drug quantity determined at sentencing during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that the district court \u201cis to leave all of its previous factual decisions intact when deciding whether to apply a guideline retroactively\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). The district court therefore did not err in declining to revisit its drug quantity determination when it considered DeGlace\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AkT\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-6\">. Because we conclude that DeGlace\u2019s guidelines range did not change, we do not address his arguments that the district court erred by not considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and abused its discretion by not reducing his sentence to 262 months. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that because the defendant\u2019s sentencing range did not change, \"the district court correctly recognized that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>tence and that it did not need to examine the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
