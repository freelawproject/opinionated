In July 2002, the District Court sentenced Presley, a career offender, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, to concurrent prison terms of 235 months on Count Three and 120 months on Count Six.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">In March 2008, Presley moved the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence on Count Three because Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which applied retroactively, reduced the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level for crack offenses. The court, finding that the new base offense level, 31, was the same as the alternative offense level under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, determined that the amended guideline sentence range, 31, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, yielded a sentence range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then reduced Presley\u2019s Count Three sentence to 188 months\u2019 confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-15\">In November 2011, Presley again moved the District Court to reduce his Count Three sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), basing his motion on Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, which was retroactive. The court found that Amendment 750 reduced the Count Three adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to 30; however, the career offender total offense level re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>mained at 31. The court therefore concluded that Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering the Count Three sentence range and denied Presley\u2019s motion. Presley now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkU\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194-95, n. 10 (11th Cir.2010). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the guideline sentence range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This includes where the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>became of the operation of another </em>guideline.... \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that defendants, who originally were sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)\u2019s career-offender table, were not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because their sentence ranges were not based on the drug-quantity offense levels that had been lowered by Amendment 706. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-30. A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by using either the offense level that would ordinarily apply, or, if it results in a higher offense level, the table in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 does not constitute a full resentencing; the court must maintain all original sentencing determinations with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline sentence range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000). A district court engages in a two-part analysis when considering a \u00a7 3582 motion for a sentence reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 780. First, it recalculates the sentence using the amended sentence range, while maintaining all other guideline applications, to determine the new applicable offense level and sentence range. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court, in the exercise of discretion, determines whether to impose the newly fashioned sentence under the amended guideline or retain the original sentence, based on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. Although Amendment 750 reduced the Count Three adjusted offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to 30, the career offender total offense level remained at 31. Therefore, Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering the Count three sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
