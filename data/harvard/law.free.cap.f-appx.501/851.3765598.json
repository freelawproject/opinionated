No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A6SV\">Gonzalez first argues that insufficient evidence exists to support his convictions. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, viewing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government\u201d and \u201cresolving all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Akjp\">To convict Gonzalez of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, \u201cthe government need not demonstrate the existence of a \u2018formal agreement,\u2019 but may instead demonstrate by circumstantial evidence \u2018a meeting of the minds to commit an unlawful act.\u2019\u201d <em>See United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1426 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Sufficient evidence exists to support Gonzalez\u2019s conspiracy conviction. Testimony at trial\u2014when viewed in the light most favorable to the government\u2014demonstrated that Gonzalez introduced the drug seller to the buyers, acted as an intermediary between the seller and the buyers, allowed the seller and the buyers to use his home to negotiate and to conduct drug sales, and received $500 as compensation for setting up the drug deal. Based on this evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that a meeting of the minds existed between Gonzalez and his codefendants to possess with intent to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"ARrf\">To sustain a conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine under an aiding and abetting theory\u2014as pursued in Gonzalez\u2019s case\u2014\u201cthe prosecution must show that \u2018the defendant associated himself with a criminal venture, participated in it as something he wished to bring about, and sought by his actions to make it succeed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pantoja-Soto, </em>739 F.2d 1520, 1525 (11th Cir.1984). The government may satisfy its burden through circumstantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGv\">Based on Gonzalez\u2019s conduct and presence at \u201ccritical junctures\u201d during the negotiation and execution of the drug sales, we can infer his intent to possess and distribute drugs and, thus, his association with the criminal venture. <em>See United States v. Sellers, </em>871 F.2d 1019, 1022 (11th Cir.1989). And because the government established that Gonzalez helped facilitate successful drug sales between the seller and the buyers, it satisfied its burden of proof such that we cannot say that \u201cno reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABO\">We next address Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on misdemeanor cocaine possession, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a), which he contends is a lesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.1995). And \u201cwe may affirm on any ground that finds support in the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.1996), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bloate v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 196, 130 S.Ct. 1345, 176 L.Ed.2d 54 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"A6p\">Because the factual issues to be resolved by the jury were the same for the lesser offense of possession as for the greater offense of possession with intent to distribute, an instruction on possession was not required. <em>See United States v. Catchings, </em>922 F.2d 777, 780-81 (11th Cir.1991). Moreover, because Gonzalez\u2019s defense\u2014 that he was a mere observer, was uninvolved in the conspiracy, and did nothing to help facilitate the drug sale\u2014\u201cif believed, would lead to acquittals on both the greater and lesser charges, it is no abuse of discretion to refuse to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>26 F.3d 119, 120 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"AL_\">We also reject Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to answer adequately the jury\u2019s question about whether sampling a small amount of cocaine made Gonzalez culpable for possessing a larger quantity. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s response to a jury question for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1247 (11th Cir.2009). After considering the parties\u2019 arguments about how it should respond to the jury\u2019s question, the court instructed the jurors to \u201crely upon [their] interpretation of the facts and [their] application of the jury instructions to those facts.\u201d Because answering the jury\u2019s question would have required a fact intensive analysis\u2014which would have invaded the province of the jury\u2014we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to provide a more precise answer to the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"AOhr\">Gonzalez also argues that the prosecution discredited defense counsel improperly by characterizing two of defense counsel\u2019s arguments\u2014about the government\u2019s desire to win the case and the government\u2019s ability to argue twice during closing\u2014as \u201cdefense lawyer tricks.\u201d Because Gonzalez failed to raise this objection at trial, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AntD\">To succeed on this claim, Gonzalez must demonstrate both that the prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper and that the remark affected prejudicially his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1307. In the light of the evidence of Gonzalez\u2019s guilt, Gonzalez cannot show that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s remark, the outcome of his trial would have been different. Thus, he has failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5Q\">We now address Gonzalez\u2019s challenges to his sentence. First, Gonzalez contends that the district court erred in failing to exclude his two Florida misdemeanor convictions\u2014for criminal mischief and for stalking\u2014from his criminal history score.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that these convictions should be excluded under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) because they are similar to the misdemeanor offenses of disorderly conduct and trespassing. \u2018We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history points, sentencing courts count generally all sentences for misdemeanor offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c). But the Guidelines have carved out an exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>for some misdemeanor offenses \u2014 including disorderly conduct and trespassing \u2014 and \u201coffenses similar to them, by whatever name they are known,\u201d which may be counted only under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). In determining whether an unlisted offense is \u201csimilar\u201d to an offense listed in section 4A1.2(c)(1), district courts must apply \u201ca common sense approach\u201d and should consider these five factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">(i) a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses; (ii) the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment; (iii) the elements of the offense; (iv) the level of culpability involved; and (v) the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 12(A)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Given the disparity in punishments, Gonzalez\u2019s conviction for criminal mischief \u2014 a first degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year imprisonment and a $1000 fine \u2014 is not similar to the Florida offense of disorderly conduct, which is a second degree misdemeanor punishable by up to only 60 days\u2019 imprisonment and a $500 fine. <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 806.13(l)(b)(2) (criminal mischief); 877.03 (disorderly conduct); 775.082(4) (statutory maximum sentences); 775.083(1) (fines). For the same reason, Gonzalez\u2019s criminal mischief conviction is also dissimilar to trespass under Florida law, which is categorized generally as a second degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days\u2019 imprisonment and a $500 fine. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 810.08(2) (trespass); 775.082(4); 775.083(1). Although trespass may qualify as a first degree misdemeanor if someone was in the structure when defendant trespassed, the elements of criminal mischief (which include damage to real or personal property) are different from the elements of trespass (which require only that defendant entered or remained in the structure without authorization). <em>Compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 806.13(l)(a) and 810.08(1). Because at least one of Gonzalez\u2019s misdemeanor offenses is dissimilar to those listed in section 4A1.2(c)(l), the district court assessed properly one criminal history point; and we need not address Gonzalez\u2019s stalking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Gonzalez also argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We review this claim only for clear error and Gonzalez bears the burden of establishing his minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Bernal-Benitez, </em>594 F.3d 1303, 1320 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2123, 176 L.Ed.2d 746 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">Based on evidence introduced at trial, the district court concluded that Gonzalez failed to demonstrate that he played only a minor role in the offense. And, although nothing evidences that Gonzalez sold the drugs, financed the offense, or controlled the details of the transactions, he \u201c \u2018is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [ ]he was somewhat less culpable than the other discerna-ble participants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21. We see no clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aki\">. Gonzalez has failed to demonstrate cumulative error. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1223 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AYe\">. Both misdemeanor convictions arose from the same criminal episode, and Gonzalez was sentenced to one year probation on each count to run consecutive to each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b879-7\">. One circumstance under which the excluded misdemeanors may be counted is if defendant was sentenced to a term of probation exceeding one year. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1)(A). Because at least one of Gonzalez\u2019s misdemeanor convictions is dissimilar to the list of excluded misdemeanors, we need not address whether his consecutive one-year probationary sentences should be viewed in the aggregate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
