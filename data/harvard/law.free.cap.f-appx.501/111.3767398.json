Yates appeals the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and from the court\u2019s subsequent order denying his motion for reconsideration. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-21\">In 1997, Yates was convicted by a jury of various drug offenses in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Yates thereafter filed a motion in October 2001 seeking to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the basis of, <em>inter alia, </em>the alleged ineffective assistance rendered by defense counsel. The District Court denied Yates\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit subsequently denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-22\">In May 2005, Yates \u2014 confined in the Middle District of Pennsylvania \u2014 filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in that District Court. In addition to raising ineffective assistance of counsel and due process claims, Yates claimed an entitlement to habeas relief on account of his \u201cactual innocence\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court dismissed Yates\u2019 petition for lack of jurisdiction after concluding that he failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. We agreed with the District Court\u2019s determination that Yates could not meet the stringent gatekeeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s safety valve provision, and summarily affirmed its decision. <em>Yates v. Smith, </em>190 Fed.Appx. 113 (3d Cir.2006) (nonprecedential).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Yates was likewise unsuccessful with a motion for reduction of sentence filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 in June 2008. He fared no better with his application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United, States v. O'Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), Yates claimed that his mandatory life sentence is unconstitutional because its imposition required additional facts neither charged nor found by the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied the \u00a7 2244 application after concluding that Yates had attacked his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(b) on direct appeal and that authorization to file a \u00a7 2255 motion containing such a claim \u2014 even one advanced under a different theory \u2014 was thus barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(1). <em>Yates v. United States, </em>No. 11-1010 (7th Cir. filed Jan. 18, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Undeterred, Yates returned to the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania two months later with yet another petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Once again, Yates advanced a claim based on <em>United States v. OBrien </em>which, as the District Court noted, he argued changed the legal landscape regarding the distinction between elements of a crime and sentencing factors. Yates claimed specifically that his mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(b) for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d) is unconstitutional because the indictment did not charge, and the jury never found, that he was a principal, organizer or leader of a criminal enterprise involving at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The District Court dismissed Yates\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction after concluding that his claims challenged the legality of his conviction and sentence and, therefore, were within the purview of a motion under \u00a7 2255. The District Court further concluded that \u00a7 2255 was not inadequate or ineffective so as to authorize the pursuit of a habeas corpus petition, and rejected Yates\u2019 argument that he should be able to proceed under \u00a7 2241 with his claim that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a principal in the CCE and, thus, of the resulting mandatory life sentence. The District Court determined that <em>OBrien </em>is not an intervening change in the law and, moreover, that it did not have the effect of rendering Yates\u2019 conduct noncriminal. In fact, it found that <em>OBrien </em>was not even directly applicable to Yates. Finally, the District Court noted that Yates\u2019 inability to satisfy \u00a7 2255\u2019s gatek-eeping requirements before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals was an insufficient reason to allow him to pursue a \u00a7 2241 petition raising the same claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Yates sought to have the . District Court reconsider its determination with a motion filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Citing to the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and <em>Cole v. Arkansas, </em>333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948), Yates argued that \u00a7 2241 was the appropriate remedy for a challenge to his 1997 conviction be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>cause his claims are based on a new statutory interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 and 848(b). In particular, Yates claimed that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2227-28, that the references to \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1), meant not just cocaine base in crack form but all forms of cocaine base, rendered his indictment deficient and the evidence presented at trial insufficient to support the resulting conviction. This is so, according to Yates, because the jury was not asked to consider the type and quantity of controlled substance involved in the offense. Noting that <em>Cole </em>\u2014 a 1948 case \u2014 was certainly not an intervening change in law, and that Yates made no attempt to demonstrate that <em>DePierre </em>rendered his conduct innocent, the District Court denied reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Yates filed a notice of appeal. He was directed to pay the filing and docketing fees to the District Court or to submit a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis (\u201cifp </em>\u201d). While Yates timely delivered his <em>ifp </em>motion to prison officials, it was delayed in reaching this Court and his appeal was dismissed for failure to pay the fees. He was notified that if he wished for his <em>ifp </em>motion to be considered, he had to file a motion to reopen. Shortly thereafter, Yates filed a motion to reopen the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We grant Yates\u2019 motions to reopen and to proceed <em>ifp </em>on appeal. We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Yates\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition is plenary, <em>see Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002), and we review the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under Rule 59(e) for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">A \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343-44, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974); <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A habeas petitioner may seek relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatek-eeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>see Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant relief. <em>See Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Rather, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 (citing <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We agree with the District Court that \u00a7 2241 is not the proper means for raising the claims Yates seeks to advance in the underlying petition. We further agree that Yates has not demonstrated that a \u00a7 2255 motion provides an inadequate or ineffective remedy in this case. As Yates himself appears to concede, the cases he <em>cites </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), and <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011) \u2014 do not reflect an intervening change in law which renders the crimes of which he was convicted non-criminal. Additionally, even accepting, <em>arguendo, </em>his contention that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in those two cases represent a signif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>icant change in statutory construction or interpretation regarding the particular provisions at issue, Yates has failed to demonstrate how either of these cases could have an effect on his conviction or sentence as neither case has been held retroactively applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Yates had a prior opportunity to challenge his sentence under \u00a7 2255, and he did so, albeit unsuccessfully. A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because a petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255. <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251. It follows, as the District Court concluded, that \u00a7 2241 is not the proper means of raising these claims and the District Court lacked jurisdiction to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">For the foregoing reasons and because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the order of dismissal and the District Court\u2019s subsequent order denying reconsideration. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAE 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. In <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>the Supreme Court held that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, the statute prohibiting the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a violent or drug trafficking crime, possession of a machinegun \"[was] an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\" not a \"sentencing factor\" to be proved to the judge at sentencing. 130 S.Ct. at 2172, 2180.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
