He now challenges the sentence imposed as substantively unreasonable. After a careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-23\">Before the sentencing hearing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI), which calculated a base offense level of 28 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5), (c)(6). The PSI provided for a 4-level reduction based on Alcemius\u2019s minimal participation in the conspiracy and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21. Alcemius\u2019s 13 criminal history points placed him in category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-24\">The PSI assigned Alcemius\u2019s criminal history points based on several prior con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>victions. In April 2007, he was convicted as a juvenile of resisting arrest and placed under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). In October 2007, he was convicted as a juvenile of two counts of resisting arrest, two counts of assault on an officer, and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He was sentenced to one year in DJJ custody. In October 2009, he was convicted as an adult of resisting arrest and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana. In February 2011, he was convicted of fleeing a police car and driving without a license, and sentenced to one year of probation. And, in June 2011, he was convicted of tampering with physical evidence and sentenced to nine months in jail. Finally, the PSI noted that Alcemius was arrested but not charged or convicted for aggravated assault with a firearm in June 2007 and attempted homicide in August 2007, both while he was a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Based on a criminal history category VI and an offense level of 21, Alcemius\u2019s guideline range was 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory minimum for Alcemius\u2019s offense was 5 years, and the statutory maximum was 40 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The PSI also stated that 14 of the 21 convicted codefendants received minimal-role reductions. Two codefendants received 4-level reductions; they received a 50-month sentence and time served. Twelve codefendants received 2-level reductions. The ten who had been sentenced at the time the probation officer prepared Alcemius\u2019s PSI received sentences ranging from 366 days to 87 months. Of the six who did not receive minimal-role reductions, two were sentenced as of the time Alcemius\u2019s PSI was prepared, and they received sentences of 70 and 128 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">At sentencing, the district court did not expressly adopt the facts and guidelines calculations in the PSI. But, when asked whether they agreed that the PSI contained the \u201ccorrect calculations,\u201d the parties agreed that it did. Alcemius requested a downward variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. He argued that his criminal history category overrepresented the seriousness of his history and that a downward variance was necessary to achieve parity between his sentence and those of his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">The district court declined to grant Al-cemius a downward variance, noting that his criminal history indicated \u201can unwillingness to submit to police authority,\u201d and emphasizing that, although his prior convictions were minor when considered individually, taken together, \u201cthe picture that develops is certainly a disturbing picture.\u201d The court noted that some coconspirators were \u201cfar, far more culpable than Mr. Al-cemius,\u201d but stated, \u201cI do think a sentence within the advisory guideline range would be sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the goal that Congress has set forth in this case.\u201d The district court imposed a sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, and this is Alcemius\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). These purposes include the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>duct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). We examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We conclude that Alcemius has not met his burden to demonstrate that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. His 84-month sentence was within the applicable guideline range, and we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). The district court concluded, based on Alcemius\u2019s criminal history, that Alcemius was a drug dealer with little regard for \u2014 and, in fact, aggression towards \u2014 law enforcement. Alcemius has not shown how this reasoning amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">And Alcemius has not shown that the district court failed to \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6), because he provides no information about the criminal history or government assistance of his codefendants. Concerns about disparate sentences among co-conspirators are not implicated where the defendant has not shown that he and his codefendants were similarly situated. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cDisparity between sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Alcemius has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence was substantively unreasonable; accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
