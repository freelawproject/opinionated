Specifically, Patel\u2019s re-movability was based on his Florida convictions for possession of 20 grams or less of marijuana, possession of alprazolam with intent to sell or deliver, and posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>sion of oxycodone with intent to sell or deliver, all under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 898.13, and one conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia, under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.147(1). On appeal, Patel asserts that because his convictions under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.13 lack a <em>mens rea </em>greater than strict liability or negligence, they should not be considered deportable offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Our jurisdiction to review orders of removal is limited by the Immigration and Nationality Act which provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section ... 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [or] (B) ... of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law, which includes whether the petitioner is \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Moore v. Ashcroft, </em>251 F.3d 919, 923 (11th Cir.2001). We also have held that the question of whether a petitioner\u2019s conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of the INA is a question of law that falls within our jurisdiction. <em>Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2005). Because Patel\u2019s petition raises a question of law, namely whether his convictions under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.13 should be considered deportable offenses, we have jurisdiction to review his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">We, however, need not resolve this question, because even if we assume all of Patel\u2019s convictions under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.13 do not constitute deportable offenses, Patel does not challenge his remov-ability based on his drug paraphernalia conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.147(1). The BIA also found Patel removable as having been convicted of a controlled-substance offense based on the drug paraphernalia conviction, which Patel does not contest. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that an alien who has been convicted of an offense \u201crelating to a controlled substance,\u201d other than a single offense involving possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana for one\u2019s own personal use, is deportable). <em>See also Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1193 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that an alien with a conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
