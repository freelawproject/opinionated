His guideline range, based on an offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, was 188 months to 235 months imprisonment. At sentencing, in April 2002, the district court granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance and imposed a sentence of 151 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">In February 2008, Smith filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706 to the guidelines. The district court found that Smith\u2019s amended guideline range was 151 months to 188 months imprisonment, and that a comparable departure based on substantial assistance would yield a range of 130 months to 162 months imprisonment. Exercising its discretion, the district court granted Smith\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 130 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">In November 2011, Smith filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the guidelines. The district court denied that motion. The court found that Smith\u2019s amended guideline range was 120 months to 137 months imprisonment, and that he was thus eligible for a reduction. But the court declined to grant relief \u201cbecause [Smith] received a reduction previously and a further reduction does not appear appropriate, in light of his extensive criminal history\u201d and a disciplinary infraction in January 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-17\">Smith later filed three other \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions for a sentence reduction, all based on Amendment 750. In March 2012, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>district court denied those motions. The district court observed that it had rejected Smith\u2019s first request for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 because he \u201creceived a reduction previously and ... a further reduction did not appear appropriate.\u201d The court stated that Smith\u2019s latest filings gave no reason for it to revisit its prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On appeal, Smith asks us to set aside this ruling. Specifically, he asserts that the district court erred in relying on (1) the fact that he previously received a sentence reduction; (2) his criminal history; and (3) his disciplinary infraction to deny his request for a sentence reduction. He also argues that, in calculating his amended guideline range, the district court failed to take into account the downward departure he had previously received for providing substantial assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In general, a term of imprisonment, once imposed, is not subject to modification. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Congress has provided, however, that a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if it was based on a guideline range that was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction of this kind must be consistent with the policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission regarding this type of relief, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (2011). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">When a district court rules on a motion for sentence reduction, it undertakes a two-step inquiry. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). First, the court determines the guideline range that would have applied to the defendant had the amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Second, if the amendment has the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then the court decides whether to exercise its discretion to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 2691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Several factors are relevant at the second step of the analysis. First, a district court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i). Second, the court must also consider \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(ii). Finally, the court may choose to take into account the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). A district court abuses its discretion if it makes an error of law. <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2012). A district court also abuses its discretion if it \u201c(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">Three of Smith\u2019s arguments do not require significant discussion. First, Smith states that the district court erred in calculating his amended guideline range by not taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure he had received. But, as the Sentencing Commission has clarified, the guideline range that a district court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>calculate, in order to determine the eligibility of a defendant for a sentence reduction, is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category ... determined <em>before </em>consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Second, Smith suggests that the district court erred by considering his criminal history. However, one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that a district court must consider is \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i). Third, Smith asserts that his January 2009 disciplinary infraction is also not relevant. But the Sentencing Commission has expressly indicated that a district court may take into account a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in determining whether a sentence reduction is warranted. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(BXiii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Smith\u2019s remaining argument \u2014 that the district court erred in relying on the fact that he had received a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 \u2014 requires more attention. As set out above, one reason that the district court gave in denying Smith\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 was the fact that \u201che received a reduction previously\u201d under Amendment 706. This observation apparently reflects the view that Amendment 706 adequately addressed the problems associated with the \u201cinfamous\u201d crack-to-powder ratio of 100-to-1, <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 (11th Cir.2006), thus rendering a reduction under <em>Amendment </em>750 unnecessary or inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Needless to say, this is not the view of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C vol. III at 231 (2011) (stating that Amendment 706 is \u201cneither a permanent nor a complete solution\u201d to problems generated by the crack-to-powder ratio of 100-to-l, but instead an \u201cinterim\u201d one); U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, <em>Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy </em>10 (2007) (describing Amendment 706 as \u201conly ... a partial remedy\u201d); <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 100, 128 S.Ct. 558, 569, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (noting that Amendment 706 was a \u201cmodest amendment\u201d that provided \u201can ameliorating change\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Nor is it, in fact, the view of Congress. Indeed, while Amendment 706 lowered the crack-to-powder ratio to a range between 25-to-l and 80-to-l, <em>see Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 106, 128 S.Ct. at 573, Congress went further when it enacted the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). That legislation lowered the crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-l and directed the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines in order to \u201cachieve consistency\u201d with that ratio. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">As Smith suggests, it is clear from this that Congress thought \u201cAmendment 706 did not go far enough.\u201d The FSA unambiguously reflects Congress\u2019s judgment that the crack-to-powder ratios under Amendment 706 continued to overstate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>seriousness of crack cocaine offenses; continued to detract from the sentencing goal of punishing major drug traffickers more seriously than low-level dealers; and continued to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system in light of racial disparities. <em>See Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2328-29; <em>see also Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 97-98, 128 S.Ct. at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Amendment 750 embodies this very congressional judgment: it is the amendment to the guidelines that the Sentencing Commission specifically adopted at the behest of Congress in order to implement the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C vol. Ill at 392-94 (noting that Amendment 750 was made pursuant to Congress\u2019s directive).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, by suggesting that a reduction under Amendment 706 renders a reduction under Amendment 750 unnecessary or otherwise inappropriate, the district court took a position that is strikingly in tension with the policy judgment of the Sentencing Commission and, more importantly, of Congress itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">We have often recognized, in the context of sentencing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that district courts enjoy broad discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1203 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that district courts have \u201cgreat discretion in determining how to weigh those factors\u201d), including the weight to be given to the policy judgment of the Sentencing Commission itself, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4), (5); <em>see also Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1184 (declining to establish an \u201cacross-the-board prescription regarding the appropriate deference to give [to] the Guidelines\u201d). And rarely do we find that a district court has committed a clear error of judgment in making this determination. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">But we have done so in a few cases. For instance, in <em>United States v. Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d 1085 (11th Cir.2011), we held that the district court made \u201ca clear error of judgment about the sentencing of [the] career offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117. We ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>served that \u201cCongress ha[d] expressed a desire that career offenders receive sentences \u2018of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h)), and that the defendant\u2019s \u201cGuidelines sentence reflected this policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>By imposing a sentence below the guidelines range, the district court erroneously \u201cdeviated from this policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Similarly, in <em>Pugh, </em>we vacated a below-guidelines sentence in part because it was not consistent with two policy judgments Congress had made. 515 F.3d at 1182, 1194-1208. First, we noted that the \u201cdetailed legislative findings and numerous legislative enactments\u201d made by Congress in the area of child pornography clearly demonstrated its recognition of \u201cthe terrible harm child pornography inflicts on its victims.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1197-98 &amp; n. 12. In view of this, we held that the below-guidelines sentence had to be vacated because it did not hew to this congressional recognition and thus failed to give adequate weight to the seriousness of the offense. <em>See id. </em>at 1198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Second, we found error in the district court\u2019s decision not to impose a term of supervised release. <em>See id. </em>at 1199-1202. We noted that, because of \u201cthe high rate of recidivism,\u201d both \u201cCongress and the Sentencing Commission intended to impose life terms of supervised release on sex offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1199 (quotation marks omitted). By not imposing any term of supervised release, we indicated, the district court failed to \u201cgive any real weight\u201d to the views of the Sentencing Commission, <em>see id. </em>at 1200, and unreasonably discounted Congress\u2019s concern about protecting the public from further crimes of the defendant, <em>see id. </em>at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">We came to similar conclusions in our en banc decision in <em>Irey, </em>where we also set aside a sentence as unreasonable. 612 F.3d at 1166. Noting Congress\u2019s concern about the risk of recidivism for sex offenders, we held that the district court \u201cmade a clear error of judgment\u201d in concluding that a sentence below the guidelines would be sufficient to protect the public. <em>See id. </em>at 1166, 1214, 1217. Along these lines, we also concluded that the district court \u201cmade a clear error of judgment in downplaying the importance of deterring\u201d child sex abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 1212. We acknowledged \u201c[t]he sentencing judge\u2019s skepticism about deterring these types of crimes,\u201d but we emphasized that neither Congress nor the Sentencing Commission shared that sentiment. <em>Id. </em>at 1210.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">It is true that, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts may disagree with the policy judgments of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1217. But, as our precedent also shows, there is significantly less room for a district court to disagree with a policy judgment that is shared by the Commission and by Congress. At the very least, a district court must articulate \u201csufficiently compelling reasons to justify\u201d its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1211, 1212 n. 32 (quotation marks omitted). \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Here, the district court took a position that is contrary to that of the Sentencing Commission and of Congress when it indicated that a reduction under Amendment 706 renders a reduction under Amendment 750 unnecessary or otherwise inappropriate. Both the Sentencing Commission and Congress clearly thought that Amendment 706 did not go far enough in addressing the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, and that the treatment of crack cocaine under that measure continued to have the effect of undermining the goals of federal sentencing. The district court gave no explanation as to why it disagreed with this. In light of our precedent, such a deviation is a clear error of judgment. <em>See, e.g., Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Unsurprisingly, the government does not attempt to defend the district court\u2019s position on this issue. The government instead notes that \u201cthe [district] court mentioned the fact of the previous reduction [only] as one of several facts weighing against a further reduction.\u201d The government thus urges us to view the error as harmless. On this record, however, we cannot do so. Indeed, the district court did not indicate that it would have denied Smith\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction based only on the remaining factors that it considered. <em>Cf. United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006) (affirming a sentence in part because the district court indicated that it would have imposed the sentence, even if it were wrong about an issue in calculating the guideline range).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">For the reasons set out above, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Smith\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no views as to whether, upon reconsideration of the relevant factors, the district court should or should not grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-8\">. Smith argues for the first time in his reply brief that the district court failed to provide notice of its intent to rely on his disciplinary infraction to rule on his request for a sentence reduction, in violation of our holding in <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2010). Under our precedent, issues not raised in an appellant\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-5\">. Amendment 750 is thus unlike many amendments to the guidelines, which are adopted at the initiative of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See generally Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (describing the revision of the guidelines).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b948-6\">. One might say that the district court did not disagree with the policy behind Amendment 750, but rather the Sentencing Commission\u2019s decision to make that amendment retroactively applicable. <em>See generally </em>U.S.S.G.App. C vol. III at 418-19 (describing the reasons for Amendment 759, which made Amendment 750 retroactively applicable). We reject that characterization. The Sentencing Commission focuses on three factors in determining whether an amendment should apply retroactively: 1) the purpose of the amendment, 2) the magnitude of the change made by the amendment, and 3) the difficulty of applying the amendment retroactively. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10 bckgrd. note. The district court here did not quarrel with the Sentencing Commission's conclusion that the change engendered by Amendment 750 was significant or that it would be manageable to apply Amendment 750 retroactively. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C vol. III at 419. Thus, if the district court did take issue with the retroac-tivity of Amendment 750, it was, at bottom, a disagreement with the policy concerns behind the FSA and, by extension, Amendment 750 itself. <em>See id. </em>at 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b948-10\">.As the Supreme Court has observed, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not \"a sentencing or resentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2690; <em>see also id. </em>at 2691 (noting that Congress did not authorize \"a plenary resen-tencing proceeding\"). For this reason, our precedent on sentencing does not completely fit here. Still, a district court that rules upon a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, just as it does during a sentencing proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i). Our precedent governing the weighing of those factors in the sentencing context is therefore instructive here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. Deviations from the policy judgment of Congress also led to our decisions to vacate the sentences imposed in <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1240-42 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that the below-guidelines sentence was inconsistent with Congress\u2019s special concern about deterrence in the area of white-collar crimes), <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>587 F.3d 1274, 1279 (11th Cir.2009) (same), and <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2006) (vacating a sentence of five hours imprisonment as an attempt to \"evade\u201d the requirement imposed by Congress that a defendant convicted of the offense that was at issue be sentenced to a term of imprisonment). <em>Cf. United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1368-69 (11th Cir.2010) (upholding an upward variance in light of a later-enacted measure by Congress to amend the guidelines to punish the offense more severely).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b950-6\">. The government observes that Smith\u2019s sentence of 130 months imprisonment falls within the amended guideline range \u2014 under Amendment 750 and prior to any departure\u2014 of 120 months to 137 months imprisonment. This observation misses the point, however. As the government itself acknowledges, the Sentencing Commission has provided that, in the case of a defendant whose original term of imprisonment was below his original guideline range because of his substantial assistance to the government, a district court may grant \"a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(b)(2)(B). This rule reflects the recognition \u2014 shared by the Sentencing Commission and Congress \u2014 that \"defendants who provide substantial assistance are differently situated than other defendants and should be considered for a sentence below a guideline or statutory minimum even when defendants who are otherwise similar (but did not provide substantial assistance) are subject to a guideline or statutory minimum.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C vol. III at 420. The government concedes that Smith is eligible for a comparable reduction, and it does not dispute Smith's calculation that his amended guideline range \u2014 if the downward departure for substantial assistance were taken into account- \u2014 would be 92 months to 115 months imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
