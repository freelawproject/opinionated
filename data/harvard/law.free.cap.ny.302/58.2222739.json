Uses offensive, disorderly, threatening, abusive or insulting language, conduct or behavior;</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>\u201c </em>2. Acts in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The testimony for the prosecution was that defendant, one of the tenants in a six-family apartment building, went to the door of one of the other apartments and, standing in the hallway, delivered herself of various objurgations and imprecations, some of them in obscene language, and all spoken to, and concerning, the two occupants of that other apartment. Another tenant testified that about the same time he heard similar vocal violence from defendant, who was then on one of the stairways of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The appellate court reversed the conviction. We agree that defendant\u2019s conduct did not rise (or fall) to the level required by the statute quoted above. Of course, what she did was in fact disorderly and did interfere with the peace and quiet of some of the occupants of the dwelling. But the disturbance was a private, not a public one, and three persons only appear to have heard the tirade.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The key phrase of the statute is \u201c breach of the peace \u201d and, traditionally, that language means a violation of public order and tranquility (see 5 Words and Phrases, p. 763 <em>et seq.; </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [3d ed.], p. 246; Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 116; Personal Property Law, \u00a7 76). The classic definition, in modern times, of \u201c breach of the peace \u201d is given by <em>People </em>v. <em>Most </em>(171 N. Y. 423, 429): \u201c It is a disturbance of public order by an act of violence, or by any act likely to produce violence, or which, by causing consternation and alarm, disturbs the peace and quiet of the community.\u201d \u201c The offense known as breach of the peace embraces a great variety of conduct destroying or menacing public order and tranquility \u201d <em>(Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U. S. 296, 308). And so, to constitute \u201c disorderly conduct \u201d there must be an actual or threatened \u201c breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>peace \u201d, which, in turn, means a \u201c disturbance of the tranquility of the People of the State \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>265 N. Y. 362, 365). Here there was no troubling of the wonted calm of the whole community, or of any sizeable segment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>It is difficult to define exactly and comprehensively the kind of conduct which \u2018 tends to a breach of the peace \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>248 N. Y. 182, 185), and no such difficult task will be attempted herein. We wish to make it clear, however, that we are not holding that the offense of disorderly conduct cannot be committed inside a building. Indeed, section 722 itself, in its fifth subdivision, lists, as one kind of disorderly conduct, shouts or noisemaking \u201c either outside or inside a building during the night time to the annoyance or disturbance of any considerable number of persons \u201d. Nowadays, many a large multiple dwelling houses a <em>\u201c </em>considerable number of persons \u201d, and it is easy to imagine, within such a building, disorder which might seriously interfere with public peace. So, the test is not whether the activity complained of was indoors or outdoors, but whether it had in it the traditional elements of an actual or likely \u201c breach of the peace \u201d, as that ancient phrase has usually been construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Loughran, Oh. J., Lewis, Conway, Dye, Fuld and Froessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
