The comptroller has not promulgated any regulation requiring anything more to be done and respondents should not be permitted to impose a more rigorous standard than that set by the Civil Practice Act (\u00a7 505) in like circumstances. <em>(Browne </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>241 N. Y. 96; <em>Robia Holding Corp. </em>v. <em>Walker </em>257 N. Y. 431; <em>People ex rel. 270 Park Ave. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>295 N.

Eelator having served only the order on April 30, 1945, and having delayed the making of an application for audit and allowance until November 28, 1947, the Appellate Division,properly held that no interest was payable for the period between those two dates. <em>(O\u2019Keeffe </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>176 N.

Service of a certified copy of that order upon the comptroller of the city of New York, and service of a copy thereof, with notice of entry, together with a letter of transmittal by relator\u2019s attorney upon the department of finance, were sufficient to start interest running on the refund <em>(People ex rel. 270 Park Ave. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>295 N. Y. 589; Tax Law, \u00a7 296, subd.,2). It is unnecessary to consider the effect of any alleged regulation of the comptroller to the contrary, for no such regulation has ever been officially promulgated (New York City Charter [1938], \u00a7 885). The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and that of Special Term affirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Loughean, Ch.
