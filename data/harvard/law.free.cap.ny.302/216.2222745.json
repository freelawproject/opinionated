Section 7512 of the Unconsolidated Laws, in purporting to delegate to The Jockey Club the power to act as a public officer and to exercise the licensing and taxing power of the State, including the power to forbid the use and enjoyment of property, occupation and liberty, violates the State and Federal Constitutions because government and its licensing power cannot be delegated to The Jockey Club, a private corporation. Moreover, as a private corporation, the club cannot constitutionally be constituted a public officer. <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; Hudson Riv. Humane Soc., </em>25 App. Div. 26, 165 N. Y. 517; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter Coal Co., </em>298 U. S. 239; <em>Schechter Poultry Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U. S. 495; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>104 Kan. 141; <em>Ames </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>Port Huron Log Driving &amp; Booming Co., </em>11 Mich. 139.) II. Section 7512 is also unconstitutional because it empowers The Jockey Club, a private corporation, to exact taxes and excises in unstated amounts from the applicant owners, trainers and jockeys, and to use proceeds therefrom for its own purposes. It also is unconstitutional as a delegation of the power to \u201c fix \u201d the rates of taxes or excises on owners, trainers and jockeys, and therefore also to fix the taxing policy of the State. It also is unconstitutional as an appropriation of an annual \u201c contribution \u201d of $15,000 to The Jockey Club for a longer period than two years. <em>(Gautier </em>v. <em>Ditmar, </em>204 N. Y. 20; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; Hudson Riv. Humane Soc., </em>25 App. Div. 26, 165 N. Y. 517; <em>People ex rel. Einsfeld </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>149 N.

As an attempted delegation of legislative power, the provision in section 7512 of the Unconsolidated Laws that <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of maintaining a proper control over race meetings \u201d, The Jockey Club may grant or refuse licenses to owners, is void, illegal and unconstitutional in that it prescribes no conditions at all for the granting or refusal of such licenses, and in that it prescribes no stated, clear and ascertainable standards and requirements for controlling the action and determination of this private corporation, or for protecting the civil rights and property rights of the owner. Moreover, since this plenary delegation is to a private corporation which has, and the members and officers of which also have, private and pecuniary interests, nonclub members are thereby denied due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. <em>(Matter of Merritt </em>v. <em>Swope, </em>267 App. Div. 519; <em>Darweger </em>v. <em>Staats, </em>267 N.

Petitioner has no constitutional right to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>race horses, or to have a license to run race horses, for purses and on the tracks of others, particularly where there has been a unanimously confirmed factual finding of disqualification. <em>(Corrigan </em>v. <em>Coney Is.

Jockey Club, </em>296 N. Y. 249.) II. Appellant is estopped from attacking section 7512 of the Unconsolidated Laws in regard to his hearing before the Joint Board (as to 1949) and in regard to the denial of his license (as to 1950) by The Jockey Club. Furthermore, the questions urged are not within the limits of either article 78 proceeding. <em>(Grannan </em>v. <em>Westchester Racing Assn., </em>153 N.

S. 300.) III. Section 7512 of the Unconsolidated Laws was validly enacted pursuant to the constitutional mandate and is appropriate to prevent such offenses as appellant\u2019s against section 9 of article I of the Constitution. <em>(People ex rel. Sturgis </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>152 N. Y. 1; <em>People ex rel. Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>152 N. Y. 12; <em>Grannan </em>v. <em>Westchester Racing Assn., </em>153 N.

Section 7512 is not invalid as failing to prescribe standards for granting licenses to horse owners or as improperly delegating legislative functions to a private corporation; nor is Rule of Racing 34 (a) vague or invalid in its application to appellant\u2019s book-making and gambling connections. <em>(Grannan </em>v. <em>Westchester Racing Assn., </em>153 N.

The statute challenged reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u201c \u00a7 7512. <em>Licenses for participants and employees at race meetings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>\u201c </em>1. For the purpose of maintaining a proper control over race meetings conducted pursuant to section seven of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>act [Unconsol. Laws, \u00a7 7508], <em>the Jockey Club shall license owners, trainers and jockeys at running races </em>and the National Steeplechase Association shall license owners, trainers and jockeys at steeplechases and hunts. They shall also license such other persons exercising their occupations or employed at race meetings held pursuant to this act as the state racing commission may, by rule or regulation, determine. The state racing commission shall fix the license fees to be paid by,persons or corporations so licensed, which fees shall be paid to the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association upon the issuance of each such license, and no such license shall be valid until the receipt of such fee shall be endorsed thereon by the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association. Each such license unless revoked by the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association for cause shall be for the period of one year from April first of the year in which the same shall be issued. From the proceeds of such license fees, the Jockey Club and National Steeplechase Association together shall be entitled to retain annually the sum of fifteen thousand dollars for the payment of reasonable expenses in issuing such licenses and collecting such fees, and for contribution toward the expenses of the breeding bureau of the Jockey Club. On or before December first, annually, they shall file with the state racing commission a detailed statement of all such license fees indicating the amount thereof and from whom collected, and shall pay to the commission for the use of the state the balance, if any, in excess of the amount which they are authorized by this section to retain for the purposes specified herein. All officials connected with the actual conduct of racing, appointed by the Jockey Club, National Steeplechase Association or the associations or corporations licensed by the commission, shall be approved by the state racing commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>\u201c </em>2. No such license shall be revoked unless such revocation is made at a meeting of the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association or of the stewards thereof. The failure of the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association to act upon an application for a license within fifteen days shall be deemed a refusal of the license. Upon the application to the state racing commission of a person whose license has been refused or revoked, made within thirty days after service by mail on such person of a notice of such refusal or revocation, such person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>shall be entitled to a prompt hearing before a joint session of the state racing commission and two stewards of the Jockey Club or National Steeplechase Association who did not participate in the refusal or revocation of such license by such Club or Association, which joint session, acting as a board, shall take final action thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201c 3. The state racing commission and two stewards of the jockey club or national steeplechase association, at a joint session and, acting as a board, shall have the power to suspend and/or revoke any license granted under this section after giving the licensee a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Insofar as appears from the records before us The Jockey Club\u2019s corporate charter has at no time empowered it to grant licenses of any kind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only authority for the licensing power exercised by The Jockey Club came with the enactment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>of section 5 of chapter 310 of the Laws of 1934, which added to chapter 440 of the Laws of 1926, a new section 9-b which (as amd. by L. 1935, ch. 613; L. 1939, ch. 837, and L. 1947, ch. 196) is now section 7512 of the Unconsolidated Laws (quoted <em>supra). </em>Under authority which had its origin in that statute (L. 1934, ch. 310, \u00a7 5, as amd.), The Jockey Club, a private corporation, for the purpose \u25a0\u2014 as declared by the Legislature \u2014 of \u201c * * * maintaining a proper control over race meetings conducted pursuant to section seven of this act [Uneonsol. Laws, \u00a7 7508] \u201d was authorized to \u201c license owners, trainers and jockeys at running races * * *.\u201d Under section 7508 <em>id. </em>the Legislature provided further that <em>\u201c Every such license </em>shall contain a condition that all running races or race meetings conducted thereunder <em>shall be subject to the reasonable rules and regulations from time to time 'prescribed by the Jockey Club, a corporation organised under the laws of the state of New York * </em>* *.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The rules prescribed by The Jockey Club are known as the \u201c Rules of Racing \u201d of which <em>\u201c </em>Rule 34 \u201d, bearing the caption \u201c Powers of the Stewards of The Jockey Club \u201d, provides in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">(&lt; 34.(a) The Stewards of The Jockey Club shall have power, <em>at their discretion, </em>to grant licenses to Owners, Trainers and Jockeys and to such other persons, exercising their occupations or employed at race meetings as the State Racing Commission may determine to require a license from The Jackey Club; and such Stewards may revoke or suspend such licenses in accordance with the then existing laws of the State of New York. Every such license issued by The Jockey Club shall provide that the licensee shall comply with the Rules and Regulations of the Commission and these Rules of Racing, and that violation thereof may be punished by fine, suspension of the privileges accorded thereby, or revocation of the license. No license shall be issued by said Stewards to a person shown <em>to the satisfaction of said Stewards </em>to he engaged, or to have been engaged in practices detrimental to the best interests of racing, including hook-making or pool-selling, or to anyone so shown to be or to have been connected with any such person in any such practice, provided that, in cases in which the Stewards shall find that such occupation or connection has ceased for a sufficiently long period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>of time, they may, <em>in their discretion, </em>issue such license. Nor shall a license be issued by said Stewards to a person so shown to <em>be undesirable or financially irresponsible or otherwise unqualified.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>\u201c </em>(b) Upon application to the State Racing Commission of a person whose license has been refused or revoked, made within such period as may be prescribed by the then existing laws of the State of New York, such person shall be entitled to a prompt hearing before a joint session of the State Racing Commission and two Stewards of The Jockey Club in accordance with said laws, which joint session, acting as a board, shall take final action thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u201c The State Racing Commission and two Stewards of The Jockey Club at a joint session, and acting as a board, shall have the power to suspend and/or revoke any license granted under Rule 34(a) after giving a licensee a reasonable opportunity to be heard * * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">It thus appears that for the declared purpose of maintaining a proper control over race meetings within the State, the Legislature by sections 7512 and 7508 of the Unconsolidated Laws <em>(supra) </em>has delegated to The Jockey Club the power to license horse owners, trainers and jockeys at running races and, as an incident to that licensing power and under subdivision (a) of rule 34 of The Jockey Club\u2019s \u201c Rules of Racing \u201d, the stewards of that club are authorized to grant such licenses \u201c <em>at their discretion </em>\u201d. In fact, in the exercise of the broad discretion vested in them in the issuance of licenses \u2014 essentially a sovereign power \u2014 the stewards are officers of The Jockey Club who are neither chosen by, nor responsible to the State government. They are not sworn as public officers, nor are they removable as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The respondents rely chiefly upon <em>Grannan </em>v. <em>Westchester Racing Assn. </em>(153 N. Y. 449). There this court ruled that the Westchester Racing Association could lawfully exclude from its track the plaintiff who admitted he had bribed a jockey and had thereby violated one of the association\u2019s rules. In that case, however, the Westchester Racing Association was licensed pursuant to statute (L. 1895, ch. 570) by the State Racing Commission \u2014 a governmental administrative body \u2014 rather than by a private corporation such as The Jockey Club. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>that case can hardly be invoked as authority for a view contrary to that indicated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We are told that benefits of great worth to the maintenance of proper control over race meetings and to the improvement of the breed of horses have been derived from action by The Jockey Club. Even assuming that fact we are mindful that <em>\u201c </em>* * * nothing is more certain than that beneficent aims, however great or well directed, can never serve in lieu of constitutional power.\u201d <em>(Carter </em>v. <em>Carter Coal Co., </em>298 U. S. 238, 291.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In our view the delegation by the Legislature of its licensing power to The Jockey Club, a private corporation, is such an abdication as to be patently an unconstitutional relinquishment of legislative power in violation of section 1 of article III of the Constitution of this State which provides: <em>\u201c </em>The legislative power of this State shall be vested in the Senate and Assembly.\u201d (See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mohawk &amp; Hudson Riv. Humane Soc., </em>25 App. Div. 26, 33, affd. 165 N. Y. 517, 524, 528; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter Coal Co., supra, </em>p. 311; <em>Schechter Poultry Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U. S. 495, 537; <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>228 Ill. 522, 536; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>104 Kan. 141,143; <em>Baughn </em>v. <em>Gorrel &amp; Riley, </em>311 Ky. 537; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>City of Milwaukee, </em>177 Wis. 410, 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Even if the Legislature\u2019s power to license had been delegated to a governmental agency, the statute now challenged would have to be stricken down for lack of guides and proper standards. <em>(Packer Collegiate Inst. </em>v. <em>University of State of N. Y., </em>298 N. Y. 184, 191-192; <em>Matter of Small </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>279 N. Y. 288, 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The order of the Appellate Division confirming the determination by respondents refusing the petitioner\u2019s application for an owner\u2019s license for the year beginning April 1, 1949, should be reversed and the determination of the Joint Board annulled, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division. The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the petitioner\u2019s application for the annulment of a determination by the stewards of The Jockey Club made March 9,1950, should be reversed and the determination of The Jockey Club annulled, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">Loughran, Ch. J., Conway, Desmond, Dye, Fuld and Fboessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em> </em>Appellant Fink instituted under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act the two proceedings which are the subject of the present appeals: The proceeding first captioned above is concerned with a determination by a \u201cjoint board\u201d \u25a0\u2014 comprising two members of The Jockey Club and three members of the State Racing Commission \u2014 made during 1949, which upheld the refusal of The Jockey Club to issue to appellant a license to run his horses at race meetings in this State during that year. The second proceeding concerns the subsequent refusal of The Jockey Club to consider appellant\u2019s application for a similar license for the year 1950 pending the determination of the first ease. The parties stipulated that both proceedings were to he transferred to the Appellate Division, which court unanimously confirmed without opinion the decision of the Joint Board in the first proceeding and dismissed the petition in the second proceeding on the law. The appeals to this court are taken as of right on constitutional grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> \u201c The Jockey Club <em>\u201d </em>was incorporated in 1894, pursuant to chapter 213 of the Laws of 1891.
