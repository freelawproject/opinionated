This was a common practice known to the employer. During the conversation Fothergill offered claimant a drink from a bottle containing a clear liquid and labeled \u201c Barclay\u2019s Gin \u201d, The claimant, after satisfying himself that the department\u2019s \u201c straw boss \u201d who was changing his clothes nearby was not watching, took the bottle, stepped behind a large noisy electrical machine designated as a \u201c DC converter \u201d where he would be concealed from view, unscrewed the cork and drank. The bottle contained not gin as he expected, but carbon tetrachloride, a fact known to Fothergill but deliberately withheld from claimant. Fothergill had obtained the liquid with the employer\u2019s permission from the company\u2019s supply room for his personal use. Later, while claimant was riding home with Fothergill, he became violently ill. The poisonous liquid did severe damage to his internal organs, resulting in the disability complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Claimant at the time was a member of a labor union, the United States Steel Workers of America, which, in acting as bargaining agent, had negotiated a contract with the employer which read in part, viz.: \u201c possession of or drinking liquor or any alcoholic beverage on company property at any time * * * is forbidden and shall constitute a just cause for immediate dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The testimony is conflicting as to whether the claimant knew about this rule prior to the accident \u2014 the employer adducing testimony that each employee had a copy of the contract and that it was accepted and obeyed by the employees, and that it knew of no violation \u2014 whereas the claimant would only admit that he learned about the rule at the hearing. Whether or not he knew about such rule prior to the accident is not determinative of the issue here, which is not whether his act, under the rule warranted dismissal, but whether he should be denied com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pensation because his injuries did not arise out of his employment. In other words, did his conduct under the circumstances amount to an abandonment of his employment as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">It is well established that disregard of the precise terms of employment does not necessarily constitute an abandonment thereof (cf. <em>Matter of O\u2019Bryan </em>v. <em>Town of Jewett, </em>296 N. Y. 785; <em>Matter of Dann </em>v. <em>Town of Veteran, </em>278 N. Y. 461), nor does violation of a rule not promulgated but which under the circumstances might reasonably be implied, bar compensation benefits <em>(Matter of Lang </em>v. <em>Franklin Ry. Supply Co., </em>272 App. Div. 988, motion for leave to appeal denied 297 N. Y. 1036; <em>Matter of Currivan </em>v. <em>Friesler Realty Co., </em>273 App. Div. 834, motion for leave to appeal denied 297 N. Y. 1033). Viewed in the light of these authorities, a violation \u2014 if such there was \u2014 of the no-drinking rule under penalty of dismissal, may and should not be treated any differently for purposes of compensation than the violation of any other rule designed to improve plant efficiency and to safeguard employees (cf. <em>Matter of Chila </em>v. <em>New York Central R. R. Co., </em>251 App. Div. 575, affd. 275 N. Y. 585; <em>Matter of Brenchley </em>v. <em>International Heater Co., </em>227 App. Div. 831, affd. 254 N. Y. 536; <em>Matter of Fox </em>v. <em>Truslow &amp; Fulle, Inc., </em>204 App. Div. 584, affd. 236 N. Y. 634).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Here the board has found as a fact, from all the surrounding circumstances, that the injuries arose out of the claimant\u2019s employment. The contention of the employer and its insurance carrier that the employee by breaking the no-drinking rule forfeits compensation must be rejected, and he may not be penalized for an intention to do so because he drank from a bottle labeled gin in an expectation that it contained gin. When he unwittingly drank carbon tetrachloride knowingly handed to him by a coemployee \u2014 who had it with the employer\u2019s permission\u2014 he was not injured because he violated a rule of the plant, but, on the contrary, because he was the innocent victim of a cruel and senseless joke. WTien so viewed the employer is not to be exonerated from the consequences of such an act under a theory that it constituted an abandonment of employment but, rather, he may be held under the theory that the-injurious act fell naturally into that category of conduct known to the law as \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>horseplay \u2019 \u2019. To be victimized by a prank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>perpetrated by a coemployee has long been recognized as an incident of employment, as something reasonably to be expected, a peril of service; an indulgence in a moment\u2019s diversion from work to joke with or play a prank upon a fellow workman is a matter of common knowledge to everyone who employs labor <em>(Matter of Leonbruno </em>v. <em>Champlain Silk Mills, </em>229 N. Y. 470; <em>Thom </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>[1917] A. C. 127; <em>Matter of Redner </em>v. <em>Faber &amp; Son, </em>223 N. Y. 379) and an employee so injured will be allowed compensation benefits if the board is satisfied that the acts were incidental to the employment <em>(Matter of Industrial Comr. [Siguin] </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>295 N. Y. 443; <em>Matter of Lang </em>v. <em>Franklin Ry. Supply Co., supra; Matter of Chanin </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>271 App. Div. 763; cf. <em>Matter of Gaurin </em>v. <em>Bagley &amp; Sewall Co., </em>298 N. Y. 511). But when the board is not so satisfied, compensation will be denied <em>(Matter of Gaurin </em>v. <em>Bagley &amp; Sewall Co., </em>supra; <em>Matter of Ognibene </em>v. <em>Rochester Mfg. Co., </em>298 N. Y. 85). These general principles are equally available here, particularly as it is quite apparent from the evidence that the claimant, although collaborating or participating in the event, was not the instigator thereof but was its innocent victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Perhaps it would be well to say also that an award in horseplay cases should not depend on evidence of foreseeability. It is an important element <em>(Matter of McCarthy </em>v. <em>Remington Rand, Inc., </em>300 N. Y. 715), but not necessarily conclusive. To introduce such an arbitrary and anomalous rule hardly seems consonant with the liberal policy incident to the administration of the statute. The test is whether the injurious horseplay may reasonably be regarded as an incident of the employment <em>(Matter of Leonbruno </em>v. <em>Champlain Silk Mills, supra) </em>\u2014 rather than the foreseeability of a particular prank \u2014 that supports the finding of fact that it arose out of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Furthermore, the claimant here is in very much the same position as the victim of an unprovoked assault \u2014 malicious or friendly \u2014 and the principles pertaining thereto are equally pertinent here <em>(Matter of Levy </em>v. <em>World-Telegram Corp., </em>259 App. Div. 943, affd. 285 N. Y. 533; <em>Matter of Sewell </em>v. <em>Johnson Auto Body Shop, </em>274 App. Div. 957, motion for leave to appeal denied 298 N. Y. 937; <em>Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>Tietjen &amp; Steffin Milk Co., </em>235 App. Div. 470, affd. 261 N. Y. 549; <em>Matter of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Verschleiser </em>v. <em>Stern &amp; Son, </em>229 N. Y. 192; <em>Matter of Chanin </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., supra; Hartford Accident &amp; Ind. Co. </em>v. <em>Cardillo, </em>112 F. 2d 11, certiorari denied 310 U. S. 649).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b168-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ8z\">(dissenting). A company rule forbade the drinking of intoxicating liquor and an agreement between the employer and the union, of which the employees were members, rendered a violation of that rule basis for \u201c immediate dismissal.\u201d The rule was, as noted in the court\u2019s opinion (p. 133) \u201c accepted and obeyed by the employees,\u201d and there is not the slightest evidence either that any employee had ever before taken a drink while on the job, that the employer by word or conduct had ever relaxed the rule, or that it had ever indicated that it would permit drinking on the premises. Under such circumstances, it passes understanding to hold that an employee, who furtively accepts a drink, <em>believing it to be gin, </em>is entitled to compensation because the fellow employee, who offered him the drink, endowed with a cruelly perverted sense of humor, had filled the proffered bottle with poisonous carbon tetrachloride.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Our inquiry here, as in all workmen\u2019s compensation cases, is whether the injury arose out of \u2014 as well as in the course of \u2014 the employment. In the case before us, there is no suggestion that the drinking was done, even in the remotest or most farfetched sense of the term, in the course of any assigned job, or that it was a <em>permitted </em>incidental diversion which the employer had knowledge of and had impliedly adopted through sufferance or acquiescence. Here, claimant\u2019s act \u2014 and it is important to bear in mind that he could never have become the victim of the prank in question until and unless he first performed that act \u2014 was just as far removed from the scope of his employment as it would have been had he become ill from drinking bad liquor from a bottle which he himself had brought into the factory, in violation of a company rule, to assuage his thirst with an occasional nip. Surely, no one could possibly claim that the employee was entitled to compensation in such a case merely because the drinking had occurred in the factory during working hours. (See <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm., </em>21 Cal. 2d 281, 284.) In the California case, Elliot, having become ill during working hours, took a drink \u2014 \u201cas * * * medica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tian \u201d \u2014 from a bottle which he believed held wine, though in fact it contained carbon tetrachloride. Although the court upheld the ensuing award, it was at pains to caution that the result would have been different if the employee had taken a drink \u201c of intoxicating liquor for the mere satisfaction of a desire therefor * * * rather than * * * for medicinal purposes \u201d (21 Cal. 2d, <em>supra, </em>at p. 284).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">It does not end our task to declare that the employee was the victim of prank or horseplay, for, if, when the injury occurred, he had stepped out of his working environment, had abandoned his employment, in order to indulge in an extra-employment caper or activity, it would necessarily follow that his injury neither arose out of his employment nor resulted from a risk of that employment. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Ognibene </em>v. <em>Rochester Mfg. Co., </em>298 N. Y. 85, 87; <em>Matter of Gaurin </em>v. <em>Bagley &amp; Sewall Co., </em>298 N. Y. 511; <em>Matter of Industrial Comr. [Siguin] </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>295 N. Y. 443, 446-447; <em>Matter of Leonbruno </em>v. <em>Champlain Silk Mills, </em>229 N. Y. 470, 472-473.) That being so, all relationship to the prank and horseplay cases is obliterated, any reliance upon them misplaced. In any event, though, whether the claimant\u2019s extra-employment activity is to be deemed an incident of employment depends in large measure upon whether it has been regularized by long indulgence, upon whether there has been <em>\u201c </em>continuity of practice \u2014 conduct which has gained acceptance \u201d. <em>(Matter of Ognibene </em>v. <em>Rochester Mfg. Co., supra, </em>298 N. Y. 85, 87; see, also, <em>Matter of McCarthy </em>v. <em>Remington Rand, Inc., </em>300 N. Y. 715; <em>Matter of Gaurin </em>v. <em>Bagley &amp; Sewall Co., supra, </em>298 N. Y. 511; <em>Matter of Industrial Comr. [Siguin] </em>v. <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>295 N. Y. 443, 446-447; <em>Matter of Leonbruno </em>v. <em>Champlain Silk Mills, supra, </em>229 N. Y. 470, 472-473.) Thus, in affirming an award for compensation in the <em>McCarthy </em>case <em>(supra, </em>295 N. Y. 443), we stressed the \u201c long-continuing custom and practice \u201d of the conduct there involved and the \u201c continued series of related and similar incidents participated in by all the employees \u201d (p. 447), and, in the <em>Remington Rand </em>case <em>(supra, </em>300 N. Y. 715), where the employee took a drink of carbon tetrachloride at a New Year\u2019s party held in the factory, under the belief, also induced by a practical joker, that it was whiskey, we upheld the award solely upon the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>evidence was ample to sustain the finding that the employer, knowing that the drinking of intoxicating liquor occurred at such parties, sanctioned the practice and, by that token, transformed such drinking and its attendant consequences into risks of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">We have seen that here the case was entirely different. The record establishes that there never before had been any drinking in the factory \u2014 this being \u201c <em>a single isolated incident </em>which originated solely and entirely in the injured employee\u2019s own act \u201d <em>(Matter of Industrial Comr. </em>[Siguin] v. <em>McCarthy, supra, </em>295 N. Y. 443, 447) \u2014 and the employer had never permitted, or even intimated that he would have permitted, such conduct. There is no escape from the conclusion that, when claimant was injured, he had deliberately abandoned his employment in order to indulge in an activity entirely unrelated to his work \u2014 and the employer\u2019s rule against drinking forcefully points up and accentuates the fact of such abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I am not suggesting that the violation of every company rule disqualifies an employee from compensation for resulting injuries. Some rules, such as those prescribing work routines or protective devices, are designed expressly for the individual employee\u2019s personal protection, and it would frustrate the very purpose and aim of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law to hold that a violation of that type of rule removed the employee from his employment. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Corrina </em>v. <em>De Barbieri, </em>247 N. Y. 357; <em>Capital Tr. Co. </em>v. <em>Hoage, </em>84 F. 2d 235; <em>Oklahoma Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>198 Okla. 65.) Not so, however, where the rule, such as the one before us, is obviously designed to protect not only the violator but his fellow employees whose safety is dependent upon his careful and sober operation of machinery or other equipment. It impresses me as principle turned topsy-turvy to sanction payment' of compensation to an employee who performs \u2014 or believes that he is performing \u2014 an act that calls for summary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the claim dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Lotjghban, Ch.
