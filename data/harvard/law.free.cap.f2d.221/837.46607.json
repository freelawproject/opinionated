The United States had sued the Potomac Chemical Co., Inc., a corporation chartered under the laws of the District of Columbia, for a money judgment. The Tr -j. <em>a </em>oa a , \u2022 ,, , \u201e , United States being unable to find any ~ \u201e ,, officer or representative of the corpora- ,. . ,, ^ \u2022 , tion m the District of Columbia on whom , . ,. , , , ,, personal service could be made and the ,, , , , , ... Marshal having returned the summons , \u201e , , \u201e , ... not found, an order for service by publication was made by a judge of the District Court. Publication was then had in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 13-104,13-108,13-109,13-110,13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>111, D.C.Code (1951). On failure of the corporation to appear default was entered by the clerk of the District Court. The United States then moved for judgment by default. This motion was denied and, in addition, the previous entry of default by the clerk was vacated on the ground that service by publication on a domestic corporation was not sufficient to give the District Court jurisdiction tc enter judgment <em>in personam.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To provide an appealable order the court entered judgment, as requested by the United States for that purpose, dismissing its complaint without prejudice; but there after the court <em>sua sponte </em>vacated this order as improvidently granted. Thereupon the present proceedings were instituted by the United States to obtain a direction from this court requiring respondent judge to render a default money judgment for the United States on its claim, contending that the corporation was duly served by publicatim and had defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The United States relies upon \u00a7 13-104 read with \u00a7 13-108. The former provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">\u201cCorporations \u2014 Process by publication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">\u201cIn a suit against a corporation, whethsr foreign or domestic, if process can not be served, such corporation may be proceeded against as a nonresident defendant, by notice by publication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">A nonresident defendant may be proceeded \u00bf.gainst as provided in \u00a7 13-108. This section enables publication to be substituted for personal service of process</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-8\">\u201c * * * upon any defendant who :annot be found and who is shown by affidavit to be a nonresident, or to have been absent from the District for at least six months, or against the unknown heirs or devisees of deceased persons,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">but only in partition, divorce, or annulment suits, by attachment, foreclosure of mortgages and deeds of trust, the establishment of title to real estate by possession, the enforcement of mechanics\u2019 liens and other actions with respect to real or personal property within the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The United States contends that the limitations of \u00a7 13-108 to suits of an <em>in rem </em>nature are not applicable where the suit is against a corporation. It says that by reason of \u00a7 13-104 a corporation that cannot be served by other process can be served by publication under \u00a7 13-108 without regard to the <em>in rem </em>limitations of that section. This position gains strength due to the fact that \u00a7 13-108 applies to \u201cany defendant\u201d, which includes a corporation, so that it can be argued that unless \u00a7 13-104 is intended to permit service by publication on a corporation in an action <em>in personara </em>in appropriate circumstances its provisions are superfluous because a corporation could already be so served in actions <em>in rem.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Notwithstanding the cogency of this reasoning we are reluctant to extend jurisdiction <em>in person-am </em>by publication unless Congress has clearly so provided though we assume there is no constitutional obstacle in the case of domestic corporations. It would have been natural and simple to phrase \u00a7 13-104 specifically to cover suits in which <em>in personam </em>liability is sought to be imposed had that been the intention of Congress. Uncertainty of such intention was inevitable, absent more definite language, in view of the provision in \u00a7 13-104 that a corporation could be proceeded against as a nonresident. For all provisions of the Code for notice by publication against a nonresident defendant pertain solely to actions <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem. </em>Though the expression \u201cany defendant\u201d in \u00a7 13-108 includes a corporation there might have been un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>certainty about this in the legislative mind; for the language modifying the expression is such as ordinarily is used in respect of an individual. It refers to any defendant \u201cwho\u201d cannot be found and \u201cwho\u201d is shown by affidavit to be a nonresident or to have been absent from the District for at least six months. It will also be seen that notice by publication is made a substitute for personal service when the defendant cannot be found \u201cand\u201d is shown by affidavit to be \u201ca nonresident\u201d. This language is hardly suitable for application to a domestic corporation. Some additional provision such as \u00a7 13-104 might have been thought desirable to insure that corporations were included in \u00a7 13-108 to the same extent as individuals. In other words, Congress might have intended by \u00a7 13-104 to serve a purpose other than the extension over corporations of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction through notice by publication. This is emphasized when it is noted that literally to read \u00a7 13-104 as the United States contends would permit an <em>in personam </em>judgment on the basis of such notice even against a foreign corporation which had had no status whatever in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Notice by publication is a substitute for personal service. It is generally unavailable as a basis for fixing personal liability. It is a means of reaching property or relationships that are within the jurisdiction of the court though all parties are not. While these usual limitations upon the efficacy of such service are not as important in the case of corporations as for individuals, as evidenced by decisions that it is consistent with due process of law to obtain jurisdiction in this manner over a corporation in an <em>in personam </em>action,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we think our Code should not be judicially construed to go this far in the absence of greater clarity of legislative intention than is evidenced by \u00a7 13-104. We think it authorizes notice by publication only in the type of cases in which such notice is available against a nonresident defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-10\">.
