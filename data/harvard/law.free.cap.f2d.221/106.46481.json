Argonne Co., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 57, 183 F.2d 811, 23 A.L.R.2d 1366, certiorari denied, 1950, 340 U.S. 852, 71 S.Ct. 80, 95 L.Ed. 624, should be extended to a case of fatal injury. We there held that a wife could recover damages from her husband\u2019s employer for loss of consortium where the husband had received a non-fatal industrial injury, even though an award had been made for the injury under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court subsequently held that in cases where the injury causes death, and the widow sues for loss of consortium, no recovery can be had. Brown v. Curtin &amp; Johnson, D.C.D.C.1954, 117 F.Supp. 830, the case at bar; O\u2019Neil v. Shelton Bros. Trucking Co., D.C.D.C.1953, 116 F.Supp. 654; Ciarrocchi v. James Kane Co., D.C.D.C.1953, 116 F.Supp. 848. As was pointed out in the O\u2019Neil case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-21\">\u201cAt common law * * * a wife has no right of action for loss of consortium or other injury on account of the <em>death </em>of her husband by wrongful act, as she is held to have in Hitaffer in the case of his <em>injury. </em>Plaintiff is therefore precluded from maintaining such a separate action under the common law. Her sole right of action in case of death by wrongful act must be found in the Wrongful Death Statute [D. C.Code \u00a7 16-1201 (1951)], but an action thereunder may only be maintained [by the personal representative and] if the wrongf\u00fcl act was one which would have entitled her husband to maintain it had death not ensued. Because of the exclusive [liability] provisions of the Compensation Act [33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 905 (1952)] * * * that would have been forbidden to the husband, and therefore it follows that it is forbidden to the wife. In addition, all right to damages has been superseded by the express provisions of the Compensation Act itself and by the award and acceptance by her of benefits thereunder.\u201d 116 F.Supp. at page 656. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>For the reasons stated, we consider that the trial court properly directed a verdict for defendant-appellee in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Appellee suggests that we consider whether Hitaffer was erroneously decided, insofar as it declined \u2014 on the facts there presented \u2014 to give effect to the exclusive liability provisions of the Compensation Act. Powerful arguments are advanced on the point, some of a nature not put before us when Hitaffer was argued. It will be time enough for us to consider them, however, when a case reaches us in which resolution of the point is necessary to a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-19\">.
