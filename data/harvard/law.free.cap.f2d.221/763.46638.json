The conviction and the death sentence were affirmed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-19\">The first time the matter came into the federal court was on application for habeas corpus which alleged incompetence of defense counsel. We affirmed the denial of the writ by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, following various other steps in the cause, another petition for habeas corpus was filed in the district court. The ground urged was the withholding and suppressing of vital testimony favorable to relator at his trial by the Commonwealth. After hearing the court denied the petition. On appeal we remanded the case to the district court for a finding of fact whether the court credited the testimony of police officer Heagy or the prosecutor as to what the former told the latter before trial concerning the condition of the accused at or about the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In pursuance of this the district court [123 F.Supp. 761] made further findings of fact, particularly that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At81\">\u201c2. Mr. Heagy did inform the prosecutor that he participated in the arrest of the relator in a barroom where the latter had been in a brawl and had been disarmed. He further informed Strauss, as the latter admits, that the relator was at that time under the influence of liquor to a quarrelsome degree; that he smelled the odor of alcohol on him; that his shirt and clothes were torn; and that he was perspiring and \u2018messed up.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-21\">\u201c3. The prosecuting officers did not communicate to defense counsel or to the State trial judge prior to trial, that, at the time of relator\u2019s ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>rest, several police officers detected the odor of alcohol on relator\u2019s breath; that he showed signs of having been engaged in a fight; and that at least one officer would say he was under the influence of liquor to a quarrelsome degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The court also made an additional conclusion of law, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cThe prosecuting officers were not in possession of information or evidence vital to relator\u2019s defense which they were obliged to disclose to the defense or to the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The court, citing our decision in United States ex rel. Almeida v. Baldi, 3 Cir., 1952, 195 F.2d 815, 33 A.L.R.2d 1407, certiorari denied, 1953, 345 U.S. 904, Baldi v. U.S. ex rel. Almeida, 73 S.Ct. 639, 97 L.Ed. 1341, quite properly states: \u201cThe suppression of evidence may be a denial of due process when it is vital evidence, material to the issues of guilt or penalty.\u201d 123 F.Supp. 759, 762. See also United States v. Rutkin, 3 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 641, 644-645.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The important question before us is whether the district judge erred in holding as a matter of law that the withheld and suppressed evidence was not vital to the defense of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The prosecution had alternative theories: (1) that Thompson had committed the killing of Wallace Russell, the bartender at a place called the \u201cBarbary Coast\u201d, in the course of an armed robbery; or (2) that Thompson wilfully and with premeditation killed said Wallace Russell. The defense, while admitting the killing, denied any robbery motivation and contended that Thompson through drink and drugs was in such a mental state that he could not have formulated the necessary intent to raise the killing to first degree murder and that in any event, because of his condition, his offense did not warrant the death penalty. Thompson\u2019s testimony was to that effect. One prosecution witness, Mattie Spells, to some extent corroborated him but on a plea of surprise as to another matter the Commonwealth impeached her credibility. One eye witness to the shooting testified that Thompson did not appear intoxicated. The Commonwealth also produced the bartender at the place where Thompson was arrested, and he testified that there was nothing wrong with Thompson, that he was not drunk, and that his eyes were normal and not glassy. The only police witness questioned as to Thompson\u2019s condition was the other arresting officer, Dubis. He said Thompson was \u201cperfectly normal\u201d and \u201cperfectly all right in every respect\u201d. He said nothing regarding an odor of alcohol on Thompson\u2019s breath and when asked how he knew he was all right, he replied \u201cThe man walked out with me. I have arrested many a drunk, if you are referring to that.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">None of the other police officers who were witnesses at the trial said anything about Thompson\u2019s condition or relating to an order of alcohol on him. Officer Heagy, though subpoenaed by the Commonwealth as a witness and present at most of the trial, was not called to the stand by the prosecutor. He was actually excused by the prosecutor from attendance at the night session of the trial at which Dubis testified. Heagy therefore did not hear that testimony nor, according to him, hear about it until long after the trial. Thompson was arrested within approximately four hours of the shooting. The Commonwealth argues from this that Heagy\u2019s testimony is irrelevant because it is too remote. The proofs do not justify that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">The shooting occurred in the Barbary Coast somewheres around 7:00 o\u2019clock in the evening of September 13, 1949. The Commonwealth produced three eye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>witnesses who said that they were eating fish sandwiches and drinking soda pop at the time of the shooting. According to their testimony they.saw no one in the Barbary Coast drinking intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One police officer who had made an examination of the premises the night of the shooting, testified: \u201cThere was no evidence of beer or liquor. Nothing outside of three empty cases of soft drinks.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to Thompson, however, the only drinks served at the Barbary Coast were \u201cmoonshine whiskey and a glass of water.\u201d He testified at the trial that he had started drinking in the Barbary Coast around 3:00 o\u2019clock that afternoon; that prior to the shooting he had drunk at least four pints of moonshine whiskey \u201cdrinking pint for pint\u201d and in addition had been smoking marijuana which he bought \u201cfrom a guy peddling it in there.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He said he imagined he smoked about four marijuana cigarettes during the. time he was there.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He said that at the time of the shooting \u201cI was under the influence of everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">In the; interval between the shooting and his arrest there was testimony at the trial that Thompson visited the home of Mattie Spells around 8:00 P.M. and asked fcr a loan of two dollars. Mattie Spells testified that she never saw him looking like he did that night. \u201cHis eyes were glarey. He wasn\u2019t himself at all. * * * He looked like he was under the influence of something that particular night.\u201d There was also testimony that he walked right past the police station and, shortly after 10:00 o\u2019clock that night,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> arrived at the Triangle Bar which was some nine or more blocks from the Barbary Coast and \u201call up hill.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the Triangle, he was observed \u201csliding up and down the bar\u201d and taking a \u201ctuck at his coat\u201d where the bartender observed his gun. The bartender called the police. Meanwhile Thompson had asked another patron for a cigarette (even though Thompson had seven on him when arrested) and when told he had none, Thompson pushed one hand in his face and reached for his gun. The patron grabbed him and with the help of others, Thompson was disarmed and held down until Patrolmen Dubis and Heagy arrived to make the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">According to the Triangle bartender who served him, he gave Thompson only two drinks. There is no evidence from the bartender or Thompson or anyone else that Thompson actually drank any liquor in the Triangle or anywhere after leaving the Barbary Coast. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Assuming that he did take the two drinks at the Triangle there is nothing which would warrant an inference that what the police officers observed about his condition shortly thereafter had been brought about by those two drinks and was not a continuation of the state he had been in at the time of the shooting. Clearly the relevancy and weight of the heretofore undisclosed evidence of the arresting officers and some of those at the station was for the jury. From Heagy\u2019s conclusion that Thompson was under the influence of liquor to a quarrelsome degree, plus his statement that Thompson smelt of alcohol, that his shirt and clothes were torn, and that he was messed up, together with Dubis and other policemen now saying that Thompson smelt of alcohol, that he showed signs of having been engaged in a fight, and with Mattie Spells stating at the trial that after the shooting Thompson \u201clooked funny and while his eyes were all glassy I was afraid of him\u201d and with no evidence of further drinking at all after the shooting except perhaps the two drinks at the Triangle Bar shortly before he was arrested, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Thompson had been in a far worse state of intoxication when he shot Russell than at the time he was arrested and from the same causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">But, argues the State, even so, the proffered evidence is merely cumulative. It argues that Thompson had so testified as did Mattie Spells. Thompson, the defendant, did tell about the dreadful thing he had done while \u201cunder the influence of everything\u201d as best he could which wasn\u2019t very good and was not believed by the jury. Mattie Spells had been discredited by the State. In that situation the effect of Heagy\u2019s testimony, of Dubis finally revealing that he had smelt alcohol on Thompson, and of the other police witnesses verifying this, might well have induced the jury to believe Thompson\u2019s evidence about his physical and mental state. The result could have been a finding of second degree murder,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or if first degree, a recommendation of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Admittedly, even with that evidence the jury might well not have accepted Thompson\u2019s testimony, indeed might not have credited Heagy, Dubis and the other policemen. But those conjectures do not permit that evidence to be brushed aside as merely cumulative. Nor can it be held as a matter of law to be unimportant to the defense here. It was substantial evidence which should have been but never was submitted to the jury (the only tribunal entitled to pass upon it) in connection with what the court did charge as to the effect of the drunkenness of Thompson or that he was under the influence of marijuana or a drug at the time of the killing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See Commonwealth v. Edwards, 1955, 380 Pa. 52, 110 A.2d 216; Commonwealth v. Detweiler, 1910, 229 Pa. 304, 78 A. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Appellee\u2019s final point is that Heagy was available as a witness for the defense and it cites the district court\u2019s language that \u201cEvidence is not suppressed or withheld if the accused has knowledge of the facts and circumstances or if they otherwise become available to him during the trial.\u201d We have no quarrel with that general principle but it has no relevancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>to the facts before us. Heagy was in court as a potential prosecution witness throughout the trial with the exception of the night Dubis was on the stand. The latter gave damaging evidence against tie defendant. At the close of the night session at which Dubis testified, the prosecutor stated in open court: \u201cAt this time I could call a few other police officers who would <em>corroborate what has already been testified to. </em>I see no reason why we should merely prolong the testimony now when the witnesses are not here.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) That was the trial picture on this particular phase of the state\u2019s case and there was no knowledge by Thompson or anyone.interested in him that Heagy\u2019s testimony differed so vitally from that of Dubis until years after the trial. Had the defense trial lawyer been without peer as an advocate he still could hardly have been held to putting the second arresting officer on the stand where there was every reasonable expectation that his story would dovetail with what Dubis had said. The contention apparently seriously urged that this application must fall because under the facts of the trial the defense did not call Officer Heagy is specious, We cannot accept it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the case remanded for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. However, nothing we have said here precludes a new trial or the taking of proper steps to hold the defendant in custody pending such a new trial. See United States ex rel. Almeida v.

Further testimony adduced at the ha-beas corpus hearings showed that Thompson, between the shooting and his arrest, also went to his own home <em>where </em>he stayed for about fifteen minutes, visited the home of Mr. and Mrs. Loice Spells (brother and sister-in-law of Mattie Spells) for about a half hour, and with the help of Mr. Spells who \u201cpartly toted Mm\u201d went back to Mattie Spells\u2019 house a second time.

The opening language of the trial court on this point was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-14\">\u201cNow, members of the jury, at this point I desire to call to your attention the effect of the drunkenness of this defendant, or that he was under the influence of marijuana, or a drug at the time of this occurrence. <em>That is a fact for you to find.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. Appellant has two other points: (1) that the trial court erred in not finding that Officer Heagy also told the prosecutor ;hat Thompson acted extremely drunk, incoherent and insane; and (2) that the trial court erred in refusing to admit Officer \"\u25a0 Heagy\u2019s statement, made while fatally wounded in the line of duty, to the effect that everything he had- said at the habeas corpus hearing was the truth. On the first we are unable to find the district judge clearly wrong as there was evidence supporting his conclusion. On the remaining point, the statement was hearsay. It was not within the dying declaration exception. 5 Wigmore, Evidence, Sec. 1433 (3rd ed. 1940). It was therefore properly excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b818-5\">KALODNER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqRm\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">I agree with my brethren that <em>under the special circumstances existing in this case </em>the District Court erred in denying relief to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">In my opinion since the Commonwealth introduced testimony by the Triangle Bar bartender and Dubis, one of the arresting officers, at the accused\u2019s trial, that he was <em>not </em>under the influence of liquor at the time of his arrest some four hours after the shooting and that it further stated to the jury that it \u201ccould call a few other police officers who would corroborate what has already been testified to\u201d (by the bartender and Dubis) that it committed fundamental unfairness to the accused by withholding Heagy\u2019s available testimony that the accused <em>was </em>\u201cunder the influence of liquor\u201d. The Commonwealth\u2019s present contention that Heagy\u2019s testimony is irrelevant because it is too remote doesn\u2019t square with its introduction of the bartender\u2019s and Dubis\u2019 testimony dealing with the same \u201cremote\u201d period. The Commonwealth cannot have its cake and eat it too. If, under its view, testimony of sobriety four hours after the shooting was relevant at the trial, certainly Heagy\u2019s testimony to the contrary was also relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">For this specific reason alone I would reverse, because it cannot be gainsaid that the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of Heagy\u2019s testimony constituted fundamental unfairness under the circumstances recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">I have stated this view because in my opinion Heagy\u2019s testimony would ordinarily have been inadmissible since it related to a time four hours after the shooting occurred and its suppression (absent the offering by the Commonwealth of testimony as to the accused\u2019s sobriety four hours after the shooting) would not have constituted fundamental unfairness by reason of its lack of relevance to establish the accused's sobriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>or drunkenness at the time of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">While the Pennsylvania courts have not declared themselves on this issue of relevance of testimony as to sobriety or drunkenness four hours after a crime is committed other jurisdictions have uniformly ruled such evidence inadmissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-12\">. In Jordan v. Commonwealth, 181 Va. 490, 25 S.E.2d 249, evidence of intoxication one-half hour after killing was ex-eluded; in Goodman v. State, 20 Ala.App. 392, 102 So. 486, evidence of intoxication as part of res gestae one hour after-wards was excluded; in Pollock v. State, 136 Wis. 136, 116 N.W. 851 court held it could be shown that Commonwealth witness was intoxicated at time of killing but could not show intoxication one and one-half hours afterward; in Raynor v. Wilmington, S. C. R. Co., 129 N.C. 195, 39 S.E. 821, evidence four hours after killing was excluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b819-6\">HASTIE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_lv\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">This concurrence expresses an additional thought about the problem of this case rather than any disagreement with the reasoning of the court. My concern is that no unduly broad implications be read into this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The matter in controversy is the extent of the duty of public officers charged with the investigation and prosecution of crime when they discover conflicting evidence on a material point. The government and the court below seem to have believed that once the prosecutor, having examined all of the available evidence, is convinced that the truth of an issue lies on one side he is relieved of any obligation to disclose the existence of evidence which in some degree supports what he believes would be a false conclusion. However, it seems to me that it is not possible to lay down a rule of thumb for such situations. It can be said that the prosecutor must not act in an essentially unfair way. But this is an area in which the question of fundamental fairness depends so much upon the facts of the particular case that a precise rule can not be devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">It seems likely that many situations will arise in which a prosecutor can fairly keep to himself his knowledge of available testimony which he views as mistaken or false. But there are other circumstances in which a prosecutor must, or certainly should know that even testimony which he honestly disbelieves is of a type or from a source which in all probability would make it very persuasive to a fair minded jury. This is notably true of testimony of a police officer, and most certainly of an arresting officer, favorable to a contention of the accused person. Here the prosecutor not only kept quiet about the existence of such testimony, but, as Judge McLaughlin points out, even stated in open court that other police officers if called \u201cwould corroborate what already has been testified to.\u201d Thus, the wrong of nondisclosure of obviously significant testimony was compounded by a misleading affirmative statement as to the nature of the available but unused testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">In brief, it is not every case in which the prosecution must reveal the availability of testimony inconsistent with the government\u2019s contentions. But in special circumstances such nondisclosure may, and here it certainly does, amount to fundamental unfairness in the trial of a criminal case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
