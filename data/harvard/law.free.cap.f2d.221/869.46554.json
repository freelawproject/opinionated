California Eastern Line, Inc., 348 U.S. 351, 75 S.Ct. 419, which we anticipated would clarify the scope of our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Tax Court of the United States in renegotiation cases. The Supreme Court has now held in the above case that a decision of the Tax Court that a particular contract was not renegotiable is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court \u201cby order, to finally determine the amount, if any, of such excessive profits\u201d, which \u201cshall not be reviewed or redetermined by any court or agency.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2*The Court held such a decision falls within the broad grant of jurisdiction to Courts of Appeals, contained in \u00a7 1141 of the Internal Revenue Code, \u201cto review the decisions of the Tax Court\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-28\">In the instant case no dispute is before us as to the amount of excessive profits, assuming the contract out of which the profits arose was renegotiable, as the Tax Court held. Petitioners, contending to the contrary, say the contract was exempt from renegotiation by \u00a7 403 (i) (1) (F) of the Renegotiation Act of 1943,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 701(d) of the Revenue Act of 1943 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *As we interpret United States v. California Eastern Line, Inc., supra, the order of the Tax Court resolving the controversy over the renegotiable status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>of the contract is within our review jurisdiction under \u00a7 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">On the merits of that controversy, however, we affirm for the reasons set forth in the decision of the Tax Court, Lichter v. United States, 20 T.C. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-18\">. \u00a7 403(e) (1) of the Renegotiation Act, 56 Stat. 245, as amended, 58 Stat. 86, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1191(e) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-20\">. 53 Stat. 164, as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(a) (1952).
