The order of April 16, 1954 set the maximum rent at $85 per month effective only from June 4, 1953, the date of the original order. The order of April 16, 1954 was protested by the complainant and his protest was denied by the respondent on August 17, 1954, following which the present complaint \"was filed in this court under section 408(a) of the Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 2108. The landlord was thereafter permitted by this court to join in the proceeding as the party respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">It appears that the complainant ceased to be a tenant of the premises in question in October 1953 and that rent control of the premises under the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 expired December 31, 1953. The respondents assert that in view of these facts this court is without power to grant any relief to the complainant. Obviously we can grant no prospective relief to him since he is no longer the tenant and rent control has, in any case, terminated. But the complainant asserts that he has a suit pending in the Monmouth County Court of New Jersey against the landlord for the overcharges of rent resulting from the original rent reduction order of June 4, 1953. He urges that he is entitled to have an adjudication by this court of the validity of the action of the respondent on April 16, 1954 in modifying that order by changing the reduced maximum rent from $47 to $85 per month and eliminating the retroactive feature of the reduction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The complainant\u2019s contention in this regard cannot be sustained because this court does not have power to accord him the retroactive relief which he requests. The jurisdiction of the court is purely statutory and in this case is conferred by section 408 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended by the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1952. Assuming that our jurisdiction in this case survives the termination of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 by virtue of the saving clause of section 204(f) (4) of that Act it is perfectly clear that our power to enter a judgment with purely retroactive effect is strictly limited by the express terms of section 408(d) (2) of the Defense Production Act as amended. The pertinent language of that subsection is: \u201cnor, except as provided in this subsection, shall any retroactive effect be given to any judgment setting aside a provision of a regulation or order issued under this title.\u201d See Thomas Paper Stock Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1945, 148 F.2d 831, 839, footnote 14. The only provision of subsection 408(d) authorizing retroactive effect to be given to a judgment of this court is that if any provision of a regulation or order is determined to be invalid by such a judgment \u201cany proceeding pending in any court shall be dismissed, and any judgment in such proceeding vacated, to the extent that such proceeding or judgment is based upon violation of such provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In this case the pending proceeding in which the complainant wishes to have retroactive effect given to the judgment which he seeks to obtain from this court is not a proceeding based upon the violation of the order of April 16, 1954 which he here asks us to set aside. Nor does he seek our judgment for the purpose of having that proceeding dismissed. Rather he seeks our judgment to re-establish for him a cause of action against his landlord which the Area Rent Director\u2019s order of June 4, 1953 created and which his state suit was brought to enforce but which the respondent\u2019s order of April 16, 1954 destroyed. It is per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>feetly clear that Congress has not given this court power to afford the complainant retroactive relief of this character.

Henderson, Em.App.1953, 202 F.2d 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">A judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
