The Tax Court sustained a ruling of the Commissioner holding the gain to be subject to tax under \u00a7\u00a7 211(b) and 117 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-24\">The Court\u2019s findings of fact and opinion are reported in 20 T.C. 151. The findings appear amply supported, and we are in agreement with the conclusions reached. The decision is accordingly affirmed for the reasons given by the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
