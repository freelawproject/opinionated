The order was entered on her motion under the summary judgment procedure of Rule 56, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Appellee\u2019s complaint was filed April 8, 1952. It alleges, and this is undisputed, that she was born in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, February 1, 1922. During the proceedings in the District Court it also became undisputed that appellee\u2019s father acquired citizenship of the United States by naturalization on June 18, 1928, prior to which he had been a citizen of Italy, the country of his birth; and that the father and appellee returned to Italy in 1931 and continued to reside there for a period of more than two years thereafter. Furthermore, the record is barren of indication that after going to Italy in 1931, and prior to reaching the age of 23 years, appellee acquired permanent residence in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The Secretary of State contends in substance that there was an unresolved genuine issue of material fact which pre-eluded summary judgment in favor of appellee. See Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P.; Dewey v. Clark, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 180 F.2d 766. In more detail he contends he should be permitted to prove factually certain provisions of Italian municipal law which, applied to the undisputed facts, resulted in appellee\u2019s loss of her Italian citizenship, acquired at birth under the law of Italy, when her father became naturalized as an American citizen in 1928. The Secretary claims it follows from this that she later lost her American citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by (1) reacquiring Italian citizenship by naturalization through the naturalization in Italy of her father, and (2) failing after reaching majority to acquire permanent residence in the United States before attaining the age of 23 years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">For his position the Secretary of State relies upon Section 401(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940, n. 3, supra, which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>\u201cA pe\u00ed'son who is a national of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">\u201c(a) Obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, either upon his own application or through the naturalization of a parent having legal custody of such person : <em>Provided, however, </em>That nationality shall not be lost as the result of the naturalization of a parent unless and until the child shall have attained the age of twenty-three years without acquiring permanent residence in the United States * * 8 U.S.C \u00a7 801(a) (1940) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We see no escape from the conclusion that the court below erred in holding appellee as matter of law to be a citizen of the United States; for under the quoted provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 a minor who is a citizen of the United States by birth loses such citizenship by obtaining naturalization in a foreign country through the naturalization there of her father having legal custody of her and by failing thereafter and before reaching the age of 23 years to acquire permanent residence in the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We point out, however, that to sustain his position it is essential for the Secretary to show not only that after losing h:.s American citizenship appellee\u2019s father was naturalized in Italy and that appellee thereby acquired Italian naturalization derivatively, but also that appellee\u2019s father had legal custody of her at the time of his naturalization in Italy. All this is not clear from the present record; but the material facts are provable within the general allegations of the third defense set up in the Secretary\u2019s answer to the complaint, namely, \u201cPlaintiff expatriated herself by failure to elect American citizenship within two years after reaching her majority, being a dual national by acquisition during her minority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">The court below thought that because of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Man-doli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133, 137, 73 S.Ct. 135, 137, 97 L.Ed. 146,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a legal defense was not available to appellee\u2019s claim to citizenship, though the facts be assumed to be as the Secretary contends. The Mandoli case arose under the Expatriation Act of 1907, not now involved; but the opinion contains a statement that the policy of that Act limiting the presumption of expatriation by foreign residence to the case of a naturalized citizen was continued in the 1940 Act so as \u201cnot to subject a citizen by birth to the burden and hazard of election at majority.\u201d This statement had reference to one born a dual citizen of the United States and of a foreign country who held such dual citizenship continuously from birth without ever acquiring foreign naturalization. Mandoli was such a person and did not lose American citizenship by failing to make the election referred to by the Court. But the statement relied upon does not apply to one who, though a dual citizen at birth, later loses the foreign citizenship and subsequently reacquires it by obtaining naturalization in the foreign state. Contrary to the decision in Gaudio v. Dulles, D.C.D.C., 110 F.Supp. 706, which we think was incorrectly decided,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> such person must thereafter acquire permanent residence in the United States within the time specified in Section 401(a) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 (a) (1940), supra, or suffer the loss of American citizenship by reason of those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-6\">. Though plaintiff has not appeared in this court we are advised by counsel for the Secretary of State that she is now in this country, as a non-quota immigrant, under a visa issued pursuant to the second proviso of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a) (1) (1952), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1481(a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">.
