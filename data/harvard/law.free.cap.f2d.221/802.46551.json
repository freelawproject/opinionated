The trial examiner found the charge to be sustained by the evidence. The Board approved the findings and entered the usual cease and desist order, requiring also an offer of employment to be made and compensation paid for lost earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\"> The evidence pro and con is in conflict throughout. That produced by the General Counsel would, if believed, not only support but would conclusively establish the truth of the charge made against the respondents. But the latter contend that the testimony accepted by the Board is inherently incredible. We do not so regard it. Thus we have before us merely a question of credibility, which is not one for this court to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">The findings of the Board are substantially supported upon the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">A decree enforcing the order will accordingly be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
