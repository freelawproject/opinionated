Following the day\u2019s class room work, they returned to the Fraternity House and were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>quired to study until eleven o\u2019clock in the evening before beginning the calisthenics and work again. The same routine was followed each day until Wednesday, May 3. After their calisthenics on that date, the decedent and a companion \u201cpledge\u201d were blind-folded, placed on the back seat of an automobile and driven out into the country. Their blind-folds were then removed and they were put out of the automobile and instructed to find their way back to Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The two young men walked around the countryside for sometime until they came to a state highway. They attempted unsuccessfully to get a ride and then stopped to rest on the side of the road; and, becoming uncomfortable there, they sat upon the paved portion of the highway. They were so exhausted that they fell asleep on the paved road where decedent was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The main argument of appellant is that the driver of appellee\u2019s truck had a \u201clast clear chance,\u201d by the exercise of due care, to avoid the fatal accident. The truck driver testified that, immediately, when he recognized that an object on the road might be a human being, he put on his brakes full force and almost went off the roadside in an effort to avoid running over the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In directing a verdict for the defendant, Judge Cecil explained to the jury that, after a person places himself in a position of peril by his own negligence and that his \u201cnegligence then ceases,\u201d the defendant is required to use ordinary care to avoid injury at the time he \u201cdiscovers the person in the condition of peril.\u201d The judge told the jury further that the terrible ordeal which the two boys had endured immediately before the accident, deplorable as it was, could place no greater duty upon appellee or its truck driver and make it, or its driver, responsible for the conduct of the boys and for \u201cwhat happened before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> In our judgment, the district judge properly granted the motion of appellee for directed verdict, for the reasons stated in the judge\u2019s address to the jury. We find no reversible error in the assignments made by appellant respecting the exclusion of evidence proffered by her, or in any procedural matter connected with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The judgment of the district court is ordered affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
