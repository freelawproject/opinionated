Communications Commission which granted an application by Alvarado Broadcasting Company to change the frequency and power of its broadcasting station. The Commission thought the protest insufficient and dismissed it without a hearing. Metropolitan filed a petition under \u00a7 402(a) of the Act, 66 Stat. 718, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a), for review of the Commission\u2019s order of dismissal. Metropolitan also appealed, under \u00a7 402 (b) of the Act, 66 Stat. 718, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(b), from that order and from the order granting Alvarado\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-17\">Uncertainty as to which section of the Act governs review of orders denying protests arises from the fact that, although the general statutory scheme seems to contemplate review under \u00a7 402 (b), that section does not in terms apply to protests, and \u00a7 402(a) provides for review of all proceedings \u201cexcept those appealable under subsection (b) of this section.\u201d Though this uncertainty prompted Metropolitan to proceed under each subsection, it agrees with the Commission that an order denying a protest is reviewable only under \u00a7 402(b). This view is supported by the close functional similarity between decisions denying protests and decisions denying petitions for rehearing under \u00a7 405, which have been treated as reviewable under \u00a7 402(b); by the Act\u2019s general scheme of appellate review; and by legislative history. We therefore grjmt the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review under \u00a7 402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Section 309(c) gives a right to a hearing to one who, in a protest against a Commission grant, makes allegations which show him to be a \u201cparty in interest\u201d. A \u201cparty in interest\u201d is one who is \u201caggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected\u201d. \u00a7 402(b). Camden Radio, Inc., v. Federal Communications Commission, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 220 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>F.2d 191; on Petition for Rehearing, March 17, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Metropolitan\u2019s protest alleged in substance: It is licensee of Radio Station KOA, Denver, Colorado, a Class I-B \u201cclear channel\u201d station. Alvarado Broadcasting Company is licensee of Station KOAT, 330 miles away, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, an adjacent channel station. KOAT\u2019s proposed operation will cause interference within KOA\u2019s primary and secondary service areas, though outside KOA\u2019s normally protected contour. The interference will be substantial, involving an area of 2,000 square miles with a population of 16,593 within KOA\u2019s primary service and an area of 1,238 square miles with a population of 149,202 within KOA\u2019s secondary service. The interference \u201cwill destroy the usefulness of the KOA signals\u201d in these areas. KOA has actual, as well as potential, listeners in these areas who will be lost as a result of the interference. Surveys show that \u201ca substantial portion of the population\u201d in these areas now listen regularly to KOA. As a commercial radio station it depends for its existence upon advertising revenues. Its attractiveness to advertisers depends on the size of its audience. Its basic selling theme is that it is a \u201csingle station network\u201d covering the \u201cWestern Market\u201d area, which includes the areas of interference. The fact that it can now claim and substantiate such wide area coverage is one of the reasons it is used by many national advertisers. Though the improved position of KOAT will not, in itself, greatly injure KOA, KOA\u2019s loss of listeners will impair its competitive position as to all its competitors in the area, including the Denver Post, and economic injury will result.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">The Commission thought these allegations too \u201cconjectural and speculative\u201d. We think they make a sufficient showing that Metropolitan is \u201clikely to be financially injured\u201d, Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 477, 60 S.Ct. 693, 698, 84 L.Ed. 869, by the protested grant, to entitle Metropolitan to a hearing under \u00a7 309(c). This does not imply that Metropolitan is entitled to relief from the grant, or that the grant is for any reason invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">No. 12191 dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">No. 12192 reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
