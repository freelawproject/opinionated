Disregarding the fact that there was no proof that the jury did see them and that, as pointed out by the trial judge, it was difficult, if not impossible, for them to have seen underneath the file, it is quite plain that the words were without material significance in the case and that, if the jury had seen them, no prejudice could have resulted to the defendant therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The second ground is no better taken. Based upon the claim that one Alexander, who was in the car and had fled from the scene when defendant was arrested and the liquor was seized, took the stand as a witness for defendant and swore, that he and not the defendant was; guilty, that defendant was ignorant that, there was liquor in the car and innocent of the offenses charged, and was driving the car only because he, Alexander, had picked him up and asked him to drive,, this is merely a repetition here of the jury argument made below that, in the light of this testimony, the circumstances' surrounding the arrest, including the' statement made by Curry to the arresting officer, should not have been deemed sufficient by the jury. It might have-availed there, it cannot do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
