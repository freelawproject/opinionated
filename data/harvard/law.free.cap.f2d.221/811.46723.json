Nine of the shipments moved from Garland, Texas, to Proving Ground, Illinois. The other three moved from Chicago to Fort Crook, Nebraska. All shipments were composed of internal combustion engines. The nine moving to Proving Ground, Illinois, were for use in \u201ctracked motor carriages\u201d such as gun carriages, bulldozers, medium tanks and tank recovery vehicles. The three shipments to Fort Crook, Nebraska were \u201caircraft engines\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-25\">The United States paid the freight charges as billed under the tariff classi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>fication \u201cAgricultural implements and other articles\u201d. In 1950, claiming the correct classification for such shipments should have been \u201cAutomobile parts\u201d the United States cut back freight charges due on other shipments, and this suit was brought by the Railroad under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346, to recover $1 082.19 which was the difference in freight charges under the two classifications hereinbefore described. Judgment was entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The commodity \u201cinternal combustion engines\u201d appears in the tariff under two separate headings. Under the classification \u201cAgricultural implements and other articles\u201d it is listed as follows: \u201cEngines, steam or internal combustion, NOIBN,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This classification takes a 40% of first class rating for rate-assessment purposes. Under the classification \u201cAutomobile parts\u201d it is listed as \u201cEngines, irternal combustion, including fuel tanks\u201d. This classification takes a 35% of first class rating. Neither aircraft engines nor tank engines are listed separately :!n the tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The case was submitted to the District Court upon a stipulation of facts and certain documentary exhibits offered by agreement. There is here no question of credibility of witnesses. Under such circumstances this Court may reach its own conclusion and order judgment accordingly. Benrose Fabrics Corp. v. Rosenstein, 7 Cir., 183 F.2d 355, 358; Bowles, Adm\u2019r Office of Price Administration v. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, 7 Cir., 149 F.2d 545, 546; Wigginton v. Order of United Commercial Travelers of America, 7 Cir., 126 F.2d 659, 661. Furthermore, when an appeal presents a question of tariff interpretation or construction the lower court\u2019s decision may usually be reviewed as a question of law. Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants\u2019 Elevator Co., 259 U.S. 285, 290, 291, 42 S.Ct. 477, 66 L.Ed. 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In interpretation of tariffs the terms used must be taken in the sense in which they generally are understood and accepted. There was nothing about the shipment of \u201caircraft engines\u201d to indicate they should be classified as \u201cAutomobile parts\u201d. Nor do we think that the term \u201cAutomobile parts\u201d is broad enough in meaning to be descriptive of tank engines. ' Exhibit 3A discloses that the tanks, bulldozers and tank recovery vehicles did not operate on wheels like an automobile but on caterpillar treads, and they also mounted sizeable guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">A case similar in many respects to the case at bar is United States v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., 5 Cir., 194 F.2d 777, 779. There airplane tank and marine internal combustion engines were shipped. The government there, as here, contended that \u201cAutomobile parts\u201d was the correct classification. The railroads contended the proper classification was under \u201c \u2018Agricultural Implements and other Articles.\u2019 \u201d The Court agreed with the contention of the railroads pointing out that under this heading is included \u201c \u2018Engines, Steam or Internal Combustion, N.O.I.B.N. (not otherwise indexed by name).\u2019\u201d The Court said, at page 779: \u201cThe articles shipped come under the broad caption \u2018other articles.\u2019 They were aircraft, tank, and boat internal combustion engines hot otherwise indexed by name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">We think the decision of the Court in United States v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Cm, supra, was correct. We hold that the shipments to Proving Ground, Illinois, as well as the shipments to Fort Crook, Nebraska, were properly classified under \u201c \u2018Agricultural Implements and other Articles.\u2019 \u201d It follows that the District Court should have entered judgment for the plaintiff pursuant to the demand of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Reversed with direction that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-10\">. The term \u201cNOIBN\u201d often is used in carrier tariffs and has been defined to mean \u201cNo&lt; otherwise indexed by name\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
