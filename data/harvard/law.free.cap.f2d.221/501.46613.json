After full public hearing, the Board entered an order granting the requested authority, except that Dallas and Fort Worth, which are thirty-one miles apart, were treated as a single terminal point with this designation: \u201cDallas-Fort Worth, Tex. (to be served through the Amon Carter Air Field).\u201d Amon Carter Field<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is Fort Worth's newly constructed municipal airfield and is located approximately midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-20\">The Dallas Chamber of Commerce, an intervenor in the proceedings before the Board, and the City of Dallas, which, jointly with the Chamber of Commerce, filed an unsuccessful petition for reeon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>si deration, are the petitioners herein. Their interest stems from a concern that Dallas will not be well served by Amon Carter, which is eleven miles farther from Dallas than is its own municipal airport, Love Field, and their apprehension lest the Board\u2019s action jeopardize Dallas\u2019 substantial investment in Love Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Petitioners first attack the Board\u2019s order on the theory that the Board is without statutory authority to require Dallas-Fort Worth to be served through Amon Carter. This contention derives from their view that airports must be considered \u201cfacilities\u201d within the meaning of the fourth sentence of \u00a7 401(f) of the Civil Aeronautics Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cNo term, condition, or limitation of a certificate shall restrict the right of an air carrier to add to or change schedules, equipment, accommodations, and facilities for performing the authorized transportation and service as the development of the business and the demands of the public shall require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">While, for reasons set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we do not believe that \u201cfacilities\u201d as there used embraces \u201cairports,\u201d there is no need to reach that question. For we agree with the Board that the present order, in providing that service to Dallas-Fort Worth shall be through Amon Carter, has not imposed a \u201cterm, condition, or limitation\u201d on Central. Rather, it has merely described the \u201cpoints\u201d and the \u201cservice to be rendered,\u201d as expressly authorized by the first sentence of \u00a7 401(f), supra, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u201cEach certificate issued under this section shall specify the terminal points and intermediate points, if any, between which the air carrier is authorized to engage in air transportation and the service to be rendered * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">The temporary certificate issued by the Board, after describing the transportation authorized, states: \u201cThe service herein authorized is subject to the following terms, conditions, and limitations.\u201d The restriction of service to Dallas-Fort Worth through Amon Carter does not appear among such \u201cterms, conditions, and limitations,\u201d but is found in the first part of the order, where the authorized transportation is described.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">While, of course, the mere form of the Board\u2019s order would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>controlling if its substance were in conflict with the terms of the Act, we find no such conflict. The Board has heretofore, without challenge, assumed and exercised a power of control over changes in airports by certificated carriers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it would be paradoxical, indeed, if the Board were without jurisdiction to designate the airport to be served in the first instance. Moreover, we think nothing in the Act precludes the certification of service to an airport as a \u201cpoint,\u201d as the Board has done on several occasions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cair transportation\u201d regulated under the certificate provisions of \u00a7 401 is defined by the Act as the carriage by aircraft of persons, etc., between <em>places, </em>and not necessarily between cities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since we believe the Board has authority to designate service to an airport as a point, :.t would be wholly anomalous to invalidate the present order because, in form, it does not designate Amon Carter, itself, as a terminal point.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Finally, even if the Act left some ambiguity concerning the Board\u2019s power to enter the order in question, we would favor the broader view of the Board\u2019s power as essential to secure a system of air transportation in the public interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, we believe that where, as here, the Board concludes that the public interest requires two or more, contiguous cities to be served as a single point, it should not be precluded from specifying the one airport which will best serve the entire area designated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think it is precisely to permit such prescribing of authorized service that the first sentence of \u00a7 401(f) empowers the Board to attach to certificates \u201csuch reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations as the public interest may require.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">Petitioners next assert that they were not given sufficient notice that the issue of service through Amon Carter Field was before the Board;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that such lack of notice constituted a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> *and a denial of due process. Although the issue of service through Am-on Carter was not specifically raised by Central\u2019s application or at the pre-hearing conference, we think that, nonetheless, within the principle enunciated and applied by the Supreme Court in Civil Aeronautics Board v. State Airlines,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> adequate notice was provided. In that case, Piedmont Aviation, Inc., and State Airlines had applied for different new routes in a geographical area including all or a part of fourteen states in Southeastern United States. After consolidated hearings on the applications of State, Piedmont, and some twenty-three other applicants for routes in the same general area, the Board awarded Piedmont new routes not specifically sought in its application and more nearly approximating those sought by State. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>State attacked this order on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that since Piedmont had not applied for the particular routes certified, State had had insufficient notice that the Board might consider Piedmont as a competing applicant, and hence had had no fair opportunity to present evidence discrediting Piedmont\u2019s fitness to serve those routes.</p>\n<p id=\"AxR\">The Supreme Court held that there was sufficient notice to State, even though Piedmont\u2019s application covered routes \u201cdiffer markedly from those awarded\u2019\u2019.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In so holding, the Court approved the principle stated by the Board that in certification proceedings the prime consideration is the public interest in the establishment of a \u201c \u2018sound transportation pattern,\u2019 \u201d and not \u201c \u2018how an individual proposal would benefit the applicant * * * \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Reasoning from this principle, the Court concluded that the requirements of notice are satisfied when interested parties are sufficiently informed of the issues so that they may present evidence which will enable the Board to reach its decision on the basis \u201cof all available information.\u201d In finding that under this test State had received adequate notice, the Court noted: (1) State had sought certificates in the same general area, was a participant in the same proceedings, and had argued against Piedmont before the Board \u2014 in short, it recognized Piedmont as a potential competitive applicant; and (2) the Board, in the exercise of its informed judgment, had denied State\u2019s petition for reopening of the proceedings in order to present evidence bearing on Piedmont\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"alu-dedup-0\">in the present case, petitioners likewise had notice of the certificate proceed-<em>jngs </em>and Participated therein. They knew\u2019 \u00b0* course\u2019 that Amon Carter Field fas ander construction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> They should hav\u00ae beeJn aware\u2019 from past experiences \u201c B\u00b0ard Proceedings, that Dallas-Fort Worth might be designated as a single P\u00b0ln\u00a3<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and ^at service to Dallas-Fort Worth <em>^rough </em>Amoa Cartf might be rfWired by the certificate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover at the hearing, itself, officials of Central were questioned at length as to the loca\u00fc\u00b0n of Amon Carter its stage of comPletlon\u2019 and Centrals plans regarding servi.ce ^ when completed. This obvious mterfst of the Board m Amon Car\u201c ter\u2019 coapled Wlth lts known Practlce of Prescribing service to points through Particular airports, must be deemed to bave sufficiently alerted petitioners to the Possibility that service might be certlficated to Dallas-Fort Worth through Amon Carter.</p>\n<p id=\"AMz\">These circumstances, we think, preclude the view adopted by our dissenting brother that petitioners had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>right to expect that the designation of the airport would be the subject of a subsequent hearing pursuant to an \u201cairport notice\u201d filed by the carrier. The \u201cairport notice\u201d procedure<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> was not and could not have been relied on by petitioners. It applies only when the holder of a certificate desires to serve a point named in the certificate through an airport not then rege larly used by the holder. Since it comes into play only on the filing of an \u201cairport notice\u201d by the holder, that procedure plainly is inapplicable where, as here, :he Board has determined that service by the holder to a point named in the certificate should be through a particular airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Furthermore, as in State Airlines, the Board here considered petitioners\u2019 proffer of additional evidence when it denied their petition to reopen the proceedings and for reconsideration. Their petition stated that they were prepared to produc e evidence (1) that service to Dallas through Amon Carter would not ne adequate, and (2) that, if one airfield was to serve both cities, Love Field at Dallas, rather than Amon Carter, would minimize the cost to the public and would offer the more convenient service. The petition did not, however, indicate specifically the nature of the evidence to be submitted, although it was perhaps implied that data reflecting the greater volume of Dallas traffic would be offered. Since such data was already before the Board, and since no other evidence was specified, we find that, as in State Airlines, supra, the Board was justified in declining to reopen the proceedings.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">In effect, petitioners\u2019 final objection \u2014 that the Board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial evidence \u2014 comes to this: that there is missing from the record the evidence they would have presented but for the alleged lack of notice that service to Dallas through Amon Carter was in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Particularly, they say, there was insufficient evidence (1) to support the finding that Amon Carter Field would adequately serve Dallas; or (2) to enable the Board, in computing the amount of subsidy savings to the public, to appraise the adverse effects on Central\u2019s revenues which would result from the loss of Dallas traffic. But we think the evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that Amon Carter was sufficiently accessible to Dallas to serve its needs adequately, and, accordingly, that the loss of Dallas traffic would be inconsequential.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXLk\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-21\">. Also known as Fort Worth International Airport.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">. 52 Stat. 977, 989 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 481(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\">. In support of their position, petitioners point to the definitions section of the Act, where, at \u00a7 1(7) and (8), the term \u201cAir navigation facility\u201d is defined as including \u201clanding areas\u201d and \u201cairports.\u201d 52 Stat. 977 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(7) and (8). However, elsewhere in the definitions section, at \u00a7 1(22), where \u201clanding area\u201d is defined, \u201cfacilities\u201d is used to refer to things appurtenant to the airport rather than to the airport itself. 52 Stat. 979 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(22). Since \u00a7 401(f), supra, speaks of \u201cfacilities\u201d and not \u201cair navigation facilities,\u201d we think that the statutory definitions, if anything, militate against rather than for petitioners\u2019 contention. Moreover, turning to Title IV of the Act, in which \u00a7 401(f) is included, we find that in at least one instance \u201cfacilities,\u201d as used therein, could not have been intended to incude \u201cairports.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 404(a) makes it the duty of a certificated carrier \u201cto provide safe and adequate service, equipment, and facilities in connection with [the authorized] transportation\u201d. 52 Stat. 993 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 484(a): Clearly. Congress did not intend for carriers to provide their own \u201csafe and adequate\u201d airports. On the other hand, the term \u201cair navigation facilities\u201d does not appear in Title IV, but is used in Titles III and VI where the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Board are vested with broad power to establish, develop, and maintain \u201cair navigation facilities,\u201d specifically including airports, and to regulate such \u201cair navigation facilities\u201d in the interest of safety. See 52 Stat. 985, 988, 1011 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 451, 452, 455, 457. Had Congress regarded the word \u201cfacilities,\u201d without more, as embracing airports, it would not have devised and painstakingly defined a new term (i. e., \u201cair navigation facility\u201d) when it sought to create and delimit a broad regulatory power encompassing, <em>inter alia, </em>airports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. 14 CUT.It. \u00a7 202.8 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">.

The Board\u2019s supplemental opinion denying the petition for reconsideration makes clear that the Board had duly considered the objections raised by petitioners.

In one sentence the Board\u2019s order from which this appeal was taken specified the terminal point and designated the air<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>port to be used. I think sufficient notice that the airport question was to be decided in this proceeding was not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Central Airlines\u2019 application for a certificate was for a route \u201cBetween the terminal point Fort Worth, Texas, the intermediate points Dallas, Texas, Den-ton, Texas, * * It said nothing about the airport to be used. The report of the prehearing conference was to the same effect. This was the extent of the notice given as to the nature and scope of the hearing to be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">No specific notice was given that the Board might designate Dallas-Fort Worth as the terminal point. Nevertheless, under the doctrine of the State Airlines case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are compelled to conclude that Dallas and all other parties had ample notice that, instead of specifying Fort Worth as the terminal point and Dallas as an intermediate point, the Board might combine the two and designate Dallas-Fort Worth as the terminal point.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">But the question of what airport should be used to serve the designated terminal point was a different question. In its brief the Board tells us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cUnder the terms of each carrier\u2019s certificate in effect since the beginning of the administration of the Civil Aeronautics Act, a carrier after being authorized to serve a new point is required to file with the Board an \u2018airport notice\u2019 notifying the Board of the airport selected by it to serve the new point. Under the Board\u2019s practice the carrier is permitted to use that airport if (a) the airport is suitable for the purpose when compared with other available airports in the vicinity, and (b) the airport does in fact serve the designated point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The designation of \u201cDallas-Fort Worth\u201d as a terminal was, as the Board phrased it in the Supplemental Opinion dated September 24, 195B, \u201ca designation of service to Dallas and Fort Worth as a single rather than separate points.\u201d If this was authorization of service to \u201ca new point\u201d, the above quotation from the Board\u2019s brief applies directly and specifically. If it was not designation of a new point, but was merely service by a new airport to two points already served, the Airport Regulations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> apply specifically. Those Regulations apply in terms to cases where a carrier desires to serve a point already named in the certificate but \u201cthrough the use of any airport not then regularly used by such holder,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>carrier. Central was serving Dallas and Fort Worth but at Love and Meacham Fields; Amon Carter Field was an airport not then regularly used. In either event, whether \u201cDallas-Fort Worth\u201d is a new point or is merely the two old points served by an airport not heretofore regularly used, the designation of the airport is a separate proceeding from the grant of the certificate. Thus, according to the Board\u2019s statement and its Regulations, the choice of airports is a problem to be considered in \u201cairport notice\u201d proceedings, separately from other issues in a certification proceeding. Of course, if the notice in the certification proceeding had contained notice of the airport issue, I suppose the two questions could have been combined in a single proceeding. But that was not done in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">It seems to me that Dallas had a right to rely upon the established procedure in respect to the designation of the airport to be used. It had a right to expect, in the absence of any notice to the contrary, that, after the terminal points and other issues in the certification proceeding had been concluded, the selection of airports would be another step to be taken pursuant to an \u201cairport notice\u201d. Dallas had no semblance of a notice that, contrary to the established procedure, the selection of the airport would be dealt with in the same order which specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the terminal points. It seems to me that Dallas was entitled to that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In its petition for reconsideration Dallas offered to present evidence \u201cshowing first, tha'; service of Dallas through Fort Worth International Airport (Amon Carter Field) is not and in the circumstances will not be adequate service required by Section 404 of the Act, and second, that if under the peculiar circumstances of any case both Dallas and Fort Worth are to be served through a single airfield, the public interest requires that Love Field should be the field used for that purpose in view of the much greater volume cf available traffic to and from Dallas than to and from Fort Worth.\u201d In its memor\u00e1ndum denying reconsideration the Board did not treat of this proffer cf evidence but merely referred to facts which it said were indicated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">I would remand the case for further hearing upon the airport question and for a re determination of that question pursuant to the established procedure and regulations relating thereto.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\">.
