The Company challenges the certification on two grounds: (1) it was based upon an invalid election, and (2) the Board included \u201csupervisors\u201d within the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-26\"> Section 9(c) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act forbids an election within twelve months of an earlier \u201cvalid <em>election.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Certification here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>rests upon a successful union election held within only seven months after an unsuccessful one which the Board had set aside as invalid. The Company says the Board erred in determining that the earlier election was held in \u201can atmosphere incompatible with freedom of choice\u201d by reason of a letter which the Company\u2019s president had sent to the employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think the Board\u2019s view of the letter was reasonable and that its determination must therefore be upheld.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since th 3 earlier election was not a \u201cvalid election,1\u2019 the later one was not barred by \u00a7 9(c) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">More difficult is the issue relating to the Board\u2019s determination that the respondent\u2019s inspectors are not supervisors within ;he meaning of \u00a7 2(11) of the Act. That section defines a \u201csupervisor\u201d as one v/ho has authority to \u201chire, transfer, <em>suspend, </em>lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, <em>or responsibly to direct </em>them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, <em>if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, </em>but requires the use of independent judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Company asserts that its inspectors are supervisors in that they have authority \u201cto transfer, suspend, assign, reward, discipline and responsibly tc direct other employees and effeetively to recommend such action.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It does not claim that they have authority to hire, lay off, recall, promote, discharge or adjust grievances of other employees. The Board found that the hiring, firing, assignment and disciplining of employees is handled through the Company\u2019s central personnel office and its division superintendents and supervisors. This finding is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">The Board found that in extreme cases involving the public safety the inspectors are required to remove an operator from his vehicle. It did not find whether or not inspectors have authority to \u201csuspend\u201d operators. On the matter of authority of the inspectors \u201cresponsibly to direct\u201d operators, the Board found that \u201cThe direction and control exercised by inspectors is concerned primarily with equipment rather than personnel, and any direction or control of personnel is incidental thereto * * * [and] not \u2018responsible direction\u2019 within the meaning of the Act.\u201d There is \"evidence in the record which indicates that the control exercised by inspectors relates primarily to equipment. It tends to show that the inspectors\u2019 primary function is to keep traffic rolling, in the event of tie-ups, by making ad hoc alterations of routes and schedules. To the extent-that their direction of the operators is related to that function, (e.g., ordering opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>tors to drive new routes), it might reasonably be viewed as incidental to their control over the movement of the vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">But there is also evidence which indicates the existence of other inspector authority not so closely related to traffic control as to be merely incidental thereto. The Company\u2019s rule-book provides that an inspector may relieve from duty any operator found violating any rule in the manual or operating his vehicle in a reckless or dangerous manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among the rules which the inspectors are thereby given authority to enforce are rules as to operators\u2019 personal appearance and uniforms; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as to their personal habits;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> their use of boisterous, profane, or vulgar language;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> smoking;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> lack of courtesy toward the <em>public;</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The Board failed to determine, as a matter of fact, the extent, if any, to which rule-book authority was actually exercised. Nor did it determine, as a matter of its own policy, the difference, if any, between the effect of actual and merely potential authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s brief nevertheless states that \u201cinfrequent occasion to perform a supervisory function does not suffice to convert an otherwise rank-and-file employee into a supervisor.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With respect to authority to relieve an operator, the brief argues that the \u201cincidence of its exercise is small and its relevance to the existence of effective supervisory authority in the inspector, if not nil, is negligible\u201d and that \u201ceven if it could be thought to have a supervisory overtone,\u201d its exercise was too \u201csporadic or infrequent\u201d to make the inspectors supervisors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There is evidence in the record tending to support these reasons for the Board\u2019s action. The testimony of ten inspectors, representing about seventy man-years of service, shows that this authority was exercised most infrequently and that some of the inspectors seemed unaware that they even possessed it. But since the Board failed to make findings in connection with these reasons, \u201cwe cannot decide now whether [they] suffice to support the order.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThe grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that its action was based.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Findings are essential not only to facilitate judicial review by revealing the factual basis for agency action but also to reflect the \u201cdetermination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make * * <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">We conclude that this petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order must be denied and the case remanded to the Board for further findings upon the matters referred to above. Upon remand the Board may reopen the record for further hearings if it sees fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">The Company filed a motion in this court for leave to adduce additional evidence before the Board on the issue whether the inspectors have supervisory authority. A petition for leave to adduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the same additional evidence, filed with the Board after its decision, was denied for lack of sufficient showing to warrant relief. We think the principles which the Board applied are correct and also require denial of the present motion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If the Board reopens the record upon remand, however, our denial should not be construed as precluding the Board from receiving any additional evidence it then deems appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The Board\u2019s order is set aside and the case remanded to the Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-15\">.
