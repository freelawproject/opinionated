The filing of notice of appeal on February 17, 1955, comes too late, and the motion is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">Movant also seeks to combine three cases identified as Criminal Numbers 1841, 1842 and 1843 for review. Notices of appeal in these cases were filed more than a year ago but the records have never been docketed in this court. These appeals are dismissed.
