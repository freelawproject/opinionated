S.C.A. \u00a7 111. After a conference with the sentencing judge in chambers, the petitioner formally consented to be charged by information and proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 5031 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">The information charged the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle from Dallas, Texas to Teton National Park in Wyoming on January 9, 1953, when the petitioner was seventeen years of age. When the petitioner appeared with his co-defendant in open court, the sentencing judge referred to the conference in chambers and observed that petitioner had heretofore consented to be charged by information and proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent, and then advised the petitioner of the nature of the charge against him and explained that he was entitled to benefit of counsel if he so desired. When the petitioner stated that he did not wish the assistance of counsel, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>was refer\u00ed ed to the probation officer for a pre-sentence report. After the pre-sentence report, in which petitioner\u2019s prior record of juvenile delinquency was recited in detail, the petitioner was again called in open court and the nature of the charges explained. After having answered that he knew of no reason why sentence should not be imposed, the court pronounced the sentence which the petitioner now seeks to vacate, on the grounds that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel as a person of immaturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Section 5032, Title 18 U.S.C.A. provides in effect that a juvenile facing charges for the violation of the laws of the United States not punishable by death or life imprisonment, and not surrendered to the authorities of a state, \u201cshall be proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent if he consents to such procedure * * * \u201d, and that \u201cIn such event the juvenile shall be proceeded against by information and no criminal prosecution shall be instituted for the alleged violation.\u201d Section 5033, Title 18 U.S.C.A. provides that the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of proceedings against juvenile delinquents; and further provides that for such purposes, the court may convene at any time within the district \u201cin chambers or otherwise\u201d; and that \u201cthe proceeding shall be without a jury\u201d; that the requisite consent of the delinquent shall be in writing before the judge, having cognizance of the alleged violation; the judge \u201cshall fully apprise the juvenile of his rights and of the consequences of ..such consent\u201d; .and ..that \u201csuch consent shall be deemed a waiver of a trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Having consented to be proceeded against as a juvenile delinquent, petitioner waived a trial by jury and consented to be deal; with by the court as provided by the statute. The record clearly shows that he was advised of all of his rights, and that the motion to vacate is wholly wit! lout merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
