Blackburn. The complaint asserted that the Deputy Commissioner erred in determining that (1) he had jurisdiction over the injury, and (2) the injury arose out of and in the course of employment. The District Court refused to disturb the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s determinations, and granted his motion for summary judgment. We think this action is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-20\">Briefly, these are the pertinent circumstances. The B &amp; J Company maintained its principal office in the District of Columbia, and there engaged in business and employed an office staff. Although, through choice, its construction operations were carried on outside of the District, it hired its employees through the union hiring hall in Washington. In December 1951, the job superintendent on a B &amp; J Company project at Clinton, Maryland, directed the shop steward, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Hunter, to go to the union hall to procure two additional laborers. Hunter, acting under this instruction, arranged the hiring of two laborers. One of these was Blackburn, who had been living in the District of Columbia and vicinity for many years. At the same time, Hunter arranged to transport Blackburn to and from the job daily, because, as Hunter testified, \u201cif it is a long distance out of town, like we were in Maryland, we have to make some arrangements to get them on the job.\u201d As provided by the wage agreement between the employer and the union, Blackburn was to be paid 40 cents per day traveling expenses, which sum it was agreed Blackburn would pay over to Hunter. Blackburn\u2019s death resulted from injuries received in Maryland when the car, in which he was being driven by Hunter from the job site to the union hall m Washington, skidded on icy pave-men^\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"Aq22\">(1) Findings of the Deputy Commissioner \u201cas to jurisdiction are entitled to great weight and will be rejected only where there is apparent error.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District of Columbia statute makes the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 345applicable \u201cin respect to the injury or death of an employee of an employer carrying on <em>any </em>employment in the District of Columbia, irrespective of the place where the injury or death occurs * * <footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The B &amp; J Company admittedly employed an office staff within the District. It was for the purposes of this case, and under the circumstances presented, an \u201cemployer\u201d within the comprehensive language of the statute. The particular employee killed or injured need not have been working at the time within the District of Columbia; one comes within the \u201cintent and design\u201d of the statute when, as here, the employer\u2019s office, the place of hiring, the employee\u2019s residence and other factors provide \u201csome substantial connection between the District and the particular employee-employer relation-g^jp * * *_\u00bb <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aao-dedup-0\">(2) Ordinarily \u201cinjuries <em>sus</em>tained by employees when going to or re_ turning from their regular place of work * * * \u201d are not compensable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but there are a number of exceptions to that rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One is that where the employer has undertaken to provide the transportation, either directly <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or by money payments in lieu of transportation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the travel is an incident of the employment, In determining whether there is such an undertaking, it is necessary to examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the \"nature and circumstances of the part\u00edcula].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employment * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In concluding that there was such an undertaking in Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., the Supreme Court relied heavily upon a union wage agreement wh:.ch imposed a contractual obligation on the employer to provide transportation to jobs situated outside the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present case, however, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the wage agreement alone, which merely provides for payment of traveling expenses,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> likewise gives rise to such an obligation. For the wage agieement is but one circumstance of the.employment; and it clearly appears from a consideration of all the circumstances that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding that such an obligation existed in substantially supported by the record as a whole.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Thus, Hunter was specifically instructed by the job superintendent to arrange for the hiring of two laborers, one of ivhom' was Blackburn. In view of his testimony that because of the distance of the job site from the hiring hall \u201cwe have to make some arrangements to get them on the job,\u201d the Deputy Commissioner could well have concluded that Hunter had the incidental authority to arrange for transportation if the new employee had no other means of reaching the job. This being so, it follows that the travel arrangement between Blackburn and Hunter was not merely an arrangement of convenience between two co-employees; rather, it was an arrangement necessary to effectuate the employment of Blackburn, which was made by Hunter in behalf of and as an agent of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">There are two supporting reasons for concluding that, contrary to the ordinary rule, the travel here was incidental to the employment: (1) Blackburn was hired specifically to work on the Maryland project. Thus, as in Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., \u201cThis was not a case of employees traveling in the same city between home and work. Extended cross-country transportation was necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In those circumstances, \u201cthe hazards of the journey may fairly be regarded as the hazards of the service.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (2) Under the arrangement between Hunter and Blackburn, Hunter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>was to be paid the 40 cents per day received by Blackburn as travel compensation. If, instead, Hunter were to have been paid directly by the employer for carrying workmen to the job, indubitably there would have been an undertaking by the employer to provide transportation. The mere fact that the money was to pass through Blackburn's hands en route to Hunter from the employer does not, in our opinion, affect the substance of the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the action of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"abz-dedup-0\">.
