It will serve no useful purpose for us to review the court\u2019s findings, in the light of the record, or set out here the undisputed facts shown thereby which sustain his conclusions and order. It is sufficient to say that the order appealed from was rightly entered and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
