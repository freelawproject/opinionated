United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, and consolidated cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>In United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, we held \u201cthat the Board has no authoritj' under the Act to deprive the Unions cf their compliance status under \u00a7 9(h) For that reason we restrained the Board from using a finding, that false non-Communist affidavits had been filed by their officers, as a basis for depriving the unions of the Act\u2019s benefits. In the course of that decision, we said, \u201cWe need not decide whether the union would be barred from the Act\u2019s benefits if its membership was aware of the alleged falsity of the affidavit.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>There the Board had made no claim of such awareness. It does make the claim here in the following context.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Ben Gold, the president of the Inter-nationa] Fur and Leather Workers Union, was convicted in April 1954 of filing a false non-Communist affidavit in 1950.\u00ae Affidavits are required to be filed annually and are effective only for one year. On May 11, 1954, immediately after Gold was re-elected by the Union, he submitted a non-Communist affidavit to the Board for the ensuing twelve-month period in accordance with the annual filing requirement. In proceedings which the Beard had instituted immediately after Gold\u2019s conviction, an order was issued on May 28, 1954 rejecting Gold\u2019s 1954 affidavit because of his conviction, and holding the Union therefore not in compliance under \u00a7 9(h). From the fact of Gold\u2019s conviction, the Board draws a conclusion that the Union was aware of the falsity of his May 11, 1954 affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Now that the Board has brought the \u201cunion awareness\u201d problem before us, we feel our decision must be the same as that in the United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers case. The absence of authority in the Board to deprive the. Union of its compliance status under \u00a7 9(h) cannot be supplied by membership awareness of the falsity of the affidavit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Congress explicitly provided a criminal penalty for false non-Communist affidavits. It assumed that this threat of criminal sanctions would be a sufficient deterrent to false swearing by union officers. If these sanctions have proved insufficient, it is for Congress, not the Board, to provide new ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-9\">. 61 Stat. 146 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S. O.A. \u00a7 159(h): \u201cNo investigation shall be made by the Board of any question affecting commerce concerning the representation of employees, raised by a labor organization under subsection (c) of this section, and no complaint shall be issued pursuant to a charge made by a labor organization under subsection (b) of section 160 of this title, unless there is on file with the Board an affidavit executed contemporaneously or within the preceding twelve-month period by each officer of such labor organization and the officers of any national or international labor organization of which it is an affiliate or constituent unit that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with such party, and that he does not believe in, and is not a member of or supports any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.
