United States, 275 U.S. 310, 48 S.Ct. 137, 72 L.Ed. 293, in which the evidence showed active cooperation between State and Federal officers, defendants argue that the fact that the arresting officers arranged for prosecution of the case in the Federal Court is sufficient evidence of cooperation to bring their case within the governing principle there laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Appellee, pointing to the two reasons<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> given by the court for denying the motion and citing many cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in support of the first reason and, in support of the second reason, Brinegar v. U. S., 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879, Harris v. State, 216 Miss. 895, 63 So.2d 396, and Martin v. U. S., 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 503, urges upon us that denial of the motion for an instructed verdict was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We think it clear that this is so, and since no useful purpose will be served by setting out the undisputed evidence as to the arrest and search, we will content ourselves with saying that it is and that the judgment must and will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">. \u201cI think for two reasons the motion should be overruled. The first is since the Federal officers did not participate in the search and arrest that the rule requiring a search warrant is not applicable. The rule is that if Federal officers in conjunction with state officers make an unlawful search then the evidence obtained under such unlawful search is inadmissible, but the rule is that if the Federal officers did not participate in an unlawful search, then the evidence obtained by officers of the State, even though the search be an unlawful one, is admissible in the prosecution in the Federal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">\u201cI will overrule it for the second reason that under the evidence of this case I do not think the search was unreasonable * * * the officers were at a place where they had a right to be and this ear drove up and they saw with their eyes sufficient circumstances that would lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that intoxicating liquors were contained in the car and that therefore the search by the officers was not an unreasonable search, so for both reasons the motion will be denied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"adh-dedup-0\">.
