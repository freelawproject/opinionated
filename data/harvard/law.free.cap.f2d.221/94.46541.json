Appellants assert that the District of Columbia is the most convenient forum, and that since the adoption of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1952), the District Court no longer has power to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens. Jurisdiction was founded entirely upon our local statute, D.C.Code \u00a7 11-306 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\"> It is almost a truism that a plaintiff\u2019s choice of a forum will rarely be disturbed and, so far as the private interests of the litigants are concerned, it will not be unless the balance of convenience is strongly in favor of the defendant. Such considerations were urged upon the trial judge in this case, and it cannot be doubted that a trial in this District might have proved equally convenient to parties and witnesses. But the public interest may also be taken into account, and it is clear that this aspect weighed heavily in the District Court\u2019s evaluation of the over-all problem. The judge quoted from Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 1947, 330 U.S. 501, 508-509, 67 S.Ct. 839, 843, 91 L.Ed. 1055: \u201cAdministrative difficulties follow for courts when litigation is piled up in congested centers instead of being handled at its origin. Jury duty is a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation. In cases which touch the affairs of many persons, there is reason for holding the trial in their view and reach rather than in remote parts of the country where they can learn of it by report only. There is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home. There is an appropriateness, too, in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the state law that must govern the case, rather than having a court in some other forum untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself.\u201d The trial judge stressed the fact that our local dockets are crowded. He undoubtedly took into account that the statute of limitations in Maryland had not yet barred a new action. He certainly knew, as he remarked, that the case could not be transferred to another federal court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and he concluded: \u201cThis is a controversy between two citizens of the Free State of Maryland. We have a congested docket here and there is no reason why this case cannot be resolved in Maryland. * * <em>*\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><em>We </em>cannot say that he abused his discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">But, appellants argue, \u00a7 1404(a) operates to <em>deprive </em>the District Court of power to dismiss when the doctrine of forum non conveniens is invoked. The law is exactly the reverse, for the statute took nothing from the courts. Rather it Conferred a new and additional authority to transfer a proper case where previously the court had no alternative but to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only recently we pointed out an appropriate exercise of the statutory power in Blake v. Capitol Greyhound Lines, 1955, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 222 F.2d 25, a diversity case, founded upon a transitory tort, which could have been prosecuted in at least two other forums. There we said that if the District Court is persuaded that the action should not here be entertained, \u201cat this late date,\u201d the action should not be dismissed but should b\u00e9 transferred to an appropriate district where it might have been brought. Here no other federal forum was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Since the standard for ascertaining a possible abuse of discretion is the same whether the court dismisses on account of forum non conveniens or transfers under \u00a7 1404(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and since we perceive the application of no erroneous principles in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AgNh\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">.
