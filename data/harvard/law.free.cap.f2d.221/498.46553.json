Arizona thereupon brought this suit to declare that its plan met the requirements of the Federal Social Security Act and to direct the Administrator to approve it. Because the District Court thought the Administrator correctly refused to approve the plan, it \u201cput aside jurisdictional questions\u201d and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">The inevitable effect of directing appellee to approve the plan in question would be to require the Secretary of the Treasury to make payments to Arizo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>na out of the federal treasury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, the purpose of this suit is \u201cto reach money which the government owns.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This raises the question of the applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to suit since the United States has not consented to be sued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We had occasion recently in West Coast Exploration Co. v. McKay<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to review applicable case law relating to this question. Under the principles distilled from that review, it is clear that the court would have jurisdiction tc entertain the present action only if the complaint contained substantial charges that (1) the Federal Social Security Act required appellee to approve the Arizona plan, or (2) appellee relied upon an unconstitutional statute in disapproving tie plan; but this jurisdiction would end whenever it appeared that these charges \u201ccould not be maintained\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The naked allegations of the complaint that rejection of the plan was \u201carbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority\u201d are of no effect since \u201cthe statutory limitation\u201d relied upon is not set forth, as required by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a foundation for the prayer of the complaint, there remain the charges that (1) appel-lee erred in ruling the federal Act did not permit and require certification of the Arizona plan, and (2) if the federal Act did not require certification, it was void as being in conflict with certain earlier treaties between the United States and the Arizona Indian tribes and also with the so-called federal Indian law.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">The gravamen of the first allegation is not that appellee\u2019s predecessor exceeded his authority in ruling upon the Arizona plan but that he made an erroneous ruling. Erroneous action taken in the .exercise of an admittedly validly delegated power is \u201cinescapably the action of the United States and the effort to enjoin it must fail as an effort to enjoin the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor does the second allegation \u2014 that of conflict of the Act with earlier treaties and laws \u2014 state a statutory or constitutional basis for avoiding the bar of sovereign immunity. It has long been settled that Congress has the power to repeal earlier treaties or statutes by passage of a later law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>It follows that this suit should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-13\">.
