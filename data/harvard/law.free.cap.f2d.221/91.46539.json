Leighton then petitioned this court to review the Commission\u2019s refusal, contending jurisdiction resides in this court under Section 9(a) of the Securities Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission has moved that we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-28\">Were we to assume that the action of the Commission in declining to entertain petitioner\u2019s complaint, or to investigate the matters pressed by him, constituted an order of the Commission nevertheless it would be one within the discretion of the Commission under Section 20 of the Securities Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, in any event, not such an order as would be reviewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by this court under Section 9(a) of the Act. See Crooker v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1 Cir., 161 F.2d 944, 949. The discretionary character of the Commission\u2019s action likewise removes it from Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which excepts from its provisions for judicial review agency action committed by law to agency discretion. The motion to dismiss accordingly will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-19\">. 48 Stat. 74 et seq., as amended, 15 U.S. O.A. \u00a7 77a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-20\">. 48 Stat. 80, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. <em>\u00a7 771</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-29\">. 60 Stat. 237, 243, as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-31\">. 48 Stat. 86, as amended, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77t.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
