Pursuant to the union\u2019s request, which the employer opposed, the National Mediation Board advised the employer by letter that it had assumed jurisdiction of the dispute under \u00a7 201 cf the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that a mediator would be assigned \u201cto investigate the dispute.\u201d Before the Board took any further action, the employer brought ..this action in the District Court-against the members and secretary of the Board to enjoin further Board action oh the ground that the employer was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under .the provisions of the Railway Labor Act. The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and the employer <em>brought </em>this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">We think the complaint was properly dismissed. Under \u00a7 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon request by a disputing party, the National Mediation Board must investigate a dispute as to employee representation and, within thirty days, certify the names of the designated representatives; thereafter, the employer is required to\u201ctreat with\u201d the representatives thus certified. Here, no more has happened than a communication'by the Board to the employer to the effect that it will make the required investigation. Since the administrative process, far from having been completed, is only just begun, the controversy is for that reason clearly not ripe for judicial review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even when the administrative process provided by the Railway Labor Act has culminated in certification of a union, such certification is not ordinarily subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-16\">No different result is contemplated by \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section expressly excepts from judicial review those cases where \u201cstatutes preclude judicial review\u201d or where \u201cagency action is by law committed to agency discretion.\u201d Under the Railway Labor Act, certification is committed to the discretion of the Board.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">This court\u2019s decision in Airline Dispatchers Ass\u2019n v. National Mediation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Board<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is of no help to appellant. We found judicial relief under the Administrative procedure Act appropriate there because the Board refused to exercise the functions assigned to it by the Railway Labor Act. We made clear, however, that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Switchmen\u2019s Union of North America v. National Mediation Board, the Board\u2019s performance of functions assigned to it by the Act was not subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Appellant urges for the first time in this court that the action taken by the Board in this case gives rise to an imminent threat of criminal prosecution for which judicial intervention is allowed by the decision of the Supreme Court in Shields v. Utah-Idaho Central R. Co.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since this contention was not urged below, we need not consider it here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But it is without merit in any event. Shields involved an Interstate Commerce Commission order, under \u00a7 1, First, of the Railway Labor Act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which finally determined that the complaining railroad \"company was a \u2018carrier\u2019 within the meaning of the [Railway Labor] Act * * By this ruling, the carrier became subject to the criminal penalties of the Act, imposed, <em>inter alia, </em>for failure to post required statutory notices on the handling of labor disputes pursuant to \u00a7 2, Eighth;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> indeed, the Board itself had already ordered the carrier to comply with that provision. No such compliance was ordered in the instant case and no penalties for violation of \u00a7 2, Eighth, are threatened here. The action complained against in the instant case was taken by the Board under \u00a7 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act, which involves no criminal penalties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus the decision in the Shields case, \u201cplaced on the traditional use of equity proceedings to enjoin criminal proceedings\u201d,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 181.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-9\">. 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152, Ninth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-10\">.
