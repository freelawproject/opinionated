Brown Shoe Company, Inc. is a New York corporation. Appellant sued the corporation and the Commissioner of Patents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The court dismissed the complaint. The question is whether the court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">Brown Shoe Co., Inc. is a necessary party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commissioner of Patents is not a necessary party. The TradeMark Act, which permits suits for registration of trade-marks to be brought under the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146, says the Commissioner is not \u201ca necessary party to an inter partes proceeding under section 146 of Title 35\u201d. 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1071.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This suit, which arose out of an opposition proceeding in the Patent Office, is plainly an inter partes proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">The question remains whether the Commissioner is an \u201cadverse\u201d party within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146, which says; \u201cIf there be adverse parties residing in a plurality of districts not embraced within the same state, or an adverse party residing in a foreign country, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction * * If the Commissioner is an adverse party, for this jurisdictional purpose, in this suit, then every suit under \u00a7 146 can be brought in the District of Columbia. We do not so interpret the statute. We think \u00a7 146 permits claims that cannot be enforced elsewhere to be enforced here, and does not create an option of enforcing here claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>that can be enforced elsewhere. In other words, for this jurisdictional purpose only necessary parties can be \u201cadverse\u201d. \u201c \u2018To hold that the plaintiff by making a mere formal party a codefendant can compel the real defendant, the real party in interest, to come from any part of the United States and defend his rights in the District of Columbia would conflict with the general purpose of Congress as appears from the fact that ordinarily suits in the federal courts must be brought in the district in which the defendant resides.\u2019 \u201d Coe v. Hobart Mfg. Co., 70 App.D.C. 2, 3, 102 F.2d 270, 271. Cf. Jax Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v. Coe, 73 App.D.C. 127, 118 F.2d 12, certiorari denied 313 U.S. 561, 61 S.Ct. 837, 85 L.Ed. 1521; Thorne, Neale &amp; Co. v. Coe, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 122, 143 F.2d 155; R. J. Moran Co. v. Seeck &amp; Kade, Inc., D.C., 91 F.Supp. 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-8\">. Also the Secretary of Commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-9\">. On this point we disagree with Gold Seal Co. v, Sawyer, D.C.1952, 106 F.Supp. 494. A registration which no one has opposed may oe denied by the Commissioner, on the ground of confusing similarity, in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding; but a Patent Office proceeding in which there are opposing parties, and a resulting suit, is not an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-19\">. 35 U.S.O. \u00a7 146 says broadly \u201cThe Commissioner shall not be a necessary par-</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
