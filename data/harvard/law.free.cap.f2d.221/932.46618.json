United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127; Friedberg v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 142, 75 S.Ct. 138; Smith v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194; United States v. Calderon, 1954, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">In its order of remand the Supreme Court cited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">\u201cWe have not considered the merits of these cases, nor have we determined their relation to our recent opinions * * * believing that re-examination by the Courts of Appeals is desirable even in those cases remotely involving the principles laid down in the net worth decisions.\u201d 1955, 348 U.S. 905, 906, 75 S.Ct. 311, 312.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">The four Supreme Court decisions forming the basis of the remand contain an analysis of the net worth theory and a thorough discussion of the need for caution in reviewing convictions secured by this method. They also contain rules of limitation which must be observed in the attempt to establish guilt through net worth computations.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">We are of the opinion that the conviction under review is fully sustainable without resort to the net worth theory. This being the case, it would constitute a mere academic exercise to reconsider the net worth features of this appeal in the light of the authoritative guidance furnished by the Supreme Court with respect to net worth prosecu-lions.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">The government produced ten witnesses who testified that the defendant, during the period covered by the indictment, had received from them sums of approximately $14,500.00. The defendant did not dispute receipt of these sums but contended he regarded them as gifts and therefore treated them as non-taxable. The issue of whether these sums were gifts and whether the defendant wilfully evaded income taxes in so treating them were issues that comprised a substantial part of the litigation in the District Court. In 3 Cir., 1954, 214 F.2d 768, 771-772, we considered the nature of these transactions and the bona fides of the defendant\u2019s treatment of them for tax purposes. This appeal presents no new material to alter our former judgment on this score, and consequently there is no need to dwell in detail on the contentions with respect to these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">The District Court charged that the government must \u201cestablish through convincing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> evidence that the expenditures made by the defendant in each year came <em>from taxable income </em>(income subject to taxation).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Since the only proof offered by the government as to the source of the defendant\u2019s allegedly unreported income consisted of the $14,500 receipts previously mentioned, the jury must have considered them in applying the standard formulated by the Court. It is clear that the jury could not, consistent with the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>of the- Court, -have returned a verdict of guilty unless it construed these receipts i:i accordance with the thesis advanced by the government. Thus, while the indictment was framed according to the net worth theory it is clear that the case as presented to the jury pivoted on the issue whether the receipts were nontaxable gifts or payment for services, qua gratuities, tips, etc.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">It is apparent therefore, that the defendant was convicted for wilfully, failing to report approximately $14,500 a3 taxable income. The receipt of these amounts was admitted. .Their taxability was established by overwhelming evidence. Accordingly, the net worth com-putatioas introduced at the trial are without relevance to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">One circumstance remains to be considered. The government in its indictn.ent alleged that approximately $33,00.C of taxable income had not been reported by the defendant. The specific income proof comprised $14,500. The variance is not fatal, for it is settled that it is not necessary to prove evasion of the entire amount alleged in the indictment. It is sufficient to prove that a substantial amount of tax liability has been wilfully evaded. Watts v. United States, 10 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 275; Sasser, v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 535; Tinkoff v. United States, 7 Cir., 1937, 86 F.2d 868, certiorari denied, 1937, 301 U.S. 689, 57 S.Ct. 795, 81 L.Ed. 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">\u2022 For-the-foregoing reasons the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.'</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-12\">. The Supreme Court took similar action with respect to nine other net worth cases, enumerated at 1955, 348 U.S. 904-905, 75 S.Ct. 288, 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-13\">. The use of the word \u201cconvincing\u201d in the portion of the charge quoted did not suggest a standard in opposition to the usual phrase \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, for the latter phrase refers to a degree of persuasion. In both civil and criminal cases the jury must be \u201cconvinced\u201d. The difference lies in the degree of conviction required. Any doubt as to the jury\u2019s understanding of this phase of the charge is dissipated upon examination of the District Court\u2019s thorough instruction as to the nature of the government\u2019s burden which included the following: \u201cIf there remains in your minds a reasonable doubt as to whether the government has established <em>any one element </em>which is a necessary or an essential part of the offense you must acquit the defendant. . . . The proof must be of such weight as to persuade your reasoning judgment beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b984-7\">.. The defendant contended he had been adviced by the local Internal Revenue Office.in \u201c1940-1943 or 1944\u201d that these . receipts., were not taxable. With respect .to, ihis contention the Court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFYY\">\u201cIf you conclude his failure to. report these items .was due to an honest, even thor gh mistaken opinion that these items were not subject to tax, then you must eliminate them from your consideration. * <em>a </em>. * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
