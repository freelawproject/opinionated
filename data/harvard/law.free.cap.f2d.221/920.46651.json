Appel-lee\u2019s foreman deposed that the hatch or opening in the top of the tank had been firmly closed and that it required considerable force and effort to open it against a strong spring. All of these facts were placed before the court in the form of affidavits which also showed that the owner of the land on which the tanks were placed made no objection to the presence of hunters or others who frequented the area; that the deceased had previously climbed the tank in the daytime and that this was known to appel-lee\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-22\">This action was brought under the applicable Alabama statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>of course,- conceded that the law to be applied is the Alabama law. Under the Alabama cases it is clear that the \u201cat-, tractive nuisance\u201d doctrine does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, i.pon consideration -of the affidavits submitted by the parties it was clear that no genuine issue of fact was' presented, the trial court properly granted the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The office of the motion for summary judgment is concisely stated by Judge Holmes, of this Court, in Creel v. Lone Star Defense Corporation, 171 F.2d 964, where at page 969 he said: \u201cThe intention of this rule is to put an' end to useless and expensive litigation if there is, no genuir.e issue - as to any material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Appellant seeks to make- a jury issue as to negligence and as to the degree of' care required of appellee under the circumstances. He relies strongly on the fact that the lands on'which the tanks were buffi; belonged to others who permitted deceased ;and others to roam at will over them and to hunt arid- fish on; them. He seeks to draw from this, and-the fact that there was open access to the tanks and no one had prohibited climbing the stairs previously, the conclusion that Obie Was air invitee or licensee, but also-contends' that even if he were a mere trespasser there was a duty on the Carter Oil Company, not wantonly to injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The weakness of this argument is that there is no fact or circumstance which would permit a jury to infer that the act of Obie in climbing up the side of this tank at night and forcibly opening the hatch and peering into with an open light in his hand, was anything more or less than the act of a trespasser. There is no contention by appellant that any servant of defendant ever knew of or authorized such an act. Obviously, therefore, there could be no implied invitation and there could be no license under any authority cited to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">If, then, the boy was a trespasser-at the time of his death, what is the standard of care that is required of the owner of the tank? This is not in dis-, pute between the parties. The standard of care is set out in numerous cases cited by appellant. -In all of them -.the Alabama Supreme Court has held that before a person can be held liable for wanton disregard of the safety of a trespasser, he must know of the peril and at least of the probability -that someone is likely to suffer injury from it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Here, the proof was undisputed that the defendant had its tank properly and firmly closed. There was no proof that it knew that anyone had ever forcibly opened the hatch,' much less that anyone had opened it, or conceivably would open it, with a lighted lamp in his hand. There then could be no basis for an inference to be drawn by a jury that, knowing of the peril, the Carter Oil Company had wantonly or callously failed to act for the protection of a person who placed himself in such peril so unexpectedly and suddenly that no one could have anticipated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-14\">.
