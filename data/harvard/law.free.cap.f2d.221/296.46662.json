On September 30, 1954, the trial court made its findings of fact and conclusions of law and caused its judgment to be filed on the 8th day of October, 1954; and within 10 days thereafter appellees\u2019 attorney filed their \u201cNotice of Motion to Amend Findings and Judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion was submitted for decision on October 25, 1954, and was ruled upon December 1, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">On November 29, 1954, the 60th day after entry of judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> **but before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>court had ruled on the motion, the United States filed its \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d, called by the United States its \u201cprotective appeal\u201d, from the adverse portions of the judgment of September 30, 1954. Thereafter, appellees filed in this court notice of their motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was premature since it was filed pri- or to a ruling on the motion to amend. On December 14, 1954, after the court had ruled on the motion, the United States filed its second \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d, this appeal being from certain parts of the judgment inclusive of paragraph V<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the judgment, and paragraph (b) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On December 28, 1954, appellees filed in this court their notice of motion to dismiss the appeal from paragraph V of the judgment and from paragraph (b) of the order on the ground that neither are appealable inasmuch as they are not final decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides that time for appeal does not run while a motion is pending for amendment of the judgment or to make additional findings. It is apparent from the foregoing facts that the attempted appeal (protective appeal), filed before the court had ruled upon the motion to amend the findings of fact and judgment, was abortive and the motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">The motion to dismiss the appeal which was noticed December 14, as to paragraph V of the judgment and paragraph (b) of the order, is also granted. Paragraph V and paragraph (b) are not final and therefore not appealable. They merely reserve power in the court to entertain motions of the attorneys of the appellee Indians for allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees and for the bringing in of other Indians under the litigation. Nothing is decided on either count. The appellants may oppose any attempt to have the court act under the reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">By statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> United States Courts of Appeals will, in most instances,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> refuse to entertain an appeal from any non-definitive judgment.

The court below acted in the reasonable exercise of its equitable discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-16\">We direct the clerk to prepare an order dismissing appellants\u2019 \u201cprotective appeal\u201d, notice of which was filed November 29, 1954, and appellants\u2019 appeal, notice of which was filed December 14, 1954, from paragraph V of the judgment and paragraph (b) of the order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-10\">.
