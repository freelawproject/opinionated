Streamlite, in order to build the trailers, borrowed $11,000 from the bank, and as security for that loan entered into a trust receipt arrangement under the Illinois Uniform Trust Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ceipts aci <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and assigned to the bank its rights to any money due under the purchase order. The government accepted delivery of the trailers and refer-red the matter to its General Accounting Office. Thereafter' the government refused io pay plaintiff, stating that Streamlite was indebted to it in excess of $17,000 for past due taxes (not arising out of this contract). Plaintiff had no notice of this tax indebtedness when' it advanced money to Streamlite. To give the district court jurisdiction of the subject matter of this suit, plaintiff reduced its claim to $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The district court, in entering judgment for the government, did so on the. theory that the government had a right to set off the past due. taxes against the purchase price of the trailers, as against the bank. Whether this right of set-off exists under the circumstances is the contested issue here. -</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">' [1] 23 U.S.C.A. '\u00a7'1346(c), .under which this suit is brought, expressly recognizes\u2019that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-7\">\u201cThe ' jurisdiction conferred by this section includes jurisdiction of any <em>set-off, </em>.counterclaim, or. other claim or demand whatever on the' part of the United States against any plaintiff commencing-an action under this section.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">This is statutory recognition that the government has. a right to present a set-off against a plaintiff commencing an action under this section.- ' The statute does not limit such set-off to the subject matter of the claim sued on.' Under a prior statuteI. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which required a United States \u2022 district attorney to file in suits against the government, \u201ca notice of any counter-claim, set-off, claim for damages, or other demand or defense whatsoever of the Government in the premises\u201d (which language insofar as it differs from the present statute,, is somewhat limited as to the scope of a set-off); we held in United States v. Harris, 7 Cir., 77 F. 821, at pag\u00e9 825, that a right of set-off by the government is not affected by an assignment of the claim to the one who sues the government upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">We conclude that the district court properly allowed the government\u2019s set-off against the bank\u2019s claim and hence, it is unnecessary for us to consider the questions raised by the government as to the assignability of Stream-lite\u2019s claim in view of the provisions of 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203 and 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15. We consider that the manner in which the bank\u2019s interest in the purchase price of the trailers was created is of no significance.. Under applicable federal law, the bank had no greater rights to. the purchase money than Streamlite would, have had. If the result, as it affects the bank, appears harsh, it should be remembered that it knew that it was dealing with the holder of a government contract. It was bound to ascertain the applicable federal law. If it had done so, it would have. known before it advanced its money to Streamlite that possible unpaid taxes-of the latter could be set off by the governm\u00e9nt against the bank\u2019s claim to the proceeds of the sale of the trailers-by Streamlite to the government. While Congress has provided<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that \u201cAny contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Atomic Energy Commission, or ,any other department or agency of the United States designated by the President, - * * * may <em>* </em>* *. provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract shall not be subject to reduction or set-off, * * *\u201d .and be given effect accordingly, no showing has been made that this provision has, by designation of the President, been made applicable to the Public Housing Administration. Moreover, it appears that any intention to apply that provision to the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>contract was expressly negatived by apt language inserted therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">The judgment from which an appeal has been taken is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">FINNEGAN, Circuit Judge. I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\">. Ill.Rev.Stat, c. 121%, \u00a7\u00a7 166-187 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-13\">.
