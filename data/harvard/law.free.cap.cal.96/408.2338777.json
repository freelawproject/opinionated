During the winter of 1861-62 the river suddenly changed its course, forming a new channel, and the water ceased to flow in the old channel. Each succeeding freshet' brought down sediment, which filled up somewhat the original channel, forming the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">One John L. Pixley made application to purchase these lands from the state as swamp and overflowed lands, June 14, 1886, upon which application a patent was issued October 17,1888. Under this patent plaintiff claims title.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The land in controversy, then, was the bed of a navigable stream until 1861. It was not acquired from the United States as swamp and overflowed land under the act of September 28, 1850. Many sections of the Political Code show plainly that no other lands are included under the designation \u201c swamp and overflowed \u201d in the statutes authorizing the sale of state lands. This land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>was not swamp and overflowed land within the meaning of those laws. Nor is there any other statute authorizing the sale of land of this character by the state officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It is said, however, that, admitting that the patent was issued in a case not authorized, still it is <em>prima, facie </em>valid, and raises a presumption that the land had been properly segregated and listed to the state as swamp and overflowed land, and that all necessary steps had been taken to authorize the issuance of the patent. <em>(Easton </em>v. <em>O\u2019Reilly, </em>63 Cal. 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">It is further claimed that the defendant cannot attack the patent, unless he connects himself in some way with the original source of title. This last proposition unquestionably finds some support among the earlier decisions of this court, \u2014 particularly in <em>Doll </em>v. <em>Meador, </em>16 Cal. 295, in which the proposition is broadly asserted. On this point, however, that case has not been followed in the later cases. In <em>Cucamonga Fruit Land Co. </em>v. <em>Moir, </em>83 Cal. 101, the plaintiff claimed under a patent from the United States, and also a certificate of purchase from the state. The defendant had made application to purchase from the state, but it was contended that his application was void, because the land at the time was held adversely by another. This point was not deemed material, as the court found that plaintiff\u2019s patent and certificate were both issued without authority of law, and concluded as follows: \u201cEach document was issued without authority of law, and is void against defendant, conceding that he showed no title except naked possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Some members of the court doubted whether it was a proper case in which to apply this principle, but so far as it holds that a patent may always be shown to be void by evidence that it was issued in a case not authorized by law, it is in exact accord with the cases in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In <em>St. Louis Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>104 U. S. 636, the true rule is declared in an' opinion written by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Field. He says: \u201cOn the other hand, a patent may be collaterally impeached in any action, and its operation as a conveyance defeated, by showing that the department had no jurisdiction to dispose of the lands; that is, that the law did not provide for selling them, or that they had been reserved from sale or dedicated to special purposes, or had been previously transferred to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">And in <em>Steel </em>v. <em>St. Louis Smelting Co., </em>106 U. S. 447, after declaring the conclusiveness of the patent as to all matters which the department officers were required to pass upon, the same judge says: \u201cIt need hardly be said that we are here speaking of a patent issued in a case where the land department had jurisdiction to act, the lands forming part of the public domain, and the law having provided for their sale. If they never were the property of the United States, or if no legislation authorized their sale, or if they had been previously disposed of or reserved from sale, the patent would be inoperative to pass the title, and objection to it could be taken on these grounds at any time and in any form of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Many other cases in the supreme court of the United States are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">I think, therefore, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Haynes, C., and Vancliee, 0., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">McFarland, J., Garoutte, J., Harrison, J., Sharp-stein, J., De Haven, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
