The plaintiff claimed to have succeeded by mesne convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>anees to the right of possession.of Jacob 0. Beideman, who was in possession of the lot sued for prior to his death, which occurred in 1867. Plaintiff deraigned title under a deed from J. W. Brumagin, as the administrator of Beideman\u2019s estate, who testified that the lot in controversy was included in a tract of land fenced in without any cross-fence when he took possession of it as administrator of Beideman, and that he employed the same men who were employed by Beideman to keep up the fences, and that as administrator of Beideman he had paid taxes on the land, and that no other person was in actual possession of any part of the land at that time. Brumagin gave an administrator\u2019s deed of the land, March 13, 1868, to Frederick Hess, who conveyed it to Robert Mulilendorf March 31, 1868, and Muhlendorf\u2019s executor conveyed it to the plaintiff August 12, 1874, who paid the taxes on the lot in controversy. The petition of Muhlendorf\u2019s executor for an order of sale, dated September 19, 1873, was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and stated that one half of the lot, on the southeast corner of Turk Street and Van Ness Avenue, was in the adverse possession of one Reay, who claimed title to said portion, and that the lot in that condition was appraised at five thousand dollars. Plaintiff proved an order of sale of the lot and an executor\u2019s deed under said petition. On behalf of the defendant, Daniel Rogers, using the inventory and appraisement of the estate of Robert Muhlendorf, deceased, as a memoranda, testified that he was one of the appraisers, and that the inventory and appraisement was in his handwriting, and that the lot at the southeast corner of Turk Street and Van Ness Avenue was \u201c valued eight thousand dollars with a good title, but in its present condition valued at five thousand dollars.\u201d The inventory and appraisement were then offered in evidence and excluded. The defendant\u2019s counsel offered to prove by the witness Rogers that when the matter was fresh in his mind he made a memorandum as to the possession of the property in 1873 and placed in his hand the same inventory and appraisement, and the court ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>eluded the evidence. The court instructed the jury that in order that the possession of the defendant should be adverse for five years prior to the commencement of the suit August 3, 1877, it was not necessary that the defendant, or those under whom he claims, should have paid any taxes on the land, and that on the question of title or prior possession of real estate the payment of taxes is not material. The defendant asked the court to instruct the jury to disregard all testimony upon the subject of taxes, which instruction was refused. Further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-5\"><em>J. M. Seawell, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-6\">The trial court erred in allowing the plaintiff to prove the payment of taxes. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Perley, </em>30 Cal. 635; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Baugh, </em>59 Cal. 579; <em>Tillotson v.

We are satisfied with the views therein expressed and the conclusion reached; but in support of the ruling of the court below in excluding the inventory offered in evidence by the defendant, we cite the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ing cases: <em>Leighton </em>v. <em>Wike, </em>4 Serg. &amp; R. 204; <em>Aelclen\u2019s Executor </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>63 Ala. 494. The rule in New York has been changed <em>(Guy </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>22 N. Y. 466); but our code seems to indorse the rule followed in Pennsylvania and Alabama, and which formerly prevailed in New York. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2047.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b481-6\">De Haven, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3n\">\u2014 I dissent from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Mr. Justice Harrison, being disqualified, did not participate in the foregoing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The following is the opinion above referred to, rendered in Department One on the 6th of February, 1892:\u2014</p>\n<author id=\"b481-9\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AYoU\">This is an action of ejectment to recover a lot of land situate on the southeast corner of Van Ness Avenue and Turk Street, in the city and county of San Francisco. The answer denies plaintiff\u2019s alleged ownership and right of possession of a certain portion of the lot described in the complaint, and sets up the statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., secs. 318, 319.) There was a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and a judgment was entered thereon, from which the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The basis of plaintiff\u2019s title is the prior possession of himself and his grantors. It is claimed by appellant that the evidence is insufficient to show that either the plaintiff or any of his grantors ever had the actual possession of the land. We have carefully examined the evidence in the record, and think there is sufficient evidence to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">We do not think the court erred in excluding the inventory, or in rejecting the proffered testimony of the witness Bogers. The inventory was admissible in evidence only as memoranda to refresh the memory of the witness. It was not competent evidence to prove the facts stated in the inventory itself. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>not injured by the rejection of the testimony, because the witness had already been permitted to testify to all be could have testified to, using the inventory as a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Exceptions were taken to some of the instructions of the court to the jury; but we think, taken as a whole, they are fair and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">It is claimed that the court erred in charging that the plaintiff had made out a record title. It is true that the court did say that \u201cthe plaintiff has made out a record title to the land in controversy \u201d; but later on, when attention was called by an exception to that portion of the charge, the court said: \u201cI do not remember my exact words. I say I have decided here, as the deeds were offered in evidence, that the record title was complete from Mr. Beideman\u2019s time down to the plaintiff in this case. Whatever title Beideman had at the time of his death, the records show that the plaintiff has acquired whatever title Mr. Beideman had.\u201d This latter statement was strictly correct, and must have been understood by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">We do not think the court erred in permitting the plaintiff to prove payment of taxes by Brum agin. The evidence was admissible to show the nature and character of the claim, and that it had not been abandoned. The instructions of the court on the subject of taxes were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Mr. Justice Harrison, being disqualified, did not participate in the foregoing opinion, and Mr. Justice McFarland acted in his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
