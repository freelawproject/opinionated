The taxes paid covered the period from 1988 through part of 1999. Plaintiffs claim was made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-54, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">Where one person has <em>by mistake paid the tax on the property of another supposing it to be his own, </em>the governing body after a hearing, on five days\u2019 notice to the owner, may return the money paid in error without interest and restore the record of the assessment and tax against the property in the name of the true owner, provided the lien of the tax has not expired and no transfer or encumbrance has been put on record against the property since the date of the payment in error,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_o\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">Plaintiffs claim was originally part of a suit commenced in the Law Division that sought a declaration that the subject property was owned by the City. Following the resolution of the ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>issue, that part of the suit seeking the tax refund was transferred to the Tax Court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In the Tax Court, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. After citing various documents \u201cand other aspects of the parties\u2019 submissions,\u201d the judge found that a plenary hearing was required to determine, factually, whether plaintiff and its predecessor in title paid the taxes by mistake pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. 54:4-54.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After the plenary hearing, the Tax Court judge found that none of the taxes and interest paid by plaintiff and its predecessor in title were made by mistake pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:4-54. <em>JC Trapper, L.L.C. v. City of Jersey City, </em>19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>421, 432 (2001). That finding is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 658, 731 A.2d 35 (1999); <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., 44 N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Plaintiff now contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">JUDGE KUSKIN INCORRECTLY RULED THAT THE TAX PAYMENTS MADE BY PLAINTIFF WERE NOT MADE BY MISTAKE AS CONTEMPLATED BY <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">A. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-54 Permits Recovery of Taxes Mistakenly Paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">B.
