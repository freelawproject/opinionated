The subject property consists of a large manor house on land that totals 8.5496 acres. The land, in addition to the mansion, has gardens, trees, lawns, a swimming pool, pool house, steps, sidewalks and driveways.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">It appears undisputed that the owner conducts an agricultural enterprise at the premises which has several employees. She derives gross income from that enterprise exceeding $100,000 per year. The agricultural products of this enterprise include flowers, pine cones, evergreens, decorative holiday wreaths, grave covers, shrubs and trees. As indicated, the primary question at trial was whether the agricultural activities \u201crequire and make use of five acres or more of the property.\u201d After considering the evidence, Judge Small determined that the subject property contained 7.1 acres that qualified for farmland assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Having carefully reviewed the record in light of the applicable law and the parties\u2019 contentions, we are in substantial agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>with the reasons for decision set forth in the written opinion of Judge Small reported at 19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>334 (2001). Accordingly, we affirm essentially for the reasons expressed by Judge Small in that reported decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
